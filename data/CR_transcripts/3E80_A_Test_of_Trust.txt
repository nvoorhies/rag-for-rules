MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (garbled) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: Before we jump into tonight's episode, we do have some quick announcements to get to, beginning with our first sponsor of the night, (resigned sigh) NordVPN. Sam? 
LAURA: Woo! 
TRAVIS: (whispering) NordVPN. 
SAM: The holidays means online shopping, and while the Crit Role store is quite secure, if you visit new or unfamiliar websites, you might not feel safe entering your credit card number, which is why you need to be safer online with a single click and get NordVPN. Trust me. But can you trust me? I do a lot of ads. What if I'm just saying NordVPN is awesome because they're sponsoring us? Well, I've invited Dr. Uta Middlebrecht from the Los Angeles Polygraph Institute-- 
MARISHA: (laughing) Middlebrecht. 
SAM: -- to administer a lie detector test on me to prove, that's this machine right here, to prove that when I say NordVPN is the fastest VPN on the planet, it's the truth. Dr. Middlebrecht, take it away. 
ASHLEY M.: (German accent) Through a series of diodes and receptors attached to Mr. Riegel's pulse, the polygraph machine will tell if he is telling the truth-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY J.: (laughs) 
ASHLEY M.: -- or telling a lie! 
ASHLEY J.: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY M.: Let's calibrate the machine. Mr. Riegel, what is your name? 
SAM: Oh, my name is Sam Riegel.
ASHLEY M.: True. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY M.: Now, tell me an obvious lie. 
TRAVIS: They're actually moving! 
ASHLEY M.: How often do you shower per week? 
SAM: I shower every single day. 
ASHLEY M.: Lie. 
LIAM: See? (laughter) 
SAM: It's actually every other day. 
ASHLEY M.: Oh, lie! 
SAM: Oh. Every third-- 
ASHLEY M.: Lie! 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
SAM: It seems calibrated. So maybe we should just get to the stuff about NordVPN. 
ASHLEY M.: Very well. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY M.: Is NordVPN a good product? 
SAM: With 24/7 customer support, a 30-day money back guarantee, dedicated apps for all major platforms, and protection for up to six devices all on one account, your traffic is always protected with NordVPN. 
ASHLEY M.: True. 
SAM: Ah! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY M.: Do you personally use NordVPN? 
SAM: I really do! 
ASHLEY M.: True! 
SAM: Hey! Well, that about wraps it up. I think this has been one of my best ads ever. 
ASHLEY M.: Lie! (laughter) 
SAM: Top 10-- 
ASHLEY M.: Lie! 
SAM: Look, I put a lot of time into this whole bit. 
ASHLEY M.: Lie! 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
SAM: We should wrap it up. My wife wants me home early. 
ASHLEY M.: Lie. (laughter) 
SAM: Okay, fine. My kids really want to see me. 
ASHLEY M.: Oh, lie! (laughter) 
SAM: My dog, Rigatoni, will be hungry-- 
ASHLEY M.: Liar! 
SAM: Okay, fine! I need to get home so I can watch some lady build a mineshaft under her house on TikTok while I sit on the toilet blasting out the Indian food I stole from the company fridge! 
ASHLEY M.: True. (laughter) 
SAM: Right now, exclusive for Critical Role viewers, grab the NordVPN deal at nordvpn.com/criticalrole and get four extra months. Try it risk free with a 30-day money back guarantee. 
ASHLEY M.: True! 
SAM: Oh. Now, Matt, please rescue me. I am not used to being yelled at by doctors. 
ASHLEY M.: Liar! (laughter) 
SAM: Oh, it's blinking! (laughter) 
SAM: She's right, I'm used to it. Back to you, Matt. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay! (cheering) (applause) Well done. 
MARISHA: Uta Middlebrecht. 
MATT: Well done. 
LIAM: Wunderbar!

Part I[]
MATT: Welcome back. So last we left off: Bells Hells, as they were finishing preparations to head on their recon mission to the red Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus, had a bit of a fractured social moment that sent them to the four corners of Whitestone to figure out how best they can repair broken trust or concerns about each other's motivations or whatever dark passengers they carry from their past. As part of this conversation, Fearne wanted to recenter herself by visiting her Nana Morri and was decided amongst the troop that perhaps a visit to the Fey Realm to try and reconnect before heading into a very dangerous unknown was a good idea. Upon asking Allura's help, she transported you all and escorted you to the Ligament Manor. After a brief conversation, FCG and Nana Morri got excited about the prospect of a team building exercise amongst you all. After a conversation, she wiped your memory of it-- 
SAM: Ah! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: -- and sent you on the first of three. The first one was an honesty based expedition in which you all were in a ravine and had to reveal truths about yourselves and about your experiences in the world, which allowed you to escape from this dangerous chasm. Completing that, you were sent to a test of communication, in which three volunteers had their sight robbed of them and were sent to walk without vision across very narrow and ever winding land bridges-- 
LAURA: So much fun. 
MATT: -- with the possibility of falling into oblivion, which Orym did. 
SAM: And is dead. 
MATT: No, you survived. 
LIAM: We learned that Imogen is a horse whisper. 
MATT: Yeah. No, Ashton, unfortunately, was knocked off the edge by-- 
LAURA: So close. 
MATT: -- wasps. 
TALIESIN: Bees. No. 
MATT: It was Orym that-- 
MARISHA: (laughing) Bees. 
MATT: -- that volunteered for the final round with real stakes this time as the bridge collapsed behind him. But you all succeeded at this second venture. With the second success behind you, you were brought to the third and final part of your team building therapy session. You were transported by Nana Morri to the middle of a massive Fey ruin, overgrown with vines and thorny brambles, faintly glowing remnants of whatever fey society fell here long ago, and you were introduced to two new creatures you hadn't seen before. These doppelganger-like fey creatures that apparently can not just take your form, but have been paying attention to your personalities, memories, and diving into your minds and thoughts since these whole number of therapy sessions began. Here as they step out, Nana Morri, still standing with you amongst the central pool-- I'm going to outline once again what this was at the end of the last episode. (Morri 1) "Hidden out amongst these ruins lie three sections of ivory branch, blanched pieces of a white tree among small altar basins. You must seek them out however you wish. But two of you will be replaced by my doppelganger friends. In this space, where illusions reign supreme, they can mimic the capabilities that you hold within yourselves, your own minds, feeling the pain psychically and converting it to believe it true. So only through care, watchful eyes, and trust in those you feel you can will you succeed to bring these three branches back. If even one is destroyed before it's returned, you fail." 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Damn it. 
MATT: "Be warned, there are denizens of these ruins as well." 
SAM: Oh jesus. 
MARISHA: Denizens? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh wow. 
TRAVIS: Put the stick in your butt. 
TALIESIN: I love a denizen. (laughter) 
MATT: The mists that crawl across the floor of this ruin suddenly swell until all of you are surrounded by a thick gray fog obscuring your vision. For each of you, you try and reach out-- 
MARISHA: Oh, wait, Nana Morri-- 
MATT: You all-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: The fog fills you. What do you say? 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: This seems counterproductive if we shouldn't trust two people. 
MATT: "Learn who to trust. That's what's important." As the fog fills your periphery-- Let's figure out who they are. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
MATT: So we have-- (clamoring excitedly) 
TRAVIS: What are we doing? What are we doing? 
MATT: We have five cards that say you are yourself and two cards that say you're a doppelganger. 
LIAM: Like that game. 
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! 
MATT: So we just need to shuffle these together. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay wait. Five cards-- 
MATT: Shuffle them up. 
MARISHA: I feel like I have this problem where I'm in nervous laughter. 
LAURA: So only one of us-- 
TRAVIS: You got to poop now? Now you got to poop? 
LAURA: There's seven of us. 
MARISHA: I'm a nervous laugher so-- 
ASHLEY: It makes you look guilty? 
MARISHA: It makes me look guilty. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MARISHA: No matter what. 
ASHLEY: No matter what. 
MARISHA: I'm going to look like a liar no matter what! 
TRAVIS: I'm calling it right now. I definitely know a doppelganger is going to be Sam. 
SAM: What? How do you know that? It's random! 
TRAVIS: 100% 
LAURA: I know. I know. 
TRAVIS: I just know. Sometimes you get a peek into the future. 
MATT: Here. 
SAM: Keep them down, Matt. 
MATT: I'm keeping them down. 
SAM: Because we can sort of see under them. 
MATT: I'll shuffle a little further. All righty. 
LIAM: We all know you're guilty of something. (laughter) 
MATT: Who wants to cut this for me? 
MARISHA: Maybe that's what it is. 
ASHLEY: I'll cut it. 
MARISHA: I'm always paying for my past sins. 
MATT: You'll cut it? All right. 
TRAVIS: Future Fatestitcher. 
LIAM: (mouth fart) 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: You farted on the internet! (laughter) 
MATT: We'll start-- We'll start over here. 
TRAVIS: (mouth fart) (mouth fart) 
MATT: Now, don't look at it yet. 
TRAVIS: Don't look at it, Taliesin! (laughter) 
MATT: Don't look at it. 
LIAM: I won't look at it, but I will touch it and hold it. 
MATT: There you go. 
LAURA: Don't let me see! Don't let me see! 
LIAM: That's yours. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: I don't know! I don't know! 
SAM: I'm scared, I'm scared. 
MATT: Don't look at it. 
MARISHA: Why would I know? 
TRAVIS: Already giving it away. 
MARISHA: Already! 
MATT: Then-- There you go. Now, everyone hold it. Quietly. 
LIAM: Quietly. 
MATT: Now, when we look at it-- Don't look at it yet! Ashley, don't look at it! 
TRAVIS: Don't look at it! 
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Sorry! 
MATT: It's okay. When you look at it, it'll tell you if you're yourself-- 
TRAVIS: Look at her. She already knows. 
MATT: -- and it'll give you an overview of your goals for this. If it says you're a doppelganger, it'll give you your separate goals as well as point out one or two traps that exist on this that can be used at your disposal. 
LAURA: So everybody stare at their card for a long time so nobody knows who's a doppelganger. 
TRAVIS: Do what you're going to do! 
MATT: There's equal amounts of writing on both. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: To make sure that you're all reading at the same pace. 
LIAM: It's so easy for me to read Laura's cards and I will. So do we want to have everyone cover their eyes while-- 
LAURA: Should we scooch back or something? 
LIAM: One at a time? 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: What? 
LIAM: Yes! 
TRAVIS: You ever play poker before? Guard your shit. 
LAURA: No, I know, but we're just so close to each other. 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Read your stuff and watch everybody-- 
LIAM: You don't sit elbow-- 
TRAVIS: -- at the same time. 
LIAM: -- to elbow with fellow poker players. 
TALIESIN: Everybody close your eyes. 
MATT: Then-- 
LAURA: Wait, close our eyes? 
MATT: Everyone look that way. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All right and-- 
MARISHA: Wait, what? 
MATT: Yes, yeah. Taliesin, look at your card. 
MARISHA: Oh, I see. 
LIAM: Don't look at Taliesin, Marisha! 
MARISHA: Wait, we're not supposed to look at Taliesin? 
SAM: You're looking the wrong way! 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: Look that way! 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: But I could-- why? 
TRAVIS: So fucking-- 
LIAM: Okay. Taliesin looks that way, you guys keep looking that way. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: Laura, don't use the one on the back of your head. 
MARISHA: We're overthinking this, I think. 
MATT: All right, it tells you who you are, tells you your objectives and then it tells, for the doppelgangers, it tells you a couple keywords-- 
TRAVIS: I can hear your heart rate-- 
MATT: -- that'll help you with the battlefield. 
TRAVIS: -- increasing, O'Brien. 
MATT: All right, so Liam, you got yours? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: All right, now you look away from Laura. 
LAURA: Nobody can look at me. 
ASHLEY: That took you a long time to read that, Liam. 
LAURA: You look away from me, hubby. 
MATT: I don't know whose these are, too. So I'm interested in reading as well. 
SAM: I want to peek. (laughter) 
LAURA and MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I know! 
MATT: Now, everyone look away from Ashley. Ashley, read your card. 
ASHLEY: Look away. Look away! 
LIAM: We're never allowed to look at Ashley. (laughter) 
SAM: Riveting television. 
LIAM: I think it's pretty good. 
TALIESIN: This is fucking great. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Okay, now, everyone look away from Sam. 
SAM: Look away! 
MARISHA: Ashley said "okay" three times. She did three nervous okays. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's not Ashley. 
LIAM: ♪ ("The Good, the Bad and the Ugly") ♪ 
MARISHA: It's Sam, isn't it? It is Sam! 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I didn't even look! 
MATT: Everyone look away from Marisha. 
MARISHA: Look away from me! 
SAM: Oh, sorry. I was thinking. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: About doppelganger stuff? 
SAM: Yes, about doppelganger stuff. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay, now everyone look away from Travis. 
ASHLEY: You already know? 
SAM: So fast, Marisha! 
LAURA: How do you already know? 
ASHLEY: I feel like I already know. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, all right. Now, I will present-- 
MARISHA: This is full confirmation bias. 
SAM: Oh, oh, wait. This combat is brought to you by WizKids Minis. Darrington Brigade is available for pre-order. Head-- Heed the call to adventure-- 
LIAM: Head the call. 
SAM: -- alongside heroes of Exandria and the Darrington Brigade. 
TRAVIS: Look at your face. 
LAURA: Head the call! 
MATT: As the mist subsides-- 
SAM: Pre-order this unforgettable set today at wizkids.io/darringtonbrigade! Okay. 
MATT: You all find yourselves-- 
MARISHA: What? (laughs) 
MATT: -- standing around-- 
ASHLEY: What a cool map. 
TRAVIS: Your nose flares. 
MATT: The central ruin. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: I'm scared. I'm really scared. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: So we got to-- 
TRAVIS: You're awful quiet, Laura. 
TALIESIN: We got to toss those branches-- 
SAM: Yeah, you are. 
TALIESIN: -- into the pool? Is that the-- 
MATT: You have to bring them back to the pool and lay them in there. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: Oh no, they're looking at me. 
SAM: Oh, that was another weird smile! They're all weird. 
ASHLEY: I feel like Liam's being awfully quiet. 
LAURA: Everybody knows! 
LAURA: It's Liam. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: It's me, yeah. 
SAM: Liam is pretty quiet. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he is. 
SAM: Taliesin is also-- 
TALIESIN: I'm always quiet. 
SAM: -- remarkably quiet. 
TRAVIS: Oh, Taliesin! 
MARISHA: Is it that they're being quiet or we're just talking a lot? (laughter) We're just rambling. 
SAM: Are we stoned right now? 
MARISHA: I think we're stoned, man. (laughter) 
SAM: They know! (laughter) 
MATT: As the mists-- 
LIAM: See? Guilty! 
MATT: As the mists pull away, you see all have now been translocated around, equally, around this central pool. 
SAM: Translocated. 
MATT: The ruins around you, the doppelgangers and Nana Morri no longer in sight. 
LAURA: (groans) 
MATT: You know that two among you are not who you appear to be. 
TRAVIS: (mouth farts) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Somewhere in this are three branches. Now, you get to decide the best way to find and retrieve them and bring them back to place them, by hand, into this pool. 
MARISHA: They're on this map, though? 
MATT: They're on this map. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: But you need to look for them. They're not visually there right now. 
MARISHA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: You have to search for them and if you succeed in investigating, perceiving, or uncovering where they might be, then I will place them on the map and you will have it at your disposal. 
LAURA: We can use all of our powers and everything to do so? 
MATT: Yes, yes. In this place of illusion, the doppelgangers can still create the image of them using the capabilities of their friends, and psychically, you respond to it by believing that it's true. 
SAM: We're in a fever dream. 
MARISHA: Wait, the doppelgangers can make us believe a branch is not a branch? 
MATT: No, they-- 
MARISHA: Or that not a branch is a branch? 
LIAM: They can believably do Form of Dread. 
TRAVIS: Don't try to throw us off the trail, you fucking doppelganger. (laughter) 
MATT: They can-- (laughs) They can make you believe that they're casting the spells-- 
MARISHA: I'm just trying to understand the rules. 
MATT: -- that your friend can. Or they can make you believe that they're healing someone and you will respond to it in this illusory space as if it was true. 
TRAVIS: Got it, got it. 
MATT: So you have all of your abilities at your disposal-- 
TRAVIS: It's the Matrix. 
MATT: -- whether you're yourself or you're a doppelganger. So, trying to trick each other into not using your abilities isn't how you suss this out. This is going to be about communication. This is going to be about asking questions. This is going to be about watching what they do-- 
TRAVIS: Battle royale. 
MATT: -- and trying to throw off the scent if you are the doppelganger. 
MARISHA: Hunger Games. 
MATT: However you feel like. However, because of that scenario, because you are actively working together and against you at the same time, we will be acting in a loose initiative order. I would like everyone to roll initiative. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
LAURA: Oh, oh jeez. 
MARISHA: What does a loose initiative order mean? 
LIAM: Can we get pizza rolls and Cap'n Crunch-- 
MATT: Meaning, it's not a six-second hardcore battle. 
LIAM: -- flown in (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, that was-- 
MATT: Everyone's taking turns as they go around. 
MARISHA: -- fucking bullshit. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: You can decide to work together as a group-- 
TRAVIS: Awesome. 
MATT: -- as small groups, as individuals, it's up to you. But do we have 25 to 20? 
LIAM: Natural 20 for 25. 
ALL: Whoa. 
MATT: Orym, up top. 
SAM: Orym never rolls that high. (laughter) 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MATT: 18, we got Fearne. 
LAURA: Ashley never rolls that high. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: That is actually true. 
ASHLEY and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Well. 
MATT: 15 to 10. 
ASHLEY: Throwing you off the scent. 
LAURA: 11. 
TALIESIN: 13. 
MATT: All right, Ashton. 
MARISHA: Wait, I missed all of that. 
TRAVIS: Ash, Imogen. 
MARISHA: Hang on, wait, so, Orym. 
MATT: Imogen. 
LAURA: Fearne. 
TRAVIS: Orym, Fearne, Ashton. 
LAURA: Ashton, Imogen. 
MATT: All right, 10 to five. 
SAM: Seven. 
TRAVIS: Seven. 
TALIESIN and LAURA: Oh. 
MATT, TRAVIS, and SAM: Rollies. 
SAM: 17. 
TRAVIS: Nine. 
SAM: Hey. 
MATT: All right. FCG. 
TALIESIN: Chet. 
MATT: Then we have Chetney. 
TALIESIN: Then Laudna. 
MATT: Then I assume Laudna at the end. 
MARISHA: Three. 
MATT: All righty. So-- 
TRAVIS: Sandbagger. 
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: Did you really even roll a three? Can we trust anything that you're saying? 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Technically, I rolled a one. 
SAM: Oh! Liar! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Well, I didn't mention it was plus two. 
SAM: Oh, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: These are just rules. 
LAURA: That's what they want you to think. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Indeed, now, as you all look around yourself, you can hear the various denizens of the jungle coming alive around you. You now get to figure out how to handle the scenario. Orym, you're up first. 
LIAM: All right, Orym is going to flea-- 
MARISHA: He's smirking. 
SAM: He smirked. 
MARISHA: He's smirking with his eyebrows. 
SAM: He smirked. 
MATT, LAURA, and SAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Instantly started smirking! 
LIAM: I've had a long day. 
TRAVIS: Oh! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: He started it with, "Orym is going to--" 
LAURA: To be fair-- 
ASHLEY: -- instead of "I'm going to." 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Orym-- 
ASHLEY: Didn't you? 
LAURA: That's true. 
SAM: Because he's not Orym. 
LAURA: He always says, "I." 
LIAM: Pass the bowl, man. 
SAM: We are three words into initiative-- 
LIAM: Orym is going to flea jump up onto the top of that arch-- 
LAURA: To be fair, Liam's been weird-- 
LIAM: -- that's right behind him. 
MATT: Right there? 
LAURA: -- since he got here today. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That is true. 
LIAM: Right up there, and I am going to-- 
SAM: Since the 90s. 
MARISHA: He's sandbagging, though. 
MATT: Just for the sake of its height-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: -- make an acrobatics check to make sure you can land at the top of that precipice without tumbling. 
LIAM: That's an 18. 
MATT: 18, you land precariously, but keep it there. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LIAM: Okay, I want to fucking look at everybody-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: -- and see if anything seems out of whack or out of place. No, you know what? I don't want to do that. I want to look around and look for likely-- 
MARISHA: That's exactly what not Orym would want to not do. 
LAURA, SAM, and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: This trust exercise is already going great. (laughter) 
LIAM: From here, do I see anything that looks like one of these? Nana Morri said that the branches would be held inside of-- 
LAURA: Ashton, look at how quiet. 
SAM: He's so quiet. 
LIAM: -- a what now? 
MATT: A small basin altar. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Taliesin never talks. 
LIAM: A basin altar. 
MARISHA: Taliesin's always-- 
LIAM: So I'm going to tiptoe, spin around up here-- 
MARISHA: -- half asleep. 
TALIESIN: I'm comfortable. 
LIAM: -- and see if anything looks like an altar from up here. 
LAURA, SAM, and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
ASHLEY: Look how hidden he put his card. He put it so far under his tray. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Whereas mine's just out. 
MATT: Honestly, hide your cards anyway. 
MARISHA: That is true. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Just to be safe, so nobody ends up knocking it over accidentally. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Do you mean this card? (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh! 
SAM: Bold. 
TALIESIN: Freeze frame. 
LIAM: Freeze frame. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: They know, they know. 20, that's a 20 perception. 
MATT: A 20, okay. 
LAURA: Aw, it's warm. 
MATT: Glancing about the space, the fog, it's slowly blanketing the bottom of this ruin, it's making it a little hard to make out details. You do not, from your vantage point, see anything that resembles one of these basins. So you might have to shift or look harder elsewhere. 
LIAM: Understood, understood. I'll hold off here. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: That's my opening gambit-- 
MATT: You got it, next. 
LIAM: -- as I lie to all my friends. (laughter) 
MATT: Fearne, you're up, what are doing? 
LAURA: Where did you go, Orym? 
MATT: Lept up there. 
LIAM: On top of that arch. 
LAURA: Oh, look at you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Look at us. Look at us. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to move this way. 
MARISHA: Look at you, now look at me. 
ASHLEY: Far out this way and look around and see if I can find a branch. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (claps) 
ASHLEY: No, but-- 
TRAVIS: Easiest save ever! 
MARISHA: I think it's Fearne, (laughs) yeah, I think it's just Fearne. 
ASHLEY: One of the branches. One of the three. 
LIAM: (as Fearne) "I'm looking for Michelle Branch." 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
SAM: ♪ ("A Thousand Miles") ♪ 
LAURA: I'm trying to-- 
SAM: No, that's not her. 
LAURA: No, that's Vanessa Carlton. I'm trying desperately to think of a Michelle Branch song. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: I can't think of a one. 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MARISHA: I can't either. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: 18. 
LIAM: Sorry, Michelle. 
MATT: Looking around this space-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ If I could just ♪ 
MATT: -- you do not see any sort of basin or altar-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ See you ♪ 
MATT: -- that is what Nana Morri had told you. 
LAURA: (gasps) That's right. 
MATT: You do see that a lot of these ruins have all manner of twisting brambles and thick, thorn-covered bushes that have grown out of the stonework, that have blocked some of the spaces. You can see there's a lot of overgrowth around here entirely. 
LIAM: Plant pubes. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Orym says. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: So you do not see anything at a cursory glance looking around the space, but everything on here can be inspected, it can be investigated, it can be searched through, it can be burned. Whatever you're feeling you want to do, be creative, the space is yours to experiment with. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: This is a good map, by the way. 
MATT: I'm excited. 
LIAM: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Stacked. 
TALIESIN: It's painful there's so many nooks and crannies-- 
LIAM: Complicated. Yeah, it's complicated. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
TALIESIN: -- for skullduggery. 
TRAVIS: There is only one thing that there are three of. 
LIAM: I didn't really find out what was around me. 
SAM: Oh, is that true. 
LIAM: It seemed like a smart thing to do. 
ASHLEY: Oh, hang on, hang on here. 
SAM: The trees. 
ASHLEY: Can I go around and play around with one of those lights? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: They're on the map for flair or are those in the environment? 
MATT: Oh, you mean these? 
ASHLEY: The blue lights? 
MATT: These here? 
LIAM: On the blue columns, the glowy bits. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: I mean, what you can see, they're glowing, the dull flicker that occasionally pulses in and out, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Mm. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: Blue balls. 
SAM: It feels like we're in-- 
ASHLEY: I will keep working my way towards the bramble over here. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Workin' my way ♪ 
MATT: Bramble here? Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: You're at the bramble. 
MARISHA: Oh, there they go. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: The audio. 
MATT: As you step up to it, you watch it as part of it (slurping) and then suddenly, (violent whooshes) the violets reach out-- 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: -- and wrap around you. Make a dexterity saving throw for me. 
ASHLEY: Hey! 
SAM and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: (as Fearne) "Hey!" 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
LIAM: You guys. 
ASHLEY: Dexterity saving throw. Wait, advantage against spells and other magical effects? 
MATT: This is a natural entity in the fey, so. 
LIAM: Physical. 
ASHLEY: Six. 
MATT: Got it. 
LAURA: Great roll. 
MATT: All right, the vines (whooshes) wrap around you and entangle you, pulling you into it. The thorns are about three to four inches long. 
ALL: Oh no. 
MATT: They dig into your skin, painfully. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: You take... 
MARISHA: Four inches is big. 
LAURA: It is big. 
MATT: You take 16 points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MATT: And you are restrained. 
SAM: Ooh, Fearne! 
MATT: You are currently held with it. 
LIAM: That's one doppelganger we don't have to worry about. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Right? (laughs) 
SAM: Do we let her die? 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: It's here for you. You are restrained in the middle of that thatch, right there. Oh god, you keep falling. All right, I'll get you out of the thatch. There we go. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: That's going to finish your turn. 
MARISHA: Wait, is that a trap? Is that considered a trap? 
ASHLEY: I think the brambles are a little grabby. 
MARISHA: Well, she wouldn't walk herself into a trap. 
ASHLEY: No, I would've known if I was a doppelganger, like Orym is. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Ashton. 
SAM: She walked so confidently into it, as if she knew it were there. 
MARISHA: Which means she's not-- 
TALIESIN: Just letting them get it out of their system. 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, what an interesting way to start your sentence. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I agree. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I agree as well. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading over to the bramble. As directly as is reasonable, I'm going to head over to the bramble that's got Fearne. 
TRAVIS: Reasonable. 
MATT: Oh, okay, you can walk around over to the space. You can try and leap across, but there is a bramble in the way right there. 
TALIESIN: Oh, then-- 
MATT: Not unlike the one that she-- 
TRAVIS: Is the pool solid or liquid? 
LAURA: Bramble. 
MATT: It's liquid. 
LAURA: Good name. 
MATT: You can see it shifting. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's liquid? 
TALIESIN: Fuck it, I'll try, and the worst thing that happens is I fall in the water. 
LAURA: Yeah, I think it's a pool. 
MATT: Yeah, athletics check. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, the water. 
SAM: Can we bring those branches into the pool? 
TALIESIN: That's 14. 
MATT: 14, you come up on the edge, (grunts) leap across, about a 10-foot gap, no big issue, land. You come up to the edge where she is currently wrapped. You can see them pulling and twisting and holding her there. 
ASHLEY: Help me, doppelganger. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Do I have a good angle to hit this thing without hitting Fearne? 
MATT: Ah, not so much, but you can try and pull her free, if you'd like. 
TALIESIN: I'll do that. 
MATT: Okay, so to do that, I need you to roll a strength check for me. 
TALIESIN: Would raging help this? It would, wouldn't it? 
MATT: Raging would give you advantage on it, if you'd like. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to rage. Set my... I'm going to do my thing, hold on. 
LIAM: Did you intimate-- 
TRAVIS: Would a doppelganger care about Fearne? 
LIAM: -- that the doppelgangers were able to look into our heads? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Or they just listened to us talking? 
MATT: No, they were able to look into your heads. 
LIAM: Oh, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. That makes it harder. 
MATT: As Morri said, they've been with you since you started this, so they were around for the honesty portion of this as well. 
TRAVIS: Told you I needed to clear that browser history. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Let's see what we got. We got... Hey, fuck yeah, this is a fun one. Got Time, finally. So I've got the red and blue flicker that starts hitting. Wow, this'll be fun. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: So I'm going to make this strength check-- 
LAURA: He never gets Time. 
TALIESIN: -- and try and pull her out. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I never get the Time one, I'm so excited. It's so badass. That's cocked. 
MATT: That's cocked, yeah. 
SAM: It's never cocked. 
TALIESIN: Strength check is, just standard strength roll? 
MARISHA: It's always cocked. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: 17. 
MATT: 17. You reach over and grab the edge of the brambles, being careful where the spikes are, and you pull back and tear them open, which frees you from being restrained. This section of bramble is now ruined and defunct. 
LIAM: Resilient. 
MATT: It's no longer part of the battle. 
TALIESIN: It's not a creature, out of curiosity, right? 
MATT: I mean, it is a creature, but it's not considered a target, necessarily. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: I mean, you can target with spells and stuff, but. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I was wondering if my effect would have an effect on it or not, but that's okay. It would be like a constitution save. 
MATT: Nah, because you didn't kill it, you tore open and it pulls away and rescinds-- 
TALIESIN: Got you. 
MATT: -- and retracts from the battlefield. 
TALIESIN: As I do that, I'm going to stop, and why don't we all stick together, find one of these branches so that we all know what it looks like and what the mode of finding it is, and then we can divide into two teams once we've found one and have been able to observe all of us together. 
LIAM: Oh, super reasonable. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Can I find a rock and throw? (laughs) 
TALIESIN: No, that's right, I'm not in my house. 
MATT: You can pick up a rock, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Scoot. (whooshes) 
MATT: (laughs) (whooshes) 
MARISHA: Is there a time limit to this? 
TALIESIN: You don't know. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
SAM: I think Ashton might be right. It might be useful for all of us to stick together-- 
MARISHA: To stick together. 
SAM: -- at least at the beginning. 
MARISHA: Then we can all be accountable for one another. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: The bramble's gone? 
MATT: The bramble, once it was pulled apart, it pulled away and vanished underground. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Nothing else is there at the moment? 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: Okay. All right, I'm still doing that weird little flicker. 
MARISHA: Big sigh. Big sigh from Chetney. 
TRAVIS: I don't like it. 
TALIESIN: You don't like it? 
TRAVIS: But I don't know why. (laughs) 
MATT: Imogen, you're up. 
TALIESIN: The group decides. 
TRAVIS: I want to wander off and get hurt. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: I know, right? (laughs) 
MARISHA: "I want to wander off and get hurt." 
LAURA: Um. 
MARISHA: Imogen. 
LAURA: Hmm? 
MARISHA: Do you love me? 
LAURA: I already told you I did. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: ♪ Do you love me ♪ 
TRAVIS: Good phrasing. 
LIAM: ♪ Yes, I love you ♪ 
MARISHA: All right. I love you, too. 
SAM: Aw. 
MARISHA: No matter what form you're in. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) I feel like you're a doppelganger right now. 
MARISHA: No, what? (gasps) (laughter) 
MARISHA: I told you! (laughs) I'm not! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Horrible, horrible. Just leave. 
LAURA: I feel like you set me up. You set me up. 
LIAM: (laughs) It might as well have been the "Body Snatchers" moment. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I love you as well. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Holy shit. You're going to start crying. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Here come the tears. 
MARISHA: I am historically so bad at my role. (laughs) 
MARISHA: This is just what happens. 
LIAM: Oh god, that's true. 
MARISHA: Every time. 
TALIESIN: Every time. 
LIAM: She's admitting defeat, she's admitting defeat. 
LAURA: Yep, yep. 
SAM: All right, we got one already. 
LAURA: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. (laughter) 
MARISHA: No! You're letting one go free. 
LAURA: Oh no. Where are you standing? Where is Laudna? Is she in here? (laughs) 
MATT: Oh, over here. 
SAM: Ah! She wasn't there. 
LAURA: She wasn't even here. 
MATT: Laudna would be over here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: That had nothing to do with me. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay, (sighs) I don't know where these altars are. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: She's scratching, it's not hers. 
LIAM: Also, where are the two real people? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: What are you talking? 
TRAVIS: They're watching from the press box. 
LIAM: Two fakes are here, where are the originals? 
TRAVIS: They got caviar in the press box. 
TALIESIN: You're overthinking it. 
LAURA: You're a doppelganger. 
TALIESIN: You are like everybody overthinking. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Turkish delight. 
MATT: Yeah, well, I guess you'll find out. 
LAURA: I am so bad at perception. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: Wherever Nana Morri went. 
LAURA: I'm so bad at perception. 
LIAM: Sipping Bacardi, man. 
TRAVIS: Are you enjoying the show? 
SAM: We are two moves into our initiative. 
LAURA: I know, I know, I know. 
MATT: They're watching back in the security camera room, like, (sips) "Oh my god." 
TALIESIN: These fucking idiots. They're just sitting going, "These people." 
LAURA: Wait. 
LIAM: "That one said she loves her, and the other one believed it! (cackles)" 
LAURA: Okay, what I'm going to do is-- Okay, I'm going to-- I'm-- Okay. 
TRAVIS: What? (laughs) 
LIAM: Hippity hoppity. 
LAURA: I'm going to Misty Step. 
SAM: Mm. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: How far can I Misty Step? 30 feet, up to 30 feet. So I'm going to Misty Step to this tree. 
SAM: That's more Odessa. 
LAURA: Can I do that? 
MATT: To this tree here? 
LAURA: Yeah. Can I get there? 
SAM: She's usually more San Antonio. 
LAURA: Well, I didn't want to be on top of the tree. 
MATT: Okay, so up here, you mean? 
LAURA: No, I just want to be at the base of the tree. 
MATT: Base of it, all right. 
LAURA: What I want to do is search. Although, that's-- 
MATT: Do you have to see where you can Misty Step? 
LAURA: Can I not see right here? 
MATT: You can peer over here, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. Poof. 
TALIESIN: Poof. 
LIAM: Nice job, doppelganger. 
LAURA: I want to-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) She shits her pants every time. 
TALIESIN: Exactly what a doppelganger would say. (laughter) 
LAURA: I want to-- 
SAM: Just like Imogen! 
LAURA: I want to search, as my action, under the tree. 
MATT: Under the tree? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, make an investigation check for me. 
TALIESIN: ♪ Under the tree ♪ 
LIAM: Imagine if the moves were all real awkward, like. 
LAURA: ♪ Under the tree ♪ 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Darling, it's better ♪ 
LAURA: Gosh darn it. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Down where it's wetter ♪ 
LAURA: Six. 
MATT: What is it? 
LAURA: Six. 
MATT: Six. (laughter) 
SAM: Do you hate Michelle Branch songs? 
MATT: The base of these trees-- 
ASHLEY: It's a great line. 
MATT: -- it's a heavy tangle of thick roots, and you can see, there's multicolored green, purple, and blue moss that grow up it. 
ASHLEY and LIAM: ♪ Take it from me ♪ 
MATT: It's a heavy tangle, and you're not quite sure even where to begin to investigate. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: You look in some of the nooks and crannies, but it's a very, very thick cluster, it'll take you a minute. 
LAURA: It's not like the mini, because I was picturing it like an open inside, the tree was hollow. It's not like that? 
MATT: I mean, yeah, we'll say it's like that, but I'm saying, but the roots around it, you look inside and you don't see anything up inside the open areas at a cursory glance or searching through from where you're standing. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: How are we're going to find this thing? 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We stick together and do a round. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: All right. 
LAURA: I guess that's everything I'm going to do. 
MATT: All righty, FCG, you're up. Chetney, on deck. 
SAM: Oh, me, so soon. I thought I rolled real low. I can't see where I am, but I'm going to head over-- 
MATT: You're right over here. 
SAM: -- to Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Towards Fearne. 
MATT: Roll over. 
SAM: And do what I always do, which is heal people. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) Thank you. 

LIAM and SAM: (laughs) 
SAM: I'll touch you and give you-- 
LAURA: You wouldn't heal someone yet. 
SAM: Cure Wounds. It's what I always do. 
LIAM: It's Sam Reich. (laughter) 
SAM: Eight points of healing. 
TRAVIS: Healing. So Sam Reich. 
SAM: Because I'm a cleric. 
TALIESIN: Only eight points? 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: Only eight, friend. 
LAURA: So now I think you're not a doppelganger because it's-- Mm, I don't know. 
SAM: Could be the double reverse Uno. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. That's what I'm saying. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's really not. 
SAM: I guess that's my action, so I can't bonus action perception, investigation check or anything? 
LAURA: That's what it is! He's being so obvious he's a doppelganger-- 
MATT: Because part of this is cursory glances you can bonus action search. 
LAURA: -- to fake us out. 
MATT: It's a higher DC to give a quick glance than spending your whole turn looking for something. So if you want to and shoot for a higher roll, maybe. 
LIAM: Let's go, Scam Riegel. 
SAM: Sure, yeah. I'll just search around. 
MARISHA: Scam Riegel. 
MATT: Anything specific? 
SAM: I'm going to look, if I can, for magical shimmers or illusions. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check for me. 
SAM: 15. (laughter) 
MATT: 15. Interesting. 
SAM: If I say it like that-- 
MARISHA: Perfectly above average. 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: At a cursory glance, first off, the canopy of this tree you can see-- 
SAM: The canop-ay. 
MATT: The canop-ay. (laughter) 
LIAM: Just like that, a new bit was born. 
MATT: -- of this tree, the tree itself has some sort of a magical shimmer to it. In fact, a lot of the brush around here has a slight sheen that shifts color with the light as it plays upon it. You do notice that some of the nearby hanging vines and bushes have a faint transparency when light hits them at certain angles. 
SAM: Do I tell the others? Of course I do! I think some of these, you said vines or branches? 
MATT: Yeah, the clusters of green and brambles. Some of these have something different about them. 
SAM: Some of the branches, but not one in particular. Several of them. 
MATT: You see sheens here and there and I'll say on the edge of this column right there-- 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: -- you can see there's a section of the hanging vines that looks like it's gossamer and somewhat translucent for a moment, and then the lights passes by and it looks solid. 
SAM: On the post there and around us, there are illusory vines. 
LAURA: Is it on all the posts or is it just that one? 
SAM: I think I just saw one. 
MATT: Just that one, but you see that similar coloration on a lot of the plants around here. 
MARISHA: Is it because this whole thing is an illusion? 
LAURA: Maybe. 
MARISHA: Are you an illusion? 
SAM: Maybe. 
MATT: Chetney, you're up with Laudna on deck. 
SAM: Oh no, I don't exist! 
TRAVIS: Would I still have about 20 minutes of werewolf form from the previous-- 
MATT: If you haven't transformed back? Yeah, sure. 
TRAVIS: I haven't. 
MARISHA: Sends FCG further into his existential crisis. 
MATT: You are still a werewolf. 
SAM: I'm not a real person. 
TRAVIS: For my bonus action, can I click my boots of speed together? 
SAM: Bewts. (boots) 
MATT: Yes, you may. 
TRAVIS: I would like to-- 
SAM: ♪ 'Cause you're everything to me ♪ 
TRAVIS: Walk backwards-- 
LAURA: That's what it is. 
TRAVIS: -- through this doorway? 
ASHLEY: ♪ 'Cause you're everywhere ♪ 
MATT: Through here? 
TRAVIS: Yes, just to see what happens. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: ♪ To me ♪ 
LAURA: Is it everywhere? 
MATT: You shift through here. 
SAM and LAURA: ♪ When I close my eyes ♪ ♪ It's you I see ♪ 
MATT: Immediately, there's a heavy bramble wall to the right and a cluster of those vines suddenly start to unwind and lash out at you. Make a dexterity saving throw. 
TRAVIS: The doorways suck! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wait, did you go the opposite direction? 
SAM: He did because he's fucking Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20. You duck out of the way and the branches lash out, scrape against the stone wall, and then recoil. You see them, they're pulling back and twisting on themselves like they grab nothing, and you're uncertain if they're prepping for another one if you stay there or not. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to try a tactic that everyone should have done. I am not the doppelganger. I'm coming! I'm just going the back way. Can I hop over? Can I go this way and head that direction? 
MATT: Make an athletics check to see if you can leap over them and not take any damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay, fair enough. That isn't the right one. 17 plus (rapid addition) 26. 25. 
MATT: Easily enough, you pounce over the top-- 
MARISHA: Boing! 
MATT: -- landing into this here. There's a spread of elements in front of you. 
TRAVIS: Great. I will split. That's going to suck, but I'll go that way. 
MATT: Okay. You rush through that center piece. As you do, you run past the column and there's a cluster of purple flowers that have grown on the side of it, and right as you go by, you hear (misty spray). 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: You watch as they spray this cloud of green that you try and dodge past that hits your skin and it burns immediately. 
MARISHA: Oof. 
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving throw. 
TRAVIS: I'm making a lot of saves, a lot of saves. (laughs) 19. 
SAM: Oh, that's pretty good. 
MATT: 19. Whoops, that was-- 
LAURA: ♪ N-n-n-n-nineteen ♪ 
MATT: The dice went away. That's going to be 23 points of acid damage. 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
MATT: As it (acid sizzling) burns into your skin and it leaves pockmarks in it for a minute. 
TRAVIS: That was just on this column? 
MATT: Just in that column there, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Really no other identifying thing on that? 
MATT: So here now-- 
LAURA: You said that the branches would be on an altar? 
TRAVIS: Did it come from a-- 
MATT: I'm going to put that there to-- 
TALIESIN: Some kind of altar. 
TRAVIS: Did it come from a-- 
MATT: -- denote where. 
TRAVIS: Was there a flower on the side of that column that if I saw again I could be like watch out for those? 
MATT: Yup, this purple flower. 
TRAVIS: Purple flower. Purple flowers spit (moans) acid. 
LIAM: (Lucky the Leprechaun) Blue diamonds, yellow horseshoes. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, you keep moving. 
TALIESIN: Purple flowers. 
TRAVIS: I'll keep going through that-- I'll go around that doorway. 
LAURA: They're not seeable-- 
MATT: Over here? 
LAURA: -- at all on the map, right? 
TRAVIS: More like-- 
LAURA: Right now? 
TRAVIS: I don't know what you have fun house planned-- 
SAM: Visible is the word. 
LAURA: To us? 
TRAVIS: -- but I'll go that way. 
TALIESIN: No, I don't think so. 
MATT: As you move past the other group of vines right there in the section, it also lashes out at you. 
LAURA: No the branches, or the altars. 
MATT: Make another dexterity saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: I got to the highest point on the map and look around. 
TRAVIS: That is a 16. 
LIAM: There's a lot of walls. 
MATT: 16. You manage to barely duck underneath as it whips out nearby and you continue to move on past it. 
LAURA: Sheesh! 
MATT: I'll say for your full movement. 
TRAVIS: Sheesh. 
MATT: You can get about to that through here. That's about as far as you can get. 
TRAVIS: Can I scour the area for my action? 
MATT: I will say you've done quite a bit of movement leaping over, checking. You can make one, but it'll be a high DC because it's a cursory glance. So you can make a perception check, if you'd like. 
TRAVIS: No. 11. 
MATT: 11. Nothing at first glance. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: So you start looking around, hand on the side of the stonework as you step out. (sniffing) Glancing, your wolven eyes do not catch anything of interest. 
TRAVIS: Just so you're aware, purple flowers spit acid, vines on the doorways hurt! Nothing back here so far. 
MATT: Laudna, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Copy that. 
MATT: With Orym on deck. 
TRAVIS: (huskily) Nothing back here so far. 
MARISHA: I pull out Pâté. 
TRAVIS: I'm a werewolf. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Yep. 
MATT: (Pâté) "Hey, what we doing? What's the plan, eh?" 
MARISHA: Are you a doppelganger? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "I don't know what that is." 
MARISHA: Am I a doppelganger? 
MATT: "I don't know what that is!" 
MARISHA: Do I look like the real Laudna to you? 
MATT: "I mean, I hope so." 
MARISHA: Me too. 
MATT: "(growls)" 
MARISHA: Oh, what? Don't! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He doesn't even have eyes. 
MATT: "I wasn't even questioning until you brought it up, so I guess that's on you." 
MARISHA: (laughs) That's fair. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) True. 
MARISHA: All right. We're looking for a white, ivory branch. 
MATT: "'Kay." 
MARISHA: So won't you start looking around, helping me out, okay? 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Also, if anyone else looks like they're up to any funny business, you tell me in my head. 
MATT: "Funny business, got it. Okay." 
SAM: Whatcha looking for, Travis? Whatcha looking for? (laughter) 
SAM: Sweat? 
TRAVIS: Smelling for a rat. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: All you're going to find is leave-in conditioner at this point, but okay, Travis. 
MATT: All right. So you summon him there. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Stop it, Sam! (laughter) 
LAURA: You're such an asshole. 
TRAVIS: (like Laura) Stop it, Sam! 
MARISHA: Can I skitter over here to this column? 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: You're going to skitter over? 
LAURA: Don't laugh at him. 
MARISHA: Then I'm going to cast Spider Climb and climb up-- oops, oops, oops, oops. 
MATT: It's okay. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Don't fucking touch my mini. 
MARISHA: Can I climb up to this one? 
MATT: That one? If you'd like to. 
SAM: (giggles) 
MATT: Well, you summoned him, so-- 
MARISHA: Well, he was already out and about. 
MATT: Okay. I'll say it's fine. 
LAURA: Damn it, it still tastes good, and I still want to eat it. 
SAM: Just enjoy it! 
MATT: You Spider Climb, and you climb up there up on top, and you have this overview position now of looking at everybody. 
MARISHA: Then, I'm going to Quicken a spell. 
LIAM: This is a sex-positive show. 
ASHLEY: You eat this and you enjoy it. 
LAURA: You suck on it and you enjoy it. (laughter) 
SAM: Suck that! 
MARISHA: Cast-- (laughter) 
LAURA: Okay. I'm throwing it away. 
MARISHA: I'm going to cast-- 
SAM: No! 
MARISHA: -- Wither and Bloom. 
LIAM: (shushing) 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I don't want to deprive you. 
MARISHA: It's a 10-foot situation. Can I do it here to wither away all of the foliage? 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Foliage. 
LIAM: Foliahge. 
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Foliahge. 
MATT: So, roll-- 
TALIESIN: What a good idea! 
MATT: -- 2d6 necrotic damage. 
MARISHA: It's got a thing with... (mumbled reading) 
MATT: Oh, non-magical vegetation in the area withers. Yeah, you watch-- 
MARISHA: But I guess I'll still-- 
MATT: You watch as all of this turns black and vanishes in the space around. 
TRAVIS: Yay. 
SAM: There's a white branch underneath it? 
LAURA: There's a white pillar. A little altar. 
MATT: You see. (cheering) 
MARISHA: ♪ There it is ♪ 
MATT: Hidden in this space right there, completely overgrown, is a tiny, little basin altar with a little white branch that sits within. 
MARISHA: (gasps) I see it! I see it! Chetney, it's near you. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) I see it. Ah! 
MATT: All right. That finishes Laudna's go. Then, Orym, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
LIAM: I call out to Fearne. Fearne! 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
LIAM: When you and I attended the 22nd Annual Byroden Forever Pageant, what did Cinna Brightbow throw at me when I was tied up on stage? 
MARISHA: Yeah, Ashley. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to say... a pie? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: A dick. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I can't remember what I had for breakfast. I think that's really a-- 
ASHLEY: It was-- It was-- 
LIAM: That's wrong, but I think it's still you. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, the right answer would be worrisome. 
ASHLEY: What was it, again? 
LIAM: Axes! And I leap off of the arch down into that room behind. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
MATT: Here? 
LIAM: To look around, and I'll spend an action-- 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
LIAM: -- investigating in that room. 
LAURA: I think she's just really good at acting. 
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an investigation check. 
MARISHA: But I don't know! 
LIAM and MATT: Eight! 
LAURA: This guy! 
MATT: Looking around the room, you see all the vines growing over the walls and around the slick moisture that's gathered on the stones that still stand, the broken stones that hit the ground around. Nothing of interest in the immediate vicinity. 
LIAM: Then, as a bonus action, I press the button that releases all the crocodiles. (laughter) 
MATT: Perfect. Got it. 
TRAVIS: Please, please have crocodiles. 
MATT: Fearne, you're up, with Ashton on deck. 
MARISHA: But he was asking if the doppelgangers have all the same information. 
LAURA: Not that much information. They only have surface level. 
MARISHA: But for extra clarification. 
LAURA: Yeah, but Matt said it was only surface level information. 
SAM: I've narrowed it down to three. 
LIAM: It's stuff that we talked about-- 
LAURA: It's stuff that we talked about. 
LIAM: Focused on here, and I for sure wasn't thinking about the Byroden beauty pageant. 
LAURA: Exactly. It's not-- I don't think. 
TALIESIN: I just assume it's still just fucking us. 
MATT: I will specify, they got to delve into your minds. 
LIAM: I will specify. 
MATT: You don't quite know how deep. At a first glance, or surface thoughts and then deeper. 
MARISHA: The royal us. 
LAURA: Wouldn't we have felt that? 
MATT: Not in this instance. 
TALIESIN: Just got to go with it. 
MATT: Mind you, it's about asking certain questions. If you think it helps, it might. It's up to you to decide. 
LAURA: We can ask questions to each other and see. 
SAM: We can. 
LAURA: We can, but we don't know how much the doppelgangers know. 
LIAM: We don't know how efficient-- 
TRAVIS: If the branch is returned to the pool, is it safe, or does it have to be safeguarded so that it remains in the pool? I love it. Okay. 
LIAM: But I picked a question that's not at the forefront of Orym's mind. He thinks about Will. He thinks about danger. He thinks about Zephrah. He's not thinking about the fucking pie contest. 
TALIESIN: You're working hard to make this make sense. 
LIAM: (blade whooshing) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: My turn? 
MATT: Could be. 
ASHLEY: Me? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Wow, you've never been that eager to go. (laughter) 
MATT: I'm sorry, I'm not discounting what you're doing. I'm just-- Also be-- 
SAM: Is it my turn yet? 
MATT: You're uncertain of how much information they have. 
LIAM: I'm acting in character. I don't care if Orym's-- 
MATT: I know. Exactly. 
TRAVIS: Those are like gills coming out of your neck. Your carotid betrays you. 
ASHLEY: Don't look at my bare neck. 
MATT: So. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay. Is there-- I want to go to another area where there's a bunch of foliage and things, like where Laudna took down-- Wait, what'd you do? Did you burn them? 
MATT: Clusters over here. 
MARISHA: I did Wither and Bloom, like necrotic. 
MATT: From what you've seen, this is the only area that's visual to you here and here are the two areas with the most clustered foliage. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so. 
MARISHA: Yeah, but if you burn it-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Just Fireball the whole-- 
MARISHA: Oh wait, can you light the branch on fire? 
LAURA: I know, that's what I'm afraid of. We might destroy the branch if... Because I was going to Lightning Bolt something, but I think I would destroy it. 
ASHLEY: But it's already been blanched. 
LIAM: I didn't ask where branch is. I said I cast Fireball. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: All right. So underneath the arch. 
MATT: Uh-huh. Here? 
ASHLEY: I am going to, yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: ♪ (sings) ♪ 
ASHLEY: Cast Scorching Ray. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: There. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack three times. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. Your eyes got big. 
MATT: No, no. They did not. 
MARISHA: Matt's the doppelganger! 
ASHLEY: That first one does not hit. 
MATT: Technically. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Your spell attack modifier. 
ASHLEY: 19? 
MATT: 19 hits. 
ASHLEY: 12? 
MATT: 12 just barely. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
MATT: I'll say it just barely misses. 
ASHLEY: Oh, just barely misses. Okay. Oh, that was a little bit of... Okay. So only one hits. 
MATT: Okay. So roll damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I have to move because I don't understand how this map works yet. 
ASHLEY: Eight. 
MATT: Eight damage doubled because these things are vulnerable to fire being brambles. That's 16. (flames roaring) This whole section begins to burn away. The brambles pull back, and much of this brush vanishes, which diminishes that vicinity, but it does leave-- 
SAM: Never been there before in 80 episodes. 
MATT: -- now a burning inferno of burning plants in that area now that closes off that entrance. 
LIAM: From behind the fire, you hear: Um! 
ASHLEY: So, I didn't fully think that through with wood and fire situation. So... my bad. 
SAM: Oh, just a mistake, huh? 
MATT: Do you want to stay put? 
ASHLEY: I will, yeah. I'll back up a little bit. 
MATT: Which way? 
SAM: A little bit of diarrhea just coming out. 
ASHLEY: Let's go this way. 
MATT: This way? (laughter) You step over here. 
LIAM: That's the tell? 
MATT: There's now this clean section of ruin over here with brambles and overgrowth. There's the flames this way, and whatever else you can see in the vicinity. 
TRAVIS: Matt, check your phone. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh! What? 
MATT: Oh, thank you. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Big wiener. 
ASHLEY: All right. (laughter) 
SAM: You just sent him a big dick pic? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It just says "big wiener." (laughter) 
MATT: All right. Ashton. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Okay, well. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: All in a text, too. "Wiener." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm not sure if you got my last text, but. 
TALIESIN: Well, how are we going to do this? 
LIAM: That could also be the way he covered sending a real message. 
LAURA: Yeah, I know. 
LIAM: It could say "Wiener, secret plans." 
TRAVIS: Unless I show the text thread. It's gone?! 
TALIESIN: Oh, stop it. 
TRAVIS: "Big wiener." (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's "wiener" and "big wiener." 
MATT: Ashton, what you got, buddy? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a move. Anybody got a problem with it? 
LIAM: The clarification. 
TALIESIN: Well, here we go. 
LIAM: Do it, doppelganger. 
TALIESIN: I am going to-- 
ASHLEY: It's really weird that you're asking us. 
TALIESIN: I'm just making my shit known. 
ASHLEY: Permission. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and get through this little crevice right here. I'm going to use Hyper Rage. So I'm burning a Chaos Burst. 
MARISHA: Hyper Rage? 
SAM: That's a real thing? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: (heavy metal guitar) 
ASHLEY: Rage. 
SAM: Mega rage. 
TRAVIS: The doorways suck. Just remember. 
TALIESIN: So. 
LIAM: Man, we are punchy. 
SAM: It's just we're nervous! 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's nerves. 
TALIESIN: So I am going to try and walk through. I'm going to try and do a hop and hop to get to that. 
MATT: Over to whereabouts? 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to get over to the white branch. 
MATT: Or, you're trying to go over this thing now? All right. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, not directly over, but left and right to two of the easy parts right there. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: And through here. Make an athletics check to-- 
ASHLEY: It's not me. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's not advantage while raging is it? No. 
MATT: Huh? 
TALIESIN: Athletics check? Wait-- 
MATT: Oh, no. While raging, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah. All right. 
MARISHA: She can't make eye contact. 
ASHLEY: Because then I feel guilty. 
TALIESIN: Natural 20. 
MATT: Natural 20, yeah. Easy enough. 
LAURA: Natural 20? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
TALIESIN: Can I spend a bonus action to pick up the-- These nerds. Is it a bonus action to pick up the branch? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. You grab the branch. 
TALIESIN: That's my bonus action. 
MATT: Here you go. This is an ivory branch fragment. Now, you look at this. Each branch has three hit points. 
LIAM: Uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: Say again, each branch has-- 
LIAM: Each branch has three hit points. So don't let someone with a branch get burned up. 
SAM: Or hit it. 
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to grab it and I'm going to go right back the direction I came. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I am like a-- I'm the fucking Flash. There's an image, there's a red streak of me that's actually beating me to where I'm going and leaving a little blue trail behind. 
TRAVIS: Sick. Very nice. Cool. 
LAURA: That's cool. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to head straight for that pool. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: The pewl (pool). 
MATT: The pool. 
LAURA: Pewl. 
TALIESIN: How far have I gone so far? 
LAURA: Straight to the pewl. 
MATT: I'm going to say going over there, grabbing it, and getting up and coming around, that's probably going to be your movement and your-- 
TALIESIN: I have 80 feet of movement. 
MATT: Yeah, going over rough terrain, which halves it. 
TALIESIN: If it's ground terrain, technically I should be able to walk over it, I believe, with-- I'm going to put this in, it's Earth Walk, "ignore difficult terrain made of earth or stone." 
MATT: Oh yeah, it's made of stone, so yeah. I'll say it puts you right up against it. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm tossing it in. 
ASHLEY: Don't we have to put them in at the same time? 
TALIESIN: I'm throwing it in there, seeing what the fuck happens. 
MATT: You go to throw it and it bounces off some sort of invisible barrier. 
LAURA: Oh, so we have to have all three. 
TRAVIS: They got to touch. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
TRAVIS: They got to come together. 
LAURA: Got to touch the tips. 
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to then use the rest of my movement and my-- 
LAURA: Wow. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the rest of my movement and my action to grab it back again. 
MATT: Okay, you have it in your hand. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and back up to see if anything attacks me in any of these. I'm going to try and taunt any of the moss. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Moss taunt. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: With the rest of my movements. Anything? 
MATT: You back up into that space. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: From inside the nearby cluster of overgrowth, these little purple buds (soft popping) (mist spray)-- 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: -- and release a burst. 
SAM: Acid. 
MATT: Okay, constitution save for me, please. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that is not-- 
MARISHA: Protect the stick! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: Oh yeah, protect the stick! Use your body. 
TRAVIS: Put in your butt! 
TALIESIN: Oh, the stick is not near that. I knew where I was walking. 
ASHLEY: Stick it in your butt! 
TALIESIN: Constitution save? 
MATT: The stick is being held by you. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MATT: Part of the challenge of this is if you take damage, so does the stick. 
SAM and ASHLEY: (groan) 
TALIESIN: Shit, good to know. 
SAM: Protect the stick! 
MATT: Depending on the challenge. 
MARISHA: Protect the stick at all costs! 
TALIESIN: Did not know that. Okay, con save. 
MARISHA: Unless he wanted it! 
LAURA: Or he did know it! 
TALIESIN: That's 19? 
LAURA: He walked directly towards the thing that would hurt him. 
MATT: 19, okay. So you take only 12 points of acid damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: The branch loses a hit point. 
LIAM: Oh no! (groaning) 
LAURA: What happened? What? 
MATT: If he had failed, it would've lost two. 
LIAM: He got acid squirted, and that means that stick lost one of its three. 
LAURA: It took one-- 
TRAVIS: It took one because he succeeded on the saving roll. 
LIAM: So they all have little damage timelines. 
TRAVIS: If he failed-- 
TALIESIN: Good to know! 
TRAVIS: -- it would've taken two? 
MATT: It would've taken two if he had failed. 
TRAVIS: Of the three. 
TALIESIN: Now I figure out who to trust, because I have to take damage every turn or I lose my speed. 
TRAVIS: You can trust me! 
TALIESIN: So-- 
TRAVIS: I'm far too casual to be a doppelganger. 
LIAM: What if you just took it easy? 
TALIESIN: If I have any movement left, I will-- 
SAM: Is what a doppelganger would say. 
TALIESIN: I'll just, yeah. I'll stay near the bowl for a second. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'll walk away from that shit. 
LAURA: Fuck! 
MATT: I'll say you can get about there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, away from everything. Yeah. Thank you. 
LAURA: He's a really good poker player. 
MATT: All righty, finishing Ashton's go. Imogen, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: FCG on deck, okay. 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
LAURA: I'm going to hop up on this wall. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I am going to cast Detect Thoughts. 
SAM: Counterspell. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Let me see. Hold on. 
MATT: When you cast Detect Thoughts, a loud staticky buzz fills your mind. (groaning) 
TALIESIN: Nice try. 
SAM: Shit, that was what I was going to do. (laughs) 
LAURA: Damn it! 
LIAM: No thoughts for you. 
LAURA: Well, that would've made it easier, though. 
MATT: I know. Trust in this comes the old fashioned way. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
LIAM: Ooh. Through force. 
LAURA: (buzzes lips) Okay, well, I can't cast another spell, so-- 
MARISHA: You can Quicken a spell. 
LAURA: Oh, I have sorcery points! 
TRAVIS: You would know that if you were you. 
LAURA: Would I? (laughs) 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LAURA: All right, I'm going to Quicken, and I can turn it into a bonus ac-- No, but-- 
LIAM: Quick and good. 
MATT: It has to be a cantrip. 
LAURA: It has to be a cantrip. That doesn't do nothing. Okay, hold on. Sorry. Forgive me. I'm going to try to ♪ make my way ♪ over this way. 
MATT: Okay, so you jump over that little flat bit of stone there down this way. You can get about, I'll say there with your movement, next to Fearne. 
LAURA: Okay. Oh! Is there any foliage around me? 
MATT: Not directly around you, but there's clusters over here with the big old bramble wall and overgrowth in here. 
LAURA: Okay, I'll save it then. I suck. I'm going to, for my bonus action, look at Fearne and go: Are you the doppelganger? 
ASHLEY: No, I'm so not the doppelganger. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Are you? 
LAURA: No. (nervous whimper) (laughter) 
SAM: A meaningful exchange. 
MATT: Are you trying to make an insight check? Is that what you're trying to do? 
LAURA: Yes! That is what I'm trying to do. 
MATT: Okay. Fearne, I need you to text me-- 
SAM: Whenever she eats-- 
MATT: -- whether or not you're Fearne or the doppelganger. Don't look at her phone. 
TRAVIS: Or text wiener. 
MATT: Then I'll roll for you. 
LAURA: She just texts you "big wiener." 
MATT: Because I have your stats right here. 
SAM: Who are you texting right now? 
MARISHA: So wait, if you roll, then we know she's the doppelganger? 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: No, no, I'm rolling either persuasion or deception. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: You roll regardless. 
MATT: So this way, you don't know what the roll is. 
LAURA: Got it, got it, got it. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: But I'll let you know. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Matt's the doppelganger. 
TALIESIN: Don't look at the phone. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: I wasn't looking! I was looking at where her thumbs were moving to see if I could-- 
ASHLEY: See what I was texting? 
MARISHA: -- figure out-- 
MATT: What's your insight check? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: My insight is-- Oh, I should roll? 
MATT: You should roll insight, yeah. 
LAURA: What was that? 
LIAM: What the hell roll was that? 
LAURA: Shut up. (laughs) No, it's terrible! 
LIAM: She rolled a three. 
LAURA: I rolled seven! 
MATT: Seven. 
LAURA: No, eight! Well, that's even worse. So that's good. I'm glad I didn't use that one. 
MATT: You're going to have to base your belief on what she said. Take her at face value. 
ASHLEY: It's true. 
LAURA: Great. I'm glad. 
ASHLEY: It's true. I'm being totally honest. 
MATT: All right, with that-- (laughter) 
MATT: FCG, it's your go. 
MARISHA: Bro. 
LAURA, LIAM, and MARISHA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: (laughs deviously) 
SAM: Oh man. Okay. 
LAURA: Normally in these games, it's fun to pretend like you're the one that's the bad guy. For some reason it's fun. But then that's not the purpose of this. 
MARISHA: Right, we're supposed to be trusting. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: This is a trust exercise. 
MATT: That is the purpose of this, yes. 
LAURA: Trying to learn to trust each other. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: So we need to stop-- 
ASHLEY: Trust me. 
LAURA: -- doubting each other. 
ASHLEY: Trust me. Do not doubt, Imogen. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: What? 
LAURA: Why are you always like that? 
ASHLEY: I am-- 
SAM: So wait. Just to recap for me, she just cast a Scorching Ray which set a bunch of shit on fire. 
MATT: Over here, and there's now flames currently burning for the moment in the middle there. 
LAURA: Yeah, right next to the fountain. 
SAM: But you withered some plants to make them go away. 
MARISHA: I did. 
SAM: And that worked. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: I don't have any of that. 
TRAVIS: The plants don't look like they're receding from the fire, right? Like (cowardly plant moan) or anything? They're just burning. 
MATT: Just the ones that are burning there. They're just (burnt crumbling) crackling away. 
SAM: Shit. I'll move towards Fearne and Imogen and maybe a little farther if I can. 
MATT: Yeah, there's this cluster of bush around there. 
SAM: I will-- Shit, I can't cast Detect Thoughts. Shit. 
LAURA: I know, that was my whole plan. 
SAM: I know, right? 
TALIESIN: Too easy. 
SAM: Locate Object. 
LAURA: I know. 
TALIESIN: There's no cheating your way through this. 
SAM: There's no animal-- Are there animals around? No, there's no animals. 
TALIESIN: That you know of. 
SAM: What do I do? 
MATT: You hear creatures all throughout the trees around you, but-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Really? 
MATT: You hear birds and different critters up in the branches of the nearby forest. 
SAM: Do I see any? 
TALIESIN: (jungle bird call) 
MATT: You can make a perception check. 
SAM: I look up. Perception check. 
TALIESIN: Tackle him while he's looking up! 
SAM: 19. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: 19. You glance up-- 
MARISHA: Loot his corpse! 
MATT: -- and you see there are some strange little bird-like creatures up in the branch up there and you see there's some little squirrel-like marsupial creatures that curl away and look back with eyes that glow out of the shadow. You look down at the bush in front of you and you see a cluster of branches and twigs and fluff that has all been gathered on the inside of this bush. 
MARISHA: It could be in there. 
LAURA: Which bush? 
LIAM: It could be in there, could be a-- 
MATT: The one right here. 
MARISHA: It could be just a bird nest. 
LIAM: -- a trap. It could be a lure. 
MARISHA: Or a trap. 
SAM: I'm going to-- Was that my action or is this my-- 
MATT: It depends on what you want to do next. 
SAM: Okay, I wanted to cast Speak With Animals and ask one of the animals a question. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's a good idea. 
MATT: Okay, you can do that. 
LIAM: A kwestion. (question) 
TRAVIS: Somebody poke FCG, see if he's squishy. 
SAM: I cast Speak With Animals and I'll turn to one of the squirrel-type creatures, and say: Oh, squirrel friends! Can you tell me-- 
MARISHA: That's a good point. 
SAM: -- around this area specifically which plants you wouldn't jump on because they're not real? 
MATT: You see one of the squirrels curls out and you can see it looks pretty much like a squirrel except for it has no mouth here. It has just eyes. As it looks down at you, the middle of its head splits open. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: You can see teeth on each side and it (chittering growl) curls. But you hear as it speaks towards you, it goes, "I'm just a squirrel. I would probably say maybe avoid the big walls because they're really scary. Also, some of these trees are a little dubious." 
SAM: Can you tell me which ones? 
MATT: "Uh--" 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Where does a squirrel learn "dubious"? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I mean, that one seems pretty safe, but it's one of these two, it's been a little hard to jump around in." 
SAM: Thank you. Thank you. What's your name? 
MATT: "My name is Kenny." (laughter) 
MARISHA: Kenny? 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes. 
SAM: Smiley day to you, Kenny. 
MATT: "Smiley day to you, too, little metal man." The mouth goes-- (crunching creak) It kind of smiles, but it looks awful. "(chittering growl)" 
SAM: Amazing. If I find some nuts, I'll bring them to you. 
MATT: "I look forward to it." It rescinds into the shadow, its eyes glowing in the darkness. 
SAM: Okay, one of them trees over there might be-- 
MATT: You hear, "He's bringing nuts." (laughter) 
MATT: A bunch of other glowing eyes (popping) appear in the nearby trees. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MATT: There's now two dozen up there that all look hungrily in your direction. 
ASHLEY: What's going on? 
TRAVIS: (creepily) Nuts. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: Okay. I guess-- 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: -- that's all I can probably do. 
MATT: With that, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. So we're going, we're going to try and get to this corner. 
SAM: Yeah, those trees over there are dubious, according to the wildlife here. 
MATT: Where you going? 
TRAVIS: Can I use 80 feet? I'm going to run the edge of the map, so I'm going to come along this way and then-- 
SAM: Oh, other way around. 
MARISHA: Other way I think. 
MATT: Oh, this way? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, this way. 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. Yeah. I'll stop here. 
MATT: Okay. Then can I touch the ground here and use Grim Psychometry-- 
SAM: Touch grass! 
TRAVIS: -- to see if I get a vibe on anything that has been placed here? Specifically I'd "recall information about the sinister or tragic history of an object or an area." I get advantage on a history check, intelligence. 
MATT: Okay. So Grim Psychometry is a-- The best reads take time to really suffuse yourself in the space. 
TRAVIS: Mm. 
MATT: If you want to do it quickly, you can go for it, but it's going to be a high DC to try and gather information. But you can give it a shot! 
LIAM: Nat 20? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not? 
LIAM: Let's fucking go. 
TRAVIS: You only live once. I get advantage on it. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: ♪ History ♪ 21? 
MATT: 21. 
TRAVIS: 19, 20, 21. 
MATT: Okay. You dig your claws in the ground and find a bit of buried ruin there, and as you touch it, you get a quick flash of the ruins still constructed high up. You can see stones falling from the sky, smashing into the sides of walls. You can see robed fey elves looking around as they're grabbing scrolls, and wordlessly, you're not hearing anything, you see one of them giving orders. You see them taking things and burying them and hiding them in things around here. You get the sense that they were trying to make sure things that were important were not found. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's like Krypton or some shit. Okay. Does that count as an action, Grim Psychometry? 
MATT: Yeah, to get that read. 
TRAVIS: Okay, then I will go over-- Yeah, I'll just-- Yeah. If that's my action, I'll just stay there. I'll leave that little area of vegetation alone. 
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go, Chet? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: At the end of your turn-- 
TRAVIS: Blood Curse of Binding, Bloated Agony, Blood Curse of Binding. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: Laudna. 
SAM: (gasps) 
MARISHA: W-What? 
MATT: You, as you're looking up there on the side, you watch something drop down from the branches of the tree behind where Imogen had stepped away. 
TRAVIS: The squirrel lied. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah. You see this tiny-- 
MARISHA: Drop down? 
MATT: -- maybe foot and a half tall, hunched, lithe-looking, humanoid fey creature. Elongated ears, a smooth front to its face, and it drops down quietly, and it's looking off past the direction past the stone. 
LAURA: It's one of those speedy guys. 
MATT: It's going to (whoosh) and it runs at an intense speed, not unlike the speed that you saw Ashton with. (extremely rapid footfalls) It darts past everybody. 
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh shit. 
MARISHA: Can I call it out? 
MATT: Huh? 
MARISHA: Can I call it out? 
MATT: You can in a second. But it's so fast that it gets right to you and as you're backing away from this, all of a sudden you hear (rapid approach) and see it leaping for the branch in your grasp. 
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, I may have a thing. Yeah. 
MATT: Go ahead and make a contested strength check. 
TALIESIN: Okay, hold on. 
MATT: Which you have advantage on because you are raging. 
TALIESIN: I do. I'll also say that because I don't provoke opportunity attacks, that doesn't help. Okay, contested strength roll. 
SAM: Matt doesn't know-- 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: -- which one of us is-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: I don't know, unless they text me and tell me. 
TALIESIN: That's not-- 
TRAVIS: Unless it's Ashley. 
SAM: Unless we text you and tell you. 
TALIESIN: -- great, a 10. 
SAM: She was texting. You were texting. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he told her to. 
TALIESIN: It's not great, 10. 
MATT: 10. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: And me. 
MATT: (snatch) It snatches the branch from your hand, and with the rest of its movement-- 
LAURA: Oh, it got it? 
LIAM: We got to run! 
MATT: -- starts darting off this way. 
LAURA: Shit, it's fast. 
MARISHA: I still can't say anything? 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: Let me see movement here. Oh yeah, it's got a lot of movement. 
LAURA: Can we see it? Do we see it? 
MATT: You all see this (rapid travel) scoot by. 
TALIESIN: Motherfucker! 
MATT: "(devious laugh)" Yep, and it leaps up onto here and then darts down out of sight for the rest of you. 
LAURA: Get it, Chet. 
MATT: Over in that area. 
SAM: It's trying to get our thing before we-- 
TALIESIN: Grab it! Don't punch it. 
TRAVIS: It took it from us. 
SAM: Oh, he took it already? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Shit. 
TRAVIS: We think. 
MARISHA: It's my turn now, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: I go: We've got a runner! And I-- Shit. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Get ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run ♪ 
LAURA: You shit? 
MARISHA: Yeah, I shit. 
TALIESIN: I'm calling that an attack, too-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ All I want to do is have some fun ♪ 
MARISHA: I saw which direction he went. I'm going to send Pâté over there. 
MATT: Pâté can fly how far? 
MARISHA: 50 feet or 60 feet? 
SAM: (like Pâté) Ooh! 
MARISHA: What is his-- 40 feet fly speed. 
MATT: 40 will get him up to the top of here. 
MARISHA: Can I see through his eyes and see him? 
MATT: You can, yes. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: (Pâté) "I got him!" 
MARISHA: Chetney! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MARISHA: Chetney, he's right below Pâté on the wall. 
MATT: You see Pâté going like, "Hey, hey, hey, hey!" 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Okay, it's just my turn. 
MARISHA: Um. Wait, I know, damn it. I'm going to, I still have Spider Climb up. I'm going to jump over to this other wall. 
MATT: Over here? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Make an athletics check. 
MARISHA: Make an athletics check? 
MATT: Yeah. There's a little (grunts). 
LAURA: You can do it, Laudna. 
MARISHA: Ooh, it is a natural 19. So-- 
MATT: Without issue. 
MARISHA: 16. 
MATT: (whooshing) (laughter) 
MARISHA: I skitter over. (skittering) 
MATT: 25, 30 gets you there. 
SIRI: Here's what I found. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
LIAM: Did you find a branch? 
MATT: Here's what you found. 
MARISHA: Do I have him--? 
TRAVIS: Michelle Branch. 
MARISHA: Kind of-- Can I see him? 
MATT: You cannot, unfortunately. You can see him through Pâté, but that's about it. But you've dropped your vision from him to get-- 
TRAVIS: What a good Pâté mini, Matt. 
LAURA: It really is. 
MATT: That was a fan sent one, actually. 
TRAVIS: Awesome. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Can I-- Shit. 
TRAVIS: I don't know, can you? 
MARISHA: Because I can get-- Fuck. 
MATT: Whoever you are, you're awesome. I'll have to look at the notes again. 
MARISHA: Can Pâté dash to get up to him for his action or something? 
TRAVIS: He's right above. 
MATT: I'll allow it. We're playing loose with this right now. Okay, so you can, like-- 
MARISHA: He grabs onto him, and through Pâté, I'm going to do Shocking Grasp. 
MATT: Shocking Grasp, all right. 
LIAM: Will it-- 
TALIESIN: It might hurt the branch. 
SAM: It's worth it. 
TALIESIN: It's really not. 
MARISHA: Is he wearing armor made of metal? 
LIAM: Is that a save? 
LAURA: I thought that was part of it. That's the teeniest little-- 
MATT: That's the branch, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're going to hurt the branch. 
LIAM: So if it's a save and it fails the save, is it going to take two-- 
ASHLEY: Because it only has one more hit. 
LAURA: That's true! 
LIAM: It's going to be obliterated. 
LAURA: It's going to kill the branch. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's going to kill the branch. 
MARISHA: Will lightning kill the branch? 
TRAVIS: Well, yeah! 
LIAM: Is it a save? 
TRAVIS: Lightning kills everything. 
LAURA: If he's holding it-- 
MARISHA: It's a-- 
TRAVIS: Paper, rock, scissors, lightning's a bitch. 
MARISHA: But then what do I do with him? 
TALIESIN: You've got to grapple. 
LIAM: You trust your teammates. 
TALIESIN: Trust everyone else to handle it. 
MATT: I mean, you don't know. It's up to you. What do you want to do? 
TRAVIS: Hit him with that real sticky candy. 
MATT: What hurt the branch previously was a-- 
SAM: Fire. 
TALIESIN: Poison. 
LAURA: It was poison. 
MATT: -- a spray in an area. 
LAURA: This is-- I think Shocking Grasp-- 
LIAM: A spell effect. 
MARISHA: We don't know! 
LAURA: -- would for sure. 
MATT: We don't know. What do you want to do? 
LAURA: I think it would hurt it. 
ASHLEY: It's also blanched and petrified already, so maybe nothing would happen to it. 
SAM: How do you know so much about these branches? 
MARISHA: I also used necrotic energy around it-- 
ASHLEY: I don't. 
MARISHA: -- to melt the plants, and that didn't hurt it. 
MATT: True. 
TRAVIS: It was in a box, right? 
LAURA: No, it was on top of the box. 
MARISHA: It was on top of the box. 
LAURA: But that's necrotic energy. 
ASHLEY: What's on top of the box? 
MATT: What do you want to do? 
SAM and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: Electricity. 
SAM: What's near the box? 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: But it's in a bag. Okay. Well, then-- 
SAM: Do you trust us? 
MARISHA: Of course! 
SAM: Then put down the gun. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) (laughter) 
SAM: Put down the gun. 
ASHLEY: Put it down! 
MARISHA: All right, well, I'll tell Pâté: Hold onto him for dear life and keep screaming until Chetney gets there. 
MATT: "Okay (strained grunt)" Are you trying to get him to grapple? 
LAURA: (grunts like Pâté) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a strength check for Pâté. 
MARISHA: I guess can Pâté try and grapple the stick out of his hand? 
MATT: Sure. To pull it away from him? Sure. Let's do a contested strength check. 
MARISHA: That's even going to be way more difficult. No. I just want him to hold on. I just want him to be-- 
SAM: Hold on! 
TRAVIS: Or just track him, I feel. 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Just track him. I just want him to hold on. 
MATT: Sure. All right. Finishing your go. That brings us to Orym, with Fearne on deck. 
SAM: I'm just going to finish-- 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, wait! 
SAM: I'm just going to finish your turn for you. 
MARISHA: Wait. But I haven't done my action, right? 
MATT: Well, if you're sending him over there-- 
TRAVIS: Have you not by this point? 
MATT: All right. So what are you going to do? 
MARISHA: Well, I was going to do another Wither and Bloom to clear some of-- 
LAURA: Yay. Do it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Go ahead. 
MARISHA: Yes. So Pâté is hanging out and watching him. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: I'll do another Wither and Bloom right here to clear all this shit. 
MATT: Okay. These burn away. This burns away. This burns away. What's the radius on it? 
MARISHA: It's not big. It's 10-foot radius. 
MATT: 10-foot radius? Yeah. So it burns off that point there. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: That stays there, but everything (flames crackles) opening up the area, making it safer to pass through, but you don't see anything in particular that catches your attention beyond that. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That's a great thing to do. 
MATT: All right. Orym. 
LAURA: So Wither and Bloom, that's the best. 
LIAM: Okay. I have a passive perception of 31. So I would like to think that I saw Ashton go, "Huh," and the little thing zip out that gate. 
MATT: Oh yeah, you watched it. 
LIAM: Through the fire. 
MATT: Through the flames. 
TALIESIN: Motherfucker. 
MATT: Let's say sure. 
LIAM: But I also have a view over there of when it popped through that door. So Orym sees those spiked vines. Those don't look good. So I'm going to run and zip through the flames. I'm going to jump through the fire. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Do I see a stick in the fire as I go through? 
MATT: You do not see a stick in the fire. You do take-- 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: -- five points of fire damage as you leap through the flames. 
LIAM: But I'm resistant because I'm a doppelganger. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Then, I'm going to use movement and action if I have to to bolt through that door. 
MATT: This one? 
LIAM: And chase after the little speedy. 
MATT: Okay. You dart through, and you catch up to him right there. 
LIAM: I'm actually going to move past him a bit, five or 10 feet, if I can. Let's say I'm standing on that stone structure. 
MATT: Yeah. Here? 
LIAM: I use a bonus action to shoot at the stick with Grasping Vine and yank it out of its grasp. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: With Seedling. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: He's earning my trust. 
MATT: All right, yeah. Sure enough (whoosh) you grab the branch. 
MARISHA: He's playing the long game. 
MATT: That is yours you can hand Liam the sheet. 
SAM: Grabbing the branch so he can break it later. 
LIAM: Zoink. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
LAURA: Did he get it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Laudna, what dead animal did you wear at the ball in Jrusar? 
MARISHA: I think it was a dead ferret or something. 
LIAM: Close! 
MARISHA: Close? 
LAURA: It was like a stoat. 
MARISHA: Oh, no. It was a fox. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It was a dead fox. 
LAURA: It was a fox? 
TRAVIS: A stoat. 
MARISHA: A stoat. 
LIAM: That's it. End of my turn. 
TRAVIS: Stoats are cute. 
MATT: All righty. Finishing Orym's go. Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: All right. So what I would like to do-- 
TRAVIS: Confess. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I would like to cast Stone Shape on-- (silly accent) Stone Shape. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Uncut jams (gems). So that whole area of bramble. 
MATT: Right here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yes. 
TRAVIS: Folding under the pressure. 
MARISHA: I know. 
ASHLEY: I would like to just so I don't have to touch any of the vines or the bramble or anything, just move the stone so it falls away and just goes away. 
MATT: Okay. So this section of ruin here sinks underground. 
ASHLEY: So I can see underneath it. 
LIAM: Whoa. 
LAURA: Cool. 
SAM: Where I was standing? 
MATT: It sinks underneath you. 
MARISHA: Where there's a hidden branch. 
LAURA: FCG is gone. 
MATT: The bush stays there. 
SAM: Oh, cool. 
LAURA: Yeah, it does. 
MATT: Because you can't shape the creatures. 
ASHLEY: Damn it! 
MATT: But you do end up revealing all the ground beneath it, and this area now is unobstructed beyond the grove. 
ASHLEY: Well, I cleared up some space for people to walk through. 
SAM: Oh, that's so helpful, Fearne. Thanks. 
MATT: As the (gentle rumbles) as it shifts and moves-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: -- the bush that was right in front of you shakes. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: Part of that opens up as a creature darts out-- 
SAM: (screams) 
MATT: -- from within. 
LAURA: Oh no. Wings (whooshes) you look up and see what looks to be an owl, just a regular owl, and it's like (whooshes). 
SAM: Oh. Okay. 
MATT: (hoots) 
LIAM: Should be fine. 
MATT: Up above you. 
SAM: I don't like birds. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Its jaw (creaks) opens up and a tentacle (splattery impact) whips out towards you. 
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and LAURA: (scream) 
MATT: I need you to make a dexterity saving throw. 
TRAVIS: No! Tentacle owl? Fuck that! 
SAM: I'm lucky with those. 14. 
MATT: 14. It grabs you, and you are-- 
ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: -- you are restrained, and it's going to start flying this way. (scrapes) 
SAM: No! 
MATT: That far. It can only get that-- Actually, it cannot get quite that far with its movement, but it'll get about there. As it drags you, I'm going to put a little thing here for today. There we go. You get dragged. 
SAM: (screams) 
MATT: (heavy impact) Right over to here, and it's trying to pull you towards the nearest bramble cluster. 
SAM: I'm going to hit it into reverse. 
MARISHA: Towards the nearest-- 
SAM: (whirring) 
MATT: It's like grinding you. It's tugging and pulling. So with that, Fearne, any more movement you want to do on your turn? 
ASHLEY: I will try to start moving toward-- Wait a minute. So all the bramble and everything is still there? Vines, all of it? 
MATT: Yeah. It's just the stone went away. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I will just move-- 
LAURA: Your tongue. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'll stay. 
LAURA: Stop it. 
MATT: Okay. Fearne stays. 
ASHLEY: I'll stay. 
MATT: Ashton, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
MARISHA: Do we see, with FCG being grappled, that his what would be hard metal exterior skids a little bit? 
SAM: Mm, because it's spongey because it's not real. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Wait. What are you looking for? 
LIAM: Does FCG feel hard as metal? 
SAM: My illusory body, because I'm not a real robot, is-- 
LIAM: Or do they feel fleshed on? 
MARISHA: Yeah, is he soft and squishy like a doppelganger would be trying to pretend to be a robit? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Come on. Come on. Come on. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
TRAVIS: Ham and cheese. 
MARISHA: Okay. 20 total. 
MATT: 20 total? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You have no idea. 
MARISHA: Aw. 
SAM: Whoa, with a 20? Because I'm so good. 
MATT: It's heavy fog around, you're at a full distance, and it's a very minute detail. You're not sure. 
LIAM: Oh, I thought you were feeling. 
TRAVIS: I've only got one branch. 
MATT: No, she's over here. 
LIAM: Ah, I thought it was a squeeze. 
TRAVIS: I suck. 
LIAM: A Charmin squeeze. 
MATT: A squeeze would be different. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: At least it's just a bird that's got me. 
MATT: Or not. Doppelgangers take the shape of whatever it is they're-- 
SAM: Those aren't bad! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Don't squeeze the Charmin. 
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sakes. I'm going to fucking shake my head and I'm going to roadrunner my way over to-- I assume FCG's being held by a giant tongue? 
MATT: Like a giant tongue with a talon at the end of it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to try and-- Safely, I'm going to try and not provoke any-- Is this provoked attacks, or is this just setting off a trap? So if I can-- 
TRAVIS: From the flowers? 
TALIESIN: -- if I can move without provoking an opportunity attack, would that-- You have no idea. 
MATT: Likely, it's not a creature. It's just a trap. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So they're not-- 
MATT: You would probably gather if you moved quickly enough, it wouldn't get an opportunity attack on you or anything. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I wouldn't trigger it necessarily if I was fast enough. 
MATT: Not that you know of. 
TALIESIN: Fuck a nut. Okay. How far is this fucking-- 
LIAM: Guys, we've got one broken stick. We're doing great. 
LAURA: I know. We really need to step up our game. 
TALIESIN: So I'm going to burn another Hyper Rage. Fuck this. 
SAM: (gravely) Hyper Rage. 
TALIESIN: There we go. 
LAURA: ♪ (deep drum beats) ♪ 
TALIESIN: I am going to, as safely as possible, make my way, avoiding these things-- 
MARISHA: He says new shit every game. 
TALIESIN: -- including and then moving between, I think those plants will attack, so I'm going to try and go out and around it so that I don't-- 
MATT: From here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I don't hit the plant or the fire. 
LAURA: I'm going to get up and walk around because everybody else has. 
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to go and I'm going to take a-- 
ASHLEY: I know. I feel like I want to do it, too. 
TALIESIN: -- a bit of a jumping attack, and I'm going to try and slam that fucking tongue. 
MATT: Like running this way and then jumping in the air towards it? 
TALIESIN: Oh, no. I'm going to hit the tongue right in the middle. I'm going to come down and try and use the sharp end of the hammer on the tongue. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I wouldn't worry too long. I'm not going to be there forever. 
MATT: All right. So roll an attack. 
TALIESIN: Reckless Attack. Here we go. 
MARISHA: You smell good, though. 
TRAVIS: Shit. That's good. 
LAURA: Do I? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's a 24 to hit. 
LIAM: That can't be Laura. 
MATT: 24 to hit hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
LAURA: Aah! 
TALIESIN: That's 19 points of damage. 
MATT: 19 points of damage. You bash the tongue so hard and slamming it into the stone beneath you that it splits and it (slobbery slithers) pulls it back into its mouth and (screeching) 
SAM: Ah! 
MATT: Looks like it's flying angry, but also is injured by it. 
LIAM: Mister Owl. 
SAM: Thanks, Ashton. 
MATT: You are no longer restrained. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to point at it, and then I'm going to use what remains of my 80 feet to try and get to the other side of that wall. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So run underneath it. 
MATT: (skitters) Through this way? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, over there, and see if anything-- 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: -- looks interesting. 
MATT: You run past the bramble wall. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: As you rush past, a tether reaches out to you. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Can I attack it as well since I still have one more attack? 
MATT: You can, but it's going to-- Well, it's going to reach out for you first. 
TALIESIN: Reach out first. 
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw and then you can try and attack it. 
TALIESIN: I have advantage on that as well. Yay! A 17. 
MATT: 17? Okay. You dart past it without it grabbing you. Are you going to attack it or keep going? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to say as I'm going, I'm going to take a swing at it as well. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: As I run by, since I'm already doing that. Yeah, a 25. 
MATT: That hits. 
TALIESIN: All right, so let's. 18 points of damage. 
MATT: 18 points of damage. 
MARISHA: Just Ashley. 
MATT: 18 points of damage. 
SAM: Just Ashley so far. 
LAURA: Yeah, Ashley is-- 
ASHLEY: Me? 
MATT: You bash the brambles and part of it splinters and breaks, but it's still holding firm where it is, but it's taken a heavy hit. But you can move past if you want. 
TALIESIN: I want to move past it. 
MATT: All right. You dart over and now land on the opposite side. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to look around for anything interesting or weird with my bonus action. 
MATT: All right. Make a perception check. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: But the DC is high because it's just a cursory glance. 
TALIESIN: That's fine. 13. Eh. 
MATT: 13. Nothing at the moment. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA: I don't think it's Liam. 
MATT: All righty. Finishing Ashton's go, Imogen, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
LAURA: I'm up. 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: I was going to show my shoulder-- 
LAURA: I am going to-- 
SAM: -- but it doesn't stretch that much. 
LAURA: Is that thing still in the air and going to attack us if we go over there? 
MATT: It is. I mean, it's still in the air. 
MARISHA: Just her collarbone. 
TALIESIN: It just has a hurt tongue. 
ASHLEY: I know he did it! (laughs) 
LAURA: Ooh. I have an idea. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Fly on myself. 
SAM: (Transatlantic accent) Fly, see! 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
LAURA: So yeah. I'm going to cast Fly. Then, I'm going to-- This is dumb. I'm going to fly towards the creature. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: As I get close to it, I'm going to Quicken a spell and cast Shocking Grasp on it. 
MATT: All right. (whooshing) As you fly towards it in this direction, roll an attack. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's great. 25. 
MATT: 25. Go ahead and roll damage. 
LAURA: Um. ♪ Do do do do do do ♪ Hm. 15 points of shocking damage. 
MATT: It tries to fly away as you reach out your Ruidusborn arcane talents and rend its body apart with a flash of electrical energy. (sparks) It turns to ash in midair and it cascades down in burnt clusters of stone and dust. 
LAURA: Awesome. From the air, do I see anything down on the ground? 
MATT: You can make a cursory glance with a perception check, if you'd like. 
LAURA: 10. 
MATT: 10. Not immediately. But you have at least a vantage point from up here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. Finishing your go, FCG, you're up, with Chetney on deck. 
SAM: Oh, and with no threats around me, I will-- Where's Fearnie? She's behind me. 
MATT: Fearne is over here. 
LIAM: She's not here. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: I will cast Enhance Ability on myself. Now that I just saw an owl, I will grant myself Owl's Wisdom. 
MATT: Oh, inspiration to you. Lovely. 
SAM: Yes, and then, I will turn around and go up to Fearne and say: Fearne, just tell me. It's just you and me here. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Can I trust you? 
ASHLEY: You can absolutely trust me. 
SAM: Insight check. 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
SAM: With advantage. 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) 
LIAM: Scanners on. 
SAM: Well, that's cocked. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
SAM: Come on. Come on. No. (laughter) 
SAM: 16. 
LIAM: That's not bad. 
MATT: 16. I mean-- 
LAURA: She's a really good liar. 
MATT: What you see is what you get. 
MARISHA: Look at Matt's face. Look at Matt's face. 
SAM: There's no rolls? There's no nothing? 
MATT: I rolled back here for her using either persuasion or-- 
ASHLEY: It's not me. It's not. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. You can't even say it! 
ASHLEY: I'm laughing because I'm uncomfortable. 
TRAVIS: Mac and cheese. 
ASHLEY: It's not me. 
MATT: Fearne seems like she's being pretty honest. 
MATT: Look at that mouth. 
SAM: Okay then. I trust you. 
MARISHA: Look at Matt, though. Matt knows. 
SAM: I trust you, then. If you're saying-- 
ASHLEY: Can I trust you? Insight check. 
SAM: 100 percent. On your turn. 
MATT: When it comes back to your turn, you can. 
TRAVIS: Oh, defensive. 
MATT: On your turn, you can do that. 
TRAVIS: Defensive. 
LIAM: (like Fearne) Oops, all doppelgangers. (laughter) 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: All right. It's me. 
MATT: That finish your turn, FCG? 
TRAVIS: Mew, mew. 
ASHLEY: Meow meow. 
SAM: Do I have anything else? 
MATT: You can make a cursory thing, because to make an insight check on somebody, to read all their stuff, has to take a moment to talk and look for them. So that's a pretty big roll. You can have a bonus action, if you wanted to. 
SAM: Bonus actions? Oh my god. Do I even have any bonus actions? 
MATT: There's spells, or you can make a glance at something nearby, if you want to try and go for a high DC search. 
SAM: You know what? On one of those pillars over there, you said that there was some shimmery stuff. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm going to look for where that shimmery stuff was and see if I can see anything more-- 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
SAM: -- of what I saw before. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
SAM: Too late. 
MATT: You can't do that out of turn, unfortunately. 
SAM: But I got a 19. 
MATT: 19. 
ASHLEY: See? It's me. 
MATT: Not bad. You can see there are a number of vines over here that are shimmery. You can see that this bramble wall here is a little shimmery. Those are the two things that you can catch in the vicinity. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: It ain't me. 
SAM: Okay. Imogen, maybe-- 
LAURA: Hm? 
SAM: Nothing. Fearne, I think it's one of those two things over there. 
ASHLEY: I do, too. 
LAURA: Why did you say my name and then you said nothing? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Say my name, say my name ♪ 
SAM: I don't know if it's you. 
LAURA: It's me. 
SAM: How come you spent the last turn trying to kill an owl and not searching for what we need? 
LAURA: Because I was trying to keep it from attacking anyone else. Really? Also, I thought it'd be really cool to fly and attack something at the same time. 
SAM: Okay. I believe that. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn. Chetney, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
TRAVIS: Let's see. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. 
LAURA: It would totally attack us if we went and searched in that area. I was trying to keep it from attacking anything else in the area. 
TRAVIS: Orym, you got this? 
LAURA: I was going to search, but it would attack me! 
LIAM: The little guy? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm going to keep it away from him. 
SAM: Okay. Okay. 
TRAVIS: How would I figure out which one of these fucking trees is the-- 
TALIESIN: Are you a good tree-- 
TALIESIN and LAURA: -- or a bad tree? 
TRAVIS: Can I see the little creature that he snagged it from? 
MATT: You can see the edge of him. He's like "(growling) What?" 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Which makes me think it's not that way. 
LIAM: By the way, Chet, what was Eshteross' best recipe for dessert? 
MATT: It's not your turn. Chetney. 
TRAVIS: He's fine. He's got this. That was definitely suspicious. 
MATT: No, you can ask him, if you want. It's fine. 
MARISHA: It was a cookie reaction. 
TALIESIN: Kind of half-baked as a question, really. 
MARISHA: Roll for cookies. Half-baked? (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Can I take out a-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Smokin'. 
TRAVIS: I'll come in this way, and I'll go around the pillar. Can I get on this side of the pillar, or do I need to come on that side because Pâté's over there? 
MATT: You can go under Pâté. 
TRAVIS: Would I still be within melee of that thing? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Great. 
LIAM: Yeah, I honestly don't know. 
TRAVIS: I use my bonus action to scrape my claws against myself and ignite. (flames crackling) 
MATT: Flames? All right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll take three hybrid claw strikes against the little thing. 27? 
MATT: 27 hits. 
TRAVIS: A 19? 
MATT: 19 also hits. 
MARISHA: Damn. Damn! 
TRAVIS: Jesus, 29. 
MATT: 29. You charge around and it looks at you. "(surprised growl and hiss)" You slam it once and it falls limp in your claw. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: But you're already-- In the second, the moment of the second strike, and then slam it up, and it hits the wall, and spatters and then-- 
TRAVIS: No problem. 
MATT: -- burns cinders across where it was. 
TRAVIS: Four points of damage for me. Okay. I still have 35 feet of movement, so I will run up-- 
MATT: Well, hold on. You moved 50 feet to get there. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. Oh, so 30 feet of movement. because I have boots of speed up for-- 
MATT: Oh, that's right! That's right, you do! 
TRAVIS: -- 10 minutes. 
MATT: So yeah, you still got movement. 
TRAVIS: Can I go over to this tree? 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Can we say I used two of my three swipes, and I can use my third one to take a swipe at the trunk of the tree? 
MATT: Sure, go for it. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Trunk swipe! 
TALIESIN: How dare you. 
TRAVIS: 21. 
MATT: 21, that hits. Roll damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Oh, it hits? 
TALIESIN: It's a tree. 
SAM: Well yeah, but I wanted it to pass-- 
TRAVIS: Seven and four. 
SAM: -- right through because it's an illusion. 
TRAVIS: 11. 11 points of damage, four of those being fire! 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Fire! 
MATT: You strike the tree, and the flames hit and the whole tree shakes a little bit, and some leaves fall. Yep. 
SAM: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: It's not this one. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That's my turn. 
MATT: Okay. Finishing that go, that brings us to-- Well, the guy's dead. Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: Shoot. 
SAM: "Laudna." 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes, correct. Laudna is going to-- 
SAM: Wow, this is a new stance. (laughter) 
MARISHA: She's going to-- 
ASHLEY: Full perch. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: -- once again, go (rapid arachnoid footsteps) Spider Climbing, Spider Climbing. 
MATT: It'll get you to about there. 
LAURA: Spider! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Spider. 
SAM: Spite-a. (spider) 
SAM: Gibbity-gib- gib-gib. 
MATT: It's move down, up, and over. 
TALIESIN: Hooah! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MARISHA: Can I do-- 
TALIESIN: Thank you, drama child. 
MARISHA: Wither and, another Wither and Bloom right here? 
MATT: Yes, you can. 
MARISHA: In this chonk? 
MATT: (whooshes) 
MARISHA: And does it fuck with that guy? 
MATT: (destructive magic) 
TALIESIN: Got some high school drama action right there. 
MATT: That all withers away. 
LAURA: I love this spell! 
TALIESIN: It's such a good spell. 
ASHLEY: It is a good spell. 
MARISHA: Nothing though? 
TRAVIS: Herbal Essences: Wither and Bloom. 
MATT: Nothing at the moment, no. 
TALIESIN: This is like full contact Minecraft right now. 
MARISHA: Pâté! 
MATT: "What, what? What do you need?" 
MARISHA: Go fly over to FCG and see if he's squishy. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You going to send him across the map? 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: That's some sus activity! 
MARISHA: Yeah, I just-- Oh! Oh! Oh! You mean, for the one who might be sus? 
MATT: All right. (laughter) 
MATT: As you're both looking at each other, eyeing each other, you hear, "Geronimo!" (laughter) 
MATT: As FCG dive bombs right towards you. 
SAM: Another bird! 
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack for FCG. (laughs) Or for him against, Pâté against FCG. 
MARISHA: But I don't want him to attack, I just-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Do it. 
MATT: It's an attack roll to check him. 
LAURA: Do it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: This is the least trustworthy thing you've ever done to me! 
TALIESIN: That can't be true. 
MARISHA: But FCG would-- Son of a bitch. Wait, what is happening now? 
SAM: Just roll the dice. 
MARISHA: Okay, I don't see his attack modifier. Oh, it's not great. 
TRAVIS: Probably just minus two, right? 
LAURA: Attack modifier is minus two? 
MARISHA: No, that's strength. Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: You guys. 
LAURA: ♪ Oh my god ♪ 
LAURA and ASHLEY: ♪ Oh my god, you guys ♪ (laughter) 
SAM: Is that a real song? 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
SAM: That's a real song? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, "Legally Blonde," right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: 14. 
MATT: What's your AC? 
MARISHA: 14. 
SAM: 18. 
MATT: 18, instinctually, you pull out of the way, and Pâté scrapes across FCG and lands. "Oi, I don't know, I didn't feel anything!" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) I don't know! 
MARISHA: He didn't feel squishy? 
MATT: Well, he missed. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MARISHA: But you know Pâté. He's not just another bird, he's my familiar. 
SAM: (laughs) Oh jesus! 
LAURA: What is happening? 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
MARISHA: What? 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LAURA: I wasn't sus-- 
MATT: Orym, you're up. 
LAURA: -- of you, Laudna, until that moment. (laughter) 
LIAM: I have no idea. 
MARISHA: Laudna is losing her mind! 
ASHLEY: You have no idea what Orym would do, because you're a doppelganger? 
LIAM: That's right, doppelganger. I jump-- (laughter) 
LIAM: I flea jump to the tip here, and race over to these bushes, and search through them. 
MATT: Make an investigation check for me. 
SAM: Start at the tip, go to the bush? Got it. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Callback! (laughter) 
LIAM: I don't know, it's not really Orym's MO. (laughter) 
LIAM: Investigation? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Okay. Oh, natural 20. (cheering) 
ASHLEY: What a doppelganger thing to do. 
MATT: You pore through the bushes, and-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: To roll a crit? (laughs) 
MATT: You pore through the bushes-- 
ASHLEY: So sorry about this. 
MATT: With a natural 20 for a total of? 
LIAM: 21. 
SAM: Lost it. 
MATT: 21, still, it's too good. You push through, and you don't see anything that resembles what you're looking for, but you do see within there a slightly glowing, a wasp hive of-- 
LIAM: Cool. 
MATT: -- very familiar wasps. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: However, because of your super high roll, you catch it in time without disturbing it, and slowly back away. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LIAM: (parts leaves) 
TRAVIS: Damn it. 
LIAM: (closes leaves) 
MATT: Yep. (laughs) 
SAM: It's the bush or the tree? 
TRAVIS: The bush. 
MARISHA: The bush all the way over there. Hmm. What the fuck? 
LIAM: Will it damage this branch if I slide it into my leather armor? 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: Then I free my hands up, and stick it in. 
MATT: You got it. Okay. 
TALIESIN: It'll still take damage when you take damage. 
MATT: You still have a little bit of movement, I think. If you want to move. 
LIAM: I understand, but no one's going to gank it out of my hand. 
SAM: Do you want to move any more? 
MATT: Do you want to move any more? 
LIAM: I think that's it. I mean, was that 30 feet of movement? 
MATT: 30 feet-- (counting) 
LIAM: My action was to-- 
MATT: Actually, yeah, that was that about it. 
LIAM: -- investigate the bush. 
MATT: Okay. All right. Fearne, you're up. 
LAURA: Wither and Bloom is necrotic? 
MATT: With Ashton on deck. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Don't you have Locate? 
ASHLEY: Thank god I have this prepared. 
SAM: I do. 
ASHLEY: So, the plants and all the stuff-- 
SAM: I can use it. 
ASHLEY: -- in front of me that didn't really do anything with the Stone Shape. 
TRAVIS: What a shady motherfucker. 
MARISHA: A hundred percent. 
ASHLEY: Wait, so you-- 
MATT: But you watched FCG walk through it and was unharmed, but no one searched them, no one's done anything to them. They're just there on the ground. 
ASHLEY: Okay-- 
LIAM: So we got one doppelganger here. 
ASHLEY: Those over there, I'm going to Speak with Plants. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: What a useful thing to do. 
MATT: So, you cast Speak with Plants. 
ASHLEY: Hey. 
MATT: "What?" "What?" 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Hi!" "Hi!" 
ASHLEY: Do you have a branch underneath you that you're covering? 
MATT: "Not here." "Not here. You?" "You?" "No." "No, how about you?" "No, not me." "No." "No." 
ASHLEY: Are you telling the truth? 
MATT: "I don't know how to talk otherwise." "Right, right, me neither." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: "Have you lied?" "What's a lie?" 
TRAVIS: What is truth? 
MATT: "I don't know." 
LIAM: Lies! 
MATT: "Yes." "Yes." 
ASHLEY: All right, can you ask some friends around, and see if there's any, you know, branch hiding anywhere within a-- Let me see how far I can do this. 
SAM: I think it's just a touch. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I can do this for 10 minutes. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Yeah, you can keep talking to other plants if you want to. 
ASHLEY: So I'll walk around, and keep talking to some plants. 
MATT: Okay, they're both like, "Well, we only have a few friends." "We don't get around very much." "You know, kind of stationary--" (both plants) "-- being plants." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: "We'll go talk to the friends over there. Oh god, they're burning!" (laughter) 
MATT: They look over at the plants crackling over here! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Don't look over there, don't look over there! 
MATT: (plants screaming, horrified) 
ASHLEY: It's okay. Look at me, look at me, look at me. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Their mortality is suddenly within grasp. (laughter) 
LAURA: (plants screaming) 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to pass through you, if you don't mind. 
MATT: (plants whimpering) "It's okay, it's okay." "I just wasn't ready!" "I just wasn't ready!" "It's okay. (gentle shushing)" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It's all right, it's all right. 
MATT: As you all wade through, there's the bramble wall this way-- 
ASHLEY: Yes, let me talk to the bramble wall there, may I? 
MATT: Okay, yeah, you can walk in there. 
LAURA: Yeah, that wall. 
LIAM: There other side-- 
ASHLEY: Hey. 
MATT: "What?" 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: That is some 'tude. Do you have a little branch? A white branch underneath you? A blanched--? 
MATT: "No, but you look mighty tasty. Come closer, come on." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: "Let's give you a hug." 
MARISHA: Ugh. 
ASHLEY: I'll give you a hug, if you got something in there? Can you move your legs? 
TRAVIS: Which one is she talking to? 
ASHLEY: Your bottom bits? 
MATT: This one here. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) "(uncertain noises)" 
ASHLEY: Let me just see, can I peek? 
MARISHA: Who can be creepiest. 
MATT: Do you come forward to peek in? 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
MATT: All right, you step up. As you come closer, it goes, "Perfect, perfect." The vines (whooshing). The ones that you saw try and reach out, and lash at Ashton also lash out to you, make a dexterity saving throw for me. 
SAM: Fearne, no! 
ASHLEY: It's fine. 
LAURA: (Cockney) She's going sacrifice herself! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh my! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: 11. 
TRAVIS: No, you cahn't! 
MATT: 11. (whooshes) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: You get restrained again as the vines wrap around you. 
ASHLEY: Ugh, rude! 
MATT: You take-- Okay. That's 22 points of piercing damage. As it wraps around you, is like, "Come on, just a hug. It's good, we're friends now." 
ASHLEY: I feel around with my hoof, looking, trying to feel if there's a branch underneath. 
MATT: So, a cursory branch, so, all right, make an investigation check-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: -- while restrained. I'll say you have disadvantage on this. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: It's a high DC. 
LIAM: -- sensitive to touch. 
ASHLEY: It's cocked. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Hooves are very sensitive to touch. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
LIAM: (clicking) 
ASHLEY: Okay. Hmm. All right. 13. 
MATT: 13, no idea. 
ASHLEY: Ugh! All right, that's my turn. 
MATT: All right. Ashton, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
ASHLEY: It's fine, just keep looking! 
TALIESIN: (sighs) It's not my bag! I'm going to turn, and I'm going to go back up to that, because that's the one that attacked me, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: The one? I'm going to backtrack just a little bit-- 
ASHLEY: What? 
TALIESIN: -- the way I came. 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Just enough to hit it. 
SAM: I can't look at her anymore. 
ASHLEY: Wait, no, what did I do? 
LIAM: (shushes) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
MATT: Ah jeez. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to look at Fearne. 
ASHLEY: What? (laughs) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I know this is weird, are we cool? Are we cool? 
ASHLEY: Yes! Now?! 
TALIESIN: Are we cool? 
ASHLEY: Now we're having this conversation? Are you for real? 
LIAM: Guys, look, the doppelgangers are fighting. 
TALIESIN: Okay, it might be you, and I'm going to take a-- 
MATT: Take a hit, roll damage. 
MARISHA: Oh, whoa! 
SAM: A hit on her? 
TALIESIN: No, I'm taking a hit on the plant. 
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: If you had said yes, I was going to leave you. 
ASHLEY: I'll try to just-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you had said, yeah-- 
ASHLEY: -- get skinny. 
TALIESIN: I was just going to drop you then. That's 21 to hit. 
MATT: That definitely hits, roll damage. 
SAM: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: Ugh. That's 15 points of damage. (laughter) 
MATT: 15 points of damage. 
LAURA: What if it's you? You're the one that's trying-- 
MATT: Slams a second-- 
LAURA: -- so hard to convince us it's Ashley. 
MATT: -- massive overhead hammer blow into the middle of this bramble, you hear a snapping sound as the central stalk that holds the rest of this wall around breaks, the vines go limp, and the voice, the last thing you hear is it go, "Oh, your friend's an asshole!" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: As the bramble wall vanishes, and you are no longer restrained. 
ASHLEY: Thank you, Ashton. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We'll talk later. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop back-- 
MATT: Drop that. 
TALIESIN: -- and start heading down this way to see if I see anything with the rest of my movement, which is just 40 feet. I'm not going nuts or anything. 
LAURA: But it doesn't look like anything is there. 
MATT: Which will get you about there. So, you move around the bit there, there's another bramble wall, there's a bush, you can see some other clusters of vines, and the tree there, a tree there cresting over the ruins. 
TALIESIN: Just because I'm curious, and I have the thing to spend, I'm going to take a random knock since none of this really matters, at the arch, before I get up to it. I'm going to see how-- 
MATT: Second hit, go for it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to take a second hit at the-- just to see if it's stable or if it falls over or anything. That's not-- those are d6s. Those don't help. That's damage. 
SAM: Something's-- 
TALIESIN: 27. 
MATT: 27. Wham! Roll damage. 
TALIESIN: Oh, where's this when I need it? 22 points of damage. 
MATT: Crack! 
MARISHA: Did you hit the branch-- 
MATT: The center, it breaks inward. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: The whole ruin topples. You back out of the way-- 
TALIESIN: I back up a bit, I back up a bit-- 
MATT: -- as it falls down into a pile of stone ruins around it. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I look around to see if there's anything interesting that that triggered. 
MATT: Nothing immediately, but definitely cleared some of the space. 
TRAVIS: Damn it! 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: How the hell are-- 
TALIESIN: All right, that's my turn. 
TRAVIS: Where are these fucking things? 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
LAURA: Just got to clear the whole map. 
LIAM: The doppelgangers-- 
MATT: Imogen, you're up. 
LIAM: -- going to find the sticks and just break them? 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: FCG, you're on deck. 
LAURA: I am going to-- 
SAM: I am. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Are you telling us your plan out loud? 
LAURA: I have an idea! Wait, can I use two? Can I use sorcery points to do two different effects-- 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. 
LAURA: -- in one turn? Okay. 
MATT: As many-- as long as you have the points for it. 
LAURA: Great. I am going to-- 
MATT: You can even overlap them on one spell if you have enough-- 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to-- What level is this? Okay, I'm going to use a sorcery point to turn Inflict Wounds into double its distance. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Because it's a touch, so I can make it 30 feet away. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LAURA: I'm going to Inflict Wounds on this little shrubbery area-- 
MATT: Right here? 
LAURA: Right there. 
LIAM: A shrubbery! 
LAURA: This little shrubbery area-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: -- with a Twinned Spell as well. 
MATT: Okay, roll an attack-- 
LIAM: Come on. 
MATT: -- for each. 
LIAM: Come on. 
LAURA: ♪ (hums "Duel of the Fates") ♪ 
MATT: You technically would have advantage since they don't move. 
LAURA: (gasps) Natural 20! 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
LIAM: (air horn sound) 
MATT: Awesome. 
LAURA: I have advantage on it? 
MATT: You have advantage on each because they're stationary. 
LAURA: Okay, great, then I'll reroll for this next one. We'll see. Okay, the other one was a 26, so-- 
MATT: Yeah, both hit, so, roll damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Which one is the double? 
LAURA: Oh, the one in front of Fearne. 
MATT: Okay, got you. 
LAURA: So that's 3d10-- 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: -- on each. Hold on, I know what a 10 looks like. One, two, three (mumbled counting). 
MARISHA: I still feel like Taliesin 
LIAM: ♪ Don't hurt the stick ♪ 
MARISHA: -- stepped on the flowers on purpose. 
LAURA: 18 points of damage. 
MATT: 18 points of damage doubled, or that was the double? 
MARISHA: At the beginning of all this. 
LAURA: No, that's 18 points doubled. 
MATT: Doubled. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Ah, (withering sound). This one withers away, as the plants curl back and turn to ash, it leaves-- (cheering) 
LIAM: I told you, I told you, I told you! 
LAURA: You knew it, you knew it! 
ASHLEY: I see it, I see it! 
SAM: It's right in front of Fearne. 
TRAVIS: (like Jamie Tartt) Poop-eh. 
MARISHA: (like Jamie Tartt) Poop-eh. 
LAURA: What about-- The other one would take-- 
LIAM: (like Jamie Tartt) That's poop-eh. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: That is the branch. 
LAURA: Would take 11 points of necrotic damage. 
MATT: Okay. There we go. This one also burns and withers away. Just (slurps) to the ground. 
LAURA: I am going to, for my movement, can I fly down, and grab it, and fly back up? 
MATT: Sure. Imogen flies down, grabs the branch-- 
LIAM: She's going to spike it into the fire. 
MATT: Flies back up. You now have an ivory branch. 
SAM: I don't trust her. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: I don't trust her. 
ASHLEY: One more! 
LAURA: Me?! 
SAM: She's got it-- 
LAURA: I'm so trustworthy, I'm trying to keep it away from that one! 
ASHLEY: What did I-- I didn't do anything! 
TRAVIS: Oh, Ashley, stop it! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "Little Rascals" over here. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Come on! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Okay, it's clearly FCG. That's fine, anyway. 
ASHLEY: I just feel like everyone's looking at me, and it's making me nervous. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so you still have about, how, your fly speed is 30? 
LAURA: My fly speed is 30. 
MATT: Or 60? Your Fly spell, 30, yeah, so, that's about down and up, yeah, you're good. Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: That finishes your go? 
LAURA: Yes, but instead of flying down and back up, I want to fly down and back that way. 
MATT: Down and back this way. Okay, so you're-- 
LIAM: She's flying towards the fire! 
MATT: All righty, with that, finishing Imogen's go, FCG, you're up, with Chetney on deck. 
SAM: Ooh, fuck. So, we got two, and we know one's over there, probably-- 
TALIESIN: Well, we don't know. 
SAM: In that fucking tree. 
ASHLEY: In one of the trees, though, or something? Over in that area? 
MARISHA: This other one was also underneath some foliage stuff. 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Yeah, under the-- 
LAURA: It was under a bramble wall, yours was. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: It was a wall with some bushy stuff underneath it, so. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Oh my gosh. 
LIAM: Could be anywhere, this map is so big. 
SAM: All right, I'm going to head towards-- 
TALIESIN: Ah. 
SAM: Fearne and Imogen. I don't think there's another one over there. 
LAURA: Oh, let me-- 
MATT: You can get over, there's a little gap there to go through the ruin, or over the ruin, but otherwise this just comes to an end, or you can move through here. 
TRAVIS: Attack the other one-- 
MATT: Right, you have about 10 more feet of movement from there. 
LIAM: The squirrels in the trees? It would look-- 
SAM: Imogen! 
LAURA: Yeah? 
SAM: If you trust me, drop the twig, and I'll get it. 
MARISHA: Ooh?! 
LAURA: I don't trust you. 
LIAM: (gasps) 
SAM: But that's what this exercise is about, trust. I trust you. 
TALIESIN: To keep the stick, right? You trust her to keep the stick! 
SAM: I don't think-- 
LAURA: If you trust me, then don't make me drop it to you, and it could get hurt. 
SAM: I don't think you're the real Imogen. 
LAURA: I am the real Imogen. 
SAM: Are you? 
LAURA: I am! 
SAM: Insight check! 
MATT: Make an insight check. Go ahead and text me-- 
MARISHA: Do you still have the Owl's Wisdom? 
MATT: If you don't mind. If you are you or a doppelganger-- 
TRAVIS: Laura, stop smiling so much! 
TALIESIN: Don't look at her text, don't look at the text. 
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, I got to find Matt. 
SAM: Insight-- 
TRAVIS: I know where the letters are on the keypad now-- 
SAM: 23. 
LAURA: Oh shit, wait-- Oh, I almost just texted some random Matt. 
MATT: He'd be like, "Um." (laughter) 
MARISHA: She's texting a random Matt, "Deception!" (laughter) 
TALIESIN: What? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh, it's hard to-- You can't see her far thumb. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Her far thumb. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You tapped it six times. 
TALIESIN: Less. 
SAM: 23. 
MATT: 23. You believe her. Meaning, you don't just think she's deceiving you. 
TRAVIS: Laura Bailey. 
MATT: You clearly think that she is being honest. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh, Laura. 
LIAM: Did some ex-high school boyfriend-- 
ASHLEY: I feel like she's telling the truth. I feel like she's telling the truth. 
LIAM: -- just get a text that said, "They're on to me." a little while ago? (laughter) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Do you need asylum? (laughter) 
SAM: I believe her. I trust her. Goddamn it, I trust her. All right, is that my action? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: I'll say that's your action to get a good bead in conversation on somebody to read them. It takes a moment to do so, but you can say what you want. You can do anything quick. 
LAURA: ♪ Say ♪ ♪ what you want to say ♪ 
MATT: And move 10 more feet, if you want. 
SAM: Then I will bonus action Misty Step that way as far as I can. 
MATT: This way? All right. 
LAURA: We both can bonus action Misty Step? 
SAM: Well, I've got the Staff of Dark Odyssey. 
MATT: 30. 
LAURA: Oh, right, right, right. 
MATT: All right, you appear on the opposite side of a bramble wall. 
SAM: I trust her, goddamn it! 
MATT: Ashton, as you destroy this ruin, the dust settling, you watch as FCG appears in front of you. You gather yourself. 
SAM: So it means you are a doppelganger. 
MATT: A nearby bramble wall, all of a sudden-- 
MARISHA: What, what? 
MATT: -- lashes out at you. 
MARISHA: Could be. 
MATT: As the 30 feet puts you on the opposite side of this ruin-- 
MARISHA: Taliesin's been pretty quiet. 
MATT: Right next to FCG. 
LIAM: So it's trapped. 
SAM: What happened? 
MATT: You teleported on the opposite side 30 feet this way. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Right next to a bramble wall. The vines lash out at you. 
SAM: Oh, goddamn it! 
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw for me, please. 
TALIESIN: I know it was you. I knew you would find-- 
LAURA: Me? Yeah! 
SAM: Dex? It's just straight 13. 
LIAM: I know it's Imogen. 
MATT: Straight 13. That's a fail. 
LIAM: Look in my eye. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: The vines wrap around you. 
TALIESIN: You don't understand. 
MATT: Restraining you and you take-- 
TALIESIN: I coulda been somebody. Coulda been a contender. 
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage and you are currently restrained-- 
LIAM: Instead of a barbarian. 
MATT: -- and held against this bramble wall. It's pulling in. You see FCG appears and then (grunts) getting pulled in while these long thorns and spine-like brambles pushing into him, it's (grunts) pulling. 
TRAVIS: DM-- 
TALIESIN: In a normal way? 
LAURA: Where are you? 
TALIESIN: Or in a metal-- 
SAM: I'm further than you towards the tree. 
MARISHA: He's behind this wall. 
MATT: I don't know. 
TRAVIS: DM? 
TRAVIS: When we see him getting squeezed-- 
LAURA: (groans) 
TRAVIS: -- does he bleed? 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: By the thorny grip. 
MATT: You don't have a good view from that point. The mist obscures a lot of this. 
TRAVIS: I got a dead line on that view. 
MATT: If you want to-- 
MARISHA: You do. 
MATT: -- try and take a look, you can next turn. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: Plus you would sniff blood, too. 
MARISHA: (gasps) Oh yeah, you could do-- 
SAM: Ooh hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo. 
MATT: So-- 
LIAM: Do I see a space-- 
MATT: That finishes your go. 
SAM: Yes, it does. 
MATT: Chetney, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
TRAVIS: Uh-- 
SAM: (grunts) I can taste my own blood! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I will-- 
SAM: It smells so bloody. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to climb up this tree. 
SAM: I can't taste if it's blood. 
MATT: Okay, athletics check for me. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and get to the very top. 
SAM: It's a dead giveaway. 
TRAVIS: Bunch of those badass. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm glad you're reliving your youth. 
TRAVIS: 22. 
MATT: 22. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You climb up this tree towards the very top. 
SAM: I should go to sleep. 
MATT: Interesting point of order. You climb up and reach for one branch and (whooshes) your hand goes through it. 
LIAM: It's not there. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: You have to catch another branch and you realize that parts of this tree are illusory. 
MARISHA: (gasps) It's up there! 
LAURA: Interesting. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm looking-- 
LAURA: Oh, I bet it is up in the tree. It's in the tree! 
SAM: Wait, why did they go up that tree? 
TRAVIS: One of those two trees sucks according to the squirrel. 
SAM: Of course, of course, but you already hit the bottom of the tree, you thought it was real. 
LIAM: Fearne, did someone see you-- 
LAURA: I was up in that tree. 
LIAM: But there were illusory parts of that tree, too. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I-- 
LIAM: I thought that was described earlier. 
LAURA: Not in that tree. 
TRAVIS: I want to attack the other tree. 
MARISHA: It's him! 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: We're looking where traps are, not where the sticks are, right? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, do I see a box or-- 
LAURA: The doppelgangers know where the traps are? 
TRAVIS: Anything up here like that? 
MARISHA: They know where some of the traps are. 
MATT: Make an investigation check, if you'd like. 
LIAM: Only Ashton-- 
MARISHA: He said that at the top. 
SAM: You've been listening? That's not like you. 
MARISHA: He said it at the top. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MARISHA: That's, wait, what? 
MATT: 17. As you're reaching through-- 
MARISHA: What? 
MATT: -- you're touching the edges of where the branches find the top of the actual trunk as it splinters off into the top parts of it, and you reach along the wood and your hand (whooshes) vanishes on the inside and you feel around and there's a hard surface. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: And you feel a branch. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS: I pull it out. 
MATT: You have a third ivory branch. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Awesome! 
LAURA: We have three of them! 
MARISHA: So we got to all get back to the pool. 
LAURA: Everybody's got to get to the fountain and put it in. We got to touch the tips and put them in the fountain. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Not today! 
SAM: How many sticks? 
TRAVIS: No. (laughter) 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do it! 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS: That was four. How much would you say to get up of my 80? 
MATT: Out of your 80, I'd say climbing it is half movement so it'd be about, it's about a good 30-foot climb. 
LAURA: Where are you? 
MATT: So I'd put you-- 25-foot climb, I'd say. 
LIAM: Across from this. 
MATT: So that'll be 50 feet to get up there so you still have 30 left. 
TRAVIS: Can I be real reckress (reckless) and try and jump from this to that platform? 
MARISHA: Reckress. 
MATT: Certainly, yeah. Make an athletics check for me. 
TRAVIS: Okay, reckress. (laughs) 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Reckress! 
TALIESIN: Reckress! 
TRAVIS: Oh, 27. 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Natural 19. 
MATT: There you go, so you reach the edge there, and I'd say you have-- 
SAM: Oh, oh, oh, he's leaning. 
MATT: You have five more feet. 
SAM: He's leaning. 
TRAVIS: I'll-- 
LIAM: Falling asleep. 
TRAVIS: On the little-- (laughs) 
MATT: Make an acrobatics check to try and land on your feet. 
TRAVIS: I don't have advantage on that. 
SAM: Guidance. 
TRAVIS: 18. 
MATT: 18, yeah, so you impact the ground, the branch in your off hand, the waters shimmering. 
TALIESIN: We got one. 
TRAVIS: Can I put the branch in the bag of holding? 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: Finishing-- 
TRAVIS: Just in case one of them little road runners comes around. 
TALIESIN: Also, we have two people who are going to turn. 
LIAM: Or just in case he's trying-- 
MATT: Finishing Chetney's go-- 
ASHLEY: Sus! 
MATT: Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: Hm, hmm-- 
TRAVIS: What do you do now? 
ASHLEY: Sus behavior, Chet! 
TRAVIS: You fucking faker! (laughs) 
LAURA: He's a faker. 
ASHLEY: He's a faker! 
MARISHA: You put it-- 
TRAVIS: I have a bag of holding. 
MARISHA: Perfect for hiding it from the rest of us. 
TRAVIS: Before I put the twig in, I take the shard out and I'm like. (screams) (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: See? 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: The stick starts to smolder. 
TRAVIS: But my hand doesn't-- 
MARISHA: Pâté! 
LAURA: (shouts) 
SAM: Oh, that scared me. 
MATT: "Hey, what's going on?" 
MARISHA: FCG is restrained! Now's your chance! Get a closer look! 
MATT: "Well, I don't know where he went!" 
MARISHA: He's over-- 
SAM and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MARISHA: I-- 
MATT: You actually have no idea where he went because he just-- 
SAM: (screams) 
MATT: -- he went this way and teleported and has not gone into your sight. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: So you can assume. You've heard some motion, but-- 
SAM: (bleats) 
MATT: You're not entirely certain where he is. 
MARISHA: I can hear his weird duck cries. 
MATT: That's true, that's true. 
MARISHA: They're from this-- 
MATT: So you gather attention. All right. 
MARISHA: This direction, Pâté. 
MATT: "Oh, okay. I'll make that way." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: He starts flying. 
SAM: (as Pâté) ♪ I'm makin' my way ♪ 
MATT: It's 40 feet, you said? 
ASHLEY: ♪ Makin' that way ♪ 
MARISHA: 40 feet. 
MATT: Five, 10, 15-- 
TRAVIS: I'll be back before the street lights turn on. 
MATT: -- 20, 25, 30-- 
SAM: ♪ Makin' my way downtown ♪ 
MATT: 35, 40. I'll say he gets to about there. 
MARISHA: Can he see FCG? 
MATT: He can. 
MARISHA: What do you see? 
MATT: "Oh, it looks like he's made friends with one of those spiny plant things." 
MARISHA: Oh, he was, oh, so congenial. I look through his eyes. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Do I see FCG bleed? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
SAM: I look right back at Pâté with my eyes burning red. 
LAURA: (laughs) Oh shit! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Natural 20. (cheering) 
MATT: Natural 20.

SAM: We have a whisper sponsor. 
LAURA: That's amazing! 
LIAM: Yeah, is that the first time it's ever been punched? 
ASHLEY: Are you trying to cover up? 
TALIESIN: We have a whisper sponsor. 
LAURA: Did you eat all the rest of the candies? 
SAM: I think we had one more. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh no. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's really Travis. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: All right. Hmm-- Hm! 
LIAM: She's changing shape. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: He's texting. He's texting Matt. 
ASHLEY: Are you texting Matt? I can see. 
LAURA: He's texting Matt. 
TALIESIN: Wrong Matt, wrong Matt! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: What's it called? 
TALIESIN: What is happening? 
LAURA: A guy I dated 20 years ago. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh, let's try and feed him metal. 
LIAM: Oh, my joke was right. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay, well, I see Orym, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I am-- 
LIAM: She's going to kill me. She's going to kill me! 
LAURA: Is she going to-- 
MARISHA: No! I'm going to stay where I am. 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Because I have a pretty good line of sight on Imogen, Chetney, and Orym. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: And me through-- 
MARISHA: And you. I can see everybody. Where's Ashton? 
SAM: Where's Ashton? 
MATT: You cannot see Ashton. 
LIAM: If she can see through Pâté-- 
MARISHA: Except for Ashton. But Pâté can see Ashton. 
LIAM: If she can see Pâté, that means that Laudna-- 
ASHLEY: Loutna! 
LIAM: I said Laudna. Can't see because you got to go blind. 
MATT: Correct, so it's like you're switching between the two of them. 
MARISHA: I'm going back and forth. 
ASHLEY: Like a doppelganger. 
LIAM: Oh, it's like left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye? 
LAURA: Yeah. Camera A, camera B, camera A, camera B. 
ASHLEY: Laudna. 
SAM: What's that from? 
LAURA: That's from-- 
SAM: "Wayne's World"? 
LAURA: "So I Married an Axe Murderer." 
SAM: Oh, yes. That's such a good movie! 
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to stay. I'm going to stay put and stay on guard. 
MATT: Okay. Orym, you're up. 
MARISHA: Watching everybody. 
LIAM: I am going to double time it. I'm going to run on a straight diagonal and leap through that broken window to-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: -- end by Chet. 
MATT: All right, make an athletics check to leap through. 
LIAM: That is-- It's a 12 with boots of-- 
MATT: Yeah, with the boots. 
LIAM: My free jumps. 
MATT: If you rolled really low it would have been a little rough. 
LIAM: Okay. So I'll spring past those vines, land right next to him. 
MATT: You have to make a dexterity check as you move past the vines directly. You have advantage on this because you're moving so quickly and it doesn't expect you but it does attempt. 
LAURA: You have the hurt branch, right? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yes. 
SAM: About to be more hurt when he breaks it. 
LIAM: That's an 18. 
MATT: 18, you move past without issue. 
LIAM: Okay, I land next to Chet and look at you and say: No, seriously, if you're my dad, you really should tell me. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Not now, son. (laughter) 
LIAM: I'll leave the stick in my chonies. 
MATT: Okay, finishes Orym's go. Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: All right. Well, we have them all? Did everybody say we have them all? 
LAURA: Uh-huh, yep. 
SAM: We do. 
LAURA: We have them all. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to turn around and I'm going to go-- 
SAM: Wait, who? You have one, you have one. Who has the third? You have one. Okay, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to turn around and I'm going to go hang out by the pool. 
MATT: Okay. Over here? 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: You! It's you! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You fucking have. 
LAURA: It's not me! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm trying not to rat you out, but-- 
ASHLEY: I'll sit on the side of the pool. 
LAURA: It's not me. It's you! 
ASHLEY: Waiting for everybody to come over. 
MATT: Right here, just chilling. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: He put it in the bag of holding. 
MATT: Are you holding an action? or are you just standing there? 
LAURA: But then how would he have a bag of holding? He didn't-- 
MARISHA: That's fair. Wait, do doppelgangers get your stuff? 
MATT: It looks like he put something in a bag of holding. 
SAM: Wait, this is the Matrix world, so-- 
LIAM: He really inserted it into his anus. 
TRAVIS: (grunts) 
LAURA: (laughs) His doppelganger anus. 
TRAVIS: Those three prongs are a bitch. 
LIAM: Which is trying to-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I am going to hold an action. 
MATT: What are you holding? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Hold Person. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm holding, I'm holding-- 
MATT: For what trigger? 
ASHLEY: Uh-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Who? 
LAURA: Does she have to say? 
ASHLEY: Chet. 
TRAVIS: You're holding me? 
ASHLEY: I'm not going to do it. I'm just, I'm-- 
TRAVIS: You're going to hold it. Okay. 
ASHLEY: If Chet does something. 
MATT: That you don't approve of, like going to release-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: Like putting the stick in the hole. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: In the hole. You're going to try to attack him? 
MATT: Okay, all right, that-- 
MARISHA: You don't approve of. 
ASHLEY: That I don't approve of. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. 
MARISHA: It could go either way. 
MATT: All right, so Fearne's holding that. Ashton, what are you doing? 
LIAM: Very carefully worded. 
LAURA: She's a doppelganger! 
MATT: You see FCG currently restrained by this wall of thorns. 
TRAVIS: It's me. 
MARISHA: It might be. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It looks like we got everything. You good? 
SAM: Leave me. Go get one of them. One of them will betray us, so go get-- I think it's somebody who has a stick. Go. Just leave me. 
TALIESIN: Only one. Oh, that works. One way or another. 
SAM: I think it's Fearne and one of the ones who has a stick. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to head back through that direction. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Is there something that I can-- 
LAURA: Is it you? 
LIAM: Is it? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to see-- 
ASHLEY: I think I know who it is. 
TALIESIN: -- if there's anything I can provoke-- 
ASHLEY: I feel like I know who they are. 
TALIESIN: -- attack of opportunity from that isn't poison. Is there something spiky that I can hit? 
LAURA: Is it, though? 
TALIESIN: Oh my way in. 
SAM: It might be. 
LAURA: Maybe he's really good. 
TALIESIN: Actually, technically, if I take a little fire damage, that'll keep my rage up, if I recall. No, that's not an attack. 
MATT: It's not an attack. 
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to run by that little spiky thing to-- 
LIAM: You're a doppelganger, bitch! 
LAURA: You're a doppelganger, bitch! 
MATT: This one lashes out at you. Make a dexterity saving throw. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: 16. 
MATT: 16, all right. You dodge past, no impact. I will say for the purposes of this because traps technically aren't attacks. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: I've allowed of it to go by when it's active and going towards you, but for this I'm just saying that it, at this point, the rage begins to die down. 
TALIESIN: So am I losing-- 
MATT: You're losing your fast speed at this point because now it's like-- 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: -- everyone's gathered the sticks. There's tension, but-- 
SAM: Too many sticks. 
MATT: -- but there's not-- You're not in a point where the rage is being maintained, I'll say. 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay. 
MATT: But you do finish your rage here next to Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so it'll die at the end of next round. Normally, yeah, it would. 
MATT: For the next round. I'll say-- 
TALIESIN: When I start, it's gone. Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, when you start, it's gone. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: All right, is that all you're going to do? You move over there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm going to-- 
MATT: Hold an action or anything? 
TALIESIN: Am I going to hold an action? 
MATT: Or anything you want to look for? What do you want to do? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to-- I'm going to take a look at-- I'm going to try and get a read on Chet just to have it. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Actually, no. I'll take a read on Orym because we haven't been in contact. 
MATT: How so? Are you asking a question? Are you just getting a general bead? 
TALIESIN: Where's his hands? And-- 
MATT: Orym, where are your hands? 
LIAM: Just a sword in one hand. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: And shield in my other. 
TALIESIN: So there's not, not going for the stick at all. 
MATT: You do not see a stick on him at all. 
SAM: Shaft, balls. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. There is no stick. I'm looking for nerves because-- 
SAM: Nerve check. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is not something that-- Yeah, just to see what's up. 
MATT: All right. Insight check, then. 
TALIESIN: Nope. You can try that against that eight. 
MATT: Orym, text me. 
LIAM: Oh, what am I sending you? 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Whether or not you're a doppelganger. 
MATT: Whether or not you're a doppelganger. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. I'm going to text my girlfriend from high school. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
SAM: I really wish things would've worked out different. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: P.S. It me. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold a-- 
MATT: He's hard to read. 
LIAM: Check me out now. 
MATT: It seems like, there's certainly tension there. 
TALIESIN: It's hard to read now. 
MATT: But you see him, sword and shield, eyeing everybody else with-- 
MARISHA: Perception. 
MATT: -- the typical Orym tension. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold a, specifically a-- 
ASHLEY: I didn't do this. That was him. 
TALIESIN: I have an attack that-- 
LIAM: Are you accusing me now? 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: To push somebody five feet. I've got a shove attack. I'm going to hold it for Fearne. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: If Fearne does anything I don't approve of. 
MATT: Okay. Finishing Ashton's go, Imogen, you're up. 
TALIESIN: What's it called? 
LAURA: Okay. Do we have to wait 'til our next turn to put it in the water all at the same time, or--? 
TRAVIS: I think you have to hold an action. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so Crusher attack. 
LAURA: All right, I will-- 
SAM: Did we say at the same time? 
LAURA: Does it? Because it-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, they need to touch, though. I think we-- 
MARISHA: Well-- 
LAURA: Do they need to touch? 
MATT: The instruction was to place them all into the pool together. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: So I don't think they need to touch. I think we just have to all do it at once. 
LAURA: Do it at the same time. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Dope. 
LAURA: Okay, so okay, we're close to that. I'm going to fly up and over and I'm going to get down next to the pool on this side. 
MATT: This side. 
LAURA: Should I be in between Chet and Orym? I'm going to-- (groans) 
TRAVIS: The closer the better. 
LAURA: That's what I mean, I feel like-- Yeah, okay, I'm going to-- I'm staying where I am. 
MATT: Okay. Anything with your action? 
LAURA: I'm going to be a little bit closer to Orym because I don't know how much distance Fearne has on scorchy hands. (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: The scorchy hands. 
LAURA: I feel like you're going to attack me. 
MATT: Do you hold an action? 
LAURA: I am. I'm going to hold the stick. I have the stick in my hand. I'm going to wait 'til Orym and Chet are also and so we can all put it in together so I'm going to hold that action to put it in. 
MATT: Okay, you've got it. All righty, finishing your turn. It's back to top with FCG. At the top of your turn, FCG, because you are still bound by it. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: It's grasping you tighter and tighter and the thorns are pushing into you. You take-- 
SAM: Please don't kill me. 
MATT: That's going to be 34 points of piercing damage. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: You're going to heal yourself, right? 
SAM: No. 
ASHLEY: Are you unconscious? 
SAM: It's for the team. I don't care about me. 
TALIESIN: Heal! 
SAM: I'll cast Divination. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, it's Chet. It's Orym. It's Chet. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Is that something I can do? 
ASHLEY: I wrote it down who I thought it was, but I think I'm wrong. 
LIAM: This exercise really increased our trust. 
MATT: You can. 
LAURA: Who'd you write? 
SAM: Changebringer, I don't know if you can hear us in this space. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
SAM: I don't know if you've been watching us lately. I know that this is something very silly to bother you with when the world is on the brink of a calamity, but can you tell me if Orym is the bad guy? 
MATT and LIAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Oh, nice. Yes or no, right? 
ASHLEY: Yep. 
MATT: You close your eyes and hold your head upward and you see a vision up above. Up above, you see the endless flow of hair. You see the drifting nature of the many roads of the world and you watch as her face emerges from it with a smile towards you. Her hand reaches down into this dark space and lifts up Orym into her palm and presents him to you. I'm going to come whisper. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: Don't listen. 
MARISHA: Okay! 
SAM: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! 
LIAM: (silly devil growl) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: You can grow a really cool beard with-- 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: We got a whisper thing. 
MARISHA: -- with beard stuff. 
ASHLEY: (waggles tongue) 
TALIESIN: You're not helping. 
MARISHA: There's a code. 
LIAM: Well, that clinches it. 
TRAVIS: It's relaxing. 
SAM: It was a little confusing, but I think I got it. 
MARISHA: She never says shit straightforward. 
SAM: It was-- 
LAURA: Maybe she's mad at you-- 
MATT: Need me to clarify? 
SAM: Yes! (laughter) 
LAURA: Maybe she's mad at you. You just said in the honesty game that you didn't trust her. 
TRAVIS: Easy, doppelganger. Stop trying to throw off our help. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: (sneezes) 
SAM: Oh, gesundheit-- Stop it! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I knew it was coming. 
SAM: Guys, I think it's Chetney. 
TRAVIS: What?! (laughs) 
SAM: And that's my turn. (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: (gasps) Unless you're a doppelganger and you're a doppelganger! 
MATT: You hear FCG shout this from over the hill, in pain, uncertain where he is. 
TRAVIS: You're a devious bastard. 
MATT: Okay, that finishes FCG's go. Chetney, you're up. What do you do? 
TRAVIS: Orym's right next to me, right? 
MATT: Orym's right next to you and Imogen's over there. 
LIAM: 10 feet away, yeah. 
SAM: Within melee range. 
TRAVIS: I will use my nose to see if I detect the familiar scents of pine, sandalwood, and-- 
LIAM and SAM: (laugh) 
SAM: Patchouli. 
TRAVIS: Patchouli. (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: -- radiating from the Orym that I know. 
MARISHA: From Orym? (laughs) 
MATT: Make a perception check with advantage because of your wolven scent. 
LIAM: Rub that on his armpits and on his groin every day. 
LAURA: He rubs you in his armpits and his groin every day? (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Got to keep oiled. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That is a 16. 
MATT: A 16? 
LIAM: Make it happen. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh, now what's happening? Oh my god. This is crazy. 
LIAM: He wants to know if I smell right. 
SAM: Guys, whispers. Whispers. Beard oil. Beard Sorcery, Displacer Beast and Mind Flayer Invasion beard oil. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I will reach into the bag of holding and I will take out the branch and I'll put it back in the bag of holding and take out the harness and then take out the branch and I'll start to absorb the branch. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding! (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (electrical energy buzzing) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I take the branch out and I'll hold my action and look at Orym and say: Okay. (beastly) Okay. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Waiting for you. 
MATT: Okay, Chetney's turn is done. Laudna, you're up. There are two branches held out. There are a handful of people that are holding actions. There are eyes darting around. What would you like to do? 
SAM: I'm so confused now. 
SAM and LIAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: So Orym is the only one left? 
LAURA: What if none of us are the doppelgangers and we all are honest? 
LIAM: Oh, wouldn't that be a kick in the patoot? 
MARISHA: You're the only one left. 
LIAM: It's just me. 
MARISHA: And you're up next. 
LIAM: (raspy) Not like this. 
ASHLEY: Not like this. 
TALIESIN: Not like this. 
LIAM: I'm after-- 
MARISHA: You're after me. 
LAURA: After you. Yeah. 
LIAM: -- Laudna, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: What do you do? 
LIAM: It's best to murder me now. 
MARISHA: I am going to pull out my Hound of Ill Omen. 
MATT: (transformational splitting) 
LAURA: It's FCG. 
MATT: (deep snarling) 
MARISHA: It's going to sit-- 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
MARISHA: It's going to be-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that thing? Where has that shit been? 
TRAVIS: It's been out a few times. 
SAM: I trust it. 
MARISHA: It's going to be-- 
LIAM: Is that a new mini for the-- 
MARISHA: -- right in between-- 
MATT: That's what I've been using. 
MARISHA: It's going to be right between Orym and Imogen. 
MATT: It hops down. 
SAM: The love of your life? 
MATT: While the two of you are holding your branches out over this water, you hear this dark tearing sound. (wolfish howls) The shadow hound lands between the two of you. (beastly snarls) 
MARISHA: He's just here for extra accountability. 
LAURA: I look over at him. Hi, baby boy. 
MARISHA: Yes, that's a good boy. 
TALIESIN: I'm cool. 
MARISHA: Then I'm going to hold my action. 
SAM: Everyone's holding actions. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: To? 
MARISHA: To just-- 
TRAVIS: You son of a bitch. 
LAURA: It's all on you, Orym. You're the one. 
LIAM: I know. I have an idea. 
TRAVIS: Divisive-- 
SAM: No, I genuinely think you're the guy! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Or-- 
MARISHA: Can I hold a-- No, a Counterspell's a reaction. 
SAM: Or Liam's right. 
MATT: No, Counterspell is a reaction. 
TALIESIN: He might be. 
TRAVIS: What? There are no doppelgangers. 
TALIESIN: That's what I've been working with. 
MATT: You can't hold it. 
LAURA: That's what I said. 
SAM: But Liam said it-- 
MARISHA: Jeez, I don't have anything that's-- 
SAM: -- in a more masculine voice. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm not. I'm not! 
MARISHA: I don't have anything that's-- 
SAM: Therefore it was much more believable. 
MARISHA: -- great! (laughter) 
MATT: That's so fucked up. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: Everyone is so smart. 
MARISHA: I'm going to hold an Infestation and someone's ass is going to get lit up with some bees, because I don't think bees can hurt a stick. 
MATT: But against who? 
SAM: Everyone. 
LAURA: You're attacking me? 
MARISHA: Anyone, right? 
TRAVIS: You have to aim it at somebody. 
MARISHA: Well, I'll hold it against Orym-- 
MATT: What's the trigger? 
MARISHA: Because he's next. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: If Orym does anything fucky. 
TRAVIS: You hit him with bees? 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to hit him with bees. (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: His greatest fear, a swarm of bees. The fucking-- 
MARISHA: Because I don't want to hurt the stick! 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: You're going to "My Girl" him here in the middle of the field. 
LAURA: We're all waiting. 
TRAVIS: He can't see without his glasses! 
LAURA: Where are his glasses? 
MARISHA: Okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Orym? All right, hey, everybody-- 
TRAVIS: The trauma from that movie. 
MARISHA: -- on the count of three. 
LIAM: Orym-- 
MARISHA: One-- 
LIAM: -- looks around at the group and says: I hope I know what's going on here. He reaches into his chonies and pulls out the Monocle of True Essence. 
TALIESIN: Nice! 
LIAM: And looks around at the group. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: This is not rules as written on this, but it fucking says "true essence" on it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's cheating. 
LIAM: I will try to Detect Magic, I guess, and see if-- 
TRAVIS: What do you care? 
LIAM: -- any of my friends are-- 
ASHLEY: I think this is about trust. 
LIAM: -- glowing all around their person in an aura. 
LAURA: Why wouldn't you just put the stick in? 
MARISHA: Put the stick in! 
LAURA: You're wasting your action?! 
ASHLEY: This is all about trust! 
LAURA: You're wasting your action to look at everybody-- 
MARISHA: Everybody's holding their sticks! 
LAURA: -- instead of putting the stick in? 
SAM: Or he's not wasting it. 
MATT: Well, pause. 
SAM: He's burning it! 
LIAM: Well, if I do that and then I don't see anything, then we can continue to hold and put the stick in, because this is-- 
MATT: That's true. 
LIAM: -- a simulation of life, not chess. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: So I use the monocle and look at my friends with a thing called Monocle of True Essence. 
MATT: Indeed. 
MARISHA: He doesn't trust us. 
MATT: As you cast your Detect Magic spell through it and look through the lens, you can see small magical essences emanates from everyone. This whole area has a weird, staticky feel. We are not getting immediate directional things, but everyone seems to have varying moving magical essence about their spaces. The branches that are being held up have a weird pulsing magical essence. Specifically, if you want to use this to try and read someone's true essence in this instance, I will let you make an insight check with advantage. 
LIAM: Advantage, okay. 
MATT: Who do you wish to look at to do this for? 
LIAM: (heavy sigh) 
SAM: Oh man. 
SAM: We were all wrong about Ashley. 
LIAM: Her deception's probably really high. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LAURA: But if it's not Ashley, then who is it? She's the only one we know. 
ASHLEY: It's not me! (laughter) It's not me! 
LIAM: I do it with Fearne. 
MATT: To Fearne? Okay. 
LIAM: I'll do it to Fearne. 
SAM: It could be nobody. 
LIAM: I am hoping. I think it's nobody, but-- 
MARISHA: Oh, it was just-- 
LAURA: It's nobody. 
SAM: That's what I'm saying. That's what Liam said. 
LIAM: Nine-- 
TALIESIN: That's been my-- 
LIAM: Insight, you said? 
MATT: Insight. 
LIAM: 22. 
MARISHA: It was just to fuck with our heads? 
SAM: It's to get us to trust each other. 
LIAM: It's to get us to get over our shit. 
TALIESIN: Get over the shit. 
LIAM: It is an exercise. 
SAM: Whispers. Beard, beard oil. Whispers, beard oil. 
TALIESIN: Just why I've been more or less helping everybody-- 
MARISHA: Beard-- 
TALIESIN: -- get out of their shit this entire fucking time. 
MARISHA: -- Sorcery. 
TALIESIN: Until the very end. 
SAM: Beardsorcery.com/criticalrole-db. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Get that beard. 
LAURA: Get that beard! 
LIAM: Okay. If we can be loosey-goosey, I will shove the monocle back into my chonies, chonies are down here, and I will pull out the stick. 
MATT: Well, I'll say because it was your action to do that-- 
LIAM: (sighs) Yes. 
MATT: I'm just saying. We're being loosey-goosey, but-- 
SAM: This is chess! 
MATT: You can pull it out, but I'll say that's the end of your turn as you pull it out. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: He just said it wasn't chess. Is it chess or not chess? 
TALIESIN: It's checkers. 
MATT: So, finishing Orym's go, Fearne. All three branches are out. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: They're all looking at each other, there are spells held. You're still keeping your incantation at the ready. 
MARISHA: One more confirmation round. 
MATT: What do you do? 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to put away my Hold Person. Can I do that? 
MATT: Yeah, you can. You can drop the spell and do something else instead. 
ASHLEY: Say again? 
MATT: And do something else instead. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: Or the same thing again. 
MATT: Surrounding you, there are three branches untouched and there is one with one hit point missing, so. 
LIAM: So a doppelganger is not a person. So when we used Hold Person, it didn't work. It's a doppelganger. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm, by the way, looking at you right now. I'm not making a face or anything. I'm just looking. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: I'm slowly dying. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah, FCG is being crushed to death over the wall. (laughter) 
SAM: It's okay. 
TALIESIN: Three fucking healers. 
LAURA: A whole other round of FCG getting killed. 
TRAVIS: (as FCG) I trust you! 
SAM: It's fine, it's fine. 
MARISHA: You do have to die. 
TRAVIS: (FCG wailing) 
SAM: It's fine. 
ASHLEY: Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Eyes. Eyes, everybody. 
SAM: (choking dramatically) 
ASHLEY: It's me, Fearne. We're going to take care of you in a minute. It's me, Fearne. 
LAURA: Remember we can't reveal the five. 
ASHLEY: I'm not a doppelganger. Okay? 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm not going to do anything and I'm going to stand here until you guys put the sticks in the pool. 
TRAVIS: That's good, that's a good move. 
LAURA: All right, let's put it in then. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Ashton? 
ASHLEY: That's my move. 
LIAM: (suddenly dies) (laughter) 
SAM: Sniper. 
TALIESIN: I feel like y'all got that. I'm going to go get FCG out of this shit. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to head over-- 
TRAVIS: Good play, good play. 
TALIESIN: -- towards where FCG is and probably burn another rage for it, so. 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Because I'm down. 
MATT: Why not? 
TALIESIN: Back at time, yay. Rolled a three. 
MATT: Well, look at that! 
SAM: As soon as Ashton gets within sight, I'll be like: Did they buy it? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We're good. (laughter) 
LIAM: (beep) (explosion) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, if I can get over to the-- 
MATT: So you go five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. You can climb up and land over, if you want to make an athletics check. 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
LIAM: Rocks! 
TALIESIN: 17. 
MATT: 17? Yeah, you climb over and land on the opposite side. That's going to be 45 feet of movement. 
TALIESIN: That is 45 feet of movement? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's a little further than I have, unless I-- 
MATT: Well, 40 feet of movement. No, 40 feet to get the top and you jump off, which I think I'll allow. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: You just have to make an acrobatics check to make sure you land on your feet. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I can do that, too. 
LAURA: I only have 30. 
TALIESIN: As opposed to climbing back down. 
TALIESIN: That's 14. 
MATT: 14. You land. Yeah, you'd be right next to FCG, who is currently now being grappled in this. 
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to take my attacks to-- 
MATT: The bramble wall? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, to get FCG out of the bramble wall. 
MATT: All right, roll two attacks. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: We didn't trust each other. 
TALIESIN: 26. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: (stick cracking) 
MATT: 26 hits. 
TALIESIN: I'm getting you out. Shut the fuck up. 
SAM: No, I mean-- You're great. 
TALIESIN: 18. 
MATT: 18 points of damage? 
SAM: I didn't trust-- 
LAURA: Anybody. 
MATT: You slam into the wall. 
SAM: -- anybody. 
MATT: It cracks a bit and you can see it's starting to send tendrils out in your direction. Make your second attack. 
MARISHA: I wouldn't say we didn't trust. We were cautious. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to fucking-- Yeah, never mind. I'm going reckless with that shit. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: 17. 
MATT: 17 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: 17. 
MATT: You smash down the wall, freeing FCG from the clasp of that bramble. 
MARISHA: There's still time for someone to turn. I'm just saying. 
SAM: Thank you, Ashton. Banishment. 
LIAM: It's very easy to break a stick. 
TALIESIN: I hope you did that. 
SAM: No. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Because then I'm going to-- You're becoming a very good therapist. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: That finishes your turn? 
TALIESIN: That's my end of my turn. 
MATT: All right. Imogen, you're up with FCG on deck. 
LAURA: I'm still waiting until-- (stammers inability to act) 
MATT: Okay, maintain it. FCG, your turn, with Chetney on deck. 
TALIESIN: Heal your damn self. 
SAM: Oh, okay. I'll Cure Wounds myself. 
LIAM: Physician, heal thyself. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'll Cure Wounds myself. Just 1st-level. 
TALIESIN: Really? Okay. 
SAM: What's this one? What is that? What did I do? Oh, 10 points. Then I want to go see this! So I'm going to roll over-- 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. 
SAM: -- towards the pool. 
MATT: Gets you right in the middle of this ruin right there, behind Chetney. You can see the group, branches out, eyes wide, looking at each other. 
SAM: This was a good lesson for all of us to trust each other and know that none of us will ever-- (laughter) 
SAM: Will ever-- 
LIAM: There's a text to Matt. 
SAM: Will ever be-- All right, just do it. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. All right. Finishing FCG's go, Chetney, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Are we all-- 
MATT: With Laudna on deck. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: We're just-- 
MARISHA: We've got to get all the way back around to Orym. 
LIAM: Waiting on Orym. 
LAURA: We got to get back to Orym because he's the one that held it up. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll continue to hold. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Because he had to look through a monocle. 
LIAM: I don the Scarf of Intrusive Intent. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I put away my bees. (laughter) 
MATT: (buzzing diminishes) Is that it? 
SAM: Holster them? 
MARISHA: I-- (holstering sound) 
MATT: (laughs) (succinct buzzes) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: And I continue to wait. 
MATT: Orym. 
LAURA: God, I'm not convinced yet. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: It's your turn, Orym. 
ASHLEY: No, me neither. 
LIAM: Chet, Imogen, on the count of three, ready. (laughter) 
LIAM: One, two-- 
TALIESIN: Five. 
TRAVIS: (whooshes) (laughter) 
LIAM: Three! 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Boop! 
MATT: You all push through this magical barrier as the three branches sploosh in the water. The water begin to light up and it pulls them together in the center. As they all meet, you watch as they grow into each other, forming a larger, extended branch. You can see little veins of silver spit through it, binding them together until it forms one singular glowing ivory branch. It sits there in the middle as the mists begin to fill the area around you to where you can just see the area around the water. The ruins vanish in this clouded space. You watch as one doppelganger walks out of the side, another one walks out of the other, and they both look at the rest of you. Nana Morri walks out the opposite end and she goes, "Well done. Sometimes you have to trust in each other, no matter what you're told." 
MARISHA: Aw. 
MATT: "So that is a successful endeavor in this exercise. And I believe you've earned this." She looks around for someone to reach for it. 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: And as you reach-- (laughter) 
MATT: She snaps her fingers and the fog fills the space and all of you feel this cold rush of air. As the fog fades, you blink your eyes blearily, and look around as you're in the warm, comfortable seats you were sitting in, in the middle of Ligament Manor. The set of tea around you on the table. You see Allura off to the side with a tiki drink, going, "Well, that was rather strange. Hope you enjoyed your naps." 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. 
LAURA: It was all a dream. 
MATT: And we're going to go to break. 
ALL: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Matthew, that was so good, man! 
MATT: Be back here shortly. 
TRAVIS: Come on!

LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. This is pretty badass. I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. It's too powerful. This holiday season, give the gift of effortless style. Ooo so comfy cozy. Roll an investigation if you want. It's basically perfect. Oh my gosh, it's so amazing. This is a lot of stuff, you guys. We have so many cool things right now. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. (adventurous music) 
TALIESIN: What keeps the children of Hale safe from their curiosity? Nursery rhymes serve as cautionary tales to explain Candela Obscura's earliest adversaries. So when a creature of legend returns to the hollowed labyrinth of Grayslate, a new and unusual circle of investigators is formed, tasked to face an unholy corruption. As the unsuspecting Newfairens bear witness to this macabre phenomena, each investigator must steel their mind, perhaps even from themselves. The Circle of Tide and Bone. Assignment #31-58: The Antiquarian.
(tense mysterious music) (ominous music) 
NARRATOR 1: The darkness around them is alive with vast, slow-coiling, bioluminescent movement. NARRATOR 2: They feel the Fold buffeted against them with somewhat more force than usual. NARRATOR 1: An odd, liquid, seismic tremoring in the fog around them, as again, Oh, it, it, it is indescribably eerie. NARRATOR 2: The beacon light blinks on and off, on and off, by turns plunging them into absolute darkness and giving them a fraction of a second's glimpse into what might be lurking there. And the next time the beacon light comes on, they see above their heads, rushing silently through the Fold, coiling around them, the underbelly of - something.

KIRBY: No. 
KYLE: We're not doing another as ASMR sketch. 
SAM: Why not? What's wrong with it?

KYLE: Stop it. 
KIRBY: No, no, no, no, no. 
SAM: Sorry! Sorry! 
KIRBY: No. 
SAM: Fine! If I can't do ASMR, then I just don't want to be part of the sub promo at all. Get somebody else to do it. I'm in too many of them already. 
KYLE: Sam, all we need you to say is that as a Critical Role Twitch subscriber, they'll be able to watch--

KYLE: Sam! Can you just scoot just a little bit? 
KIRBY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
KYLE: Yep. A little. 
SAM: Like this? Why? Why? 
KYLE: A little bit. Right. Scoot. Stop! Right there, right there! You're good. [increasingly intense string glissando] 
SAM: How dare you! How dare you! 
SAM: ♪ Boo boo boo doo boo boo ♪ [text notification] 
SAM: Oh! A text from Max! (groans) Stupid Twitch promo! "Hey, Sam. I know you read your texts out loud." Distracting me from my real work, which is making a flask gag. "Please say that with a Twitch subscription, Prime members get one free Twitch subscription. You can watch live with a professionally moderated chat." Guys, this is not funny! People? [static] (muffled) You know-- (clearer) You know what I need! I'm subscribing to Critical Role! (whispers) Doesn't that sound nice? (regular) I just want to eat 'em right up!

SAM: It's something that everyone loves! [high-pitched tone gets louder] 
SAM: Guys... we go meta. [intense drum beat] 
KIRBY: Oh god! 
KYLE: Fucking... 
MAXWELL: No. It's clever because it's self-referential. 
KYLE: Mm-mm. (No.)

Part II[]
MATT: Welcome back. As you all wipe the odd appearance from your eyes, you look and see the tea around you and you see the scarf curled on the table along with a monocle and a branch that emerges from the side, the three objects. Nana Morri folds her arms as she leans back in her chair. "Well, I certainly hope you're all quite proud." 
LIAM: Orym checks for leeches. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: There is one on your dick. 
SAM: (screams) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: He called you dick. 
TALIESIN: This is not the first time I've woken up thinking that a stick and a piece of cloth were super important based on what happened that night. 
LAURA: Hmm! 
LIAM: Holy shit. 
SAM: That sounds loaded with meaning. 
ASHLEY: Yes, it does. 
TALIESIN: I think I need orange juice. 
MATT: "That can be arranged." 
LAURA: What is he talking about? 
SAM: Orange juice? 
TALIESIN: We need to re-up if we're going to go out. We need to take a nap, we need to hydrate. This is important. 
ASHLEY: Dangerously low. 
LAURA: We did just take a really long dream. 
TALIESIN: I don't think it counts as a nap, though. 
ASHLEY: That was really fun, Nana. 
MARISHA: Wait. You did not. 
MATT: "I'm so glad you enjoyed it." 
ASHLEY: I feel like we really learned a lot. 
LAURA: We did. We did. 
ASHLEY: I feel like that was needed. 
SAM: We did learn a lot, actually we really did. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: I mean, we revealed a lot about each other. A lot of stuff that I have follow-up questions about, but we also learned to trust each other. Shut the fuck up! 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
SAM: We're really together now. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Communication, honesty. 
SAM: We're really a team. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Did you catch all that? 
MARISHA: What'd he say? 
SAM: Anyway, I had a question. Which bits did I come up with and which bits did you come up with? 
MATT: "Well, you certainly provided the seeds to each of these, and I just ran with them." 
SAM: Got it. 
TALIESIN: Did you-- 
SAM: Well, I feel like the lessons might've come from me, at least I hope so, but the way we got there didn't feel like me, but maybe it was. 
MATT: "It was a collaboration, and I--" 
SAM: It was fun. 
MATT: "-- just got a little excited in some places." 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: "But, nevertheless, the work isn't done. You've just begun the journey of reforging the bonds between you, so--" (Morri 2) "Take your time." 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
LAURA: Thanks, Nana. 
MARISHA: A bit of a technical question. If we were all dreaming this whole time, if Orym did happen to fall to his death, would he still have died? 
MATT: She looks at you and realize that the wounds you took in the dream you still have puncture wounds in your body from the damage you sustained. 
TALIESIN: Ow. 
SAM: It's like "Nightmare on Elm Street." 
MARISHA: I was going to say "The Matrix." Your brain makes it real. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Uh! Uh! Uh! (laughter) 
MATT: Pretty much. 
LIAM: All right. 
LAURA: Not like this. 
LIAM: That really was effective. Letters, I think that was a good idea. 
ASHLEY: Me, too. 
LIAM: (shouts) Are you a doppelganger? 
LAURA: Oh, what is this shit on your sleeve? 
LIAM: I don't know. Is it a leech? 
TALIESIN: Doppelganger leech. 
LAURA: Ew, I thought it was going to be hard and now it's on me. 
ASHLEY: Now it's on your finger. 
LAURA: Give me a Kleenex, give me a Kleenex! 
SAM: That's what she said. 
LIAM: I don't know. I'm not going to sweat it. 
ASHLEY: Maybe mustard or something. 
LAURA: I think it's mustard. Wait, why would you have mustard on you? 
MATT: Trust. 
LIAM: I had some chicken satay in the back of Nana Morri's. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's chicken satay. 
LAURA: That's what. 
LIAM: So it could have got on my elbow. 
TALIESIN: Chicken. 
SAM: Thank you so much for your hospitality. Well, this is the first day we've been here, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: We should probably take it-- 
LIAM: Hours. We've been here hours. It feels like we're going to rest here, right? Probably will spend the night? 
SAM: We should probably rest. 
LAURA: Is everyone all right? 
LIAM: Well. 
TALIESIN: I mean-- How? Like, emotionally? Spiritually? 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
MARISHA: I think-- 
SAM: Are you all right, Ashton? 
TALIESIN: Uh... In many ways, yes? In some ways, definitely not. I'm going to be working through several epiphanies, sadly, while we are probably on the move. One thing I have thought about, because we did just do this trust exercise, is as the most recent and spectacular person to fuck up, it's worth acknowledging that it could've been any of us. We are a collection of fucking time bombs, and the possibility that any of us was going to do something stupid and hurt one of us was real and is still real. And I've been thinking a lot about that. That a bad day for you, Chet, or Laudna, or you, FCG, or the wrong thing stolen, Fearne, or the wrong moment to listen to your mom, Imogen. 
SAM: Orym's just great. 
TALIESIN: Orym's got some internal shit that, you know. 
LIAM: I don't know that if I would've shared everything I did, but I'm glad that we did. I feel like I have slightly better appreciation for all of you. I did already, but it feels a little clearer now. 
LAURA: Oh, if there's anything any of us can do to make you not lonely-- I'm not offering anything like untoward. 
LIAM: I didn't think you were. 
SAM: No. 
LAURA: I'm just saying-- 
LIAM: I mean, you guys, you're great. I'm happy to have you as my family. 
TALIESIN: Trust, I think, is just better when it's not easy, is what I'm starting to realize. Is that the only way we're going to be okay is because we are all in the same place of being deeply capable of fucking up and maybe that's good because who else would fucking tolerate or forgive any group of us? This is-- You are the only people I can think of who would put up with this shit. 
LAURA: Mm. 
TALIESIN: And I am forever fucking grateful. 
LIAM: I also don't know if we can wait for it to click or feel perfect. We got to do something now. The world's in disarray, everyone's scattered around, got their heads up their asses and, frankly, we're paying attention. If we can do something, we should do something. Tomorrow. Hopefully we don't arrive back and it's a century later. 
MARISHA: Something Fearne mentioned, feeling like there's no way we can do this or save the world. We're walking towards failure. Perhaps another part of this is just accepting the little ways in which we can help. What areas we can control. It does make me incredibly nervous that even Allura and Keyleth, and all of these powerful people don't, themselves, feel like they can do much. 
LAURA: Yeah, but they're targets. I feel like if we do it right, we won't be seen, you know what I mean? Like we're not so powerful that we'll catch their attention immediately. 
ASHLEY: I see what you're saying, I like where you're going with this. 
SAM: We're sort of expendable? 
ASHLEY: No. 
SAM: Well, I guess, in other people's eyes. 
TALIESIN: Inconsequential, I think. 
SAM: Inconsequential. 
MATT: Allura nods. 
LIAM: Who is going to take us seriously? 
MARISHA: Underestimated. 
LAURA: There it is. 
ASHLEY: I like that word. 
TALIESIN: Weird as fuck, every last one of us. 
MATT: Allura nods and goes, "To be honest, myself and many of the individuals that you've met and are part of this plot to prevent mass destruction have been entangled with the machinations of the Ruby Vanguard for quite some time. As such, they know us well, they expect us, and I believe have many safeguards and preparations in that case tailored. When you volunteered, and the things you've done in the past, I think you're not incorrect to assume that your lower profile puts you at an advantage. I'm not saying go too deep into this, I'm not saying go and throw your lives away. But find out what you can that you think gives us all an edge when the time comes for us to storm the Moon of Ill Omen. You won't be doing that alone, you don't even have to come if you don't want to. The job will, hopefully by then, be done." 
LIAM: Honestly, what's the alternative? Do nothing and wait to get steamrolled over a couple weeks later? I'd rather give my all and do something than lie down for it. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
LAURA: Same. 
SAM: Even if we die. 
LIAM: Can we get a round of drinks? 
MATT: "Not a worry, I'll get right to it. Peepers, help your Nana." (heavy impacts) Stomps over towards the tiki bar and you hear (clicks) Peepers, the strange rabbit-like creature skitters across the ceiling and looks down with its terrifying grin and then darts off after her. Allura goes, "(shudders) Just one more night, right?" 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Very well." 
LAURA: I mean, this whole thing about trust, right? I think if we go up-- How would y'all feel if I, if I gave in? 
SAM: What does that mean? Give in to-- 
LAURA: Every time I make a connection with Ruidus it feels like it's asking me to connect. And I push it away, I always have. But what if I don't? 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LIAM: What does your gut tell you will happen? 
LAURA: I don't know. But I know I have the right motive. And I trust y'all to bring me back if anything did. 
TALIESIN: Jump into that fucking lava. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I still say it's the season of the witch. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Find out who the fuck you are, that's great. 
SAM: Just tell us before you do it, okay? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no that-- Yeah. 
LAURA: Trust. 
SAM: Don't just go off on your own. 
LAURA: I'm not the doppelganger. 
SAM: I know. 
LIAM: We know. Fearne is. 
LAURA: Obviously Fearne is. 
ASHLEY: Obviously. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Speaking of Fearne, are you going to take this shard? They've told us a few times the more we hold onto it the more of a beacon it makes us. 
LAURA: I'm sorry I said I was disappointed in you, it's not-- 
ASHLEY: No, I felt the same. I feel like I've been scared of something that, in some ways, is inevitable but maybe not a bad thing. I think I kind of want it. I think I want to try it. And it came out of Ashton, so if it doesn't want to be in here, then it'll come out. 
LAURA: Do you think a part of you wants to be in her? 
TRAVIS: Hm? 
ASHLEY: Whoa, Imogen. That is a bit much. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: My, my, my, my. 
SAM: You crossed a line. 
TALIESIN: That's a little loaded, but-- 
LAURA: Sorry. 
MARISHA: Are you blushing a bit? 
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know. It's just hot in here. 
LIAM: Aren't we in a rooftop bar? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: It's muggy in the Feywild. 
TALIESIN: For whatever that spell means and whatever it means to whatever fucking thing my parents screwed up or otherwise, I can't think of anyone else who should benefit from it as much as you. I refuse to believe in destiny, but it seems like it was made for you. 
ASHLEY: I feel the same way. I don't like that whole thing. What do you all think? Yay? Nay? 
LAURA: Yay. 
SAM: If you're going to do it, I mean, you're home. 
MARISHA: You should do it now. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it'd be nice to have Nana here in case something goes wrong. 
TALIESIN: More lava. 
LAURA: Nana would totally be able to help out. 
LIAM: Yeah, got the Morrigan. 
MARISHA: You got the Fatestitcher. 
LIAM: Right on hand. 
MARISHA: I think you should give yourself more credit for having that control over your future. You're not that dark shadow of yourself you saw before. You're not your father. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay. Okay. I mean, let's give it a go. 
SAM: Like right now? 
LAURA: Let's do it. 
ASHLEY: Right now? 
MARISHA: We should. 
SAM: I mean-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
MARISHA: I don't think we should take this thing to the moon. 
LAURA: We should do it before we go to sleep, that's for sure. 
ASHLEY: Oh, in case we need to-- 
TALIESIN: I think we are just tipsy enough that this is a good idea. 
SAM: By the way, are you full health and stuff? 
ASHLEY: No. 
SAM: I will-- 
LIAM: Also, you should definitely-- 
ASHLEY: I can also heal myself. 
LIAM: -- have a shot first. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
TALIESIN: Actually, hold on. 
LAURA: We're taking a short rest while-- 
ASHLEY: A short rest? 
TALIESIN: Before we do this-- 
MATT: I'll allow a short rest. 
TALIESIN: Hold on. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's do a short rest. That's a good idea. 
TALIESIN: All right. How do you handle fire damage, out of curiosity? 
ASHLEY: Just kind of like a normal person. 
LIAM: I avoid it. 
TALIESIN: Okay, hold on. 
ASHLEY: Nothing fancy. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw you something. Make of it what you will, but during the short rest, if you have-- Do you have room for something to attune? 
ASHLEY: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: Or no? 
ASHLEY: I don't at the moment. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But I mean-- Let me see. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
LAURA: Oh, speaking of attunement, what about these items we got? 
LIAM: I pull out of my-- Where'd they go? 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LIAM: -- my armor. 
TALIESIN: I have a, if you want to look it up, ring. 
LAURA: I feel like this one should be yours, FCG. 
SAM: What does it do? 
LAURA: It increases your attack. You have better attacks by one. 
SAM: That's one better. 
MATT: Spell attacks, yeah. 
LAURA: And every time you cast a spell to regain hit points, that person you cast it on gains an additional 1d4. So it does more healing. 
SAM: I heal. That's amazing! 
TALIESIN: It's a Ring of Volcanic-- 
SAM: I have to attune to it. That's all right. 
TALIESIN: Ring of Volcanic Flesh, if you want to look that up. 
LAURA: I am down one attunement, if you want to give me back that staff, if you don't want what to-- 
SAM: That staff does amazing things. 
LAURA: Okay. Then you keep the staff. 
SAM: No, no, no. You can take the staff back if you think you'll use it. We have other items, too, that maybe you want. 
LIAM: I don't know how any of this junk works. I pull out the scarf and a little green monocle. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: The scarf is spooky. Do you want to look at this? 
MARISHA: Sure! Sure. 
LIAM: Do you want to break this lens, too? 
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at this. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: "This beautiful purple scarf--" 
TALIESIN: I put it down and I hit it with my hammer. (laughter) 
MATT: The more things change. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I didn't say I'd never do it again, did I? 
MATT: This is true. 
LIAM: So that's going to fly out of my eye when I'm flipping around, so. 
TALIESIN: Who is this good for? 
LIAM: Oh, maybe Imogen-- 
MARISHA: This might be better for someone like you. 
LIAM: -- or Laudna, or Fearne, or Letters, or really any of you but me. 
MARISHA: I mean, I don't have Magic Mouth. 
ASHLEY: That is a cool ring. 
MARISHA: But I kind of already-- 
TALIESIN: You can borrow it, if you like, or you could honestly-- 
MARISHA: I have fear stuff already. 
TALIESIN: Up to you if you want to borrow it for the run, or-- 
ASHLEY: Borrow it for the-- 
MARISHA: He's getting the stick I think. 
TALIESIN: At the very least. 
ASHLEY: Let me see. 
TRAVIS: Fear, oh that's pretty good-- 
LIAM: This monocle's good for seeing bullshit. 
MARISHA: Fear makes people run away from you. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
ASHLEY: Hmm. 
MARISHA: I don't have-- What is Suggestion again? 
TALIESIN: This also-- 
SAM: Inventory! 
TALIESIN: This also feels like a Laudna or Imogen thing. 
MARISHA: I don't think this one's right for me because it already has a decent amount of overlap-- 
TALIESIN: Switch. 
LAURA: Here, switch. Look at that one. 
TALIESIN: Switch. Switch. 
MARISHA: -- with things that I can do. 
LAURA: This is a purple scarf? 
MARISHA: It's a purple scarf. 
TALIESIN: Let's take a look? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: As we're like, yeah, we're doing this whole-- 
MARISHA: This could actually work. (mumbling item description) 
TALIESIN: We've said out loud what this does, right? 
LIAM: Yeah, I think we read it out loud last time. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Suggestion, Magic Mouth, Fear. 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
LIAM: Looks fabulous. 
TALIESIN: This also feels like either a-- Hmm. Either a Fearne or an Imogen thing, or-- Yeah, this feels like a Fearne or an Imogen thing. 
ASHLEY: Well, I don't need all that stuff. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
ASHLEY: Well, I could borrow the ring for the-- 
TALIESIN: Borrow the ring for the thing. 
ASHLEY: Just in case. 
SAM: Matthew, Dungeon Master? 
MATT: Yes. Mm-hmm. 
SAM: My grappling canon is attuned to me. I can't unattune it! Because it's part of my body, probably. 
MATT: I mean, you can-- It won't let you unattune it, you mean? 
SAM: Nope! 
TALIESIN: Interesting. Very interesting! 
SAM: But that's okay. We can figure it out later. 
MATT: Yeah, I'll figure it out later. 
SAM: Or if you want the Staff of Dark Odyssey back, I can give it to you back. 
TALIESIN: What does that do? 
SAM: That's the thing that teleports us around. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
SAM: It also has a couple extra little useful things, but it's mostly the teleport thing. 
TALIESIN: I've always got room for more attunement, so. 
LAURA: Yeah, I've got room for one more thing. 
TALIESIN: I don't attune nothing. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take it. 
SAM: Take what? 
LIAM: That's not attunement, so it's just stacks. 
LAURA: No, this is just a thing. 
TRAVIS: You use Detect Magic. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Stacks on what you got. 
TRAVIS: Oh wait. No, that's not right. 
MARISHA: The scarf? 
LAURA: The scarf is Suggestion, Magic Mouth, and Fear. 
TALIESIN: Which actually might work really well for Chet, even. 
MARISHA: That one's Detect Magic, See Invisibility, or Arcane Eye. 
SAM: I put the harness on Fearne. 
MARISHA: Both are-- 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
SAM: (laughs) Just in case! 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
SAM: Just in case. 
TALIESIN: We've had that short rest? 
MARISHA: Yeah, Fear means people can't get closer to you. 
MATT: Should be unattuned for you if you re-- 
TRAVIS: I need them to be close to do anything 
SAM: Refresh! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: I have the ring in there. I'll give it back to you, Ash. 
TALIESIN: No worries! Just for the run. 
LAURA: I could wear it. I could just keep it for now. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: You want to keep it? 
LAURA: Sure. 
MARISHA: Do you want this one? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: We'll figure it out. 
TALIESIN: Throwing you the weird-ass ring. 
SAM: It's gone. 
MARISHA: I've got enough spells and shit. 
TALIESIN: Kick ass. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All right, so you attune to that. In the process of shuffling this around you enjoy your tiki drinks that have been presented by Nana Morri. 
MARISHA: Plus, Chet with a monocle. That's pretty cool. 
MATT: She finishes off the tea herself. 
LAURA: Chet with a monocle is pretty fun. Laudna with the monocle, pretty cool, too. 
MARISHA: You in your velour jumpsuit and a monocle. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Don't hate the player, hate the game. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: (Morri 1) "Well, the manor is yours as much as you need." 
ASHLEY: Should I go outside for this? 
MATT: "For what?" 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MARISHA: Tee hee hee. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to take the shard. 
MATT: "Really?" 
ASHLEY: I think so. I think so. What do you think? 
MATT: "That's exciting! Fearne, I'm so proud and intrigued." 
ASHLEY: You are? All right. Can you stay here? Should I do this outside? 
MATT: "Maybe." She looks up. "Maybe in the garden." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: ♪ In the garden ♪ 
LAURA and ASHLEY: ♪ Hoh, garden ♪ 
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: (pant heavily) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You fucking-- 
ASHLEY: All right. All right. I'm going to go out to the garden. 
LIAM: Come on, hoes. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: Okay. Is anyone else joining? 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yes! Yes! 
LIAM: Yes, of course. 
MATT: Allura falls behind, being, "I'll be on barrier duty and whatever else is suddenly required of me if things go wrong. Just, if you need my help, say: "Help." 
MARISHA: Help. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. We got it. We got it! We got it. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: You're all filled up in your-- 
ASHLEY: I'm all filled up. 
MARISHA: -- your healthies? 
ASHLEY: I'm healthy. I'm ready to come apart in a million pieces and hopefully back together again. 
MATT: Allura stands back, sets some runic barriers around the outside. You're now standing amongst all the beautiful hedges. You can see the fireflies floating by. You can see the slightly floating candles that drift throughout and above the gardens out here. There's the beautiful faintly cloudy sky above and that gentle blue, purple twilight sense. Occasionally, a star peeks through. You can see peaks of the horizon and the nearby valley in the distance in the area where you once saw the visage of Ruidus where its brief, illusory arrival here in the Fey Realm last you had visited. But here, amongst all the strange people-like topiaries and sculptures and fountains and benches and the occasional sound of skittering, cawing, or other various creature noises that echo throughout the nearby woods, you step out into the central open clearing where there's a good solid 25 or so feet from any sort of vegetation and some stones that are laid out to connotate the center of this garden. 
ASHLEY: All right. Chet? 
TRAVIS: Yes? 
ASHLEY: You want to pop in the shard into the harness? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. You're rocking the harness already, right? 
ASHLEY: I feel like you're fast and can get out of the way if you need to. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
ASHLEY: All right, everybody good? 
SAM: Wait, we should prepare you for this. The things that you went through, Ashton-- 
LAURA: It was con saves. 
SAM: What is that? 
TRAVIS: Death Ward would be good. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Death Ward. Yep. Let me see if I got some-- 
TALIESIN: Death Ward is a really good idea. 
MARISHA: Oh, do you have where you can enhance Fearne? 
SAM: Some sort of enhancing of an ability? 
MARISHA: Yeah, of maybe her-- 
TALIESIN: Sturdiness. 
MARISHA: Her essence. Yes, her constitution. 
SAM: What's that? 
TALIESIN: Make sure she doesn't throw up-- 
LAURA: Your constitution is how healthy you are. 
TALIESIN: -- from getting super sick. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: I mean, I can try. 
LAURA: Wait, I have this upside down. 
SAM: Oh, stop the game. 
LAURA: Shut up. 
SAM: Sure, I can enhance her ability. 
LAURA: Thanks, Ashley. 
ASHLEY: You need to put your hand in there. 
SAM: Give you Bear's Endurance. 
ASHLEY: All right. That's a constitution situation? 
SAM: That's a constitution situation, whatever that is. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. 
MARISHA: You get advantage on con saves. 
ASHLEY: Get advantage on con saves? Okay. 
SAM: Let's see if that's true. 
LAURA: Or is it checks? 
SAM: Constitution checks! 
MARISHA: Checks. 
SAM: Yeah. Checks. 
LAURA: Cool. 
SAM: Also, you get 2d6 temporary hit points, which I will roll for you. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Look at that! 
SAM: Which you get an extra two and four. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TALIESIN: That item doesn't add an extra d4 to that, does it? 
SAM: I don't think so because I'm not healing. 
TALIESIN: You're not healing, yeah. Makes sense. 
SAM: What else? 
ASHLEY: I'm nervous. 
LAURA: You'll be fine. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: You'll be great. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: I hope. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll be fine. Nana's here. If something goes wrong, she can take care of it. 
MATT: Nana sits back and watches, and you watch as various creatures start emerging from the nearby wood and landing on branches, many strange little birds themselves with pincers that seem to emerge from their beaks and the singular set eye in their forehead, all gather in a cluster to watch. You see as Bompers, down from the Undermuck, the weird fur and oily antlered crocodile finishes a long steady march up through the tree and emerges. "(heavy panting)" 
ASHLEY: Hey, Bompers! 
MATT: You see he did not like the ascent through the tree, but comes to watch on the ground. 
MATT: (soft growls) 
ASHLEY: Hey. 
MATT: "(grunts) (growls)" 
ASHLEY: I'm going to scratch him on his chin. 
MATT: "(happy panting)" (Bompers settling in) Shakes some of the muck off, it splatters around. You watch as Sweet Pea, the sun bear, arrives with his big old scraggly beard. (Sweat Pea) "I was told to come watch. So I'm going to keep an eye." 
ASHLEY: All right. Thank you, Sweet Pea. 
MATT: The creepy sun bear stare. You watch as Dr. Nesbitt, Peepers, all manner of the beings and creatures that you grew up with all come to witness this as a circle of friends, familiar and unfamiliar, all gather throughout the garden. 
ASHLEY: This feels like such a spectacle. Okay. All right, we ready? 
SAM: Is there anything you want, like an item, a good luck totem, anything to give you strength? 
ASHLEY: No. Oh, I'm going to pop out Mister so he can be here, too. 
LAURA: Oh, that's great. 
MATT: (monkey chitters) 
ASHLEY: Hey, just hang out. 
LIAM: Do we think this is going to be just as hard? 
LAURA: Possibly. 
TALIESIN: Probably not. But, you know, maybe. 
LAURA: You don't know? 
MATT: Climbs up your shoulder. (monkey chitters) 
LAURA: Maybe you took some of the kick off of it, Ashton. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. We got this. 
TALIESIN: Maybe. 
LAURA: I'm going to walk over to Ashton and hold your hand. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the weird one. 
LAURA: The weird one. I'm going to lean over and kiss you on your cheek. 
SAM: Aw. 
LAURA: I'm sorry you felt you had to hide your motivations and your feelings from us before. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. It was nothing on y'all. It was just-- Well, here's to old damage. May we all get the fuck over it. 
SAM: Oh, I'm going to, if I may, I'm going to touch you and I'm going to do a Bonded Blessing, or I'm sorry, a Sympathetic Binding with her. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Just so I can get you some extra bonuses as we go. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. 
LIAM: Just above table, mechanically, you boosted one of her-- 
SAM: Con checks, but it's not a con save, so I don't think it's going to do much. 
TRAVIS: Any Death Wards? 
LIAM: All right. Well, Orym pulls out a little vial. 
MARISHA: Death Ward would be better. 
SAM: I think I used it. Let me look. 
LIAM: I think this'll help. I'm not really sure. Couldn't hurt. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: It's a potion of heroism, so it'll give you another 10 temporary hit points right now for an hour, but it also gives you the effects of Bless. 
MARISHA: (murmurs game mechanics) 
MATT: It doesn't stack with the ones that you put on there. 
SAM: But that's more. 
MATT: But the effects of Bless means that you-- 
LIAM: That's why I'm saying-- 
MATT: You get an extra d4 to any saves. 
LIAM: A d4 added to all your saves. 
MARISHA: Yeah. That's good. That's good. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: That's hard core. 
SAM: I don't have Death Ward. 
LAURA: You don't have it? 
LIAM: But Fearne, chug it right before you start. 
MATT: You memorize it? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: I didn't learn it today. 
ASHLEY: Chug it right before we start. 
TALIESIN: It's not an auto mode for your-- 
SAM: What's it called? Spare the-- No, what's it-- 
LAURA: Spare the Dying is a cantrip. 
MATT: No, Death Ward. 
SAM: Death Ward. 
LIAM: Oh, never mind. 
SAM: I didn't learn it today! 
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying-- 
LIAM: It's an hour. 
SAM: I thought we were doing a scavenger hunt. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's all right. It's all right, I think. 
TALIESIN: Always have a Death Ward. 
ASHLEY: I think it'll be okay. 
SAM: I know. 
LAURA: Can you cast-- 
SAM: Instead, I took Locate Object. 
ASHLEY: Cure Wounds on myself? 
LAURA: Or what was the thing you kept casting on Ashton? The-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, yes! 
TALIESIN: Which? 
ASHLEY: Yes. I know what you're talking about. 
LAURA: Aura of-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. (sighs) Okay. 
MATT: Aura of Vitality? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
ASHLEY: Aura of Life. 
MATT: Aura of Life. That's what it is. 
SAM: Mine is Vitality. 
MATT: Yeah that's true. Yes. 
SAM: Which I still have. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: I might use. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Aura of Life on myself. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. Yeah? 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to step away from Chetney before he pulls out the shard and just-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, you don't want to see this? You don't want to see this? 
MARISHA: No, you dick! 
ASHLEY: Oh, wait. Can you... 
MARISHA: Ah! 
LAURA: I'm going to go over to Laudna and I'm going to hug you. You can bury your head in my shoulder while I watch what's going on. 
MARISHA: I do that. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: At least until it's in the thing. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Getting into almost a runner's pose, unless-- if something goes wrong. 
SAM: Just calm her emotions if she acts up. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Yeah, Orym is going to kneel 10 feet in front of you so that you can see him and he can see you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: And I'm ready to go. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to keep my eyes on Orym. 
SAM: Oh, you know what? When I sympathetically bond to someone, I'm allowed to do it to three people. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: So I'm going to do you, you, and who has a lot of hit points? 
LIAM: I'm the doppelganger. 
TALIESIN: I'm fine. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: No, I mean, like, who has the most hit points? 
TALIESIN: I have 113. 
SAM: I'll take you. I may rob you of some of your hit points. 
TALIESIN: That's cool. I'm fine. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Cool. I'm into it. 
MATT: Okay. Nana Morri lumbers up behind, you have Orym in your original sights and this dark shadow of Morrigan, the Fatestitcher, about 10 feet behind them. 
SAM: Cool, cool, cool, cool. 
MATT: Just looking towards you with this big grin. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, booties? 
SAM: Little cozy for her can. 
TRAVIS: Open up the Bag of Holding and I take a pair of tongs out from behind my back. (slurp) Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
SAM: Where'd you get those? 
TRAVIS: What? 
SAM: Where'd you get those? 
TRAVIS: It was a part of my harness. 
LAURA: Yeah, right. 
MARISHA: Suction noise. 
TRAVIS: What noise? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag, grab the shard. 
LAURA: There's no reason the tongs would also be in the bag of holding. They have to be up his butt. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: They're not, they're squeezed between the cheeks, because that way they can keep them closed at the same time. 
LIAM: You do you, sonny. 
TRAVIS: Retaining tension is important. 
TALIESIN: Dynamic tension. 
MARISHA: Occasionally hear a muffled bing. 
TRAVIS: Hey, Fearne! 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
TRAVIS: Catch! (sploosh) 
MATT: As you pull the shard out, even just its presence. Laudna, you feel that like, (reverberating boof), and that voice be like, (Delilah) "Now's the time." 
MARISHA: ♪ La la la la la ♪ ♪ Meet you in the garden, oh garden ♪ 
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw for me. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Calm Emotions. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: Oh, and you're casting Calm Emotions? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: You have advantage on this. 
MARISHA: Okay. Advantage. 
LAURA: I imagine I'd be able to feel her tense up. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. We're good. 21. 
MATT: 21. The voice whispers in your ear, but it begins to fade into the background as instead you focus on the warmth of Imogen holding you. 
MARISHA: Only Imogen probably hears me go: Shut up, shut up, shut up! 
MATT: As you say-- And jam the spark into the back of the funnel on the harness, you feel it get close. The proximity heat of it lights up the center of this garden, as all these now hundreds of faces of all different sizes, all light up like they're staring at a bonfire but the bonfire is the back of Fearne. As the crystal gets placed there, you watch as it stops about an inch from the edge of the funnel and begins to slowly turn as it turns and rotates, begins to brighten brighter and brighter. The red turns to a bright orange to eventually a yellow-white. The heat of it begins to burn your back slightly as you watch the energy begin to drift into the funnel as it turns. 
ASHLEY: There's a bit of a tingle. 
MATT: You take six points of fire damage, reduced to three, I believe, if you attuned that. 
LAURA: Are you fire resistant? 
ASHLEY: With the ring that I'm borrowing from Ashton. 
TALIESIN: It's actually not fire resistant. Well, it might be. 
ASHLEY: Is it? 
MATT: Is your ring fire resistant that you gave her? 
TALIESIN: I'm double checking, I don't-- 
MATT: Or is it taking reduced damage? 
ASHLEY: Ring of Volcanic Flesh. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: How much did you pay for it? 
ASHLEY: Oh, when I take fire damage, can expend the charge to reduce the damage by 2d6. 
MATT: Got you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you might want to. 
MATT: So you just took six that time. 
TALIESIN: You just might want to wait for-- 
ASHLEY: That's fine. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: So keep that in mind. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh god. 
MATT: You can feel the heat transitioning into your chest. It's like you had just swallowed a warm tea or a hot coffee too quickly and it burns inside a bit. It's uncomfortable. 
ASHLEY: Ow ow ow ow ow. 
MATT: Yeah, it's uncomfortable, but not too much. Then it (whooshes) sears the inside. You take-- 
TRAVIS: That's different! 
ASHLEY: Ow! Ow! 
MATT: That would be 12 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: (grimaces) 
TALIESIN: This would be a good-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: This would be a good use of the ring. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Is it resistant? 
TALIESIN: No, but you could, in theory, undo all of that damage right now. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Now, I need you to make two concentration checks because you're maintaining your spell while you're taking fire damage each time. 
LAURA: Oh, right. 
LIAM: Bless is up, yeah? 
MATT: Yes, so you have-- 
ASHLEY: What did you say? 
LIAM: Plus d4. 
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw for each of these, but you add a d4 to it because of the Potion of Heroism. 
ASHLEY: That's right, okay. Okay. 17. 
MATT: Okay. And the second one? 
ASHLEY: I couldn't pick them up. Oof, not as good. 
SAM: That's still not bad. 
ASHLEY: 14? 
MATT: 14's still fine, you need to roll 10 or higher to maintain concentration on these until the damage grows to a certain point. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: And you-- well, no. 
MATT: So, unlike when the ritual had begun with Ashton, where the body seemed to be rocked with a conflicting source of explosive energy, this seems to be a gradual burning sensation. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: You watch as the crystal's light now begins to dim, you can see a light brightening through Fearne's skin. 
ASHLEY: (grimaces) I got it, I got it, I got it. 
MATT: It's poked through where the arms come through the harness and the neck you can see a glow beginning to emit from underneath. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
LAURA: You all right, Fearnie? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's like a little heartburn. It's okay, I got it, I got it, I got it. 
MATT: You take 16 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Ring? Ring? The ring? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: Any time. If or not. 
SAM: If possible, Ashton, you can still help. I will use Scatter Vigor. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: You take 16 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: Happily. 
ASHLEY: What? 
SAM: You get 22 points of-- 
ASHLEY: What? 
LAURA: Ooh, this is awesome! 
ASHLEY: What? 
LAURA: What a cool ability! 
TALIESIN: Or there's the ring. 
LAURA: Or stop doing that. 
TALIESIN: No, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm back up. 
SAM: Sorry, Ashton-- 
TALIESIN: No just-- 
SAM: It feels like good payback. 
TALIESIN: She'll figure out the ring at some point, that's fine. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Just hold onto it. Holding on. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw to see if you can maintain concentration on your aura. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Ew. That's a natural one. 
MATT: Natural one, your spell fades, your aura's now gone. Your spell has vanished. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: However, the crystal's beginning to crumble on one side and you can see as the glow is now filtering through the funnel, that glow, that dull orange glow underneath her collarbone and outside the edges of her torso is now getting to a brighter, brighter orange and you can see almost the edges of her hair are starting curl back from the heat. 
TRAVIS: Oh dear. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: You take, ho. That is 21 points of fire damage. 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Oh! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to use the ring, so it's 2d6 minus-- It's a minus eight. 
MATT: So that would be 21 minus eight, that'd be 13, I believe. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Two more uses of that. 
ASHLEY: Two more uses, okay. 
LAURA: Great. 
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. It's not too bad. 
MATT: As now the glow of Fearne is matching the glow of the crystal itself, you can see that same bonfire glow on all the faces around as creatures are shifting. You can see Morrigan seems to have ninja-catted closer to the back of Orym and you can see her neck is now stretched out to the point where you look up and her chin is right above yours, Orym. She's looking at you with a smile, unblinking, just paying attention. 
ASHLEY: (pained) It kind of hurts. 
MATT: "The things that are important sometimes do, my dear." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: "Right here." 
SAM: Bear down. I don't know, I heard that once. 
LAURA: Oh, there's another one coming! It's going to be bad! (laughter) 
SAM: This one looks like a big one! 
MATT: Adding a d6 every round. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That is going to be 25 points of fire damage to you. 
SAM: Ooh, this one's a big one! 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use a second charge on the ring. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Six... minus six. 
MATT: So 19 points of fire damage to you total. 
TALIESIN: You need to hit me again? 
ASHLEY: Oof. 
TALIESIN: Hit me again. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: I could. 
TALIESIN: Yep, I don't care. 
SAM: Or else I just heal her. 
TALIESIN: Either way, whichever's better. 
SAM: I'll do a Healing Word, if that's all right with you, Dungeon Master. 
MATT: Sure. 
LIAM: Got that branch attuned? 
SAM: Yep, I do. 
LIAM: Woo! 
SAM: So that's 3d4 plus three. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
SAM: That's terrible. Okay. Oh god, eight! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
MATT: Heal eight hit points. 
TALIESIN: Every bit. 
ASHLEY: Every bit helps. 
MATT: You feel like your heart itself is a burgeoning star. As much as it hurts, it also feels powerful. It feels like a core of strength you've never experienced before, like holding onto an unmoving rung of a ladder that's keeping you from falling, but it's inside you and it's holding firm. It hurts, but it's yours. 
ASHLEY: Ah. Ah. 
MATT: You take 28 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use the last charge in the ring. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: DM, I know we've gathered quite an audience, can I use the Monocle of True Essence just to-- 
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. 
TRAVIS: -- use See Invisibility and look around and see if there are any orbs that are watching or any other entities-- 
MARISHA: Yes! Yes. 
TRAVIS: -- that we're not thinking of that might be watching this. 
MATT: Yes, you may. 
MARISHA: Once again, very Fjord. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Fjord's back, baby. 
MATT: With See Invisibility, you glance through. You don't see any glowing orbs, but you do see there are three winged creatures that are perched on one of the nearby branches that were invisible beforehand. These odd, gargoyle-like creatures that have serpent necks that scoop down and as it comes up it opens a three-pronged flower and there's a singular eye peeking out from the inside. They're all looking at each other and watching this. 
TRAVIS: Fun. Oh good. 
ASHLEY: I rolled an 11. 
MATT: Rolled an 11, okay, so you reduced that. It was 28-- 
LIAM: Mr. Moneybags. 
MATT: -- minus by 11 would be 17. 17 fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You all watch as Fearne, now, the last bit of the crystal's starting to crumble and it's now this dull red cinder glow, while now Fearne's skin above the neck is now turning orange-white. You can see her eyes are starting to go from the normal colored pupils to themselves, a bright orange. You can see the light pouring out of it, her hair-- 
ASHLEY: It's beautiful. 
MATT: -- that you thought was curling back from the heat, is now curling back to a golden glow itself and she's starting to lift up off the ground. 
SAM: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: You take-- 
SAM: Oh no. 
LAURA: Are you watching now, Laudna? Are you watching? 
MARISHA: I am watching now. Yes, yes. 
MATT: Not that bad. 29 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: I think I'm going to-- Sorry, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I'm here for it. 
SAM: I'll hit you again. Four, seven, 12, not as good. 18 points of-- Oh, 18 points of damage to you, so that's 24 points of healing to you. 
LAURA: Nice! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm fine. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Oof. 
SAM: Uh oh. 
ASHLEY: It's all right. It's okay. 
TRAVIS: Just casually writing it down. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Give us a number. 
ASHLEY: I'm okay now, I'm okay now. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Doppelganger. 
MATT: (laughs) As you're drifting up in the air, you look up and can see the sky and the clouds and suddenly the image of your home and comfort space around you flickers into a flash of inferno, then back. (whooshes) Again, almost like your vision is blurring in flame. Okay. That's 32 points of fire damage. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
SAM: You okay? You okay? Okay, I'm going to go up-- 
ASHLEY: I have three hit points. 
SAM: I'm going to go up and touch her. 
MATT: Uh huh. 
SAM: For a 5th-level Cure Wounds. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: So that's-- 
LAURA: Add a d4 to that. 
SAM: Yeah, I already did. So, sorry. Nine, 17, 23. 33 points of healing. 
ASHLEY: Great, great, great. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Ugh, thank you! 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Is there anything-- 
SAM: That's my action. As a bonus action, I can do that thing again-- 
TALIESIN: Do it! 
SAM: -- but it will send me into a rage. 
ASHLEY: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hang on, hang on. 
TRAVIS: I can hold you still. 
SAM: You can hold me still? 
ASHLEY: Am I able to cure myself? 
TRAVIS: I have a Blood Curse of Binding. 
LAURA: Can you do it? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: We can try. 
SAM: I will bonus action. Sorry, guys. 
TALIESIN: Hold him down. 
SAM: I'm going to take from you and give to her. 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
SAM: 12 points of damage to you, 18 points of healing to you. 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
SAM: And I am berserk. 
LAURA: Can I try to calm his emotions at the same time? 
TRAVIS: I'll also use a bonus action to cast Blood Curse of Binding on him and I will amplify it. 
MATT: Okay, so let's do that roll-off here. 
TRAVIS: Okay. I need a strength saving throw. A strength saving throw. 
MATT: A strength saving throw from you, FCG. You also, FCG, take 10 points of fire damage from touching Fearne who is currently putting your hand in the middle of an inferno. 
SAM: I rolled a three for my strength. 
MATT: So as you reach in and heal her and pull back, you begin to go berserk. As you do, the ground beneath you suddenly feels like it's not moving. Whatever mechanical, Aeormaton fluid runs through your constructed body seems to freeze cold and your legs-- not legs, you don't have legs-- your wheel now feels bound to the ground, it will not roll. You cannot move. 
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry! 
LAURA: Is he taking damage from her, is he so close? 
MATT: He's just next to her. 
TRAVIS: You can't take reactionst. 
LAURA: Okay, but I'm going to use Telekinetic Shove to pull him five feet away from her. 
MATT: Okay, make another strength save. 
LAURA: So they don't take damage. 
SAM: Roll bad. Okay, nine, 10. 
MATT: 10, yeah. You begin to go berserk and prepare yourself to unleash on Fearne as your eyes turn red, and suddenly (whooshes) you're pulled five feet from her and she's just beyond your physical reach. The heat that would be burning you subsides. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
SAM: I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you! 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: FCG, no! 
ASHLEY: FCG! 
LAURA: That was a bonus action. Can I cast Calm Emotions on him as an action? 
MATT: As an action? You can certainly try. 
LAURA: I'm going to try. 
MATT: Okay. This falls beyond an emotional state. This is an actual, physical, berserk rage. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: This is less about his thoughts and more about the build up of tension within in his own construction. 
LAURA: Jesus. 
MATT: So it has no effect on him at the moment. 
LIAM: Orym's got his blade out and I'm going to hold an attack if he, if they break free. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. Fearne? 
TRAVIS: You fucking bitch, hold it together! 
SAM: I'm less concerned with me. Can any of you-- I mean (screams). 
LAURA: You might be able to heal her, though. 
SAM: Can any one of you guys heal her? 
MARISHA: I can try. 
ASHLEY: I can try to heal myself, too. 
TALIESIN: I got options. I got options. 
MATT: Your mind is in two places at once, and as you're looking up into the sky and you're aware of your friends around you, that burning pain in your body also feels euphoric. It's like you're connecting with something beyond yourself, beyond time, more ancient than anything you've ever experienced. In those moments when your eyes flash into the flame, suddenly, you have a moment more and you can see a landscape of fire, a beautiful, churning, broken land of flames but each flame has a life. You can see sparks like children running and playing and merging and vanishing like their games before there was language. You see a time before... a time before. Then the pain strikes back into you. You said you're going to heal yourself. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: You have a moment of clarity as the pain strikes in to try and cast a spell on yourself. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Let's see how I cast this. 
SAM: I'm going to spin up my buzz saw. 
MATT: (whirring) 
SAM: You don't deserve this. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
SAM: You don't fucking deserve it. You should've given it to Ashton. 
ASHLEY: FCG, not now! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah! Oh my god, shit. 
MATT: You start speaking. As soon as you say "A--" it goes quiet. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: You keep moving, but your lips are making no noise. You see Nana Morri still staring at her, puts her finger out and says, "Don't spoil the moment." 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: 20 points. 
MATT: Okay, so you heal 20. 
ASHLEY: I did it at 4th-level. 
MATT: Great. 
SAM: Oh yeah, she can probably heal a bit with Nana Morri. 
LAURA: Probably. 
SAM: And maybe Allura. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
LIAM: We're in a rooftop garden, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: You take 31 points of fire damage. 
MARISHA: What are you at? 
ASHLEY: I'm at 43, I'm at 43. 
SAM: She's okay, she's okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm okay. 
MATT: You feel now it's beginning to settle into you a bit as much as it's still burning. The rest of you watch as Fearne is lifting up in the air, the reddish glow that's gone to orange is now going to the yellow-white that the crystal had when it began to be placed in this position. Her hair is no longer hair, but a wreath of curling flames. 
LAURA: Awesome! 
MATT: You see the muscular, fur-covered legs are now a texture of smoldering, curling fires. You watch as they come together into a singular point that just becomes a trickle of flame that spirals down below her legs. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
MATT: Where her fingers are, that blackened expanse of her claw-like fingers emits red flames that burn up into a black. 
SAM: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LIAM: But she dies. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: But in style. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: That is 34 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: (high-pitched noise) 
SAM: Giggity. 
TRAVIS: Sam may roll another strength saving throw. 
SAM: Oh, I might never ever save from this. Three. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: This isn't a lot, but I'm going to cast a 4th-level Wither and Bloom around her. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: So you see all of the greenery from the garden start to get sucked dry and wither within it's as if the Feywild reaches up, and vines start to wrap themselves around your ankles as you're hovering and that energy gets transferred to you and you can roll three of your-- 
MATT: Hit dice? 
MARISHA: Hit dice. 
ASHLEY: Oh, sick! 
LAURA: That's great. 
MATT: As these vines reach up, they immediately ignite and these burning vines curl up to wrap around you to instill you with the life energy of this garden as they crack and crumble into cinder. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, I have a 10. Can I cast Cure Wounds on myself again? 
MATT: You can before it comes-- 
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds. So another 3d8. Oof. Okay. 15. 
SAM: Hey, that's great. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: You're still kicking. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: I am ready. 
ASHLEY: (nervous noises) 
SAM: Really? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay! 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
SAM: You sure your math is okay? 
MATT: You see her horns now where was once the smooth horn curl is a cracked, molten rock, not unlike the arm that Ashton now still bears, but bright with red color. You watch as they ignite, much like how the Balrog flexes in "Lord of the Rings." How the flames brighten up brighter and you can now see this halo of fire emits from her. She's now this being of flame. 
LAURA: Hot. 
SAM: I don't like that roll. 
MARISHA: ♪ Mm, she the devil ♪ 
MATT: This is a bad roll, you're lucky. So far. I still have a few more dice to roll. 
TRAVIS: Bad for us or bad for you? 
MATT: No, bad like it is a low roll. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: I still have four more dice to roll, though. 
SAM: Four more dice? 
MATT: That could've been a lot worse. It's 28 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: You holding? 
SAM: Oh boy, oh boy. No, she's not holding. 
ASHLEY: All right, can I cast Cure Wounds on myself again? 
MATT: You can, this is the last round. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to do it at 5th-level. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Might as well smoke 'em if you got 'em. 
ASHLEY: Smoke 'em if you got 'em. 
TALIESIN: Is this insane? I don't know. 
TRAVIS: I think last time it-- 
SAM: It fizzled. 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah, it evaporated. 
SAM: You could try. 
MARISHA: I'll do my last 4th-level spell for another Wither and Bloom. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Maybe if you took the potion and kissed it into her. Just sort of tongued it into her, it would be okay. 
LIAM: Aren't you silenced? 
SAM: I am silenced. 
TRAVIS: "Aren't you silenced?" 
SAM: Yeah, I am. 
ASHLEY: (counting softly) 
TALIESIN: And they say romance is dead. 
ASHLEY: Okay, that was a good roll. 
MARISHA: I'll do my last Wither and Bloom into you as well. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: So do it again, you see more tendrils of vines snapping up to you. 
MATT: You watch as the nearby hedges curl to brown and then immediately burst into flames from the proximity-- 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: The dried brush now igniting from the sheer heat that's blasting out of Fearne. The rest of you have to check your eyebrows as they're starting to feel like the hairs are curling back. You watch as some of the humanoid topiaries that are crawling up in their twisted dance poses, the greenery begins to break away and as they fall, you can see remnants of bones under the leaves. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: Leaving these standing skeletons in the same position of the garden. 
LIAM: Well-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Did you-- 3d8? 
MARISHA: Another 3d8. 
ASHLEY: Oh, nice. 
MARISHA: These are coming away from your hit dice. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: That you would use for a short rest. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I got it. So I rolled six of them. 
TALIESIN: A long rest will be very helpful. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: If we make it to a long rest. 
MATT: In this moment, your vision goes from the flashing imagery of the sky above, of your friends around you, the crossover of this ancient time of flame and history to darkness. In the middle of the shadow, you see a flame begin to rise and expand to an impossible size. To an immense size, a being you've never encountered of this great construction. You see an entity towering, made of just flames. It seems to flicker and shift around you, and it looks down at you like you're a fly. Then it looks at you like you're an eagle. You feel a sense of sadness, but then also a sense of legacy. (handful of dice rattling) 
LAURA: (nervous noise) 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That scary sound. 
SAM: (panting) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, when the DM's rolling a pile of gravel, that's not good. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Then another pile of gravel. 
MARISHA: Enough for a fish tank. 
MATT: 20. 
SAM: I'm making graphic hand gestures at everybody. 
MATT: (more dice rattling) 
TALIESIN: Jesus, the sound of that! 
MATT: Sorry. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I don't like that. Oh. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Grinding my teeth. 
MARISHA: Everybody stop. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: I think you have to back me up. 
MATT: 41 points of fire damage. 
LIAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: You still up? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Two? 
ASHLEY: I have 12 points. 
SAM: She's okay. 
TRAVIS: Oof. 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
LAURA: Of hit? 
ASHLEY: Of hit points. (laughter) 
MATT: In that moment of connection-- 
SAM: Of the hit variety. 
MATT: -- the entity embraces you. 
SAM: (gasps) 
MATT: The rest of you watch as Fearne has now lifted 20 feet in the air, her arms curl in like she's embracing herself. In that moment, the light becomes a bright white and she (surge of power) leashes her hands out as flames emit from all sides. The top of the garden get singed across in a 50-foot radius. All the rest of you take-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: (laughs) 11 points of fire damage in the proximity of this space. All of the creatures immediately scatter back, off to the sides. You watch as Allura puts up a barricade around, a magical energy barricade that prevents it from burning all the critters and creatures that were watching. And, in that moment, Fearne, the light begins to subside, the flames begin to die down, and you slowly lower back into your space. But as you all stand there, you can see Fearne gently lifting off the ground a couple of inches. Her hair is still curling flames, her eyes a bright orangeish-yellow color with little flicks of flame licking out of it. Her horns still this curved, smoldering, red-veined rock-like formation. The harness itself is the only dark part across her chest as she seems to emit light around her. You can see as the flames flick up her upper arm and the fire that licks off of her fingers curls into a black flame at the tip. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: No shit. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: You have that. 
SAM: Whoa! 
LAURA: Woo! 
TALIESIN: That's a big card. 
MARISHA: That's so big! 
ASHLEY: This is such a big piece of paper! Ooh! 
MATT: That should be in your feats now as well. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
SAM: Did she poop out a little shard? 
MATT: Just a (plop). Nope. 
MARISHA: Little raisin. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: (laughs) Just a smaller one each time? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh. 
LAURA: (laughs) Is it just amazing? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is amazing. 
SAM: Is she in an inFearneo? 
TRAVIS: Oh! Sam Riegel! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Get out of here. 
SAM: Sam Reich. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Sam Reich. 
MATT: He was the doppelganger all along. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LIAM: You okay? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: I want to read it so bad. Yes! 
MARISHA: ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ 
SAM: ♪ Disco inferno ♪ 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm standing! 
LIAM: Do you feel different? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: You look different. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You look amazing. 
ASHLEY: I do? 
MARISHA: Wait, do a little flame thing. I think it changed. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! Oh my goodness. 
MARISHA: (gasps in wonder) 
TRAVIS: Strength saving throw. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Well-- What's he doing? 
SAM: 19. 
TRAVIS: He's free! 
SAM: Ah! (laughter) 
SAM: I'm going straight for it! 
MATT: All right, make an attack. (clamoring) 
LIAM: No, I've been holding an attack! 
MATT: No, I know. 
LIAM: I go first! 
MATT: Yep. All right, so as soon as he gets free, he starts rushing towards Fearne. 
TRAVIS: It's been several rounds, to be fair. 
MARISHA: That is true. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: So let's say you hold it every round. 
LIAM: Of course! I've been protecting her. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Okay, so-- (laughter) 
LIAM: That is a 20 to hit. 
SAM: Hits. 
LIAM: Pushing attack, towards the edge of the garden balcony. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: That is-- 
MATT: You're not doing damage, you're just trying to hit him and push him back? 
LIAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: Knock him out! You got to knock him out! 
LIAM: Yep, yep, I will. I'm going to start thwacking him with the flat of this blade. 
SAM: I really don't know. I think you have to knock me out. 
LIAM: So that's eight. Eight points of thwack damage. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: You have to beat my DC of 17. Strength again. 
SAM: Oh, strength? Yeah, that's not going to happen. 18. (laughs) 
LIAM: Oh, you beat it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
LIAM: Attack, it's even higher, it's 24 to hit so you take another eight points of thwacking. Pushing attack. 
SAM: Oh great, yes. Successful. 
LIAM: Did you roll to save already? 
SAM: Wait, what do I do? 
LIAM: Another save. 
MATT: Another strength save. 
SAM: 14. 
LIAM: You fly back 15 feet. 
SAM: Ah! 
LIAM: I hit you again, natural 20. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: Dang! 
LIAM: You take 18 points of thwack damage. Pushing attack. 
SAM: Got it, yes. I'm taking it, this is good. 
LIAM: Beat a 17. 
MATT: Another strength save. 
SAM: Strength save. 15. 
LIAM: You get knocked back another 15 feet. I don't know if we're getting close to an edge. Have you had enough? 
SAM: I can't talk at all. 
TRAVIS: Allura! 
MATT: No, you've been pushed out of the Silence spell now. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: It was in radius there. 
SAM: Get your fucking hands off me, you little twerp! (laughter) 
LIAM: Action surge! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (sword slashing) 
LIAM: 28. Hits. 
SAM: This is all one-- Yes, of course that hits. 
LIAM: So you take 10 points of thwack damage. 
LAURA: This is all one turn? 
LIAM: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, he hasn't actually stopped yet. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Fighter shit. 
TALIESIN: (sword flourishing) 
LIAM: Pushing attack. 
SAM: You're going to die alone! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) No! 
LIAM: Pushing attack. Beat a 17, motherfucker. 
MARISHA: I forgot how much-- 
SAM: 16. 
LIAM: You fly back another 15 feet. 
MARISHA: -- horrible shit he says. 
LIAM: That's a 16. Does it hit? 
SAM: That misses. 
LIAM: Oh, you're so angry. Last one. 24. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: That hits. 
ASHLEY: "Oh, you're so angry." 
LIAM: Yes, that is nine points of thwack damage. 
MATT: At the end of this-- You're supposed to make a wisdom saving throw at the end of each turn. 
SAM: Oh, am I? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: Well, this is all one turn! 
MATT: Right, this one is, but I'm saying after this one, make it again. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Beat my strength save. 
SAM: Okay. That's cocked. Natural 20. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Natural 20. It goes (vibrating twang). (laughter) 
LIAM: I'm done. 
SAM: You're done? 
LIAM: Are you done? 
SAM: I don't think I am! Wait, I need to make a wisdom saving throw now? 
MARISHA: Were you supposed to be making them-- 
MATT: At the end of your turn. So, yeah, you shouldn't-- 
MARISHA: This whole time? 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: I don't know how this shit works! 
MATT: On your turn, you use-- 
TRAVIS: It's only the second time it's ever happened. 
MATT: You literally-- It's on your sheet. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: I know, I know, hold on. Where does it say? 
LAURA: You have a sheet. 
MATT: Well, first off, when you reach your stress limit, you immediately gain temporary hit points equal to twice your cleric level. 
SAM: So I get another 22 hit points. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Wow! 
SAM: Okay, great. Feeling great. 
MATT: You have advantage on all attack rolls, and you move towards the nearest creature. 
LIAM: Hey, that's me. 
MATT: But at the end of your turn, you make a wisdom saving throw, which is a DC equal to your current stress points. 
SAM: Which is 17. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Wisdom save. 
MATT: Well, first take your turn. 
SAM: Okay, I take my turn. Well, I've been pushed away from you by 15 feet. 
TRAVIS: 30, I think. 
MATT and SAM: 30 feet. 
MATT: Well, he hit you and then he closed the distance. 
LAURA: He was chasing after and pushing him. 
MATT: You're 30 feet from her, but. 
SAM: So I'm closest to Orym? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah, I pressed you back. 
SAM: Okay, I will attack Orym. Let's see what I'll do. Oh my god, what do I have? I will-- 
TALIESIN: Worth it. 
SAM: Jesus. 
MATT: You have to make a weapon attack against them. 
SAM: A weapon attack. 
MATT: Yeah, you're-- 
SAM: That limits things, doesn't it? I will attack with the hand saw. 
MATT: Go for it. With advantage. 
SAM: With advantage! Okay. That is a 20 to hit. 
LIAM: That hits. 
SAM: Okay. Seven points of damage. 
LIAM: Oh, ah! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) Plus, because if you're a cleric, you do an additional d8 divine weapon damage, don't you? 
SAM: Oh! Oh, that's right. You're right, I do. Another six points of damage. 
LIAM: Ease down, ease down! 
SAM: I will not! 
MATT: Now make a wisdom saving throw-- 
TRAVIS: Good "Alien"-- 
MATT: -- with a DC of 17. 
SAM: That's a 20. 
MATT: 20, that's a success. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Oh man. 
SAM: So I'm okay? 
MATT: You're okay. On a success you lose all stress points, lose all temporary hit points. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: So you lose the 22. Well no, the 22 would've gone away already. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: And the rampage ends. 
LAURA: Yay! 
SAM: (gasping breaths) 
LAURA: You just had to get it out! 
SAM: (heavy breathing) 
TRAVIS: Bong! 
SAM: Ah! (laughter) 
SAM: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry! Oh shit! 
MARISHA: You just, frying pan. 
SAM: Congratulations. 
ASHLEY: Thanks. 
SAM: You did great. 
ASHLEY: You did great, too, you fought past it, and you fought your demons. 
SAM: Don't worry about me. I'm just proud of you. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
LIAM: It's been a while since we've seen Sam rage. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Been a while ♪ 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: I forgot how to do a lot of that. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Thank you for hurting me. 
TRAVIS: Fearne. 
LIAM: Let's make that a last time, huh? 
SAM: Sorry I said stuff to you guys. 
LIAM: You didn't mean it. 
ASHLEY: I didn't hear anything, anyway. 
SAM: Maybe I did. I don't know. 
TRAVIS: You're literally on fire. Does that mean that we can't come near you at all? 
ASHLEY: I hope not. 
MARISHA: Can you control this? 
ASHLEY: Am I still on fire? 
TRAVIS: I'll walk up to-- (rapid pitter patter) and try and touch her knee. 
MATT: Do you want him to be hurt? 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: ♪ This girl ♪ 
TALIESIN: I think I know what that smile says, but. 
SAM: That was crazy. 
ASHLEY: How do you mean? 
TRAVIS: Say yes. Say yes. 
MATT: Meaning do you want to allow him to touch your knee? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah. You touch her knee and it's as hot to the touch as a mug that has very hot liquid in it, and it doesn't hurt you, but it's definitely hot. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: But it doesn't damage you. 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: What-- What do I feel like? 
SAM: Is it actual fire? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm going to walk up and hold my cigarette to it. 
TRAVIS: Caliente. 
SAM: Does it light? 
TALIESIN: That's not-- 
ASHLEY: I pull a little fire out of my finger. 
MATT: It ignites it when she touches it. 
SAM: Yeah, I need this. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh jesus. 
MATT: Oh my god. 
SAM: I was crazy back there. 
ASHLEY: Get your cigarette-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: So yeah, so you-- (laughter) My god. (laughter) So-- 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: What is the prop guy doing sitting there? Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: So in Fearne's now-neutral form state, she's still, she's not made of pure flame. She's still Fearne. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MATT: There's just parts of her that emerge as flame, the hair and the glow of the flames out of the eyes, and the tips of the fingers. 
LAURA: Is it all the time? She just always looks like that or she can control that? 
MATT: Well, you are currently in a specific form. 
LIAM: This is the-- 
TRAVIS: The Grand Poobah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I think I just need to learn how to control it. You know, maybe I have to learn how to dial it back sometimes. 
TRAVIS: I've heard that before. 
ASHLEY: And bring it out sometimes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I think it's just there right now, I don't know how to get rid of it. 
MARISHA: You know, as someone who had a fabulous teacher... 
ASHLEY: Very true. Yes. 
MARISHA: -- teach me fire, Maybe I could teach you a little thing or two about flame. 
ASHLEY: I think probably. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
ASHLEY: The teacher, or student-- 
MARISHA: Becomes the teacher, yes. 
ASHLEY: -- becomes the teacher. I love this idea. 
MARISHA: The cycle. 
LIAM: How's Little Mister handling this new development? 
MATT: So Mister's been watching from the sidelines as the flames blew by, like, "(awed monkey chitters)" He's looking up at you with these bright eyes. 
ASHLEY: Come, come, come, come. 
LAURA: Both of you are made of flame now? 
MATT: "(excited hoot)" Leaps up into your arms, and as he leaps in the air, you watch his body just (fire whooshing) burst into his flamed form, jumps into your arms and it looks like a little fiery monkey baby in the arms of his fiery monkey mom. 
LAURA: Aw! 
TRAVIS: Aw! 
ASHLEY: (laughs) That's my buddy. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "(cute chittering)" 
ASHLEY: Where's my Mister? 
LAURA: Where's Mister? 
LIAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh, there it is. He was on the floor. All right, well. 
TRAVIS: What happens if you don't let someone touch you? 
ASHLEY: What do you mean? 
LAURA: I'll go up and-- 
LIAM: You can choose, I think, to make the fire. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh, I understand. Okay, I'm going to act like I don't know you're touching me. 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to fly over to her. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Because you can fly now. 
LAURA: Because I fly. I'm going to lift up and be in front of you. 
ASHLEY: (chomps) (laughter) 
MATT: You deal 1d-- 
ASHLEY: Go ahead, I'm not paying attention. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll 1d8 for me. 
ASHLEY: 1d8? Okay. 
MARISHA: "Go ahead, I'm not paying attention." 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
ASHLEY: Eight. 
MATT: You take eight points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. Sorry! 
LAURA: Ow! Fuck! 
ASHLEY: Sorry! 
LAURA: That's hot! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: This is something I got to get a handle on. 
LAURA: Ow. 
TRAVIS: This girl-- 
MARISHA: ♪ Is on fire ♪ 
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and LAURA: Is on fire. 
MATT and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
LAURA: It looks really good, though. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: It's amazing. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: Wow! 
ASHLEY: I feel really good. I feel really kind of powerful. 
LAURA: I mean, maybe we are powerful enough to take on. 
ASHLEY: Maybe we are. Maybe this is-- 
LIAM: Are you even going to be able to sleep tonight? 
ASHLEY: Probably not. 
LAURA: But wait! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to-- 
LAURA: Wasn't your shard supposed to wake up your shard? Is your shard awake now? Now that you put it in your body and then spit it back out? 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: Did you feel like you awoke? 
MARISHA: Kiss. 
TRAVIS: You guys should hug and make up. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Hey, now. Hey, now, this is not-- 
ASHLEY: This is-- (flabbergasted sigh) 
TRAVIS: Shake hands! 
MARISHA: I'm just saying! 
TRAVIS: Shake hands! 
MARISHA: The legend was that they were husband and wife, right? 
TALIESIN: I feel like that's a lot of expectation to put onto people right now, especially with a fucking audience, so. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, for sure. I was just saying like a fist bump. Just to bury the hatchet. 
LIAM: But yeah, what if you just touch palm to palm. 
ASHLEY: I'll go put my hand out. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Shake on it? 
LIAM: Just holy palmers' kiss. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I shake and I-- (buzzes) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. 
ASHLEY: Did anything happen? 
TALIESIN: No, no. Yeah, throw the fire. I'm not going to do shit. 
MATT: So you clasp the new arm. As your hand touches his, you watch as those little veins that were once glowing when you first created the arm in the past ritual that has since gone cold, light up once more. As that orange-ish heat, those veins curl back through up into your arm, you feel that same-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: There it is. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, fucking go for it. 
MATT: You feel that familiar sense of belonging to the ground. When you sat for a bit in Whitestone, you felt that odd connection, but now it's overwhelming you. Through your feet, you feel like the stone in the middle of this garden, you feel in a brief flash, you can feel the history of the stone. You can feel where in the ground in the Fey it was carved and hewn and placed there. You suddenly, in that moment, hear, even above the tree, not fully connected to the stone of the realm itself, you see a flicker of flame in her eyes. Then as your vision fades out, you can feel yourself pushing through darkness, like you're burrowing through sand, but the sand itself is shale and rock. You are burrowing through the very earth of Exandria. You are pushing through the ground, and yet you are one with it. Suddenly, you emerge like a massive whale breaching from the ocean, but through the rock itself. You look beyond to an endless mountain range that is ever growing and folding on itself. You feel a time before time. You feel where the land itself was still forming, being made and unmade, where all the elements swam between each other, and in such creation and destruction was a singular process. As you come back to your vision, you feel this strength begin to fill your chest. The rest of you watch as Ashton seems to suddenly grow about a foot, two feet. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: You watch as the arm itself seems to swell and spikes of rock jut out of it, as around his torso, the bits of his skin begin to jut out in additional jagged spikes of stone and rock. You watch as his eyes begin to shift color into a faded gray coloration. Suddenly, both the smooth eyes of gray crack in the center, and where they crack, it's a vertical iris where a dull yellow glow just appears out. As you release your grip and pull back, the orange glowing veins subside, but you feel this sense of strength and sturdiness that you've never understood until now. You feel like as a being that spent their life feeling broken and un-whole, for the first time in a long time, not just because of what power you found in yourself, but the people that surround you, you feel complete. 
SAM: (gasps) (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Big paper! 
SAM: Everybody gets pages! 
MARISHA and LAURA: (excited cheers) 
MARISHA: So much paper in this episode! 
LAURA: Oh my gosh! 
ASHLEY: So much paper! 
LIAM: Oh, I saw one line and it blew my mind. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: You are invincible. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
TALIESIN: I wasn't ready for this before. Thank you. This is fascinating. (heavy exhale) (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
TALIESIN: (powerful exhale) 
ASHLEY: You look different. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you look smaller. What happened? You all look small-- Oh my! Holy fuck! (laughs) 
MATT: You look down, and your legs themselves, they trunk out towards the bottom. 
TRAVIS: Ooh, bell bottom! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: ♪ Bell bottom jeans ♪ 
LIAM: Got to be, pants have split. (laughter) 
SAM: Bootcut. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Apple bottom ♪ 
LIAM: No more skinny jeans for Ashton. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh my god, let's see. Okay, yep, yep, yep. 
TRAVIS: He's wearing sweats. 
TALIESIN: Just for fun. I have an idea. I need to see something. I'm going to fall forward, like face plant, and I assume that I can just meld straight into the ground?
MATT: Well, you watch as Ashton falls forward, and melds about half a foot before stopping, because you are at the top of a tree. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Shit! 
MATT: So it's like watching someone sink partway into the mud, but the mud is stone, and he gets a couple, like three or four inches into the ground before-- 
TRAVIS: Oh no! Oh no, I gotcha! Ashton, I gotcha! (straining) 
MARISHA: (laughs) Tiny Chetney. 
TALIESIN: Oh man. I'm trying to think of what-- Yeah. 
MARISHA: Do you want to go down to where there is stone? 
SAM: Fearne, do a trick! 
MARISHA: Tricks, tricks, tricks, tricks, tricks! 
ASHLEY: Hang on a minute. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
SAM: (as Fearne) Hang on a minute. 
TALIESIN: Yeah? 
LIAM: I start to do the worm. 
ASHLEY: Well, I have to save some of this stuff. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: But-- 
TRAVIS: We're going to take a long rest. 
SAM: She's pooping, she's pooping! 
ASHLEY: I emit a very bright light for 30 feet. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Out of your butt? 
LAURA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: No, I just like-- 
SAM: Oh! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I pushed it out and it poofed. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: Poof! 
SAM: Well, she was doing the international symbol for-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I had to push it out. 
SAM: -- butt stuff. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Should we go downstairs? 
TALIESIN: Race you. Yeah, and I'm going to fucking-- Yeah. Let's go downstairs. 
MATT: You watch as these two freshly transformed and odd gift accepted individuals begin to-- 
LAURA: (groans) 
MATT: (groan-laughs) 
TALIESIN: Mah. 
LIAM: Wow. The nightmare begins. 
MATT: That's terrifying. 
ASHLEY: No! 
SAM: It's the theme of the episode. It's the theme of the episode, guys. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You watch as the two of them, like two children excited to play a new game, go rushing out of the garden and down into the heart of Ligament Manor, as all the various creatures and critters begin to cheer and chitter and scatter off, and Nana Morri stands back up. "(satisfied inhale) I always knew she was meant for greatness." You all glance at each other and look back towards the two friends. Broken as they both were recently, finding a little shard of strength in themselves, and all of you together finding yet another little rung to hold onto in each other. Here, as the fireflies scatter around a bit, the candles floating, a bright moment of possibility seems to have lent itself to you in these moments before the journey of uncertainty lies ahead. And that's where we'll end tonight's episode. 
TRAVIS: Oh man! 
SAM: Wow! What a trip to the Fey Realm! 
TRAVIS: Upgrades! 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: Holy shit, this-- 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Upgrades! 
TALIESIN: We got to trade. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: As a note. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: The final effect of these forms will not happen here because this is part of the process, but future uses of this will enact the one penalty per use. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Makes sense there's a penalty. 
ASHLEY: There's a penalty with both, yeah. 
MATT: But it allows for a-- 
ASHLEY: But-- 
MATT: An hour, some pretty cool stuff. 
TRAVIS: Don't tell us. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Damn! 
TRAVIS: Can't wait to find out. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's some shit. It's cool. 
LAURA: Ni-ice! 
ASHLEY: I'm excited! 
TALIESIN: Okay, now I'm really deeply into this shit. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm glad we did it. 
TALIESIN: Yep, this was worth it. This is amazing. 
ASHLEY: (excited exhale) 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Bet you're proud of yourself, aren't you, doppelganger? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Still fooling them. 
MATT: This whole campaign she's been a doppelganger! 
ASHLEY: I've been a doppelganger the whole time. 
MATT: Good game, y'all. 
LAURA: Yeah, dude! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Pick up there next time as we finish your leg of rest and recovery here in Ligament Manor and on towards what strangeness lies ahead. 
LIAM: So much laughter tonight. 
ASHLEY: Ah. 
LAURA: Hah. 
TALIESIN: Ah, what a time. 
ASHLEY: So fun. 
MATT: Until then, thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)
