Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (garbled) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: (laughs) Yeah. But before we get into tonight's episode, we have some quick announcements to get through, beginning with our first sponsor, which is a brand new sponsor to Critical Role. 
LAURA: Woo hoo! 
MATT: An awesome clothing company called Snag. Sam, tell us about them. 
SAM: I will. Snag started five years ago in (Scottish accent) Scotland. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: But already has two million customers worldwide. They're a fully size-inclusive clothing company whose clothes actually fit every body. (murmurs of approval) 
SAM: If you've ever been told, thank you, if you've ever been told you're the wrong size, shape, or gender to wear what you want, you're not the problem, the fashion patriarchy is and Snag is on a quest to take them down one pair of legs at a time. Snag makes all kinds of clothes, but their original and most popular product is tights. But you shouldn't listen to Sam Riegel about this. 
TRAVIS: No? 
SAM: Tonight, why don't we let the tights do the talking? 
LAURA: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: Where are you going? 
LAURA: Oh god, what's happening? 
SAM: Okay. (grunts) 
LAURA: We can't even see you. 
SAM: (grunts) Okay. I think I can-- (goofy voice) Hello world, it's me, Snag tights. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) (general sighing) 
SAM: I'm-- (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: I'm plastic-packaging free and I use vegan dyes and develop my sizes on real people. I come in lots of varieties. Like-- 
MARISHA: Can the mic pick you up down there? 
SAM: Yeah, we got one down here for me. 
MARISHA: Oh, good. (laughter) 
SAM: Check out these. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: These over here, these! Cable knit Merino wool tights. 
ASHLEY: Those are actually pretty cool. 
SAM: Perfect for cold weather. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
SAM: Yeah, so warm. 
LAURA: Gross! I don't like it. 
SAM: Or these! 
LAURA: I like the tights, I don't like Sam. 
SAM: These fishnets, when you're feeling fancy. Ooh la la! 
LIAM: I've actually seen this-- 
SAM: They have tights-- 
LIAM: -- 1,000 times. 
SAM: -- for every occasion, the office, a night out, a cosplay convention, even a Critical Role live show! Snag has your legs covered. Also, the blood is rushing to my head and I'm seeing strange colors. Wait, that's not me blacking out, it's the dazzling array of colors and styles that Snag come in. 
TRAVIS: This is kind of perfect. 
SAM: Look at these! And these! (laughter) 
SAM: Oh no! I can't feel my extremities. Mommy! 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, no. 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, he passed out. 
ASHLEY: Well, whatever. Snag actually anticipated this happening, so they send all of us tights. Look at all these! 
MARISHA: Yay. 
ASHLEY: Woo! Show them off! 
LAURA: ♪ (joyful humming) ♪ 
ASHLEY: Clothes and tights that actually fit. Why the Snag not? Be sure to check out-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Why the Snag not? 
ASHLEY: -- all of their collection online at snag.world/CriticalRole. This is the back. Should we call an ambulance? 
LAURA: Nah. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Nah, he's fine, he's dead. 
MARISHA: He's fine. 
TRAVIS: We don't really need him. 
MARISHA: He'll be great. 
LIAM: Finally free. 
ASHLEY: Nah. 
SAM: Trade up. 
ASHLEY: Matt, Snag to you. 
MATT: Yeah, boy, thank you, Ashley. 
TALIESIN: Well that's fun. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Eh, he'll probably get more people on his Only Sams after that. (laughter) 
MATT: News from the royal court. 
LAURA: Did you say Only Sams? 
MATT: I did. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: News from the royal court of Darrington Press, the second edition for, For the Queen, by award-winning game director Alex Roberts is coming later this year. 
TRAVIS: For the Queen! 
MATT: For the Queen is an amazing, easy-to-learn collaborative card-based game of building a tale of love, betrayal, doubt, and devotion towards the queen as your characters accompany her on a journey. I love this game so much. Find the second edition of For the Queen, which includes a ton of new art and additional story cards on May 14th at Critical Role online shops, Darrington Press Guild Stores, and other familiar, familiar, friendly, local game stores. Brain, short circuit. But sign up for updates at DarringtonPress.com/newsletter. 
TRAVIS: (whispering) Newsletter. 
MATT: Marisha, you're up. 
MARISHA: Let's talk Candela Obscura. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy! 
MARISHA: The esoteric investigations of the Circle of Tide & Bone came to a rousing conclusion last Thursday. You can now watch the whole thing on Twitch and YouTube, especially for those of you all who binge watch, I see you, I know you're out there. I would like to give a massive thanks to our GM, Aabria Iyengar. (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: Yes! 
MARISHA: She's so dreamy. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: For leading us on these assignments, and of course players, Sam Riegel, Noshir Dalal, Gina Darling, and Liam O'Brien. 
ASHLEY: Whoop whoop! 
LIAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: We hope their investigations inspire you to go on your own. Also, Midst, Season 3-- 
TRAVIS: Three! 
MARISHA: -- is launching on February 14th. 
MATT: Woo! 
ASHLEY: 14th! 
MARISHA: It's a great little Valentine's Day present. So now you can snuggle up. The Midst narrators will join us for a round table next Wednesday, February 7th, with Sam and I. They'll answer questions about Season 2, showcase gorgeous episode artwork, and tease what's to come in Season 3. 
MATT: Ooh. 
MARISHA: While Season 3 will bring the current narrative to an end, do not worry, because there's so much more to this cosmos that it has to offer and we're so excited-- 
TRAVIS: Fire! 
MARISHA: -- to explore everything the Midst universe has with the amazing creative team at Third Person, and yeah, maybe talk about some new projects in the future. 
TRAVIS: Oh snap. Do you know if Sam is still alive down there? 
MARISHA: He's purple, but he's all right. On January-- Wait, let me start over. Our January-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I distracted her! 
MARISHA: On January, it's done now. Our January 4-Sided Dive with our guest host Abubakar Salim. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby! 
MARISHA: It's available right now. It was fun. I think we annoyed the hell out of him, it was great. 
LAURA: He's awesome. 
MARISHA: He's so great. We don't deserve him. 
TRAVIS: Abu! 
MARISHA: Now, we will not have a 4-Sided Dive this month, the month of February, so look forward to the next one in March. We just have a lot of shit going on. It'll make sense in time. 
TRAVIS: Mm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Thank you. 
LAURA: Speaking of March. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: Yes, Laura. 
LAURA: Nope, speaking of merch. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Out of the blocks! 
TALIESIN: Oh, I love it! 
LAURA: We have some. Would you like to see it? 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Oh, yes. 
LAURA: This has been out for a little bit, but I'm showing it now. We have this. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Hey! 
ASHLEY: Yay! 
LAURA: It's our Chetney Pock O'Pea pullover knit hoodie. Check it out! On the inside, it's like his hat. 
TRAVIS: It's so comfy, y'all! 
MARISHA: So cute! 
LAURA: Yeah, Travis has been wearing this one. 
TRAVIS: I wear it a lot at home and I don't wash it. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm like-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We know. 
LAURA: I didn't know that. (laughter) I might keep that one for myself. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: Or you can keep it, I have other ones, I'm sure. Then we also have, let me make sure I say it right. Yes, we have-- ♪ (triumphant fanfare) ♪ 
MARISHA and SAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: This is from Candela Obscura. 
TRAVIS: (whispering) Candela Obscura! 
LAURA: It's our blueprint T-shirt. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: You may notice-- 
ASHLEY: I love the blueprint. 
LAURA: -- or you may not, that it is an arcane siphon blueprint. 
MARISHA: Yeah! The artist is Shaun Ellis. He's one of the illustrators from the Candela Obscura Core Rulebook. 
MATT: Shaun! 
MARISHA: He's so great. 
LAURA: It's amazing and awesome and I liked the design so much that we put it on a blue one for the-- 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: Because, you know, variants and stuff. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Cute. 
MARISHA: It's so cute! 
TRAVIS: Watch out for that bleed. 
MATT: That's awesome. Thank you, Laura. Liam! 
LAURA: That's all I've got. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
LIAM: I'll talk about comic books, because we make them! Over at Dark Horse, we're back to Vox Machina Origins after a break. Series 4 begins with issue number one! 
TRAVIS: Let's go, baby! 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LIAM: Oh, mysterious disappearance, an ominous basement. Remember that from the home game? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Dark surprises await-- 
TALIESIN: Good times. 
MARISHA: God, yeah. 
LIAM: -- Vox Machina. 
TRAVIS: There's an asshole in that one. 
LIAM: The creative team features a new artist to the series. Love, love the work on these pages by Noah Hayes, and we have returning colorist, Diana Sousa, and letterer, Ariana Maher. You can look for it on May 29th, I don't know why I'm steepling my hands, at your local comic store. 
MATT: I don't trust you suddenly. 
TRAVIS: Don't ditch it, don't ditch it. You can't abandon it now. 
LIAM: For the latest updates on our comics, graphic novels, and other creations with Dark Horse, check out CritRole.com/DarkHorseGuide.

MARISHA: That was that metal one! 
TRAVIS: I got him in the dick! 
MARISHA: Holy shit! (laughter) 
SAM: You got me in the dick! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It took me two, but the second one was true! 
ASHLEY: Let me try it, let me try it! 
LAURA: The metal dice! The metal dice! 
ASHLEY: Wait, go back. 
MARISHA: You want to try?! 
ASHLEY: Did you use a d4? 
TALIESIN: Did you hit a nat 20? 
TRAVIS: I had to gauge the windage. 
TALIESIN: I was really proud of that. 
LAURA: Are you serious? You're going to try it, too? 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: Sam! 
MATT: While you prepare for your various-- 
LAURA: It's sharp! 
ASHLEY: Why are you covering? 
LAURA: That's a sharp one! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We're on the moon! We got to get serious! 
SAM: I'm not covering. 
MATT: There you go. There you go, that's the one. Hey-oh. 
LAURA: I don't want any of my dice touching Sam's dick.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. 
SAM: Poop. 
MATT: So last we left off, Bells Hells, after meeting with some of the various important Exandrian figures trying to plot along with you what is happening upon Ruidus and how to stop it, you put yourselves forward as the ones to do this intel mission to figure out as much as you can about the goings on so the Exandrian forces can plan accordingly when the time is right. In doing so, you rallied yourselves, and with the help of the Voice of the Tempest, you snuck into the Tishtan Excavation Site once more, seeing them now bolstering their defenses, new technology being incorporated into the surroundings of the Key itself. You stealthed past many members of the Ruby Vanguard and the Reiloran defenses. Attempting to climb to the Malleus Key, it seemed that combat was a necessity after some not quite as smooth stealth attempts had transpired, but I think, overall, you managed to climb towards the top piecemeal, somewhat rickety map piece, of an advancement to the Malleus Key, my apologies. But in doing so, you damaged and distracted a number of the surrounding guard in the vicinity. You fought the Thought Eater, one of the various powerful mystic Reilorans that was guarding the spot behind Otohan Thull, who had darted off towards the distraction that had been built by the remaining forces of the Exandrian mines. Upon climbing it, did so while also bringing along with you (laughs) a possum-transformed juggernaut. As you all found yourselves being thrust through the energy blast that is the Bloody Bridge, you found yourselves now standing on the surface of the red Moon of Ill Omen-- 
TRAVIS: Let's go! Let's go! 
MATT: -- Ruidus. 
SAM: What. What. 
MATT: Looking up you can see a portion of the sky is now encompassed by the beautiful, glowing blue-green sight of your home world, Exandria. As your eyes come down on the space around you, on the horizon you can see the majority of which is clouded in ever-shifting, either away or towards you, roiling dust storms of red in the distance, the dappled stars above still being slowly consumed by the ever-prominent and dangerous-looking storms, very familiar to you. As you look into the space around you, you can see the glow of the ground where the Bloody Bridge arrives here, filling the space with the reddish energy and beyond that, you see what looks to be a makeshift encampment. There are built walls of bone and glass and stone that have been put together in a ramshod manner. You can see there are tents and small structures surrounding this, like a temporary military encampment had been built around this arrival site. You can see there's a large pillar with a bell hanging on it. You can see there's the weird, reddish plant material, like a scrub brush that is growing and grasping onto bits of exposed stone around here, the first real sign in person of vegetation on this land, though unfamiliar in some odd ways. You can see spires of strange rock poking through the ground in places, like the very presence of the magic of the Bloody Bridge is tearing and pulling elements up from the ground beneath. But, this is an encampment and you have no idea how many people may or may not be in it, and you know there's something coming behind you, likely very soon. In this brief moment, before we go into possibly another initiative, what are you doing? 
LAURA: Can we see anybody visible right now? 
MATT: I'll put down the map for you so you can see it. (excited clamoring) 
SAM: This map brought to you by-- 
LAURA: That fast, that fast. 
SAM: This map combat brought to you by WizKids Minis. Fresh Cut Grass-- that's me-- Ashton Greymoore, and Fearne Calloway are ready to join your couch party. 
LAURA: Yay! 
SAM: That sounds dirty. Order your plush friends today. Check out the Bells Hells Plush at WizKids.io/BellsHellsPlush. 
LAURA: They're so cute! 
TRAVIS: Yo. Oh, snap. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Okay, so maybe not as ramshackle as I thought. 
SAM: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: Is that the bell tower? 
SAM: Did we see this before? 
TRAVIS: What is that for? 
MATT: That's the bell tower. 
LIAM: No, we didn't. 
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that for? 
MATT: And-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, if Scanlan could see me now, my sweet boy. 
SAM: Wait, what?! (laughter) 
SAM: You're Scanlan's dad?! 
TRAVIS: Huh? You don't know who-- 
MARISHA: Just dropping that shit right off the bat. 
SAM: Who's Scanlan? 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh! 
MARISHA: Oh my god. Look at the portal light! 
MATT: You all-- 
LAURA: Oh, that's where we come in. 
SAM: From which perspective-- 
MATT: This is backward. 
SAM: -- it does look like we're standing on pudding. (laughter) 
LAURA: I was going to say like Brie cheese. 
TRAVIS: Brie cheese, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yum. 
SAM: It's like some nice tapioca. 
TALIESIN: We got a moon. We're like, I knew it. 
LAURA: You guys. Do you remember our brunches? 
MARISHA: I know, it's what I immediately thought about. 
TALIESIN: Ooh, I love the little-- 
MATT: You're still in your wolf form. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that visual effect is amazing. 
LIAM: Well, right away, Orym's going to hop up onto Fearne's shoulder and hold onto her horns and scan around and see if anyone is in sight, sees us. 
TRAVIS: I'll-- 
MATT: Perception check. 
TRAVIS: I'll match his perception and look for cover, like structures. 
LAURA: We need to move. 
MATT: Still standing here in the center? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: We need to move now. That Thought Eater was coming through. 
MARISHA: It was a-- 
TRAVIS: Left to right. 
MARISHA: -- a Thought Eater and a juggernaut that's coming through? 
MATT: Possibly. 
SAM: Juggernaut might already be through. I'm looking for the possum. 
MATT: You look down and see this tiny little possum biting at your wheel. (ferociously chewing) 
SAM: I wheel back to him. 
LAURA: Don't do it. Don't-- Pick him up. Take him with us. 
ASHLEY: I had the bag, I was trying to put him in the bag. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: I'll gently put him-- 
TALIESIN: We got to move. 
SAM: -- into the bag. 
LAURA: Yeah, let's go, let's go! 
TRAVIS: Question for the DM. Is that an open space between the fences, or is that enclosed? Like are we in an enclosed-- 
LIAM: But is that just miniature? 
MATT: Correct, that is just miniature setup. It is enclosed. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. How the fuck do we get out of this fence? 
SAM: Jump. 
MATT: Well, make a perception check. 
LIAM: 27. 
MATT: 27. 
LIAM: Looking for anybody. 
MATT: Leaping up over that point, 27 is pretty decent. You do see, over in this area, there are two conversing Reilorans over on that edge. 
SAM: We can see through the fence? 
LAURA: No, he jumped up over-- 
MATT: He jumped up onto Fearne's horns and is glancing over quickly. You can see other figures walking through some of the tents. It is, now that you get a top view, you are in the center of probably about 60-ish buildings built entirely around the center of the Bloody Bridge's arrival place. 
LAURA: So cool! 
MATT: You've dropped right into the center of another encampment. 
LAURA: Can we jump up and over and hide behind these rocks right here? 
MATT: Right here? 
LAURA: Just get out of this way, I was thinking that way. 
TALIESIN: They're going to hit the bell. 
MATT: Yeah, you can. All right, so you rush over this way? 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, if we-- 
SAM: Sure-- 
LAURA: Will they ring the bell, you think? Is that an-- 
TALIESIN: Well, I think there's going to be-- 
LAURA: -- alarm or something? 
TALIESIN: -- people that come through, start looking for them. 
SAM: Are there any gaps? Yes, let's all move over there so we can huddle and discuss real quick. Are there any doors, gates, gaps in the-- 
LAURA: This looks like we're right by a tent. Is there somebody in this tent that we're just hopping over? 
MATT: You don't know. 
LAURA: Is there a door? 
TRAVIS: Go, go, go. 
LAURA: We got to move. 
TRAVIS: I will (sniffs) smell and use my keen senses to try and perceive if anybody's in there? Do I sense smell here? 
MATT: Sure, sure. 
TRAVIS: Anybody in there? 
LAURA: I think we should all be crouching and ducking behind things as we can. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
TALIESIN: I'm following the group and I'm trying to keep an eye on anything to hit. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Do we still Pass Without? No, we don't Pass Without-- 
MATT: So people are still moving back over this way. 
ASHLEY: We don't. I think I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: Wolf nose-- 
MATT: No, because you're currently concentrating on-- 
LAURA: The Polymorph. 
MATT: The Polymorph. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, that's a concentration. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: Yeah, it is. Fearne, where are you going? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over there as well. 
MATT: Rest of the group moves over this way, too. 
ASHLEY: Since Mr. Possum is in the bag of holding now, can I-- Unconcentrate? (laughs) 
MATT: You try to throw him in the bag of holding? 
LAURA: We put him in the bag of holding. 
ASHLEY: That's what we were attempting, FCG and I. 
MATT: Okay. Okay, well, who's going to try that? It's going to try and resist being grappled. 
SAM: Oh, I was trying to shove it in and she was helping by opening the bag. 
MATT: Okay, so make a strength check for me. 
SAM: Strength? 
LAURA: I guess the possum-- 
TRAVIS: Possums are fucking-- They're nasty. 
MATT: They're wiley. 
LAURA and MARISHA: They're nasty. 
SAM: Okay? Just a strength check, 15. 
MATT: Athletics, I'll say. 
SAM: Okay. Still 15. 
MATT: Still 15. Yeah, no, he didn't roll well. (laughter) 
MATT: (angry squealing) 
SAM: Just git! 
MATT: He vanishes into the bag of holding. 
SAM: Good. You're going to unconcentrate? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: He's in the bag now. He's out in the void. 
SAM: But won't he poof out and explode the bag? 
LAURA: No, it's a bag of holding. 
ASHLEY: No, he's probably going to-- 
TRAVIS: Suffocate. 
ASHLEY: -- die in there. 
SAM: Aww. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Laudna, what are you doing? 
MARISHA: Are people hiding? 
MATT: Yeah, they're all clambering over this side. 
MARISHA: Oh, I'll hide. (laughter) 
LIAM: Now we're back 
SAM: That's a lot of darkness. 
MATT: Dart to join over to this space. 
TALIESIN: Here we go. 
MATT: You following suit? 
LIAM: No, it's better to stay together right now. Yeah, I'll follow suit. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Now you can Pass Without a Trace? 
MATT: Running low on space over here, but you have a pretty leap so you can come down to this side if want you to. 
LAURA: We're trying to hide? 
MATT: You leap down into that space, which immediately reveals to you the opening to the back of this tent. On the inside, you hear something rustling. 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
MATT: Okay, you guys have Pass Without a Trace. 
SAM: She yells that. 
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace! 
ASHLEY: (yells) Be real quiet! (laughter) 
MATT: What do you do? 
TRAVIS: I was running towards the tent and I rolled in 19 to use my senses, nose and ears, to see if there was anything in the tent. 
MATT: Okay, so as you darted, passing him and land next to Orym in this space, you both (thuds). You hear the rustling. The scents here are unique. You've not smelled a space like this before. You've been near Reilorans, and you can pick up their scent a little bit more. But like, all of the surrounding flora, the stone and dust around here, it's overwhelming you for a moment, but it also means that you can very quickly pick up the scent of what is likely Reilora in that tent. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Should we rush him? 
MARISHA: In the tent? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: He'll send out a message to everyone around. 
TRAVIS: Oh because they do mental shit? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: It's about this moment-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: (sucks teeth) 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: -- that you see (ominous fizzing), a flash, a pulsing burst of energy from the Bloody Bridge itself as it descends into this place (thuds) immediately. 
MARISHA: Shit. 
LAURA: Are we hiding? We're hiding, right? 
SAM: We duck. We duck. 
MATT: You watch as the Thought Eater still bloodied and recovering from the recent conflict with all of you immediately darts out from the bridge and floats up in the air. Its robes floating around it. Shortly thereafter. 
TRAVIS: Celestial body. 
MATT: (explosion) 
LAURA: Another Juggernaut? 
MATT: One of the Juggernauts-- 
LIAM: Another Juggernaut. 
MATT: -- that was pursuing from behind and begins to clamber through. 
MARISHA: I-- Fuck, fuck. 
LAURA: Not now, Laudna-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) Rain check. 
TRAVIS: Unbelievable. 
ASHLEY: Stress reliever, but now's not the time. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I am going to cast Phantasmal Force on the Juggernaut, because I think he's going to be-- 
SAM: (loudly sneezes) 
MARISHA: Shut up. I think he's going to be stupider. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I want him to believe that he sees-- 
LAURA: I can't believe it. 
MARISHA: I can't believe this. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MARISHA: He sees the heels of me and Imogen and Chetney running this direction through the fence. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: There's no gap. 
LIAM: There's no gap. 
SAM: No, there is! 
MARISHA: We are-- 
LIAM: It's just an approximation. 
MARISHA: We are jumping over the fence. We scaled it and he sees us jump down and we're running that way. 
MATT: That's going to be a 15. 
MARISHA: Failed. 
MATT: Failed. He rolled pretty decent, but yeah. All right, so that's going to be your casting onto that point. Since they've arrived, and that was your initial jump point-- 
SAM: Initiative? 
MATT: -- everyone roll a new initiative. (groaning) 
LAURA: Should we roll for stealth, since we Passed Without a Traced and stuff? 
MATT: Pass Without a Trace and jump behind? Sure. Yeah, we'll say everybody can roll a group stealth check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Right. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: So stealth checks here. So we'll go with that first, and then we'll go to initiatives since that was what we're doing there. 
TRAVIS: 35. 
MARISHA: Oh, it's better than I thought. 
MATT: 35, okay. 
MARISHA: I thought it was two but it's a nine. Sorry, 25. 
MATT: 25, okay. FCG, what you got? 
SAM: Oh, sorry, sorry. 26, then. 
MATT: 26. 
ASHLEY: 20. 
MATT: 20. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
MATT: All right? 
LAURA: 30. 
MATT: 30. 
LIAM: 24. 
MATT: 24, got it. 
TALIESIN: 28. 
MATT: 28, all righty. 
TRAVIS: Ruidus moon landing initiative.
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: So, now initiative, 25 to 20. 
LAURA: 20. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a 23. 
MATT: 23. 
TALIESIN: I think so. Wait, is that a one or nope-- 
TRAVIS: So, Ashton, Imogen? 
TALIESIN: Yep, that's 23. 
LIAM: 24. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: Goddamn it. 
MARISHA: Oh wait, so Orym? 
TRAVIS: Orym, Ashton. 
MATT: Ashton. 
TRAVIS: Imogen. 
LAURA: Say it faster! 
ASHLEY: Orym, Ash. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Imogen. 
LAURA: Orym is before Ashton? Jesus. 
LIAM: Sorry, I was too busy thinking what the fuck are we going to do? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Orym, Ashton-- 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
MARISHA: 19. 
TRAVIS: 18. 
MATT: 19? What's your dexterity? 
MARISHA: Oh, I hate that. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too. 
MARISHA: 14 plus two to my dexterity. 
MATT: 14, got it, all righty. 
TRAVIS: Laudna, Chet. 
TALIESIN: Laudna, Chet. 
TRAVIS: 19, 18. 
MATT: All right. 15 to 10? 
ASHLEY: 15. 
MATT: 15, all right. 
TRAVIS: Good job, Fearne! 
ASHLEY: Thanks. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Wait, what was, wait. 
ASHLEY: Wait, I'm 15, what are you? 
TRAVIS: Laudna, Chet, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Laudna, Chet, Fearne, okay. 
TALIESIN: Orym, Ashton, Imogen, 
TRAVIS: FCG, gold balls. 
TALIESIN: Laudna, Chet, Fearne. 
SAM: Two. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
TALIESIN: FC. 
SAM: (roars) 
LAURA: How'd you roll so low? 
SAM: I rolled a two. 
LAURA: You're a cleric. 
MATT: With the Juggernaut, immediately like grasping its head for a second, then looking over in that direction (booms) slamming its fist together. The illusion that you would put through its mind, taking hold, our initiative order kicks in with Orym. You're up first with Ashton on deck. 
LIAM: Whew, I have no idea what we're going to do. So what I am going to do is crouch just off the side of the tent's entrance and hold and attack on if anything threatening comes out. 
MATT: Okay. So you dart off to the side where, right in front of Chet and you keep your weapon ready? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: You got it. So readying your action there for an attack in case anything comes through. That's the end of your turn. Ashton, you're up next with Imogen on deck. 
TALIESIN: Well, I suppose that's the end of my rage. I am going to try. 
MATT: Unfortunately. 
TALIESIN: Is it possible to get to the other side of that tent without being in the line of sight of this awful flying psychic nightmare? 
MATT: Unfortunately not. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah, there's not a whole lot to break eye contact with it because every other space you could do that is filled with your friends who are also hiding. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so there's no-- I suppose I'm going to hold a-- At the moment, I'm going to hold a rage. Well no, because then I spend it no matter what. That's silly. I'm going to-- Fuck it, I'm going to-- I'm going to hold my attack. Where am I there? We're hidden enough from this motherfucker, right? 
MATT: You think. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to hold my attack, watching, and keep an eye on him, but listening for Orym to do his thing. If I do, I'm going to try and take a swing at anything that gets close to me. 
MATT: You got it. Imogen, you're up. 
MARISHA: Because if they go ring this bell. 
LIAM: That bell, yeah, we need to-- 
MARISHA: It'd be awesome if we could silence it, but I don't think we have-- 
LAURA: But the thing is, is if they ring the bell, they can let everybody know with one thought. They don't need a bell to let people know. 
SAM: They must need a bell, otherwise they wouldn't have a bell. 
ASHLEY: Maybe that's for the non-Reilorans. Maybe the bell is for, like, their cattle, like let them know when it's time to eat and stuff. 
MARISHA: It's time for dinner? 
ASHLEY: Maybe it's for us. Maybe it's for Bells Hells. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: It's a welcoming gift! 
ASHLEY: It's to welcome us. 
LAURA: I have a question. 
ASHLEY: It's a welcome bell. 
MATT: Yes? 
LAURA: I feel like I would know this from having done spells a lot. 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: If I cast a spell-- 
MATT: Yeah? 
LAURA: -- that is in a different place than myself, like a distant spell. 
MATT: Yeah? 
LAURA: They can't tell where the spell originated from, right? 
MATT: It depends, because casting a spell, does it have a verbal component? 
LAURA: I don't know. 
MATT: It means you have to speak to cast the spell, which does make a little bit of noise. 
LAURA: But if I'm whispering. 
MATT: True. 
TRAVIS: It's a forceful whisper. 
TALIESIN: We're Pass Without a Trace. 
TALIESIN: Daddy didn't raise no whisperer. 
LIAM: Also, a side question. I feel like he would've said something, but-- 
TALIESIN: He's also an asshole. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Gravity's cool. There's no Total Recall, eye bulging anything? 
TRAVIS: Which one is it? 
MATT: Make constitution-- No, you're fine. 
LIAM: (gags) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Why would you say that? 
MATT: You're fine. 
SAM: We can turn into clouds-- 
LAURA: Yeah, but it takes a minute. 
SAM: -- but that takes a minute. 
LAURA: We'd be dead. 
SAM: We're dumb while we're doing it, too. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We'd have to find really good cover. 
LAURA: Yeah, we'd have to find-- 
LIAM: Then normal. 
LAURA: We have to hide. 
TALIESIN: If we're going to do that. 
MATT: What are you trying to do? 
LAURA: So your answer is, "Maybe"? 
MATT: Yeah, maybe. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: It's always the answer. 
LAURA: Mm. 
TRAVIS: He's floating in the air above the fence. People can see him if we attack him. 
LAURA: Yeah, we can't attack that thing. 
TRAVIS: Stuck. 
SAM: What's he doing up there? Is he just like-- Picking his nails? 
MATT: Right now? He's looking around. 
SAM: Picking his nails? 
MATT: Looking for all of you. 
LIAM: Yeah, because he chased us here. 
TALIESIN: Do you have anything defensive? 
SAM: He's checking his texts, now that he's home? 
TALIESIN: Nothing defensive. 
MATT: Uh, no, checking his Apple Watch. 
SAM: Okay, good. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. It's more polite. 
MATT: Reilora mystics, they're upgraded. Better than I am. 
MARISHA: We did see the Juggernaut, be like, "Gaw,"-- 
TRAVIS: Got no ranged stuff. 
MATT: You did. 
MARISHA: -- towards the direction. 
MATT: You're the only one who has context for what you did to it. So you noticed that. What you got? 
SAM: I can get us out of this wall if we can last a round. 
LAURA: To get out of the wall and then run? 
LIAM: Keep silently? 
SAM: We can silently open a hole in the wall. 
LAURA: Great. 
LIAM: That sounds good. 
LAURA: Okay. Then, once we're on the other side of the wall, we have a bunch of tents of Reilorans to get past. 
SAM: Yeah, but-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: -- they're not expecting us. 
TALIESIN: We're not readable. 
ASHLEY: Are we still dressed in the? 
SAM: Oh, didn't we take some clothes and stuff? 
MARISHA: Didn't we dress like-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Dressed like the Ruby Vanguard? 
MATT: Yeah, you still have Vanguard outfits on. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: For those of you that were dressed. 
ASHLEY: They might think we're just-- 
TRAVIS: We'll just be fighting. These two definitely know what to look for. 
LAURA: Yeah, but not everybody. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, but not everybody else. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Right. 
TALIESIN: I think we're psychically cloaked still, if I recall? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah, you're able to talk psychically to each other. 
LAURA: Yes. So all of this conversation is just-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Happening in half a second. 
LAURA: Okay, I am going to-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's great. 
MARISHA: Which is valid, that's a great point. So I tell everybody, I think I distracted the Juggernaut. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: I tell them that. So they hopefully don't ruin that. 
SAM: Do you tell us that as confidently as you just said that? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: What's your initiative roll, Orym? 
SAM: Yep. 
TRAVIS: We got through Orym? 
MATT: Yeah, we're on Imogen's. 
TALIESIN: Imogen's, maybe Laudna-- 
MARISHA: Can't confirm or deny. 
TALIESIN: -- and no one said what was going to happen before Laudna's. 
LAURA: Can I hold a spell? 
MATT: What do you want to hold? 
LAURA: For if they spot us? 
MATT: Sure. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Or if, yeah. If there's any aggressiveness towards us, I'm going to hold. 
MATT: Okay, you've got it. 
SAM: Let's go. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn. What spell are you holding? 
LAURA: That's a good question. (laughter) 
SAM: The Finger of Death. 
LAURA: I was debating. I was debating. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: Mending. (laughter) 
LAURA: I think (groans). I think I'm going to hold Lightning Bolt. 
MATT: Okay, got it. 
SAM: That's a good one to waste. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: That's a good one to waste. 
MATT: All right, so, that finishes your turn. That brings us to the Thought Eater's turn. 
LAURA: We're trying to get away. 
SAM: You're right. You're 100% right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: The Thought Eater's up there and scanning the vicinity. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
LAURA: Everybody, empty your brains. Don't think anything. 
SAM: Oh shoot, I'm thinking about not thinking about that. 
TRAVIS: It just popped in there. 
LAURA: It just popped in there. Ray? 
MATT: The Reiloran glances around for a second and you see it look frustratingly and it takes it left hand and does this. 
LAURA: Oh, the bell. 
MATT: As it does the bell-- (loud obnoxious ringing) (faster ringing) 
LIAM: (groans) 
LAURA: Told you we should have silenced the damn bell-- 
SAM: How can we silence a bell? 
MARISHA: We should run over-- 
SAM: That kind of magic-- 
MARISHA: -- and ram it. 
SAM: -- is impossible. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We can't hit him. 
TALIESIN: Probably not now. He's in clear view. 
MATT: He climbs up. 
SAM: Ska doo doo doo! 
LAURA: He gets higher? 
MATT: Yeah, he gets taller up there. 
LAURA: Shit. 
MATT: Because he's looking for a better vantage point, because he cannot seem to pick up your minds. 
TRAVIS: Also, if you could refresh us. 
SAM: Rings of Mind Shielding. 
TRAVIS: I know we just fought him. Was he super rough in any way? 
MATT: He's looking wrecked. He's looking real wrecked. 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
SAM: Take him out. Shit, we shouldn't have taken him out. 
ASHLEY: But we can't take him out there. 
TRAVIS: I forgot to ask how fucked up he was. 
SAM: I think Matt said it, but we just are too nervous. 
TRAVIS: Is that right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm, it's okay. 
MARISHA: Did you say that? 
SAM: He did. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I mean, he was still floating in front of everybody. 
TRAVIS: Kind of. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. Also, an attack with magic would've-- Everyone could see it. 
ASHLEY: Everyone would see it. 
SAM: It's like, it's bad. It's bad. 
LIAM: Laudna succeeded-- 
LAURA: But now it's super duper-- 
LIAM: -- in messing with the big guy's mind that he saw people climb over the fence? 
MATT: Maybe, we'll see. 
TALIESIN: God, no. 
MATT: That finishes his turn. 
MARISHA: Looks that way! Ah! 
MATT: Laudna, it's your turn now. The bell has rung loudly and now that it's come to your turn, you hear howls in the distance-- 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
SAM: Like wolf howls? 
MATT: This odd, echoey, like-- (howling and growling) Like, off in an area. 
TRAVIS: We got to push in that hole and run, yeah. 
ASHLEY: We got to go. 
TRAVIS: We got to move. We're on the X. 
SAM: (laughs) There's moon wolves? 
TRAVIS: Even if there's a dude in this tent, we need to get moving this way. 
TALIESIN: I'm sure he's scanning the horizon. How quickly is he turning? What's the spotlight speed here? 
MATT: On him? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: The guy facing. 
MATT: I'd say he's drifting-- 
SAM: If a werewolf is on the moon, is it always a full moon? 
MATT: Like he's doing the full-- 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh! (laughter) 
LAURA: How do you feel? How does you feel, Chet? 
TALIESIN: So we could possibly clock out of his range of speed if we were-- 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
TALIESIN: Certainly try, okay. 
MARISHA: He's turned right now. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Were we going to try and loop around and this guy also turned that direction, right? The Juggernaut? So they're both looking away. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say hopping into the tent is a great idea or at least a temporarily great idea. 
LIAM: There's someone in the tent. Letters are saying that can make a hole that way. 
SAM: I'm not trying to make it harder for us. I'm just wondering how this works. This is just a morbid curiosity. We can all speak to each other in our minds, but we also have shielded our minds from-- 
LAURA: No, but it's only against unwanted. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: It's Scrying and stuff. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Outer divination and things like that. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. It seems to prevent the-- 
ASHLEY: Don't question the magic. 
SAM: I just wanted to know how it works. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's the exact same as my circlet. 
TALIESIN: Whatever's in there will be surprised when we-- 
MATT: Gating what is not wanted for the time being. 
SAM: Got it. Okay. 
LIAM: Go to the corner. 
MARISHA: Fuck. Shit. 
ASHLEY: Should we try to-- 
TALIESIN: It's about to come out, anyway. 
TRAVIS: It feels like it's overwhelm the person in the tent or make a hole in the fence and run and start running. 
TALIESIN: He's about to come out, anyway. 
LIAM: We have no idea. It could be a scrub in the tent. It could be some heavy hitter. We have no idea? 
TRAVIS: No idea. 
TALIESIN: But they just heard the bell. 
TRAVIS: Also, it feels like we got to go by the tent to get to the fence. 
LAURA: Let's just go behind the tent. 
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Darkness at the front of the tent. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: So we can't see when they come out? 
ASHLEY: So he can't see when he comes out. 
LIAM: How wide is this? 
SAM: Or so we can't see them when they come out? 
LAURA: How big is Darkness? 
MARISHA: 15 feet. 
LIAM: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Can we go behind the tent? 
LIAM: They're going to see darkness. 
TRAVIS: Can we go around the back? 
LAURA: They're going to see the darkness. 
MARISHA: But then we can maybe run around before, and scooch by without a-- 
LIAM: But that's going to pinpoint us to where the darkness is. 
MARISHA: I can not do it, if it's a bad idea. 
SAM: No, it's too late. It's too late. It's done. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
LIAM: No! 
SAM: Does the darkness stay there? 
TRAVIS: I like it. 
MARISHA: That's way bigger than 15 feet, isn't it? 
MATT: 15-foot radius is that. 
SAM: Not diameter. 
TRAVIS: Radius. 
MATT: Five and 15. 
SAM: Does it stay there? Does it stay put or does it travel with us? 
MARISHA: It stays put. 
SAM: That actually might be good because they could all converge there, we're gone. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Actually, if it's covering part of the wall, then that's where we could-- 
MARISHA: I'm doing it, I said it out loud. 
ASHLEY: Do it. 
MATT: You toss it down, the area right there (magical energy) fills with a sphere of pitch-black shadow that encompasses both Orym and Chetney. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Both of you, your sight goes (vanishing) to darkness. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
SAM: But you can still hear and smell. 
TRAVIS: (sniffs) 
MATT: Indeed. You still have your other senses about you, but suddenly, your vision-- 
TRAVIS: I put my hand on Orym's shoulder. 
MATT: -- blinks out in an instant. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, you reach out and grab-- 
TRAVIS: Stay with me. 
MATT: -- Orym's shoulder. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, cool. Laudna, are you staying put or are you moving? 
TRAVIS: I'm like Matt Murdock. 
MARISHA: No, I'm going to move through. 
MATT: You can see through magical darkness. 
MARISHA: I can see through dark vision, or through darkness, so can I reach over and grab Orym and drag him with me? 
MATT: I'll allow it if you want to. 
TRAVIS: Darkvision doesn't work in this, right, though? Because it's magical? 
MARISHA: I have-- 
LAURA: Magical darkness. 
MATT: Yeah, you can see through magical darkness. 
MARISHA: I can see through magical darkness. 
TRAVIS: Damn! Pasta! 
LAURA: I was prepping the spell. I can still move though, right? 
MATT: Yeah, if you wanted to. 
LAURA: Can I try to get closer to the fence? Sorry, I would've done that, I just didn't say it. 
SAM: Goddamn it. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh boy. 
MATT: Now, here's the thing, you're all stealthed when you're-- 
SAM: Damn it. 
LAURA: Holding still? 
MATT: -- holding still. 
SAM: I can't close the-- 
MATT: If you're going to move-- 
SAM: -- the hole. 
MATT: I'm going to say, because he's watching, he's looking away, it's still going to be another stealth check to see if he can pick up on you. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: But we can do it. 
LAURA: Okay, so we have to roll a stealth check to move anywhere? 
MATT: So you move. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: You feel another hand, Orym, on you. 
LIAM: Cold. 
MATT: It begins to pull him forward. We'll say, Chetney, if you want to go forward, since you're next anyway, you could follow suit. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Okay. So make a stealth check for me, Laudna, if you don't mind. 
LIAM: We got to go right now. 
MARISHA: We still have Pass Without a Trace. 
TRAVIS: Stay with me, son. 
MARISHA: Do I have any other bonuses being in darkness? 
MATT: Nope. 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh my god. 
LAURA: We're going to die, man! We're all going to die! 
LIAM: There's a dead thing picking me up-- 
MARISHA: It's going to be a good year, it's going to be a great year. 
LIAM: -- that I can't see. 
MARISHA: That's a natural one. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
LAURA: Oh fuck! 
MATT: A natural one. 
LIAM: Fuck! 
MATT: Well, here's the thing-- 
MARISHA: I don't know why I can't roll this entire campaign. I'm pretty sure it's the dice. 
TRAVIS: Everything happens for a reason. This is how it's meant to be. 
MATT: So you create the darkness, you reach over and you take Orym's shoulder. Right as you move in, your foot hits this small divot in the ground, and your ankle, (cracks) pop! Pops out for a second. 
SAM: Fuck. 
SAM: Ow. 
MATT: You (tumbling) collapse onto the ground. Now, you make an impact sound, which draws at least the attention of this fellow-- 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
MATT: -- who turns, and he just sees a sphere of shadow-- 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: -- that sits there-- 
LIAM: A duck. 
MATT: -- which is now visibly present. 
SAM: Let's go. 
MATT: But nevertheless, that finishes your turn. 
MARISHA: He can't target us. 
LAURA: Would I have moved? 
MATT: Chetney, you're up. 
LAURA: Should I roll a stealth check? 
ASHLEY: Eyelash. 
MATT: Oh yeah, if you wanted to move at the end of your turn, then yes. 
SAM: Maybe we should just fight. 
TALIESIN: No, this is still working. 
LAURA: Okay, that's great. 
SAM: It is? 
LAURA: That's a 13. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We end with your turn, you make the hole, and then-- 
MATT: So over this way? 
LAURA: I would've gone over to the wall. 
TALIESIN: It'll be everyone else's round, practically, before-- 
ASHLEY: Everyone's going to get back. 
MATT: You're now, as you rush over to the wall, (vanishing) just darkness around you. 
TALIESIN: He doesn't get to move until a full round, so we're pretty good. 
MATT: All right, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to continue moving towards the fence. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we'll be gone. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: He's going to see a big hole 
TRAVIS: I've got Orym in tow. 
TALIESIN: No, it's in darkness. 
TRAVIS: So I'm moving towards-- 
LAURA: Can you make the hole in darkness? 
TRAVIS: -- where we were headed towards. 
SAM: We won't see the hole. 
TRAVIS: Even in darkness, I'll use my sniffing and hearing to hopefully keep a straight line. 
MARISHA: I can cancel it whenever I want. 
TRAVIS: Like swimming in the ocean at night. 
MARISHA: It's concentration. 
MATT: Yep, and you do. Then (splats) your nose hits the edge of the wall. 
TRAVIS: (whimpers) (laughs) 
MATT: As you just catch the, at the edge of the darkness. 
TRAVIS: Great. 
MARISHA: 10 minutes. 
TRAVIS: I'll whisper back to FCG: (whispers) Wall! 
LAURA: In his brain. 
TRAVIS: I will hold-- In my brain, yes, thank you. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: In my brain. 
SAM: Wall? 
TRAVIS: I will hold my attacks in case I see someone up in my face. 
MATT: You got it. All right, that finishes your go. Fearne, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Actually-- 
MATT: Oh! 
TRAVIS: I hold, with a bonus action, Blood Curse of the Binding. 
MATT: I'll allow it, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah? 
MATT: You're normally it's holding an action versus a bonus action-- 
SAM: I have to be able to see what I'm doing. 
MATT: -- but I'll-- 
TRAVIS: Let me just-- I'll hold the attacks. 
LAURA: It's already done. 
TRAVIS: I'll hold the attacks. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: We're on the moon, we got to start off on the right foot. 
MATT: All right, sure. 
LAURA: That's what I was asking. 
ASHLEY: Hi. Okay. 
MARISHA: Well, you can find a path, just a part of the fence that is not in the darkness. 
TRAVIS: Ash, dude. 
ASHLEY: Yes? 
TRAVIS: Ignore these people. 
TALIESIN: No, he can't. 
ASHLEY: All right, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to prepare-- 
TALIESIN: There's darkness there, he can't see. 
ASHLEY: Well, I'm going to bamf out Mister. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Let's get him out, ready to go, rearing and ready. 
MATT: (monkey hoots) Where do you want to throw him around? 
ASHLEY: Hi, baby. Just next to me. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Otherwise we're just sitting there like-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the wall's covered. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Then I'm going to prepare-- 
SAM: Om-ina Om-ina. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) I'm going to run to the darkness, and run 'til I hit the wall. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, if you keep running you'll hit the other side. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: 25, 30's your movement? 
ASHLEY: Yes. No, 35. 
MATT: Okay, 35. (thuds) 
ASHLEY: Ow! 
MATT: You run into the wall-- 
LAURA: Shh! In your brain you can say ow. 
MATT: -- alongside Chetney. 
ASHLEY: I said it in my head. 
TRAVIS: That's my strong backside. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh! (laughter) 
MATT: Mister's going to follow? 
ASHLEY: Mister's going to follow. 
MATT: He follows behind you in the shadow, and you hear (concerned monkey hoots) once he goes into the shadow. 
ASHLEY: It's okay, it's okay. 
MATT: (concerned monkey hoots) 
ASHLEY: What are we doing? What are we doing? 
LAURA: We're trying to get a hole in the wall. 
SAM: We're getting out of here. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That finishes your go? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Can I hold-- 
LAURA: Oh god. Now you have to make the hole. 
TRAVIS: If you're going to hold a spell on an action? 
ASHLEY: I'll hold Scorching Ray. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Okay, until you have sight on something. 
ASHLEY: Until I have sight on something. 
SAM: Sight unseen. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: So it is now the juggernaut's go. 
SAM: What? 
MATT: The juggernaut is going to bound-- (leaping whoosh) 
LIAM: Hey! 
TRAVIS: Nice. Nice! Nice. 
MATT: (thud) 
ASHLEY: Good. 
MATT: -- and begin searching around in the vicinity this way. 
TRAVIS: No one make a move. 
LAURA: Good job. Good job. 
MARISHA: I'm stressed. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Tell me I'm wrong. 
MATT: Actually, it's an interesting question, Phantasmal Force is concentration, Darkness is also concentration. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MARISHA: Wait, no, Phantasmal Force is-- 
TRAVIS: One followed the other, right? 
MARISHA: -- not. 
MATT: Phantasmal Force is concentration. 
MARISHA: Is it? 
MATT: It is. 
MARISHA: Well, he still saw that-- 
MATT: He did. 
MARISHA: It is. 
MATT: He did. 
MARISHA: He still saw it go that way. 
MATT: He saw it, he leaps over there. 
MARISHA: So now it's-- 
MATT: Now it's gone and he looks confused. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Looks up at the Thought Eater, and looks over at the globe of shadow on the opposite side, and goes like, (roars) and is preparing himself now to try and return. 
LAURA: Ruh-roh. 
TRAVIS: At least he went the other way. 
MARISHA: He did. 
MATT: He did, all right-- 
TRAVIS: Mind the gap. 
MATT: -- so finishing his go, you watch as a Reiloran steps out of the tent and immediately into the orb of shadow and you-- Actually, you don't see anything, except for FCG and Ashton. The rest of you hear some-- 
ASHLEY: And me. 
MATT: Yeah, and you and you. You hear the footsteps, something step into the space. 
TALIESIN: Is he within striking distance or no? 
MATT: Immediately steps back into the-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I hate this post. (laughter) 
MARISHA: (claps) (laughter) 
LIAM: He came out and did the... he did the Travolta. 
TRAVIS: Fucking something new every day. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: They're not all badasses, they are not all badasses. Good to know. 
TRAVIS: Matt, name a day of the week in this world? 
MARISHA: He Homer Simpsoned. 
LIAM: Travolta memed. 
TRAVIS: What's a day of the week in this world? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Oh, we'll say Miresen. 
TRAVIS: Miresen sucks. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Miresen? 
MARISHA: Wait, his name is Miresen? 
MATT: No, it's the day of the week. 
SAM: No, that's the name of the day of the week. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Because I know the days of the week, I was just having him pick one. 
MATT: Right. 
SAM: There's eight. 
TALIESIN: Miresens, am I right? 
MARISHA: I hate Miresens. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Miresens, am I right? 
MATT: Nah, I got that wrong. Anyway, so-- 
LAURA: (laughs) "Got that wrong." 
MATT: -- that brings us to-- 
LAURA: It's different on Ruidus. (laughs) 
MATT: I know. Days, it's hard to pick a day here. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: No, no, FCG, it's your go. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: We're one day ahead here. 
SAM: So much to do on this turn. First, glancing up, going to take a mental image of what Exandria looks like, because I'm going to check again in a few hours and see if it's rotated at all-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: -- to prove that it's a sphere. 
ASHLEY: Good call, you're smart. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: If it doesn't, it means it's not. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
SAM: Second-- 
TRAVIS: Yep, that's first. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Priorities. 
SAM: Second, using theater of the imagination here, Matt, it's a sphere, it's a sphere of darkness, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: It goes 20 feet up as well. 
MATT: Well, the point where you pointed it at, it would be a dome from your perspective, because you point it at a point in the ground and it creates a dome area. 
MARISHA: Yeah, 15 feet. It's a sphere. 
TRAVIS: So 15, 15, 15. 
SAM: So 15 feet up? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay, okay. So I'm trying to do my math here. So from his perspective, there exists a point-- 
TRAVIS: A horizon? 
SAM: -- yeah, behind which he cannot see. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) I see what you did there. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Math. 
TRAVIS: Damn it, it's not fair. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: So I'm going to scoot around the outside of the sphere, if I can still, stealthily. 
MATT: Okay. (wheels squeaking) 
MATT: 25, 30. You can't get around it, unfortunately. 30 feet only gets you partially to the side. 
TRAVIS: Where we're going, we don't need dice. 
LAURA: If you go straight through-- 
LIAM: Because of them rocks. 
LAURA: -- would he have gone straight through and hit the other side? 
MATT: If you want to try and come around this way, (laughs) you might cross visual perspective, but that'll get you a visual sight on the wall. But this way, you just don't have enough movement to get around the entire sphere. 
SAM: But I can see the wall, I just can't see the wall that's right behind the sphere? 
MATT: Correct, you can see the wall over on this side. 
SAM: Yeah, that's probably in his eyesight as well. 
LAURA: Could you have gone straight through? Does the sphere touch the wall? 
SAM: Could I have gone through, sort of bisect the edge, (laughs) in a as-the-crow-flies way and cut off five feet? 
MATT: I'll say because of the height you had up here and the sphere 15 feet, you could probably make a perception check for it. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Let's do that. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Let's give it a try. 
MATT: Let's see how keen your vision is here. 
SAM: Perception, 19. 
MATT: 19. As you're coming down the broken rock here on the edge of this platform where the Bloody Bridge lands, you see there's one little point where the dome of shadow and the top of the tent meet, and you have one little perspective point right there in the center where you think you can hit the wall-- 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: -- that might be blocked by either the sphere or the tent. 
SAM: Okay, I will do that. I will use the Staff of the Dark Odyssey, and I will aim it, and I'm going to cast Passwall-- 
MATT: Mm. 
SAM: -- at the wall, as low as I possibly can, maybe a four-foot-high door. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: You can make it go way past that. 
SAM: It can go as deep as I want it to. I don't know how deep the wall is, so I'll try and make it go (laughs) 20 feet deep. 
MATT: Okay, so you do that, and the portion of the structure there, dust goes (poof) around it in the shape of almost a slightly rounded door about three and a half feet off the ground, four feet off the ground. 
TRAVIS: Awesome. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Nothing's open, but you see that shape (whooshes) appear there. 
SAM: Wait, it's not open? 
MATT: Meaning it looks like a door-like space has been carved around it. 
SAM: Oh, okay. Great, okay, I will telepathically say, "There's a door open to the left of the sphere," and then I will use my movement to head toward it. 
MATT: Okay, and the last of your movement will get you 10 feet this way. So you are now within the sphere of darkness as well. 
SAM: Okay. (laughs) 
LAURA: Great. 
SAM: Right, I think that's my-- Oh wait, do I get a bonus action, or is my bonus action telling everybody what's going on? 
LAURA: Thinking. 
MATT: I'll say between glancing at everything, unless you have something at the ready right now? 
SAM: I don't. Go. 
MATT: All right, then we'll move on to Orym with Ashton on deck. 
LIAM: Wait, help my mind palace, I'm in the sphere or out of the sphere right now? 
MATT: You are in the sphere. 
TRAVIS: You are next to me against the wall in the sphere. 
LAURA: You know it's to the left of the sphere. 
LIAM: Of the sphere. (sighs) Jeez. 
LAURA: So walk left on the wall. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Your mind palace is as good as it would be for Orym right now-- 
LIAM: All right-- 
MATT: -- who's been in darkness for the past four seconds. 
LIAM: -- so I'll do this. along the wall. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay, so you push forward to the edge of it, you move your hand, and you feel a part of the wall (whooshes) give, and that section of it (thuds) hits the ground as dust kicks up. You step out of the shadow, and you're now looking out beyond the wall into what looks like an alley, and some stones and rock outcropping. You can see edges of the tent on either side. 
LIAM: Any threats for a 21 perception check? 
MATT: 21? You don't see any, but you can definitely hear those howls in the distance, and they're getting louder, as well as hearing footfalls scatter in the distance. You don't see anything immediately. 
LIAM: Okay, so there's alley ahead of me here? 
MATT: Mm-hmm, there's alley this way and this way. 
LIAM: Okay, so it's going like this right where we are? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Like a T-junction? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: I think really quick, "Left or right?" to the group, which would mean cutting up this way or going-- 
TRAVIS: You're the first. Make the call. 
LIAM: (sighs) 
LAURA: Or go straight out and run. (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) But it's not that way. 
TRAVIS: (bashes) 
LIAM: He's saying it's this. 
LAURA: Oh, it's an intersection. Left, always left. 
LIAM: Where he's looking, where the-- 
MARISHA: Always left. 
TALIESIN: He's going to keep turning. Well, actually-- 
LIAM: No, they're looking at the sphere. I'm going to go right. I'm going to this way. 
MATT: Go right. 
TRAVIS: Towards the people? 
LIAM: Because they looked at the ball, so I'm going the opposite direction from where they're looking, in my opinion. 
MATT: Okay, so that'll get you about here, following the edge of the wall. You're like (pattering). 
LAURA: You're moving towards them. 
LIAM: No, I want-- 
LAURA: You're following that wall? 
LIAM: The alley goes-- 
MATT: The alley goes this way and this way. 
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm imagining, guys, that they're going to be like, "What's that way?" So I'm going out of their line of vision. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, these guys? 
TRAVIS: Well, he-- 
MARISHA: I think we're talking about those guys. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, these guys. 
LIAM: I don't know what's out there in invisible land. 
TRAVIS: I think Laudna-- 
LIAM: I didn't say I was curving up the fence towards those guys. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you could come by the back this way. 
MATT: Go by this way here? 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: It'll be your dash action to get there. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's fine. 
MATT: I need you to make a stealth check for me. 
TRAVIS: You got this. 
SAM: It's right in his line of sight. 
LAURA: Right in his line of sight. 
LIAM: That is, it's good. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
LIAM: Two, 32. 
MATT: 32. 
SAM: 232? 
LAURA: 232. 
MATT: (laughs) 232. 
LIAM: That's what it is. 
TRAVIS: That's my boy. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, you keep low, take some of the dust and scatter it on the shield to almost blend in with the ground as you dart by as quietly as you can and get behind the rock, and almost tumbling into the shoulder as you get behind it and hold against it. You're fairly confident that nothing saw you for now. 
LIAM: Okay, so I'm looking for new Reiloran or anybody, and watching the hole where I just left. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. 
LAURA: Always watching the hole. 
TRAVIS: Mentally, were you communicating where you went as you did it? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Awesome. 
MATT: All right, finishing your go. Ashton, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
SAM: Are we going that way? 
TALIESIN: All right, I just saw that shit happen, and I just heard FCG's shit. I'm going to, in my head, say, "Hey, Laudna, I could use some directions when I get in here, so I'm going to pick up the healer and make towards the exit. Tell me if I'm going the wrong way." I'm going to go directly towards where I saw FCG dash to. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: ♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo ♪ 
MATT: You stumble almost into FCG, and you're now in the shadow if you keep moving. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab FCG-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: -- and I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: Just walk straight through. 
TALIESIN: -- and I'm going to follow Laudna's advice. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Do I recognize his rocky hands? 
MATT: It's hard to miss. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. 
MATT: The rough texture. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Daddy's hands ♪ (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Make it weird. I'm into this, all right. 
MATT: Take FCG, it slows your movement, but you pull him along a little bit. 
TALIESIN: So normally, I have 40 feet, so that gets us to-- 
MATT: Right, so it would've been 25 to get you there. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Then you finish your movement at the wall with everyone else. So if you dash, you can continue to move out there at half speed. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to dash and I'm going to take FCG with me through the door, and just-- 
MATT: Okay. Do you allow him to do so? 
SAM: Oh, oh, Ashton! Yes, I do. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: And I enjoy it. 
MATT: All right, so you step out of the shadow, and outside of this open door, you-- actually, you don't even see Orym, you step out and you're like, "Uh," there's an alley going to the right and left of you with a rock structure on the side. 
LIAM: I whisper: On your right of the tent. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, we have the-- 
LIAM: That's what I'm saying. 
TALIESIN: Do I have enough room if, well, obviously I can't bring both of us, but how much movement do I have left just? 
MATT: Bringing both of you, five feet. 
TALIESIN: Just by myself, 10 feet then? 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use whatever's left to try and get the most advantageous, please don't look at me. 
MATT: Okay, so hiding up against the wall essentially? Yeah, I'll put you there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm trying to pretend that I'm going, "Wow, the bell's ringing, what the? I'm wearing clothes that makes sense." 
SAM: Hey. 
MATT: Okay, well-- 
LIAM: Going to cover my eyes so I'm invisible. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, finishing Ashton's go. Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We're through. 
LAURA: I didn't use my spell, so that wastes that spell slot, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Okay. While I'm in the darkness, I'm going to cast Invisibility on myself. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Ooh, good idea. 
LAURA: Then I'm going to go find the hole. 
SAM: Wait, what? 
MATT: You find the hole and step through, you see immediately FCG and Ashton to your right. You heard Orym whisper to everyone, "To the right," and you glance over and you can just barely see him off to the side of the rock on that end. 
LAURA: I'm going to try to catch up with Orym. 
MATT: Okay, so that'll get you about 20 feet up to about there. You are invisible. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You're darting off in that direction. That finishes your go. All righty. That brings us to the Thought Eater. The Thought Eater is now going to, angrily look about in this area, is going to float over to this portion here. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: Yeah, it's going to Psychic Slam one of these rocks. You watch as this piece of stone (crashes)-- 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: -- lifts up off the ground for a second. 
MARISHA: He's about to toss a fucking rock at us. 
LAURA: What is that spell? Can I see him doing it? 
MATT: It's a Telekinesis type. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's Telekinesis, Kyle. 
MATT: Throws it into the sphere. 
LAURA: (gasps) I need all three that are there, that's going to be Chetney, Laudna, and Fearne as well as Mister-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: -- to make a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage because you don't see it coming. 
LAURA: No! But Laudna would! 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. All right. All right. 
MATT: Actually, you would, so you have it fine. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Question for the GM. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: Is gravity the same? 
MATT: It feels pretty similar. 
SAM: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: You haven't had a full moment to really try it out, but it feels-- It hasn't affected your mobility. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: 22. 
MATT: 22. You take half damage. So that would be 12 points of bludgeoning damage. Which is, indeed, halved again because you are in your wolf form. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Magic. 
MARISHA: 15. 
MATT: 15. You take 24 points of bludgeoning damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: As you are (forceful projection) bashed heavily by this rock. 
TRAVIS: A rock! 
MARISHA: You are knocked prone from its impact. 
LAURA: You have to roll a concentration check, right? 
MATT: You do. 
SAM: Oh, on the Darkness. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
MATT: Yeah, DC 12. So roll a constitution saving throw and get higher than 12. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Please stay, Darkness my old friend ♪ 
MARISHA: 18. 
MATT: Yeah, you hold onto that. 
TRAVIS: (rapid panting) 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. 
MATT: All righty, Fearne. 
SAM: Easy. Easy. 
MARISHA: So easy for me. 
ASHLEY: 12. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: 12? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: You also take 24 points of bludgeoning damage-- 
ASHLEY: The fuck? 
MATT: -- and you're knocked prone. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Where did that come from? (laughter) 
MATT: I need you to make a concentration check. 
TRAVIS: You got hit by an outcropping and you said: The fuck? 
MATT: Constitution saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Constitution saving throw? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh wait, I didn't do Mister, either. 
MATT: No, not yet. We'll do that in a second. 
LAURA: Oh! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh, a natural 20? 
MATT: Natural 20, okay. You maintain concentration. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what was that? What am I maintaining-- 
MATT: Pass Without a Trace. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You did a no-look roll. 
ASHLEY: What am I maintaining? 
MATT: You did great! 
TRAVIS: She did it like-- 
MATT: You're good. 
TRAVIS: She had her eyes on you-- 
MATT: You're solid. 
TRAVIS: -- and just went. 
MATT: I know! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: She didn't even know what she was rolling. 
ASHLEY: I forgot how to do the-- 
MATT: It's a good feeling, when the fear kicks in like that. I'm doing my job. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Panicked as fuck. 
ASHLEY: Mister. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Mister is at disadvantage, too? 
MATT: Yes. Because he cannot see. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 12, same. 
MATT: Yeah, takes 24 points of bludgeoning damage. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh, is he gone? Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
SAM: I think he's dead. 
LIAM: Gone-zo. 
ASHLEY: Is he dead? 
SAM: He's probably dead. 
ASHLEY: No, he poofed. 
LAURA: That's probably poofed. 
ASHLEY: I'll find out, I'll find out. 
MATT: Okay. But indeed, (tumbling stone) bits of chunked rock and weird purple-black slate stone and metal seem to burrow into the ground and jam out in chunks as there's now just rubble around all of you in this darkness. 
TRAVIS: Jam out in chunks. 
LIAM: The Reiloran in the tent's like: What the fuck? 
MATT: I know. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (rock slide) (laughter) 
SAM: He's in the corner just like: I don't want to go outside. I don't want to go outside. 
TRAVIS: I asked for a transfer! (laughter) 
MATT: That's going to finish his go. 
TRAVIS: I knew I wanted to be a cook. 
TALIESIN: That was pretty cool. 
MATT: Now that's going to bring us to Laudna. 
LAURA: Five plus five plus-- 
MATT: With Chetney on deck. You're prone, so you have spend half your movement to get up. 
MARISHA: I'm prone. Yeah, so I get up. 
ASHLEY: Five times? 
MARISHA: I head through the gate. 
MATT: Okay, it takes five, 10, 15 feet to step beyond the hole. You're now out of the Darkness. That's all of your movement. 
LAURA: That's 55, he still has hit points. 
MATT: You still have your action. 
ASHLEY: Mister is okay. 
MATT: Mister is okay? 
ASHLEY: Mister is okay, everybody. 
MATT: Okay, okay, good. 
ASHLEY: Mister is fine. 
TRAVIS: Really? 
ASHLEY: He's up. Yeah, he's got 60 hit points. 
MATT: He's a beefy boy. 
TRAVIS: Six-zero?! 
LAURA: Yeah, that's-- 
ASHLEY: He's a chonker! 
LAURA: By the way, that's what Trinket had at level 20. 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
SAM: But why does Mister do so much more? 
ASHLEY: Because he's a chonk-- Oh wow. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. Save it, save it, save it. 
ASHLEY: Save it for the fight. Save it for the fight! 
SAM: Save it for the fight. 
MATT: Laudna, you still have your action. 
TALIESIN: Take your time. 
MARISHA: Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
MATT: It's okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm gonna put this right here. 
TALIESIN: This is a panic. 
LIAM: Frumpkin had-- 
MARISHA: Can I take a minute to look left and see what is down the direction, the opposite direction-- 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
MARISHA: -- that we did not go? 
LAURA: But I stopped leveling in ranger. So he stopped getting hit points. 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. Why? 
LAURA: He was just a bear. 
MARISHA: 12. 
MATT: What was it? 
MARISHA: 12. 
MATT: 12? Glancing down that way, you don't see anything immediately in your eye line. But you can, kind of what Orym heard, you can hear the baying of some sort of beast, multiples of them throughout the vicinity getting louder and distant footsteps. 
MARISHA: If I dash, there's no way I can make it to where Orym did, right? 
MATT: You can get part way there. 
MARISHA: No. 
LAURA: Mm-mm. Out in the open? 
MARISHA: I'm actually going to head a few feet to the left. I just don't want to be completely crunched up. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: Maybe a little bit more. 
MATT: Okay. About 20 feet that way. 
MARISHA: And that's it. 
MATT: You got it, all right. So finishing that go for you. That's going to bring us to Chetney, with Fearne on deck. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll keep moving forward, having felt Orym pull out of my hand. I'll step out towards the door, or towards the wall, at least, and move towards the left was the last thing I heard, until I find the door. 
MATT: Yeah, you find the door. It only takes you about 10 feet of movement to get there and pull through. You emerge from the shadow and you can see your friends to the right and to the left. You can see, you do not see Imogen, but you can see FCG and Ashton immediately to your right. With the indication whisper from Orym, you know that he's to the right direction. 
TRAVIS: 25, 30, 35, 40. I couldn't get to where Orym is, so I will-- 
MATT: You could if you dash. 
TRAVIS: That's true. I'm stealthy as fuck. I will dash to where Orym is. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: But on all fours and with my belly in the dirt. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Okay. I will say, because this will cross into the eye line of the entity, and you're going full movement dash here, now that he has attention in this area very cleanly as well, especially since he shifted over to the direction, roll with disadvantage. 
TRAVIS: I normally have advantage, so just normal? 
MATT: Yeah, just a straight roll. 
TRAVIS: Ugh. 
MARISHA: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: I liked it more when I had advantage. 
MARISHA: I know, you said stealthy as fuck. But we still have Pass Without a Trace. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Still plus 10, still plus 10. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, if it is Pass Without a Trace, it's 33. Without it, it's 23. Because I'm moving away from-- 
LAURA: No, you still have it. You're within 30 feet of Fearne still. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: What do we have with this Heroes' Feast again? 
MATT: So-- 
LAURA: Immunity to Fear. 
TRAVIS: It's literally crawling through the Sahara, like I'm a lion and my body doesn't move, but just my haunches do. 
TALIESIN: I think that's a lizard. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Listen, it's my fucking visual. 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I am Nala. 
TALIESIN: That guy's having a weird day. 
MATT: From a technical standpoint, to be mindful of this, Pass Without a Trace, it's a 30-foot area around Fearne. So you can't cast it and someone runs off for an hour and they can stay stealthy. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, once you get away from them. 
MATT: Once you get more than 30 feet away from Fearne. So, you are just emerging from the area of that before you get to the area. So you would not get the Pass Without a Trace bonus as you make the rest of that run. 
TRAVIS: So it's 23. 
MATT: 23, still very good. It still beats his passive perception. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: You dart past Orym and after scooting along the ground. 
MARISHA: I can feel a twang in my temple. 
MATT: The dust is picking up a little bit. I mean, bits of dust get curled up in this area anyway from wayward gusts of wind. You manage to follow one-- 
LAURA: Other than the hole? 
MATT: -- gust of dust and dart into it and use that to protect your arrival as you dart in next to Orym behind the rock. 
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing) 
LAURA: Why the fuck?! 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Hey, Orym. We're on the moon. 
LAURA: What the fuck? 
TRAVIS: In my head. What? 
SAM: Nothing. 
TRAVIS: Okay. That's my turn. 
SAM: I thought he didn't know anyone on the moon. 
MATT: That finishes your turn. 
SAM: But I forgot that we've been here-- 
MATT: Fearne, you're up. 
SAM: -- like seven times. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Ow. 
MARISHA: Do we have to go home? 
TRAVIS: Eyes are crossing over here. We must have missed something or forgotten something. 
LAURA: And now we can't do it because you used the charges. 
ASHLEY: So, I'm prone, right? 
MATT: You are prone, yes. 
ASHLEY: So I'm going to try to find where the opening is. 
MATT: Okay, are you going to get up? 
LAURA: You could have done that as soon as we landed. 
ASHLEY: Get up, and yeah, move through. 
LAURA: You could have done that as soon as we landed. 
MATT: You shift over, you find it. 
SAM: Why didn't we talk about this? 
MATT: The end of your movement is getting out of the opening. So you still have your action. You can dash or you can cast a spell. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to look both ways. 
LIAM: Can you still use it? 
ASHLEY: Can I see anybody? 
LAURA: No, he used up the charges. 
SAM: No! 
ASHLEY: What happened? 
SAM: Sorry. I fucked up, everybody. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: I fucked up. 
MARISHA: You didn't fuck up. 
SAM: Go on. 
ASHLEY: Can't we do it now? 
SAM: No! 
LAURA: No! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: We can't, if we all meet up? 
SAM: I'm bad at D&D, keep going. 
LAURA: No, we can't. We really can't. 
ASHLEY: No, you're not. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay wait. So if I go out, look each way, do I see Imogen, do I see? 
LAURA: No, I'm in Darkness. 
MATT: You don't see Imogen. You see FCG and Ashton to your right and you see Laudna to your left. 
LAURA: And Chetney. 
MATT: I'll say with your passive perception, you do not see Chetney. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Should we all go back to the dark bubble? 
ASHLEY: So you ended up going to the left? 
MARISHA: I did, but just 10, 15 feet. Just because I couldn't make it all the way there and I didn't want to be out in the open. 
ASHLEY: Okay, all right. 
MARISHA: I didn't want to clump up, either. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to just make a run for it. I'm just going to dash. If I can see-- Wait, do I see Orym? I'm so sorry. Did you already say this? 
MATT: I'd say yeah. I'd say you didn't see Chetney approach because he was in the process of stealthing, but you can see Orym behind the wall. 
LIAM: I think when I got on the other side of that tent knowing I was blocked from those guys' view, I'm popping up like a hedgehog so that the gang can see me. 
TRAVIS: Meerkat? 
LIAM: Meerkat. 
MATT: So, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm just going to make a dash. I'm going to run for it and I'm going to see Orym and I'm going to run as fast as my hooves can take me. 
MATT: About 30, that'll get you-- 
TRAVIS: Clop clop clop. 
ASHLEY: 35? 
MATT: Oh, 35? 
ASHLEY: 35. 
MATT: You almost shoulder slam an invisible Imogen. You see Fearne clomping up behind you and then (shift). Make a stealth check for me with disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Plus 10, right? 
ASHLEY: Plus 10. 
MATT: You are stopping in the middle of the open here. 
LAURA: Just right-- 
SAM: Good lord. 
LAURA: -- in the middle of the open. 
LIAM: Oh my gosh. 
ASHLEY: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay, I don't need that one. I'll just do another one, I have so many. Okay. Oh, disadvantage. Okay. 24. 
MATT: Okay, 24. Still pretty good. So as you dart and you realize, you skid and you're not going to make it in time as you can sense the Thought Eater looking in your direction. You crouch as low as you can and kind of-- 
ASHLEY: Don't perceive me! 
MATT: Almost like a-- Oh, what are they? The dust bunnies. The ones that, the desert rats that shiver in the dirt and the dust kicks up around it. You get low and do that for a second and cause this cloud dust to get up around you. 
LAURA: You know what, her cloak color might actually blend in with the dust of-- 
MATT: You're uncertain if it was enough. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You don't know. 
LAURA: Can I see her very well? 
MATT: Yes, because she ran past you and then (scurrying) into the dirt. 
TRAVIS: Started to burrow right in front of you. 
LAURA: In her head, she's just going to hear: Cool. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I can still see you. 
MATT: Yeah. Is Mister coming? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: What's his movement? 
ASHLEY: Wait, so even with the dash, that's as far as I can get is right out there? 
MATT: Unfortunately, because getting up is half your movement. 
ASHLEY: Fuck, I forgot I had to get up, that's right. 
MATT: 15, 20 or so feet to get beyond the door and then it's 35 feet in a straight line. So you make the run and you're just not quite going to get there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: I love that so much. 
MATT: Mister has a movement of what? Fly speed of something, 30 feet? 
ASHLEY: He has a-- So sorry. 
LIAM: It's okay, it's just a quarter mile to go. 
MATT: It's okay. 
ASHLEY: I think he's 30. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: So he darts. He didn't have to worry about getting up too hard from prone. 
ASHLEY: (uncertain wavering) I'm going to keep him there. 
MATT: Keep him in the shadow? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to keep him in the shadow. Well, fuck. 
MATT: You can move him just beyond the wall. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll move him a little bit beyond the wall. 
MARISHA: Okay, so he comes up behind FCG. "(monkey hoots)" 
ASHLEY: Perfect. 
MATT: Glance off the side, little flaming, floating elemental spirit. 
MARISHA: Should we all go back to the dark, the hole-- 
MATT: Finishing Fearne's go. 
MARISHA: -- then teleport in? 
SAM: I can't. 
ASHLEY: That might be so dumb, what I just did. 
LAURA: He can't do it. 
ASHLEY: That was dumb. 
MARISHA: Oh, you're out of charges on the staff? 
TRAVIS: Big boy's moving, big boy moving. 
SAM: Yeah, I did bad, I did bad. 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: No, you didn't. No, you didn't. 
SAM: I did bad. I did real bad. 
MARISHA: You did not. 
TALIESIN: We've got a new problem, so that's okay. 
MARISHA: It's make believe. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: None of this is real. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's worse. 
SAM: I made believe bad. (laughter) 
MATT: So he leaps. 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, he is on us! 
LAURA: If one of us dies, it'll be your fault. 
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. He jumped. 
MATT: You hear the-- (rumbling) 
LAURA: No, no. 
MATT: -- nearby of the juggernaut landing heavily into the shadow on the other side of the wall still. 
MARISHA: But we all made it through. 
TRAVIS: That's when the sentry comes out of the tent, finally finding his braveness and attacks his own Reiloran friend. 
MATT: (noncommittal shrug) 
SAM: Is he in the darkness, the juggernaut? 
LAURA: He's in the darkness, the juggernaut is, yeah. 
MATT: Both of these figures-- 
LIAM: Oh, jeebus. 
MATT: -- go rushing by-- 
LIAM: Oh cool. 
MATT: -- in this direction, they're hearing the bell. You see them both grab to the sides and open a swinging gate to this side of the wall. 
MARISHA: Oh! There was a door the whole fucking time? 
SAM: There was a gate?! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You never looked. No one looked. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fair. 
MARISHA: That's okay, this is better. 
TRAVIS: I was going to say, did they run up and go like: Why did we never build a door here? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. We were in disguises, so we could've just bloop, bloop, bloop walked on out. ♪ (jaunty tune) ♪ Walked over that way. 
TALIESIN: That doesn't sound like us. 
LAURA: That's silly, you guys. Why would we do something easy? 
TRAVIS: None of us went: Is there a door? Goddamn it. 
ASHLEY: We did, we did. 
SAM: Yeah, we did. We did. 
LAURA: I looked for people immediately. 
ASHLEY: I feel like we asked for a door. 
SAM: We did. 
TRAVIS: No, we didn't ask for a door. 
LAURA: We just looked for people. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We did look for people. 
TRAVIS: (sighs) We suck at this. 
MATT: You asked if these were openings and I said no. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Is the eyes in the sky, is he coming towards us? 
MATT: I mean, he's definitely focused in this area. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: You're too far away to meet an eye line of black shark-like eyes, unfortunately. You're not able to figure out where exactly he's looking. 
SAM: Got it. 
MATT: But that does finish their go. The howls are getting louder. You can hear, as they approach, and you, Imogen, and maybe Fearne, can see off to the side here these shadowed shapes darting past as these bestial entities come running through-- 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: -- to join over here that are also mounted by-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, I hate that. 
MATT: -- two other Reiloran. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MATT: One of them looks to be-- 
MARISHA: Mounted? 
MATT: Yes, they are. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Those creatures have what looks like big, leather and chain mounts that are put across them. You get one good view perspective. This one here, it is a massive, muscular panther creature, but with no hair. It's a heavy, scaled body with very much a massive, hunting feline or hunting cat type body. There is no neck or head. You see it stops and turns around like this. Where the neck would be, there is just a jaw and a mouth that-- (bestial growling) 
MARISHA and SAM: Ugh! 
TALIESIN: Ew. 
MATT: There's no eyes visible on it. And it, (snarled howling) Now you can hear, this is one of the things that was howling. 
LAURA: One of the things. One of the things. 
ASHLEY: Ooh boy. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: They just enter the space here. That now brings us to Orym, with Ashton on deck. 
TALIESIN: What did you-- 
SAM: I think you skipped me. 
MATT: Oh that's right. FCG, you're at the end. Yeah, you're right. 
SAM: Do we think that this guy's coming towards us? I'm going to use my movement to go where everybody else is going, stealthily. 
MATT: Okay. That'll get you just alongside the low to the ground Fearne there. Go ahead and make a stealth check with disadvantage for me, please. 
SAM: With disadvantage? 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: I get advantage on my next roll, because my friend rolled a natural 20. 
MATT: That's right! 
SAM: So I'll just roll once. Is that cocked? 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: It's not that cocked. 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: What is that, a six or a nine? 
LAURA: Nine. 
SAM: It's a six. (laughter) 
SAM: 16! 
MATT: 16. Okay, got it. 
SAM: Right? Because Pass Without a-- 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Okay, you roll past and you glance up. You couldn't see the eye line before, but you do notice-- 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Shit. 
MATT: The head shift of this gentlemen here. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: Or lady. 
SAM: Oh, that's right. We don't know. How far away, 100 feet? 
MATT: Uh-- 
SAM: 90? 
MATT: More or less. Probably a little less. 
SAM: (sighs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Okay, then I will hold a spell until it gets within 60 feet. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I will hold Banishment. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your go as you're now holding the spell at a point there. Now, Orym, you're up, with Ashton on deck. 
LIAM: Jeez, well, uh-- Do you think that out, that your cover's blown? Or is this happening too fast? 
SAM: Sure, I do. 
TALIESIN: It's Vox Machina shit. 
LIAM: Regardless, Orym is going to creep to the far corner of that tent. 
MATT: Over here? 
LIAM: Yeah, and get some Metal Gear cover so that I can slash the air with Seedling to attack these guys if things go-- if I see the fight break out. 
MATT: Okay. So you're holding your action to get ready to slice at the first provocation of them charging. Okay, got it. 
TALIESIN: Laudna, do you have a fucking plan? 
MATT: All righty, Ashton, you're up. 
MARISHA: Do I have a plan? You're asking me? 
TRAVIS: She has been the plan since we got up here. 
MARISHA: I would love if anybody else wants to contribute to said plan! 
TALIESIN: I'm contributing by thinking at you: Do you want me to drag you towards everybody else, or are you fine off in your own corner right now? 
MARISHA: I'm fine off in my own corner. That looks pretty precarious right now. 
TALIESIN: Done! 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
TALIESIN: There, by for the grace of something we go. I'm going to rage, first of all, because that's where we fucking are. 
TRAVIS: (growls) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I feel like we should all split up. 
MARISHA: It's not a bad idea. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's the tenet. (laughter) 
MARISHA: In this instance. 
LAURA: I think everybody split up and hide somewhere for a minute and then just turn into mist. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: If we can hide individually. 
ASHLEY: How do we turn into mist? 
LAURA: You think it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. You feel it deep down in your cockles. 
ASHLEY: You do? Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Feel it in my fingers ♪ 
TALIESIN: Interesting. 
SAM: We just got to get rid of this guy, he's the only one who's got eyes on us right now. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to see what the fuck's going on with me. That's a, oh-- 
TRAVIS: There's a chance the big savage guy might not find the door. 
TALIESIN: That's a space pull, so I'm getting weird. 
SAM: Yeah, it's small. 
TALIESIN: Slightly see-through. 
SAM: They might not even fit through. 
LAURA: Didn't a giant rock just bust through all the wall? 
TRAVIS: I don't-- 
TALIESIN: How far away is it? 
MATT: It slammed into the ground right at the base of it-- 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: -- and (slamming) into the wall. 
SAM: It's very small. 
TALIESIN: He's far, he's like 120 feet. 
MATT: This guy's about roughly 100 or so from you, yeah. 
LAURA: I'm pretty sure a juggernaut could bust through. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to also hold an attack until he's within 60 feet, and I'm going to, because I'm worried about these fuckers. I'm going to take my 30-foot run towards the people who are out in the open. 
MATT: 40 feet, you mean? 
TALIESIN: 40-foot run. 
MATT: Towards them directly? 
TALIESIN: No, towards our friends who are fucked. Slightly, yeah, there. 
MATT: That'll get you just right there. 
TALIESIN: Attempting to be stealthy. 
MATT: Stealth at disadvantage for me, please. 
TALIESIN: For whatever it's worth. 
SAM: ♪ Do-do-do ♪ 
MATT: You do get the benefit because you are within 30 feet of her. 
TRAVIS: Also we don't want to look too suspicious, right, because anybody that sees us-- 
TALIESIN: 21. 
TRAVIS: -- we do look like everybody else ish. 
MATT: 21. Okay. You dart past, I mean, the entity seems to be definitely focused in your area, but you're uncertain whether or not you've been spotted. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm just, I'm ready to fuck with them if it comes to it. 
MATT: You got it, okay. 
LAURA: We're all in Ruby Vanguard robes? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Still. 
MATT: Correct. Yeah, currently the only ones that are directly aware of your intent are these two for now. All right, that finishes your turn, Ashton? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hm. 
MATT: Imogen, you're up. 
TRAVIS: God, the hindsight. We could have circled up and just smoked him-- 
MATT: Actually no, before it gets to your turn-- 
TALIESIN: Actually no, I'm not going to hold that. Yeah, I'm not going to hold that attack. 
MARISHA: Yeah, knowing he's not good. 
TALIESIN: Actually, I take that back. 
TALIESIN: Holding a standard attack within 60 feet. 
SAM: Oh noes. 
MATT: Two Ruby Vanguard-- 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
MATT: -- individuals come through (heavy thud) onto the area, and their initiative-- 
MARISHA: We got to get out of here. 
TALIESIN: We got to get the fuck out of here. This is a run. 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: They're going to be, okay. All righty. So they arrive at that spot. Imogen, sorry, what are you doing? 
LAURA: (sighs) Fuck me running. 
SAM: Are you Imogen? No, you're Laudna. Just to confirm for the audience. 
MARISHA, ASHLEY, and MATT: (laugh) 
LAURA: Actual fact. 
MATT: (laughing) That's awful. 
TRAVIS: So considerate. 
SAM and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Really sweet. Really sweet. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Oh, look what I just found in my box. 
LAURA: I am going to move forward and hide behind this. Can I move forward? How far can I get? Can I move up to the tent at least? 
MATT: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, you can get in this area. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm still in a hidey area? 
MATT: More or less, from multiple perspectives, yeah. 
LAURA: I can see the-- 
MARISHA: Shit. Shit, shit, shit. 
MATT: Correct, you can see the Thought Eater from where you are. You cannot see the others. You managed to get just far enough past that rock and through your friends as you move beside and hold there. The only one you have an eye line to right now is this one. 
LAURA: I was going to cast something, but its distance is far less than I thought it was! Hold on! Fuck! 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: Do you have a Metamagic that can extend the distance? 
LAURA: I can, but it doesn't extend it enough. 
MATT: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: It's a short distance spell. I'm dumb. 
MATT: Gotcha. 
SAM: Can you just look coquettish, and draw it closer to us? 
LAURA: Could that guy bring him down closer to us? 
SAM: I need him closer. 
TRAVIS: The big savage guy's going to get us before Mind Eater does. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I had it prepped and then it's not what I can do anymore. 
SAM: It's D&D's fault. It's not your fault. 
LAURA: It's all D&D's fault. If I do something, it's going to make me not invisible and it's going to let people know where I am and I'm going to put everybody else at risk. 
MATT: So are you holding a spell, or are you using your action to move elsewhere? What are you feeling? 
LIAM: Tick, tick, tick. 
LAURA: Oh stop it! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Could you have the resources-- 
MATT: It's okay, it's okay. 
LIAM: -- to teleport us? 
MATT: You're not under pressure. 
LAURA: No, I don't have the resources to teleport us! 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: There's already acknowledgement that there's shit happening over where the Darkness is. 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: Is anybody of our team still in the Darkness? 
MATT: From what you can see in your vicinity? No. 
LAURA: Then I am going to cast Seething Storm on that area. I can cast within 150 feet of me. 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That's a 20-foot radius as well. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Wait, what are you doing? What? 
TRAVIS: Seething Storm. 
LAURA: Seething Storm. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
MATT: You're casting it over here? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay, what's the radius on that? 
LAURA: That is a 20-foot radius. 
MATT: 20-foot radius. 
SAM: (sneeze) 
MATT: Gesundheit. 
LAURA: I tear open a gateway of liminal space and boundless, destructive energy. 
SAM: Are you making that up? Because that's really good. 
LAURA: It is pretty cool. 
TALIESIN: That's pretty solid, right there. 
ASHLEY: Pretty cool. 
LAURA: So it's lightning-- 
TALIESIN: That's some flavor. 
LAURA: -- lightning flaring everywhere. 
MATT: These tendrils of purpleish lightning are arcing through, like the inside of one of those plasma balls. Just (electric crackling) on that space there. 
LIAM: Is Laudy Daudy clear? 
MARISHA: I'm on the other side, yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Again, anything in that space is also blinded. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Then anything in that space is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 lightning damage, and anything that ends its turn there must make a dexterity save or take-- 
TRAVIS: That's awesome. 
MATT: Great. 
LAURA: -- force damage. 
LIAM: Once again, the guy in the tent. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
LAURA: Poor guy in the tent. 
ASHLEY: Poor guy. 
MARISHA: It's still dark-- 
TALIESIN: He made his choice. 
MARISHA: -- so it's dark and a hellish lightning storm. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MARISHA: That's awesome. 
MATT: Yeah, it's been a bad afternoon for that gentleman. 
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to read Brandon Sanderson, man. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: Yes. I'm no longer invisible. 
MATT: Right, your Invisibility drops. Okay, finishing your go, it's now the Thought Eater's turn. It's going to-- (shifting rock) 
LIAM: Oh no! 
MATT: -- lift this rock up. 
SAM: No! No it doesn't! 
LIAM: Oh dear. 
MATT: It's going to fly over-- 
SAM: Oh, oh, within 60 feet? 
MATT: -- this way. 
LIAM: Oh, that looks precarious. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LAURA: How high up in the air is it? 
LIAM: Oh my goodness. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: Save the miniature. 
MATT: I know. 
LIAM: It's right on a bush. You put it right on a bush. 
MATT: There we go. 
TRAVIS: It's on the edge. 
MARISHA: It's got to be. It's got to be, come on. 
MATT: What's the range? 
LAURA: ♪ I'm on the edge ♪ 
TRAVIS: 60. 
MATT: 60 feet. 
SAM: What is that? 
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, yes? 
MATT: It's right at 60 feet. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
MATT: Oh my god. Oh my god. 
SAM: It's still got to make a save, though, it's got to make a save. 
MATT: Because its range on this is 60 feet. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: So it's literally going to throw the rock, and right as it gets there. 
SAM: 15, it's a DC 15, which is not a lot. 
MATT: DC 15. 
TRAVIS: He's got to roll shit. He's got to roll shit. 
MATT: On what save? 
SAM: I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking. It's under spells. It's under 4th-level, I think. Where is it? 
MATT: Is it charisma? 
SAM: I'm looking. Charisma 15. 
MARISHA: Charisma. 
MATT: Charisma. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: Charisma is not his best saving throw. 
MARISHA: It might be good. 
MATT: That's going to be a nine. (excited cheering) 
TRAVIS: Shit! 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: Right as it rushes forward-- 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MATT: -- the stone, rocking and spinning in the air behind it, as it starts down, it does this with its arm right as the stone begins to arc upward and you watch it, (quick impact) and finish, and the rock goes-- 
TRAVIS: Hope. 
MATT: -- and slams into the ground. 
LAURA: Does it fall into the-- 
TRAVIS: Hope. 
MATT: (crashing) 
LAURA and LIAM: (groan) 
SAM: Does it draw attention? I hope not. 
MATT: It certainly slams into the ground heavily over there. 
TRAVIS: There's plenty of attention over here, but there's a barrier now. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Additional cover. 
MATT: He's gone. 
TRAVIS: Oh man, that's huge. 
MARISHA: Holy shit. 
LAURA: You just have to hold that, you have to concentrate. 
SAM: I broke it, I fixed it. 
TRAVIS: Is that concentration? (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Is it concentration? 
MATT: It is indeed concentration. 
SAM: It is, yes. 
TRAVIS: For one minute? 
SAM: One minute. 
TRAVIS: We got to get the fuck out. 
SAM: We got one minute to get out. 
LAURA: We got to get the fuck out of here! 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Quietly. 
MARISHA: Matt, you said these Reilorans are going to go through this gate. Is it a swinging gate that also gives us additional cover? 
MATT: It's a double opening gate. 
SAM: Exactly. 
MATT: Yeah, it's bolted in the front, now you can see they pull the brace out of the way and then both pull it open. 
TRAVIS: Like one, two, three-- 
MATT: It (creaks) opens up that way. 
LAURA: That's a good way to describe it. 
TALIESIN: Should be a little bit. 
MATT: Just to help give you a little perspective, it's this area here. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MARISHA: I'm just wondering if, I'm sorry, I'm getting, does it go in or out? 
TRAVIS: So if it opens out... 
MATT: It goes, it opens out this way. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, so these guys might lose visual-- 
MARISHA: Visual. 
TRAVIS: -- on this side of-- 
MARISHA: That's what I'm curious-- 
MATT: It's possible, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Maybe. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: But they also just heard a huge rock. 
MATT: They did and they all looked over this direction and watched the stone go (impacts) over there. 
LIAM: Red dust area. 
TALIESIN: Your orders are to report to the bell! 
MATT: It blocks line of sight to all of you at the moment. 
SAM: Amazing. 
TALIESIN: There's a big lightning attack happening over there. 
MATT: Their attention is definitely now starting to focus this way. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: We'll see how this plays out. 
SAM: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: That's going to finish Thought Eaters' turn. Laudna, you're up, and Chetney on deck. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: Fuck. (laughter) 
LIAM: Every round. 
MARISHA: Things are changing so fast. 
ASHLEY: Changing fast, yeah. 
TRAVIS: You just keep saving the day. 
ASHLEY: Not going to do what I was-- 
TRAVIS: Keep saving the day. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: MVP right now. 
LAURA: Just get out. 
TALIESIN: Laudna? 
LAURA: Move it. 
LIAM: Let's go, casters. 
TALIESIN: Laudna? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Do I see, can I, shit, do I have-- 
MATT: You can. 
ASHLEY: Can you? 
MARISHA: Can I shit? 
MATT: You can certainly try. (laughter) 
LIAM: Not for decades. 
LAURA: Establish it for her. 
TRAVIS: Her body, it's like (boof). (laughter) 
LAURA: Pop-pop, pah. 
LIAM: She probably spits stuff out like an owl. 
TRAVIS: Blergh. 
LIAM: Goes down, digests-- 
MATT: Oh god. Just Laudna pellets. 
LIAM: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: That's pretty good. 
TALIESIN: You found a magic item. (laughter) 
MATT: Oh god, that's good. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Fuck, I'm just going to run. I don't know what else to do. I'm just going to run and join everybody. 
MATT: Okay, so five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. You just dart past the outskirts of the (crackles) lightning energy that's curling over there. 
MARISHA: I'm going to dash. 
MATT: All right, 10, 20, 25, 30 gets you alongside where Chetney is. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Hey. 
MATT: Make a stealth check for me with a disadvantage. 
MARISHA: With disadvantage? 
MATT: Yes. You do have the plus 10 from Fearne because you've now entered the 30-foot radius around her. 
LIAM: I've forgotten. What's causing the disadvantage? 
MATT: It's just full sprint and open. 
LAURA: When you're runting. 
LIAM: Sprinting, thank you. Runting? 
MATT: If it's a slow stealth, technically, it's half speed, but it's a straight roll. I'm going to say if you're trying to run quickly through an open area, it's much more difficult. 
MARISHA: 25. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: 25? Disadvantage, that's great. All right, so you dart past using the freshly fallen stone to keep low and not make any eye line to the creatures along the way there. All right, that ends your turn. Chetney, you're up with Fearne on deck. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to keep coming this way. I'm going to use 30 feet to advance past Orym, stealthily, and when I get as far as I can, Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. It's here on this side of the rock. Can I make a (sniffs) sight, ears, everything, in what is this way, assuming we're going to keep moving that direction. 
MATT: All right, so make a perception check for me. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Fuck you. Seven. 
MATT: Seven. 
LAURA: Aw. Everything's unfamiliar on the moon. 
MATT: It's true. It's a lot of fresh scents that are messing with your head. What you can see just beyond that is beyond this rock and a smaller hill area, you can see there are other tents around here. The encampment itself, it seems like a bunch of makeshift barracks that have been thrown up here in previous weeks, when the Bloody Bridge was established and the Vanguard truly connected with the Reilora. You get the sense that they began to throw this together to guard both sides of the bridge. So everything here looks like it's been freshly put down and is temporary. So there are a lot of military tents, tent looking things, some that are Exandrian based, some that you can tell by the construction of materials. There's no cloth, there's heavy hides and leather and other spongier materials that are used at the top part of some of these tents that has a weird bluish purple hue, but that has a similar structure to it. 
TRAVIS: Cool tents, are there any bodies moving towards us with the bell ringing? 
MATT: Not that you can see. 
TRAVIS: Okay. That's my turn, if that was my action. 
MATT: Indeed. Okay. That, end of your turn. These two figures, now they're going to rush over to this side. 
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Yes, yes. 
MATT: They both going to get up over to here. 
LIAM: What's in the box? 
LAURA: Should we go in, George? 
MATT: That one's going to make a perception check-- 
MARISHA: Push them, push her friend. 
MATT: -- to look over the top of the hill. Nah. (laughs) Looks over, looks back towards the entryway and points towards them and says, "Over here," and points over towards the electricity and the darkness that's happening-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: -- and they're both going to start moving around the outskirts of it, not willing to run into a bunch of sparkling energy. 
LIAM: That's fair. 
LAURA: Psh. 
SAM: Scaredy cats. 
MATT: That's going to finish their go. Fearne, now you're up. 
ASHLEY: All right, so now that I can see everything, do I have to let loose my Scorching Ray or that I can... 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. All right. 
MATT: Yeah, you can let it go, you just lose the spell slot. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so, I'll, from my little dust bath, look around, and then I'll just keep running, see that everybody's taken off and I'll just keep running. 
MATT: 25, 30. 
ASHLEY: Oh and then is-- And Mister too. Yeah, let's... 
MATT: Mister. 
ASHLEY: I'm 35. 
MATT: You can dash this way. 35, so they can see they're on, you still have an action if you want it. You can keep moving if you want. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. You know what I'll do? I'm going to send a Thunder Clap 100 feet that way. 
MATT: This way? 
TRAVIS: That direction? 
ASHLEY: Yes, way far back behind, away from us. 
SAM: Within the fence area-- 
ASHLEY: It's 100 feet, so it can be heard-- 
SAM: -- or outside? 
ASHLEY: "The sound can be heard up to 100 feet away," oh wait, maybe I can't send it far away. 
MATT: Wait, is it a Thunder Clap? 
LAURA: That's like on self, that's right. 
ASHLEY: That's on self. Never mind. 
MATT: That's you. 
LAURA: That would be so bad. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's not at all what I wanted to do. 
TRAVIS: Over here! (impact) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I was trying to do it over there-- 
MATT: I was like, let me double check. 
ASHLEY: I thought it was a good idea. 
TRAVIS: We wanted to play it hard. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to wait. 
TALIESIN: San Luis Obispo-- 
ASHLEY: I'm just going to wait. 
TALIESIN: -- High School marching band. 
SAM: Use can your action to keep moving forward, by the way. 
MATT: Yeah, you can if you want to. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll keep going then. I'll keep going. 
MATT: Okay. So you'll dash up this way? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: (as Fearne) Here I go. 
MATT: Next to Chetney, you can see the cluster of tents. You can also, as you approach and while you didn't see immediately, you can hear other footsteps and people that are starting to filter into this side of this open-- 
TRAVIS: The central ravine. 
MATT: -- the central open area where they began to push through. So there are more and more soldiers of this alliance coming and they're all gathering towards the center. 
TRAVIS: I'll relay that. (deeply) More coming up the center. Our side is clear. (laughter) 
LAURA: In our head, do we still hear you as a wolf, or are you just Chet in our head? 
TALIESIN: He's doing the voice in his head. 
TRAVIS: Just let me live my dream. (laughter) 
MATT: Beginning the Juggernaut's turn, it takes 2d6 damage, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, 2d6 lightning damage at the beginning of its turn. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll for that for me, please. 
MARISHA: You can put live photos as your-- So whenever you get a-- 
LAURA: Ooh, 11. 
MATT: Okay. 11 points of lightning damage on this juggernaut. You're like, (crackling) and it's rough terrain, so its movement is reduced, but it goes ahead and (smashing). 
LAURA: Oh, it's getting it. 
MATT: It begins punching along the wall. 
TRAVIS: At anything that could be in this darkness. 
LAURA: It's trying to punch along, or trying to get out, or--? 
MATT: (laughs) It has disadvantage because it can't see, so this was to hit the AC of the wall and then one of them's a one. So its fists are careening off of it, because it's not, it looks like wood sections here but a lot of it is stone pillars that have been unnaturally grown out of the ground. You can see bits of odd glass pushed out of it in places as well. You can see ropes tied around them with other bits of flotsam and jetsam, that are pushed around it. 
TALIESIN: That's why you hire a decent contractor. 
TRAVIS: That's a weird lunar surface. 
TALIESIN: Just saying. 
MATT: Second hit, though, with disadvantage. 
TALIESIN: Too real. 
MATT: Does hit and it already took a lot of damage from the rock that fell in there earlier. So we'll see if it's enough to push through. 
TRAVIS: Is it crystal or glass? 
MATT: You're not sure. You haven't had a good look at it yet. 
MARISHA: Wait, did you say crystal? 
TRAVIS: Well, glass means heat. 
MARISHA: The things you're working on, the rock here? 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
TRAVIS: Sharp things, sticking up out of the ground. 
MATT: -- 12 damage. (crashing) Part of the wall cracks open, and you watch his dust peels off on that side and the juggernaut begins to full-on "Here's Johnny" through. Is like (smashing). 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
MATT: It's starting to pull its way through. It's not completely through yet. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: It is preventing it from getting through but it is doing enough damage where that part of the wall is starting to give, but he does finish his turn in the radius. 
LAURA: Okay, then he has to make a dexterity save. 
MATT: Okay, that's going to be a-- 
TRAVIS: This is a good spell. 
MATT: -- 15. 
LAURA: He fails, so he takes 2d6 force damage! 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Was this guy already-- 
LAURA: 10 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MATT: What's what? 
MARISHA: Is he dead? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: I don't think he was as rough as the-- 
MATT: No! He was nowhere near as rough as the Thought Eater. 
TRAVIS: He said that exuberantly, we're fucked. 
LAURA: Yeah. That guy's full of everything. We got to go. 
MATT: He's full of a lot of things. 
TALIESIN: A lot of piss and vinegar. 
MATT: (laughs) All right. That finishes his go. These figures here on the darkness side. 
LAURA: Can you move the darkness, Laudna? That would be amazing. 
MARISHA: I could recast it. 
LAURA: Put it to where he's got another 15 feet of darkness in front of him again. 
MARISHA: I could theoretically, I think, cast it on him. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Around the edge. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Can you see him poking his head through? 
MARISHA: If he's like-- 
TRAVIS: You can see his hand. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he's doing this. 
MATT: Yeah. His hand and his shoulder. He's like (grunting). 
LIAM: Yeah, Laudna should be able to see that. 
TALIESIN: That would be amazing. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: If you could just ruin him. 
LAURA: Yeah. I love that. 
MATT: This guy here is going to-- 
SAM: Oh shit, I forgot about him. 
TALIESIN: (noncommittal noise) 
LAURA: I didn't. 
MATT: There. 
LAURA: I can't stress to you enough how much I wanted that Gudetama mug. 
MATT: Creature's going to (stomping). 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. Oh! 
MATT: Onto the rubble of the rock. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: Then (whooshing)-- 
SAM: Right next to me! 
MATT: -- dart down on the opposite side of the wall. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: The dog and the mount? 
LIAM: They went that way? 
MATT: Yeah, the dog and the mount. They heard all the scuffle going over this way, it leapt onto this and then over to try and pincer on this side. 
LAURA: Oh no, do they see it? 
MATT: It lands. As it lands-- 
SAM: It can only see movement. 
MATT: -- the one that's on this side is riding it, (whooshes) looks right over at you. 
TALIESIN: How close is it to us? 
LIAM: That close. 
MATT: Oh, it's about five feet from him. 
TRAVIS: But he doesn't know what we look like because we're wearing Vanguard robes. 
TALIESIN: It's not next to me, is it? 
LAURA: That's true, we're in Vanguard robes. 
MATT: You're in Vanguard robes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay. 
MATT: And one of you's a robot. 
ASHLEY: We're in Vanguard robes. 
TRAVIS: Which is, I'm sure, very common. 
MATT: It's very confusing. 
LAURA: Yeah, what would a robot-- 
MATT: But we'll see how this goes. 
SAM: Robot Vanguard. 
TRAVIS: Ooh-ooh! 
MATT: We'll see how this goes. 
LAURA: Bad guy robot? No. We are definitely-- 
MATT: Yeah. I'm just saying, it looks at you curiously. 
SAM: It's fine. 
TRAVIS: Just speak your truth. "Fuck the gods." 
MATT: It looks curiously at you. All right, so that finishes its go. This one here is going to lean over. 
SAM: I will never say it. 
MATT: (whooshes) (impacts) Over to this side and is scoping this space internally here. Finishing their go, FCG, you're up. 
SAM: Shit. 
MATT: Looking over the shoulder right at you as the muscular, panther-like headless beast is right beside you and in a crouched, pouncing position in this direction, it's just-- 
SAM: I can't cast Fast Friends on him because that's concentration and the Banishment will undo. Command isn't a concentration spell, though. 
MATT: Yeah, things like Command. 
SAM: I will use Command. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I will turn to the guy who just looked at me and I will cast Command. Ooh, it's just a 1st-spell. That's probably not going to work. But let's try. 
MARISHA: You don't know. 
TALIESIN: You're good. 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
LIAM: Come on, pull it off. 
LAURA: It's a Wisdom save? 
SAM: It's a Wisdom 15 save. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: Wisdom 15 save. 
LAURA: These guys are all wisdom. 
TALIESIN: You have to pick a single thing that you get one round of. 
TRAVIS: He'll know you're a foe if you do it. 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Otherwise, you could just pretend that you're-- 
LIAM: I believe. 
SAM: You mean just act? 
SAM: Yeah, well, maybe I'll do that. Maybe I should just act. 
ASHLEY: Are you good at deception? 
LIAM: Here's the verdict. 
SAM: We'll find out. 
TRAVIS: Matt rolled. 
ASHLEY: Already rolled it. 
SAM: You've already rolled? 
MATT: Are you casting it or not casting it? I haven't said what the roll is yet. 
TRAVIS: He rolled shitty. 
SAM: I'll cast it. I'll cast it. 
LAURA: Travis. 
SAM: I already said I'd do it, I'm doing it. It doesn't matter. 
MATT: What'd you say? 
SAM: I already said I'm doing it and I'm doing it. 
TRAVIS: I said he's going to roll shitty. 
SAM: I'm doing it, I cast Command. 
MATT: You cast Command, what do you Command? 
SAM: I will say, the Command is just: Shh. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. Two parts to this. One, it rolled a 14, all bonuses in, which is why I laughed because it's right under your DC. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: So it looks over and cocks its head strangely. Make a deception check for me, I'll say with advantage because you succeeded on the spell. The spell's taken effect, but this is beyond the spell. This is you trying to pass yourself off as an ally or at least not a threat at the moment. 
SAM: Deception? 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: 25. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: This little robot's got some stank! 
MATT: What?! 
LAURA: Are you a super lie-y and we just don't know? 
SAM: Yeah, I'm really good at deception and we never use it for me. 
ASHLEY: Why wouldn't we use it? 
MARISHA: But you're so honest. 
TRAVIS: He's a murderer! 
MATT: What'd you roll? 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. He is a little murder bot. 
SAM: I rolled a 19 plus six. 
MATT: That's amazing. Dang! (laughs) Look at that clutch fucking throw there. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
MATT: So you say "Shh." 
TALIESIN: Way to Decepticon there. Shit. 
MATT: It looks at you, nods, and turns around. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MATT: Holding onto the reins of this entity and prepare themself to get ready to go after whatever tears through that wall that's not a friend. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: For the time being. 
LIAM: So you fucked it, then you un-fucked it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: I might fuck it again still. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: So? 
MATT: So that's going to finish-- 
SAM: Oh, and then I'll use my action or my movement to continue on with the rest. 
MATT: Okay. (skitters) 
TRAVIS: 15, 20, 25, 30, yep. 
MATT: It's about right up there with Mister and (chuckles) lucky you rolled so high because Laudna was right behind you and it was a high DC-- 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: -- because all the rest of you were fleeing for the moment. 
SAM: Of course. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
MATT: Whew. Okay. 
MARISHA: How long does it last? 
MATT: Lucky motherfucker. 
SAM: Not long. 
MATT: Great. That finishes FCG's go. Orym, you're up; Ashton, you're on deck. 
LIAM: Okay, so just perception-wise, do I hear many inhabitants of this place coming? That is a 23. 
MATT: 23. Yes. Now you hear other bells starting to ring in other parts of the vicinity, different sounds. This is the big bell and there's other ones acknowledging the chain to make sure that everyone hears it. You can hear those howls getting louder, more of them approaching and in nearby tents off the main walkways, you hear heavy footfalls of possibly dozens arriving here in the next half-minute. 
LIAM: Okay, so really quickly, I think I would say walk away casually, but we're going to be the only ones going in this direction. Are we stealthing serpentine? Quickly, to the group. 
TRAVIS: I think it's casual, right? What do you think? 
LIAM: But if there's 50 people going (grunts) and we're just, "Hey friends," as we walk in the opposite direction-- 
ASHLEY: Maybe we act like we're stressed. 
LIAM: What's the story that tells? 
TALIESIN: Stealthy serpentine is my call. 
LAURA: Stealthily try to blend in with the people, but run away. 
TALIESIN: Tent to tent, yeah. 
MATT: Which stealth can both be not being seen or trying to casually work your way in. 
LAURA: Being nonchalant. Yeah, let's try to look-- 
LIAM: Confused in the craziness of it? 
LAURA: Nonchalantly. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So here's the thing. Stealthing, I'll put this context. 
LIAM: Everybody walk backwards. 
MATT: Stealthing by just not being seen has a higher DC, but you get the bonus of Pass Without a Trace. Stealthing casually, that spell does not help you blend in. It helps you not be seen. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So it'll have, with your clothing and the stress of the scenario, possibly a lower DC, but you do not get the benefit of Pass Without a Trace, the choice is yours. 
LIAM: I think that's our best bet. 
MARISHA: Cuban? 
TRAVIS: Cuban burp. 
LIAM: Trying to blend in. Whoa! 
SAM: (high-pitched sneeze) 
TALIESIN: Stop it. 
ASHLEY: What is happening to you?! (laughter) 
LAURA: Why are your sneezes like that? 
SAM: I don't know. 
TRAVIS: Got some Benadryl over here? 
ASHLEY: You have to clear your nose. 
SAM: I do. I do. 
MARISHA: So cute. 
LAURA: It is a cute little sneeze. 
ASHLEY: It is a cute sneeze. 
SAM: It's the cocaine. 
TRAVIS: It's fucking annoying. 
MATT: So what's the plan? 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: (nervous groan) 
MATT: Shadows or blending? 
TALIESIN: Will it blend? 
LAURA: I feel like-- 
MATT: Will it blend? 
LIAM: Or! Or! Or! 
MATT: Don't breathe this. 
LAURA: But plus 10. 
LIAM: Or do we run into a tent-- 
SAM: There's a tent right there. 
LIAM: -- and turn into clouds for a minute? 
LAURA: Yeah, no. That's what we should do. 
LIAM: Together. 
TRAVIS: I thought about it, but they're coming this way and it feels like they'll make their way and check stuff. 
LAURA: We should duck into a tent further away. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it feels like it. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Even if we get 50 yards away. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Then find an empty tent. 
MARISHA: You can pop up a thing? Do I remember that correctly? But yours is more organic. 
LAURA: Natural. Yeah, no, that's not-- 
TALIESIN: That's fun. This is-- 
MARISHA: That's not going to work. 
LIAM: Plus, we're on Mars. 
TRAVIS: Follow Orym's lead. 
LAURA: We should hide in a tent. 
TRAVIS: Follow Orym's lead, he'll find a tent. 
LAURA: What do you want to do, Orym? 
TRAVIS: Blend in. 
LAURA: Casually look for a tent? 
LIAM: I want to look like I'm confused by the alarm going on around and like I belong here, and start moving away. 
TRAVIS: Like we're searching. 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Yeah, like we're searching the area. 
LIAM: I'm looking for my colleagues to help me-- 
MATT: Great. 
LIAM: -- here. 
MATT: So to that point, I need a group stealth check without the benefit. 
ASHLEY: Without the Pass. 
LAURA: (groan) 
LIAM: Without the Pass? Oh. 
MARISHA: So that's the thing, we can't use Pass Without a Trace that way. 
LIAM: Yes. Gotcha. 
MARISHA: Okay. All right. 
TALIESIN: Don't fuck it up. 
LAURA: But the DC's lower. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: I'm going to use-- 
LAURA: Halfling Luck? 
LIAM: Indomitable because I rolled low. 
MATT: That's for saving throws and ability checks or is it just saving throws? 
LIAM: Oh, it's a saving throw, okay. Then that's it. 
MATT: Okay, we'll start over here. 
TALIESIN: 14. 
MATT: 14, okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MARISHA: Group check, group check. 
LIAM: Nine. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: 20. 
TALIESIN: Yay. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 14. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: One. 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: But I'm a huge fan of the Luck feat, as you all know. So I will use the coin of the Changebringer to reroll. 
MATT: Because you can do that. 
MARISHA: Did you take the Luck feat? 
SAM: No, it's a coin. It's not luck, it's faith, so it's okay. (laughter) 
SAM: I say a silent prayer to the Changebringer. I'm coming for you, baby. 16, 15. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: That's better. 
MARISHA: 25. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
LAURA: Let's go, Laudna. 
MARISHA: I rolled a 19. 
LAURA: You did it. 
MARISHA: I did good! 
ASHLEY: No, why are you doing that face? 
TALIESIN: Right there, that's a one face. 
TRAVIS: 27. 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and MARISHA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck right off, you motherfucker! Boo. (laughter) 
MATT: You better make a strong prayer to that Changebringer because that saved your ass. 
SAM: Thank you. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: What? 
LIAM: Nine years later and you did it. 
SAM: It's faith! It's faith, it's different, it's my belief. 
LIAM: It's good enough for me. (laughter) 
SAM: It's different. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: It's different when I do it. (laughter) 
MATT: Weaving through-- 
ASHLEY: Did we make it? 
MATT: -- some of the nearby tents. 
LAURA: We did it. 
MATT: You can watch as Reiloran soldiers and the occasional Vanguard figure-- 
ASHLEY: That way, that way, oh my god! 
MATT: -- comes darting out, glaive in hand. 
SAM: What way, which way? 
MATT: You can see multiple weapons at the ready. Some are Exandrian. You can see some of the other Reiloran weapons themselves are these massive glaives that are made mostly of bone or this jagged crystal-like glass material that are strapped together with bits of errant metal. Most of the armors they wear are leather and bone with bits of odd patchwork hides. But they all come charging through. Some of them eye you as they pass and then go back to concentrating. A few of them look over their shoulder a second time, but then hear a noise and continue to pursue. You hear the juggernaut bashing through the wall before eventually emerging right as the other one pounces and there's a point of confusion as they both face off, just as you all vanish into the nearby crowds. With Orym taking the lead, eventually you find a tent. You glance into each little flap you can find, there's one heavy leather tent that's kind of smallish, like it's a supply containment tent and as you pull back and look on the inside, it looks mostly empty. There's a couple of boxes that were brought in from probably Exandrian make that they're open and mostly empty aside from some minor supplies, some fire-burning wood and some other errant things. But this gap could very tightly fit all of you for a moment. 
TRAVIS: So one issue, right? If I remember correctly, we can't communicate when we're clouds and we-- 
LAURA: No, we can still talk when we're clouds. 
MATT: Telekinetically, you can. 
TRAVIS: Awesome. 
MATT: That spell is the only way you can. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I was like we don't know where to say to meet. We're just going to be venturing out into the fucking lunar surface. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah. 
LIAM: So Orym spins around and says: We need to queef out of here, let's go. (laughter) 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Question. The tent flaps-- does it have buckles or-- 
TRAVIS: (mouth farts) 
MARISHA: -- something to help keep it closed? 
LAURA: It lasts for an hour, do you need to recast it on us? 
MATT: Not on the exterior, no. 
LAURA: Telepathic Bond. 
TALIESIN: Interior, yeah? 
MATT: You can find something. What clever way would you want to keep it buckled closed? 
MARISHA: I was just going to maybe Mend the fabric so that if someone tries to throw it open-- 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: They'd have to take a sec. 
TALIESIN: It doesn't flap open. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it doesn't flap open. 
MATT: As you all enter the inside and you get a good look at it, the texture on it, you can see the hide texture on this. This is leather, this was once a creature's hide and as you cast Mend, as opposed to watching cloth reform, it's like watching flesh-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: -- peel and snap together into a solid form. 
TRAVIS: Shit, yes. 
TALIESIN: Nature's Velcro. 
MATT: Yes. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Nature's Velcro. 
MATT: It (slurps) back together and it becomes almost a pink or purplish color. 
LAURA: Ew. 
MATT: A bit of it has-- 
TRAVIS: Fresh? 
MATT: Just a fragment of fresh life to it. 
TRAVIS: (cackles) 
MATT: But no actual life to support. 
TRAVIS: That's going to scar. 
MATT: As you all carefully step in, you can hear the bells still going. You can hear other growls and you can start hearing humanoid shouts. None of the Reiloran have been shouting in the vicinity, but the humanoids and the Vanguard are giving out cries and the tension's starting to build. Are you all? 
TRAVIS: Do it, say it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yes. 
LAURA: Oh, but before we do-- 
SAM: I think I have to recast the Telekinetic Bond. 
LAURA: Or Telepathic Bond? 
SAM: Telepathic Bond. 
MATT: How long does that last? 
LAURA: It lasts an hour. 
SAM: I don't know how long it's been, though. 
TRAVIS: Since we cast it before the fight? 
MATT: You cast it, when did you cast it? 
SAM: I don't know. 
LAURA: I feel like you cast it before we even went-- 
MATT: Before you went left? 
LAURA: We started down. 
MATT: Right. 
LAURA: That would've been-- 
TRAVIS: We do need to recast it, then. 
LAURA: Yeah, because I don't want it to go away while we're farts. 
MATT: It's pretty close. I will say it's still lasting on you, of course, because you're using it, but depending on how long you want to be in this mist form. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I long to be ♪ 
MATT: You probably have about I'll say 15, 20 minutes or so before it fades. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Under the sea ♪ 
LIAM: Up? 
LAURA: Because you won't be able to cast it once we're farts. (laughter) 
LIAM: So we go up for a view of the landscape and decide from there. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: But we're going to rest or something, right? Because I am spent. 
TALIESIN: We got to go. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Okay. I will recast Telepathic Bond. 
MARISHA: That's a spell you have, it's not a scroll, right? 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: It's a spell I have. By the way, a minute's probably up. So Banishment's probably gone on that dude. 
TRAVIS: It's been a minute. 
MATT: As you all step in here after stealthing around, it's been about maybe I'd say 30 seconds to find the tent where you get in there. So halfway through your concentration, it will drop. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: You'll feel it (poof). There's a part of your mind that's like, "Oh god, it's back, it's angry, and it's looking for us." 
SAM: Got it, okay. Yeah, Telepathic Bond. Let's become farts. By the way, did you see back there? One of the Reilorans spotted me. 
TALIESIN: Okay, we're going. 
MARISHA: We start going while he's talking. 
SAM: I held the Changebringer coin and then he just looked away, it was amazing. That's Chay-Chay, she did that. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Chay-Chay? 
SAM: Chay-Chay. 
TRAVIS: Pray-pray to Chay-Chay. 
SAM: Pray-pray to Chay-Chay. (laughter) ♪ You better pray to Chay-Chay today ♪ 
MATT: You all are concentrating on the enchantment that still stays rooted in your beings. You feel that confident presence of the Voice of the Tempest with you here as a quiet wind begins to encircle all of you and you watch as your fingertips begin to dissolve, your feet begin to shimmer. You watch as your body begins to feel lighter and almost like you begin to lift off the ground slightly. Laudna, make a perception check for me. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
TRAVIS: Dani said we cast Telekinetic Bond just before we turned into clouds last time. 
MATT: Yeah, so with the travel there because you travel pretty fast with that spell. 
SAM: Yep. 
MATT: Getting to the spot. 
LAURA: It would've just-- 
MATT: Yeah. It's pretty close to ending, so. 
MARISHA: Eh. 
TRAVIS: There's no guilt here, man. You're lighting up the field, it's crazy. 
MARISHA: Yeah, nine. 
TRAVIS: You and Imogen are fucking wrecking shit. 
MATT: Nine? Okay. 
MARISHA: Nothing, nothing? 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: As the din outside begins to crescendo, you can sense and feel that the search is now becoming methodical through all the nearby structures. You begin to hear the pushing over of doorways. 
MARISHA: Can I look at Treshi ball real quick before I go ghost? 
MATT: Yeah, if you want to. You look up and your fingers are mostly gone now and you see it begins to slip out of your grasp almost. 
MARISHA: Ooh, oh. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: Before you catch it and indeed, you see that blue glimmer. 
MARISHA: She's here! 
LAURA: Ah! 
MARISHA: I put it away before I'm a poof. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I want to leave right now, I want to go! 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MARISHA: Can we concentrate faster? 
TRAVIS: That bitch is so bad! (buzzes) 
ASHLEY: Bubble guts. 
MARISHA: Concentrate harder! 
MATT: You hear a structure, not a tent, but a structure nearby-- (clatters) 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: -- slam and collapse. The splintering of wood and rock shattering. 
TRAVIS: Stop. 
LIAM: I love it. 
TRAVIS: Stop. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
TRAVIS: Stop, Matt, don't roll! 
SAM: Do it, do it. 
TRAVIS: Don't roll! 
SAM: Roll it. 
MATT: (poof) You all turn into clouds of mist. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought you meant the fucking tent. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought something, but okay. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: I shit my pants a little. 
MATT: You all begin to (swoosh) filter out from the nearby bottom corners of the tent to emerge into the brushing wind that's blowing by, the dust kicking up and trying to ride alongside it. As you emerge, you can see now 
ASHLEY: (mouth fart) 
MATT: -- probably close to 40 to 45-- 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- soldiers of the factions are now scattered around the core of this central compound, and you can see them around the corner from the tent where you were. As you all begin to (swoosh) drift up into the air, two things you pick up on. One: The wind here, though there is no immediate storm here, it's a little bit of a fight against it in your mist form. You move quick, but you get the sense that moving through a storm in this form is not advisable. 
TRAVIS: Mm. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Moving through the wind in the storm in our normal form is not advisable or as a cloud? 
MATT: In the current form. 
LAURA: As winds. 
MATT: As the winds buffet you a little bit from it occasionally and you can see the dust storms brimming miles off in multiple directions. Just from this little bit of the occasional gust, this would probably be bad in a dust storm. The second thing that you notice is indeed these distant dark dust storms are (rumbles) rolling in full-on "Fury Road" style, are probably a good 20 minutes off from the landing spot of the Bloody Bridge and you have no real concept of where to go and what your next destination is. But for now, you've at least gotten out of the frying pan. So we're going to go to break here. (groaning) 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MATT: But since we do have a moment to breathe, we're also going to level up. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit, we are? 
MATT: Yep. (clapping) 
MATT: I'm going to sit down for this. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: This is the first real pause moment in the tension of the past episode, so it puts you guys all at 12. You can think about your abilities and stuff during the break, but at the very least, we can roll hit points. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: If you know what your next level is. 
LIAM: Come on. 
TRAVIS: I think I do. I'll do blood hunter, which is a 10 or a 12? 
MATT: It's a 10. 
TRAVIS: Should I go first? 
MATT: Sure, yeah. You're already ready. 
LAURA: You're already ready already. 
TRAVIS: Ready ready already. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Roger, roger. 
TRAVIS: Eight. 
MATT: Eight on you there. All righty. Laudna? 
MARISHA: I'll do-- 
TRAVIS: Don't rush it. 
MARISHA: (groans) I'll do sorcerer, I feel like there's not much left for me as a warlock. Okay. 
MATT: Delilah would disagree. 
MARISHA: I know she would. 
MATT: (chuckles) 
MARISHA: That's good. I rolled a five. Right, sorcerers are d6s? 
LAURA: Yeah, it's a d6. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Yeah? Okay. 
MATT: That's good, all right, FCG? 
SAM: I'll take another level in cleric. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: But I'm a cleric of the Changebringer. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. (chuckles) 
SAM: And I rolled a two. 
MATT: All right, two hit points, put it on there, buddy. Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Um. Can-Can-Can I go last? 
MATT: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Well, I, okay, wait. 
SAM: Are you going to do some weird shit? 
ASHLEY: I may. 
TALIESIN: All right. You can go last. 
MATT: If you want to wait until after the break, we can roll yours when we return to the table, too. 
ASHLEY: Okay, let's do that. Because I made some different copies and I'm trying to figure out which one I want. 
MATT: So you can continue to consider after the break. Laura? 
SAM: ♪ Friends around the table ♪ 
LAURA: Hi. I am going to roll a d6. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LAURA: Four. 
LIAM: Pretty good. 
MATT: Perfect. 
LIAM: Sticking with fighter. Five. 
MATT: All righty. Five on that and--? 
TALIESIN: Why argue with success? Six. 
MATT: Six, okay. Fair enough, so that's everyone rolled there. We'll come back with Fearne's at the end of the break and we'll see you all here shortly.

Oh hey, it's us. Your friendly neighborhood ambiguous shadowy weirdos here to say cryptic things at you as usual. Are you ready for the third and final season of Midst? We certainly are. Some of you have been waiting a very long time. Good news: the wait is almost over. Midst, man. What the heck? A lot of questionable characters doing incredibly problematic things to each other in a series of increasingly insane escalating circumstances while struggling to follow their warped moral compasses and do what they think is hopefully the right thing. Can the Trust get… worse somehow? Can Phineas get less worse? How much longer can Lark outrun her past? Are there any objectively good guys in this story? Other than Moc Weepe. How can any of these threads possibly be resolved with only one more season to go? And we STILL don’t even know what happened with that dang moon. Are we ever gonna get some ANSWERS? Yes. As a matter of fact… we will. The third and final season of Midst unfolds February 14th. Listen to the pure sound experience anywhere you stream podcasts or watch illustrated video episodes on the Critical Role YouTube channel. In the meantime, you can follow us at @midstpodcast or join the Fold on Midst.co to get early access to episodes, behind the scenes bonus content music downloads, digital artwork, and more. Everything’s been leading to this. We’ll be with you to the end. Do you Trust us?

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So before we jump in real fast, Ashley, have you decided on what you want to do? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to hide. 
LAURA: Did you instantly change? 
ASHLEY: Oh, yes, I did. 
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself. 
ASHLEY: So I am going to do-- (sighs) Don't fucking @ me. (laughter) (laughter) (clapping) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to do-- 
TRAVIS: So defensive! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's so dumb, but I'm playing my game. I am going to do a third level in rogue. 
MATT: Hell yeah, I love it. 
ASHLEY: I am going to do Arcane Trickster. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Which I know is hilarious because my intelligence isn't very high, but I have reasons. 
MATT: I love it. 
LIAM: That's better. 
ASHLEY: So leave me alone. 
MATT: There can be narrative reasons as well, which I love. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Great, awesome. 
MARISHA: After almost nine years of playing this game on the internet, we're like, "Shut up." 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Don't! It hurts my feelings. (laughter) 
LIAM: Just let me make my dumb choice. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d8 hit points. 
TRAVIS: No, we don't know what we're doing. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Never have, never will. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Don't care to. 
ASHLEY: Let's do this one. Two. 
MATT: Look at that, out of the gate. It's wonderful. 
ASHLEY: Look at that, right out the gate. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: All right, perfect. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to add that now. 
LAURA: Do I want to do it? 
MATT: So, Bells Hells, as you've now ascended into the lower atmosphere of Ruidus, the red Moon of Ill Omen, storms roiling at all sides and below you, the sight of the Bloody Bridge, its singular red beam (sizzles) firing past you into the sky above where it strikes down on the beautiful blue planet, Exandria. Where do you go and what do you do? 
SAM: Matthew. 
MATT: Yes, Sam? 
MARISHA: (extended wet burp) 
SAM: Gross. 
LAURA: Gross. That was a gross one. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh look, you got a little. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: When you try to keep it quiet. 
MATT: Oh my god. 
LAURA: That was awful. 
LIAM: I thought it was pretty great. 
MARISHA: That one had a little salsa, not going to lie. (groaning) 
LAURA: That wasn't the foul part. That was the foul part. 
SAM: Did you eat salsa today? 
MARISHA: Nope. 
MATT: Sam! (groaning) 
MATT: Sam, you were saying? 
LAURA: You tasted it? 
TRAVIS: I ate it. 
ASHLEY: Tasty. 
SAM: I was saying-- And we're back from commercial. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: We'll cut all that. 
SAM: I was saying there's several of us-- 
TRAVIS: Assholes. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: -- who in dreaming, have been to the moon before. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Do I, as one of those beings-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
SAM: -- do I recognize any features, any landmarks, anything that we've seen before in waking dream form? 
TRAVIS: It's red. 
MATT: I will say any who have seen this landscape before can roll a survival check or a perception check. 
MARISHA: I think we've all been here at some point, right? 
LAURA: Not all of us. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But in dreams, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yes, yes. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Only in dreams ♪ 
LAURA: This is a temporary, I don't know if this is-- 
MATT: There's different DCs for each person based on how familiar they are with the landscape. 
LAURA: Was it survival, survivor-der? 
MATT: Survival or perception. 
TALIESIN: I'll take survival for 19. 
SAM: (in slow motion) Survival. 
MATT: 19. 
LIAM: I'll use my passive perception, 24 for the roll. 
LAURA: I am never rolling a Ruidus dice again. It was not a one. It was just a nine. 
MATT: Nine. 
SAM: Available in the shop. 
ASHLEY: 17. 
MATT: 17. 
LAURA: No, that's not our Ruidus dice. It's just a red die. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: 19, perception. 
MARISHA: Natural one. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I've only been to Ruidus once, but I rolled a natural 20. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Did you? 
LAURA: You're so good, Chet. 
SAM: Because of the moon and you're a wolf. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
SAM: The moon wolf, the wolf moon. 
MATT: (howls) 
TRAVIS: My virility is off the charts. (laughter) 
SAM: You've just been erect this whole time? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: For a total of? 
LIAM: Every episode. 
TRAVIS: 21. 
MATT: Okay, I'll say-- 
TRAVIS: It's survival. 
LAURA: Okay. (laughs) 
MATT: Right, so the threshold on this would have been about 20-plus, the natural 20 definitely pushing it over the edge. While the rest of you still feel lost amongst the storm, Orym and Chetney, it's less about the landscape because you have no real correlation of direction. You just see a storm around you and the only real landmass that you can see at this point or the marker on the landscape is that encampment beneath you. But looking up at Exandria and looking at the direction of where the continent of Marquet is set and looking at what would be north, south, east, west from there and then recalling where you saw that city across the moon when you were looking through the telescope. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
MATT: You can figure a general direction that's likely where the city would be. 
LIAM: Let's us two go up. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So you can pick that direction. It'll still be a series of rolls to try and traverse if that's where you're trying to go. 
LIAM: So that direction though, we don't see the city. It's just we're taking a shot in the dark and hoping we'll get there? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: We're going (inquisitive grumbles). 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Cloud geometry. 
LAURA: From up above-- 
TRAVIS: (lips blubbering) 
LAURA: -- can we see anything that looks like-- 
TRAVIS: (lip trill) 
LAURA: -- this kind of a structure? I feel like this structure was made by the Ruby Vanguard, potentially. 
MATT: This section here you can see, it looks like it's been mostly constructed by a combination of both Ruby Vanguard and unfamiliar structure designs outside of what you've seen in the attire of some of the Reiloran. So it's a combined effort. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: This appears to be a new encampment. A fresh encampment. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: As we leave the encampment, from our bird's eye view, do any other structures other than the landing pad stand out? Is there a central HQ or any sort of? 
MATT: There are a series of larger tents. There's no stone-built structures or permanent things here. Everything here has been temporarily set up around the base of operations. 
LAURA: Do we see Otohan from the sky? 
MATT: How high up are you going? 
TALIESIN: High. 
LIAM: We're only on the moon once. 
TRAVIS: You're kind of leading. 
LAURA: How high can we go? 
TRAVIS: Or you, either one. 
MATT: You can go as high as you want. The wind gets stronger in some places. 
LAURA: I think we should stay in-- 
LIAM: Can we gauge that, though, as we're moving? As a cloud, do you start going, "Whoa, this is fucked" at a certain point? 
SAM: 240 feet. 
MATT: Yeah, all right. So you're leading in the direction where you assessed it might be. 
LIAM: Spiraling up around the Bloody Bridge. 
ASHLEY: Do we look like blobs? 
LAURA: No, we just look like air. 
LIAM: On that perception check, looking for landmarks. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Especially with a dust storm. This place just has dusty storms. We probably don't want to do that. 
TALIESIN: We're not flying into the storm or anything insane-- 
LAURA: No. 
TALIESIN: -- if we go this direction? 
LIAM: That's at a distance still. 
MATT: Any direction you go, you're going towards a storm. 
TALIESIN: Okay, fair. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Is it possible to avoid, try to avoid them or move ahead of them? 
MATT: We'll see as you get closer. It's tough to say. 
LIAM: But we're not right there. 
MATT: Most of the time you've ever been on this planet psychically or dream-wise, it's rare to have not been in a storm. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: It does break. You're not sure how often as you arrived in one, but they are pretty consistent. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: There's vast areas of storm, but we're not ringed in by storm all around 360 degrees? 
MATT: It looks it at a full distance. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: But sections are closer than others and you're not sure if they break behind or not. Just from your current barely moving position, you can see on all horizons clouds, big red clouds. Just some look like they're 100 miles away, you're not sure. Others look like they're 10. 
LIAM: We're in space, y'all. 
MARISHA: We're in space. Do we see anything? Because you said it's not tenable to hold this for forever. Do we see anything, though, that looks like a far enough outcropping, like a mountain or a cliff face or something that would be good for shelter? 
MATT: Along the ground here, as you get more of a bird's eye view, you can see the landscape of Ruidus itself is fairly broken. It is a bumpy, jagged series of landmasses, hills that come up to jagged points and you can see there are sections where the ground cracks open and these small chasms that splinter off and fork for a handful of miles before they eventually dissipate back to just crag land. You see to the left of the direction you're traveling where the clouds are about to consume it, there looks like there is a mountain range that looks to be maybe 35, 40 miles off. 
MARISHA: About to be consumed? 
MATT: Meaning that the storm will probably consume the mountain range before you get there in this form. 
LAURA: Yikes. 
MATT: But you could then either travel by foot. 
TRAVIS: Get close and hunker down. 
MATT: Then try and make the rest of the trek if you want. 
MARISHA: I'm guessing that looks like the best option right now. 
LAURA: That's all we can see? 
MARISHA: Or else we're just out in the open, which would be bad. 
MATT: Kind of, from this bird's eye view that you have. 
TRAVIS: Let's do it. 
MATT: That that's the most immediate landmass that seems like it has any real distinction. 
SAM: If I may, counterpoint. 
TRAVIS: Just keep going into space. (laughter) 
SAM: We only get this gift of flight like this for six and a half more hours. We don't know how far away the city is. Shouldn't we go as far as we can as close to the city? 
LAURA: Because we travel really far for right now, yeah. 
SAM: Could be 100 miles. 
ASHLEY: Go as far as we can? 
SAM: So if we just keep going as far as we can until-- 
LAURA: We head towards the city. 
SAM: -- the spell goes away. 
LAURA: And try to dodge the storms. 
LIAM: Because is this a one-off? I don't remember. 
SAM: I think so. 
LIAM: It's a one-timey? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Then absolutely go as far as possible. 
MARISHA: Cast this on us. 
LAURA: We never answered if I saw Otohan. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
MARISHA: I think I just had a lapse. 
LAURA: Also, Orym, you should look for Otohan. 
MARISHA: Is this an episode? 
TRAVIS: I missed the reference. 
LIAM: From space? 
LAURA: The sky, we're not in space. We're just above the encampment. 
LIAM: If Imogen tells me to, I help her look. I rolled balls for me. 
LAURA: I rolled a 16. 
LIAM: 17. 
MATT: You do not see anyone from this height that resembles Otohan in the chaos. 
LAURA: Okay. All right, we should follow Orym and Chet's lead toward the city. 
LIAM: (sputters) 
TALIESIN: Speed, whoa. 
MATT: (chuckles) 
TRAVIS: Speed runs in the family. 
MARISHA: Shiver and queef. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Shit, I forgot about that. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: They do fly similarly. 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched mouth fart) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay, so you can travel in this form the equivalent of a little over 60 miles per hour. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Because it's 300 feet is your movement speed in this form. You're not going to be able to travel that speed all the time because there are storms coming. But you can get to the mountain range. I said it's about 30, 40 miles away. You won't get all the way there, but you'll get damn close to it before it closes there. Or you can just, like I said, you don't have a direct beeline. You just know it's generally in that direction and the mountain range is to the left hand side. Do you want to shoot for that or do you want to try a straight shot? 
LAURA: Let's shoot for the mountain and then see if we can see past. But I don't want to get hit by that storm. 
MARISHA: Maybe we can-- 
LAURA: Dart in front of the storm and try to cut it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Try to cut it off? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Does the mountain range run in the direction that we're heading? 
LAURA: Or is it a mountain? 
MATT: It's a razorback mountain range that continues off like a dragon back that continues to wind up and down. But it's at an angle off to the side from where you're currently standing. So it's a longer range and it looks like there's maybe two or three main ridges that travel along that path at, yeah, at an angle away from you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Shooting for it? Okay. (swoosh) You go at an incredible speed once more, rocketing towards that area. You can see in the distance the (crackles) flashes of odd lightning sparking through the clouds of the distant and not-so-distant storms, the occasional one flashing and hitting some of the ground landscape in the distance and you can see the (poof) and hear the rumbles, that (rumbles) as it echoes around, (swooshes) careening as fast as you can in that way. You can see the shape of that one mountain range getting closer and closer. Eventually, as you are not terribly far off from it, you can see where the storm is and it's coming in this way. You look to see if you can try and beat it onto a left side direction. There's not really a way to get around it. It looks like an entire front is consuming this area. It's not like there are a couple of separate broken storms. It's like you are one of a handful of eyes in the hurricane that consumes the entirety of Ruidus, if that makes sense. There are pockets of clear. Otherwise, the rest of it has some sort of dust-- 
TRAVIS: Chaos. 
MATT: -- and wind. Some areas harsher than others. You can try and brave the storm still. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it will slow you down and there's a chance that you might get thrown off course. 
TRAVIS: The Reynolds Pamphlet. (laughter) 
LIAM: What? What? 
LAURA: I was right there with you. 
ASHLEY: It was so quiet. 
TRAVIS: My head was halfway going through "The Eye of the Hurricane" from "Hamilton." 
MATT: ♪ In the eye of the hurricane there is quiet ♪ 
LAURA: ♪ For just a moment ♪ 
MARISHA: It's been a while since we've had a "Hamilton" reference. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: ♪ Eliza ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (claps) With love. 
MATT: Anyway, with love. All with love. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LIAM: Oh my god, yes. 
MATT: But nevertheless, the storm is encroaching. To follow the outskirts of the storm, not certain whether you can get completely around it, it will take you off course from the direction you're traveling or you could try and descend and walk or you can push through the storm in your current forms and roll for it. What do you want to do? 
LAURA: I think we go off course. 
LIAM: I think we go off course. 
LAURA: Unless you want to go to the mountain. If we drop our form-- 
TRAVIS: These dice ain't going to roll themselves. 
SAM: We're not dropping our form. 
TRAVIS: We roll for it. 
MATT: The choice is all on you guys. 
SAM: What did you just roll? 
SAM and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MARISHA: That doesn't count. It was bad. (laughter) 
MATT: What are you feeling? 
SAM: We fight the fucking storm. 
LIAM: So if we go off course, I think as I'm a cloud-- 
LAURA: We fight the storm? 
LIAM: -- flying out on the moon, if we go off course and we land in these mountains, then we got to travel real far on foot. 
MARISHA: We can keep pushing. 
SAM: (sputters) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Right? Or we go off course. 
LAURA: We're trying to get to the city. 
TALIESIN: I don't mind banking around a storm in cloud form to try and find the fastest way there even though it doesn't have to be a beeline since we're not really beelining anyway. 
MARISHA: I think eventually we're going to get consumed by the storm no matter what. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: But we can just-- 
LAURA: Try to keep ahead of it for as long as we can and then if it looks like it's taking us too far off course, then we bank in and try to head back toward the city. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm good with that. 
MATT: Sounds like a plan. So with that, as you all figure this out in your heads to each other, Orym, you shift off to a front-left direction to try and ride the edge of the storm like one would ride the barrel of a wave as it's crashing. 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: All of you (swoosh) off to the side as the massive dark shadowy red clouds just (rumble) continue to billow forward, the flashes of (crackles) causing this dull electrical light show from the inside that is both beautiful as it is ominous. You can see the faintest shapes of the ground alongside the nearby mountain range. You can see the broken rocky hills and elements of mountain cliffs that begin to rise up over portions of the-- 
SAM: ♪ Rise up ♪ 
MATT: -- rolling, villa-- What happened there? 
LAURA: ♪ Eliza ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Rise up ♪ 
MATT: Oh. God-- (laughter) 
MATT: (sighs) I'm going to kill you all. 
TRAVIS: Sometimes, you need touchstones. 
MARISHA: It's like it's 2016 again. 
MATT: I know. (laughter) 
MATT: If only. 
LIAM: That's what happens when you listen to a musical 200 times. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Those were much more optimistic times. You do also, as you get lower, feeling like as the storm is getting closer, the wind above you is getting a little tenuous, so you naturally begin to sink a little lower and you can pick up more of the detail of the landscape below you. While a lot of it looks like just open, barren land, you can see in areas where these hills begin to break and where these cliffs begin to jut out and some of these crevices begin to tear into the ground below. You can see bursts of red brush-- (laughs) Oh god. Goddamn it. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MARISHA: It's a picture of Robbie, and it's like, "What's he looking at?" 
LAURA: Sorry, Matt. 
LIAM: Sorry, Matt. I think we are-- 
SAM: I'm ready. 
LIAM: Ruidian dust storm is fucking cool. (laughter) 
SAM: I was just having some water. 
MATT: I know, I get it. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh, he's taking-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no! 
LAURA: (discouraging noises) He marked it. 
LIAM: Kill the robot. 
MATT: I'm just adding hit points to things. It's fine. (laughter) No. 
SAM: Worth it. 
MATT: You can see there are these continued clusters of those red brush, like a smattering of desert scrub, but it's this vibrant and deep crimson tone to it. You can see as it spreads out, as opposed to normal clusters of brush, this seems to stretch out in places and then bloom, and thinly push out and then bloom. It's like it expands in tethers and tendrils before blooming as opposed to a slow, gradual expansion. 
MARISHA: It's like wormholes. 
MATT: A little bit, red weed sort of creep. 
TRAVIS: Capillary-looking. 
MATT: A little bit. You can also see that in some of these shadowed areas, there is more prominent, tree-like vegetation. You can't quite make out details at this distance that you're flying, but you can see what looks like reaching branches, though you can't really make out leaves. But there are thin, long, reaching, branch-like protrusions. It looks like small little clumps of forests in moments of shadow. You also pick up something running towards the storm. In fact, about a dozen of them, these shapes that are running across the base of the mountain range. You see they're running right towards the storm, towards the mountain range. 
TRAVIS: What kind of size? Even from this distance-- 
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance. You can make a perception check if you want to pick up the best you can. You can get closer for a higher DC. 
TRAVIS: Balls, total balls. 
LIAM: I'm curious as well. 
LAURA: Yeah, can we swoop down a little bit to see? 
LIAM: You want to dip? Let's dip. 
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. As you all get down to get a better view on them, you won't even have to roll if you're getting closer. 
LIAM: I'm looking for signs of life, as well. 
MATT: Indeed, this is a very prominent sign of life. You see 13 of these beasts. They resemble burly, buffalo-like creatures. Massive, round-shouldered backs and six buffalo-like legs that are thick, stalk-like at the base, as they thunder across this area, leaving cracked ground in their wake. You can see the thickly furred hide that surrounds the bulk of their shoulders and back is tangled around a wreath of horns that seems to protrude, probably about seven or eight horns on each side of the head that come out and curl outward in rows. You can see some that curve down and fully-- 
LAURA: Ah! 
MATT: It's like a mane of horns around the front of its head. You're not at the direction where you can see its face. You can see the backs of them as they're running away from you towards the storm that you're skirting past. But they are all in a full sprint towards the edge of this coming dust storm. 
ASHLEY: It's interesting they're going towards it. 
MARISHA: Towards it, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Bison and buffalo typically-- 
ASHLEY: Run towards? 
TRAVIS: -- head into a storm. 
SAM: They do? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Ooh, we could follow behind them. 
TRAVIS: It gets the storm over with quicker. 
LAURA: We could follow-- 
TRAVIS: It's true. 
ASHLEY: Are you serious? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Are they going fast? What if we go down and-- 
SAM: Ride them? Tame them? 
LAURA: -- use their wake to keep out of the-- 
MARISHA: Just drift. Drift on the bison. 
LAURA: Yeah, can we drift? How fast are they going? 
SAM: You mean draft. 
LAURA: Is it possible? 
MARISHA: Draft, that's correct. 
MATT: It's possible. You all are traveling much faster than they are. 
LAURA: Oh, right. 
MARISHA: Ruidus Drift. 
MATT: You are, for high fantasy terms, outside of teleportation, you're breakneck speed. You're all running freeway speeds when most things are-- These are bison. 
LAURA: Right. 
ASHLEY: Should we take a minute, dig down a little, and see? 
MATT: If you want to. 
LAURA: I mean, they're going into the storm. That's what we were doing. 
SAM: Do you want to communicate with them with the language of love? (laughter) 
LAURA: They can't see us, we're farts. 
SAM: We'll just note them. 
LAURA: Yeah, note them for future. Keep going. 
MATT: Okay, do you careen away and continue on your path? 
SAM: Keep on going. 
MATT: Okay. You pull away from the cluster of beasts pushing-- 
TRAVIS: How far are we away from the beasts, roughly? 
MATT: I'd say right now, you're a few hundred feet away. You're just close enough to start picking up the details of their forms. 
TRAVIS: You can't pick anything up, can you? Just in case they're intelligent or something. 
SAM: I mean, we could drop the form and then pick it back up again a minute later. 
LAURA: I don't think I can, We can't use any-- 
ASHLEY: I thought I could. 
LAURA: We can? Wait-- 
SAM: We can drop the form. It takes a minute. 
MATT: It takes a minute to drop the form. 
SAM: Interact with them, and then take a minute, resume the form again. 
LAURA: I don't want to interact with-- 
SAM: Well, then why are we going down there? 
TRAVIS: They might not be trying to kill us. They could tell us about the area, they could give us warnings, or they could just be beasts and then we're clouds again, just in case they're fucking yetis or whatever. 
ASHLEY: I did, I prepped something just in case. 
SAM: Amazing, so you can talk to them and befriend them? 
ASHLEY: I prepped something called Beast Sense. 
SAM: Great. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: It's a willing beast that you can see. 
SAM: I can talk to them. You can talk to them, too. 
LIAM: Are they on wide, flat land? 
ASHLEY: I don't think I prepped Speak With Animals. 
MATT: It's wide and flat in places, but also, the topography shifts pretty heavily. 
LIAM: Because if we go into humanoid form and they are not friendly-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's one minute. 
LIAM: -- and we want to turn back into clouds, 
LAURA: We're fucked. 
LIAM: -- we're cooked. Because there's nowhere to go to spend a minute without getting gored by-- 
TRAVIS: We just send the robot. 
LAURA: I don't-- 
SAM: We take chances. 
LAURA: I think they're fucking-- 
SAM: We take chances! 
LAURA: They're like beasts. 
SAM: We take chances! We're on the moon, we've got to take chances! 
LAURA: Yeah, but there's Reiloran ahead. 
LIAM: We're going to be taking a lot of chances. Plenty of chances. 
ASHLEY: What if we get a little close, just to see if you get a ping? 
LAURA: I'm a cloud. We don't get pings as clouds. We'd have to drop the form. 
ASHLEY: I understand what everybody's talking about. 
TRAVIS: I'm sure there will be more. There can't be only 13 blood buffalo on the moon, right? 
SAM: What if they're the nicest ones, though? 
ASHLEY: 13, and they're-- 
LIAM: They're bluffalo. 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
SAM: I could go talk to it. 
LIAM: That's terrible. 
SAM: Then I could just hide, if they are ill-tempered. 
TALIESIN: Where? 
SAM: You know. (laughs) 
MATT: Do you want to diverge or continue? The storm that they're heading towards is growing closer. 
LAURA: Yeah, they're going into the storm. 
TRAVIS: Want to keep going? 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TRAVIS: Let's keep going. 
TALIESIN: They're not going to stop and wait for us to take a minute to turn into-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I'm not going to beg. 
TALIESIN: This is not going to work. 
TRAVIS: It's cool. 
SAM: Two clouds hang back. 
ASHLEY: What should we do? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: It feels like we could go down there and talk to them a little bit. 
ASHLEY: Should we get a little lower than everybody else, or do you think they'll get pissed? 
TALIESIN: We will buy you both a puppy later. 
SAM: You don't even know which one we are. We just look like a cloud. I could just be some other-- 
SAM: I could be Laudna right now. You don't know. 
ASHLEY: Maybe. What do you want to do? I'm going to go a little lower. 
SAM: Just a little lower. (laughter) 
SAM: We're going to get a little lower to see if they seem ill-tempered. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
LIAM: I like this. 
MATT: So as most of your group begins to careen off to the left to continue coasting as long as they can on the outskirts of the oncoming massive cliff of dust storm, the two of you (squeaks) get a little closer. You can get pretty quick up along them there. Both of you roll animal handling checks, I'll say, to understand the temperament of beasts and creatures. 
SAM: Watch this. 
LIAM: Yes, sentient clouds. Make animal handling rolls. 
SAM: Watch this. 
LAURA: What can we do as clouds? 
SAM: Boom. 
LAURA: We can't do any-- 
SAM: 12. 
LAURA: -- any of our abilities. 
MATT: You can move. 
MARISHA: Boom! 
MATT: Or you can become not clouds over a minute. 
LAURA: Got it. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MATT: 19. Gliding by and getting a closer look on them, yeah, they're very strong, and the horns, as they curve around, the front of the head, you can see they have the side-mounted eyes. They're definitely prey beasts, by evolution standards. They're not predators, you can gather by the way that their eyes are set in the side of the face. 
SAM: Cows! 
MATT: Their nose, as it protrudes forward, as opposed to a bovine-type nose, it goes into this smooth curve, like a stunted elephant in the front that curves forward. You can see as they're running, the bottom of it opens up every now and then. You can see a big row of square teeth that are-- 
SAM: Square teeth! Vegetarians! 
MATT: There's a foam froth at the corners as they run, but it seems through activity. There's no sign of fear in their movement. They're just running. 
SAM: Square teeth. Vegetarians. 
LAURA: Yeah, vegetarians. Have you ever been bitten by a horse, FCG? 
SAM: No. 
ASHLEY: That's a very good point. 
SAM: No, I haven't. They don't bite people. 
MATT: You do also see that three of them of the group are of slightly smaller size, so you see there are some adolescents with the rest there. (aww-ing) 
LIAM: Are there little teeny horns? 
LAURA: Little babies! 
MATT: They do. Little curves. (cooing noises) 
SAM: We have to know them. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What do you want to do? Do you want to go back up? 
MATT: You also gather they're about, front, nose to back end, about nine to 10 feet. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MATT: So they're quite large. 
SAM: Nice for cuddling! 
ASHLEY: I want to give it a spoon! 
SAM: I don't know what to do. 
ASHLEY: All right, well, let's go back up. 
SAM: Can our friends hear us? Hello? Can you hear us psychically? 
LAURA: Can we? 
MATT: What's the distance on that spell? 
SAM: That's my spell, isn't it? 
MATT: Telepathic Bond? 
LAURA: I think it's miles. 
MATT: I think it's miles, so yeah, you can hear them. 
TALIESIN: No, you can't. 
SAM: Hey! (laughter) 
SAM: These guys seem harmless. They're vegetarians. 
LAURA: Yeah, they're like bulls. They're moon bulls. 
SAM: Or-- Or something nicer than a bull. 
TALIESIN: Are you both flying into a dust storm right now? Straight into a giant wall of death? 
SAM: No, we're hanging out with these cuties. 
ASHLEY: We were just seeing-- 
TALIESIN: Could you look up for just a second? Just in front of you? What do you see? 
SAM: I don't see you anymore. 
LAURA: You see a giant dust storm. 
ASHLEY: We've got to get up there. 
LAURA: Hurry! You're going to get sucked into that storm. 
SAM: Not us. We're too good. We're squid swimming through the storm. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: Did the rest of you wait up a little bit for your two scattered friends? 
LIAM: Are you flying alongside them? With them? 
SAM: Yeah, we flew up through and between them. 
MATT: Yeah, you all split off, and they went and followed the rest of that group. 
LIAM: But you're 10 or 15 feet away from these things? 
SAM: Yeah, between-- 
ASHLEY: These are the first-- 
LIAM: You are absolutely blending their fart molecules with the molecules of your body. 
MATT: We'll get there. 
ASHLEY: These are the first beasts we've seen on another planet! How can you not go up and look at it? 
SAM: First contact! 
ASHLEY: Have to! Okay, let's go. 
SAM: The Changebringer would've wanted this. 
ASHLEY: I agree. 
TRAVIS: It's second or third contact, but yeah. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. Well, you know. 
MATT: So you're both now returning-- 
SAM: Yes, we're returning. 
MATT: The rest of you are waiting for them? 
TRAVIS: Can't believe you guys-- 
LAURA: Ish. 
TALIESIN: Eh. 
TRAVIS: -- went to visit these buffalo. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Not running. We're trotting. 
LAURA: Yeah, we slowed down, but we didn't stop. 
LIAM: To 50 miles an hour. 
MATT: Yeah, there you go. Eventually, you all gather up once more, and following along the storm's side, the storm front, you realize at this point, is hundreds of miles long, probably. From what you can tell, you don't see an end of it. You don't see a curve. It continues on into the horizon, and the open pocket of clear sky that you've been enjoying since your arrival is short-lived. So you get the sense that either you're going to have to continue to veer further left and it'll be another series of rolls to try and get back on course, or you could try and land or push through the storm. 
TALIESIN: Is there anything resembling shelter at all? 
MARISHA: Do you think the buffalo would let us ride them? 
TALIESIN: I thought about it. 
SAM: Of course they would. 
TALIESIN: I'm not going to pretend I didn't. There's a whole series of complicated issues there, because we would have to wait for a whole minute, and they're going to run away. 
MARISHA: Wait, let's go back to Orym's combining with their fart molecules thing. If we, theoretically-- 
TRAVIS: We're backtracking for fart molecules? 
MARISHA: Well, could we seek shelter as gaseous forms in the buffalo? 
LAURA: Oh my-- 
SAM: Go up their asses? 
TRAVIS: Like a tauntaun? 
MARISHA: Yes, like a tauntaun, but up their-- 
LAURA: -- gods. 
MARISHA: I'm just saying. 
LIAM: That would be a high-- 
TALIESIN: Can a campaign go by where we don't go up something's ass? 
SAM: When you look over to the Fearne and FCG clouds-- 
TALIESIN: Just one. 
LIAM: We've done it already. 
TALIESIN: Oh god! 
SAM: You notice that the Fearne and FCG clouds are just a little pouty. 
TRAVIS: Are we pushing on or are we going down to the ground? 
SAM: Just a little bitchy. 
LAURA: We already said! 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LAURA: If we can't cut it, we'll try to cut through the storm. Let's try to fucking-- 
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a little-- 
MATT: Perception or survival. 
TRAVIS: Give him the order. 
TALIESIN: 17. 
MATT: 17, not bad. 
ASHLEY: No sense of adventure. 
MATT: Yeah, so you can see-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Because you're now starting to hit that point where the storm is consuming the mountain range and you're along the base of the mountain range that you've been following along the way, where the mountains begin to rise, you can see there are cliff edges that protrude out in these harsh endings, and beneath that, there are alcoves, the faces of caverns that might burrow deeper into the mountain. You're not quite sure how shallow they are. You can see there are various cracks in the ground, some three, five, 10 feet deep or more, that can also be places to weather the storm if you wanted to stay stationary. You also do not know how long this storm may blow. 
TALIESIN: Do we want to-- How long does this spell last beyond where we're at now? 
MATT: Eight hours. 
LIAM: We have no idea how far away the city is. 
MATT: I'd say for now, you've traveled about, or you have about an hour of the spell's being used, so you still have seven hours of it being available to you. 
TRAVIS: I think we should probably ground ourselves, because if we do get hit and it scatters us, then we're separated. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: We're fucked. 
TALIESIN: I would say let's take a minute to regroup in one of these little shelters, one of the little cliff edges or in one of the crevices, cliff edge probably. 
LIAM: Short rest on a Martian mountain? 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
MATT: Okay, you all begin to descend quickly towards what you find is the nearest, safest-looking alcove right along the base of this mountain range. As you careen up to its side and fit within the space, it's maybe about 25 feet wide at the mouth of it and about 10, 12 feet tall, so it's very much this wide, oval-type entryway shape with a jagged top and roof. As you enter in, it only goes back about another 30 or so feet before it stops. You do find it a space where it seems the wind doesn't quite pierce into the interior. The temperature is a bit cold out here, but not as cold as it would be as you all begin to, I assume you're reverting to your normal forms as you enter? 
TALIESIN: I would assume we're taking some person time. 
MATT: Okay. As you revert within this cavern, you feel that temperature rush into you. It's chillier than it was back at the encampment where you had arrived at, so you immediately begin to have to bundle up a bit, too. Be aware that at these certain storms, it seems, the temperature drops pretty significantly. 
TRAVIS: Before we go into the cave too far, let's just say before we went in, we cast a look over our shoulders because we made a highly arcane-fueled escape from an area where people were looking for us. Was anything flying in the air behind us, looking for us? 
MATT: Perception check, perception check. 
TRAVIS: Will you-- 
LIAM: Always. 
MATT: I always assume if there's one there, it's going to be in Orym's-- 
LIAM: Oh, very average. 
TRAVIS: Natural 19 for a dirty 20. 
MATT: Nice. 
LIAM: Dirty 20. Like father like son. 
MATT: Dang. (laughter) 
MATT: God. 
TRAVIS: The source. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
MATT: Looking back, and you have, at this moment, as the storm's just starting to push over, you can see the periphery of your vision out back from where you came from. The dark red is starting to consume the outside, but you still have a pretty clear shot from the direction you came from. You can see, on that end, the dark, cloud-covered horizon. You can see the occasional flashes in the distance, the wisps of gray-red clouds that dapple the open space. No sign of anything directly in pursuit, or if anything is, you've at least outpaced it for the time being. 
LIAM: Can we see the Bloody Bridge in the distance? 
MATT: Oh yeah, you can definitely see that singular thread, and it follows it up before it nearly vanishes at the cusp of your home. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Laudna? 
MARISHA: Are we de-clouding? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Got anything on the magic? 
LIAM: De-queef. 
TALIESIN: On the ball of doom? 
MARISHA: As soon as I de-queef myself. 
TALIESIN: (snorts) 
MATT: (heavy sigh) 
MARISHA: I pull out the Treshi scry ball. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Merriam Webster's new Word of the Year. (laughter) 
LIAM: De-queef. 
ASHLEY: Be-queef? 
LIAM: Re-queef. De-queef. 
MARISHA: Be-queefed? (laughter) 
MATT: (heavy sigh) 
LIAM: It's the new, "Be pleased." 
MARISHA: Yeah, "Be queefed." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: No, no, no! We don't have any more! 
TALIESIN: Stop it! 
ASHLEY: Don't do it! 
TALIESIN: That was brilliant. 
TRAVIS: No, we don't deserve-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: So wait, we have "Bidet," "Minus eyes," and "Be queefed." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Beep beep. 
MARISHA: Beep beep. (laughs) 
SAM: Dearly be-queefed. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's so great to be back. 
LAURA: "Dearly be-queefed"? 
MATT: The scry ball's dark. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Like your heart. (laughter) 
SAM: I look up and out, out and up at-- Can I see Exandria from here? 
MATT: You can indeed, though it is going to rapidly vanish as the dust cloud begins to consume the area. 
SAM: Does it look like it's moved at all? 
MATT: Not from what you can tell. 
MARISHA: That's not no. 
SAM: I'll keep looking. 
MARISHA: You lie to him. 
SAM: I'll keep looking. 
MARISHA: Tell him the tround. 
TALIESIN: Signs of activity? 
MATT: They're tidally-locked by the Bloody Bridge. 
MARISHA: It's tidally-locked. 
MATT: This is all fucked. 
MARISHA: No! 
MATT: I want nothing more than to disprove him. 
MARISHA: It's tidally-locked. 
LIAM: How much of the sky does it take up? 
TRAVIS: Tidally-locked. 
LIAM: Exandria? 
MATT: From where you are here, if you look out beyond the cave, which means you have a decent chunk of your vision is available from where the cave closes off, Exandria takes up probably a good fifth of the sky. 
SAM: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: A fifth to a sixth of the sky from what you can see. So it's pretty massive and it's not too distant. Ruidus just looks a lot smaller because it is a smaller mass from Exandria, but Exandria's quite large. 
LAURA: So we can still see the sky through the storm coming? 
MATT: You're seeing it for the last moment you can as the clouds are beginning to swarm in. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Have we looked around this place? I'm looking around the-- 
TRAVIS: Cave? 
SAM: It's a cave or a structure? 
LAURA: It's a cave. It's an outcropping. 
TALIESIN: It's a cave. I want to see if it seems like people have ever been here before. Are there footsteps where we haven't gone? 
MATT: You can make an investigation check for me. 
SAM: I'll cast Light through my eyeballs. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: What kind of check did you say? 
MATT: Investigation. 
TALIESIN: Investigation. 
TRAVIS: I'll do a (sniff) for any organics or for smells in general. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LIAM: Look how smart, you're smart, very smart. Oh, it's me and Chetney. 
LAURA: I'm not smart. 
ASHLEY: Can we see Catha from here? 
MATT: From this perspective, you do not see Catha. 
TRAVIS: 18 on the nose. 
LIAM: 19. 
MATT: Great. 
LAURA: I could make myself smart. 
MATT: You light up the interior of the back of this cave. You do immediately notice, one: There are signs of a small fire that hasn't been used, with a glance over it, probably in quite some time. This is not the first time something has used this cave for cover. You can see what looks to be remnants of rope, but it's of a material, once you pick it up and look at it, it's began to deteriorate and decay over time. So it's also been here for quite some time and exposed to the elements. But it's not a standard hempen rope or a silken rope. The material's almost spongy. Yeah, it has an old, decaying sponge crumbliness to it as you rub your fingers on it and the faintest gray-blue color. Someone make a nature check, if you want to, to inspect this material. 
MARISHA: I'll try. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
MARISHA: It feels like something. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Thank you. 
MATT: Great. 
MARISHA: That's with a d4, correct, for you? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: Look at you, learning to play D&D. 
ASHLEY: Oh, who me, after 10 years? (laughter) 
MATT: I knew we'd get there eventually, guys. I'm so proud of you. 
MARISHA: 21. 
MATT: 21. You, in particular, being familiar with the darker, more moisture-based portions of natural spaces, this is a fungus-- 
MARISHA: (knowing laugh) 
MATT: -- or at least it was once a fungus. Oh my god, you two. (laughter) 
MATT: (heavy sigh) (laughter) 
MATT: My friends are dirty. I don't mind. 
LIAM: You got to get something to clear up that Delilah. (laughter) 
MATT: See, that's the problem, it doesn't ever go away. It just flares up every now and then. 
ASHLEY: It flares up. (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: But whatever material this rope is made of is fungus. It's a dried, treated fungus. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: But for fungus to exist, it needs dark, damp spaces. 
MARISHA: Something to feed off of and dark, damp spaces. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Could I-- 
TALIESIN: Chet, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Some need two dark spaces. (laughter) 
MATT: You're not wrong, either. 
TRAVIS: Could I go over to the campfire and do my damn thing? 
TALIESIN: I was going to offer you a knife for that. 
TRAVIS: Grim Psychometry, touch the middle of the fireplace and "recall information about the sinister or tragic history of an object or area you're touching at your current location." 
MATT: Yeah, make that wisdom roll for me. 
TRAVIS: I think it's intelligence. 
MATT: What does it say on the ability? 
TRAVIS: Intelligence roll, a history check. 
MATT: Oh, gotcha. 
TRAVIS: Plus three, 19, 20, 21. 
MATT: 21, 21's not bad. As you're looking over the space, you sit down and concentrate and as you breathe outward, the crimson power that sits in your body seems to connect with the crimson rust of the landscape that surrounds you and as you close your eyes, you see a shape or a shadow. It's you, hunched and squat, swathed in tattered materials. You gather tools and watch as a storm clears. Pick your things up, take hitching post reins that have been dangling on the outside and you can see there's some sort of a beast of burden on the outskirt. As you begin to move, you hear restlessness. A beast (snorts) and then it tears away out of your grasp and you see this shape dart off into the field. You go to give chase before the ground quakes and tears open beneath it as a larger shadow just (poof) consumes your mount and is gone. You stay perfectly still and you hold your breath and when you think time has passed and it's safe, you take a step back. (rumbles) You feel the quaking once more. You dart out of the cavern because there's nowhere else to go and you begin to climb up the side of the rock to try and get above ground, to try and get to a space where it can't get to you. But in the back of your mind, you know there's nowhere to escape before the shadow takes you, too. (poofs) 
TRAVIS: That's not good. (gasp) 
SAM: That look, why have you got that look? 
TRAVIS: We got Kevin Bacon, "Tremors." Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: There's something that burrows through the ground and comes up. 
SAM: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Should we leave? We should probably leave. 
TRAVIS: No, we should stay here. 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: Yes, and we should all-- 
MARISHA: Not move, ever. 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: No, no, flying's good. 
SAM: Oh, okay. (chuckles) We should leave. 
TRAVIS: Also, I can't tell how long that was, but it was here. They were taking shelter, but they had a mount and it seemed very perilous on the ground. So it may be good to be wary of. 
SAM: Any signs of recent death, bones or anything like that? 
MATT: You've done a pretty fair investigation in the space around this between your Light and you all taking a look. No sign of bones, no sign of death. Just been abandoned for quite some time. 
TALIESIN: No graffiti, no scratching? 
LAURA: We hold still. 
MATT: You don't see any, and the thing is most of the ground here, because of the nature of these storms that blow through, dust gets brought in in heavy amounts and then gets drawn out like a suction wind tunnel. So by that nature, the landscape of the surface and the near surface of this moon is ever being wiped clean and changing and growing and eroding. 
LAURA: Can I feel the presence of Predathos? 
MATT: Do you want to try and reach out? 
LAURA: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: You're in a protected spot-ish. 
LIAM: Yeah, you do. 
LAURA: Just to see? 
TRAVIS: Surrounded by friends, no enemies. 
LIAM: We're here for a recon. 
TRAVIS: Probably going to take a short rest. 
MARISHA: I think it's still safe to stay here and we can just be aware that we might have company. Maybe you just stay quiet. 
LIAM: What was the vision? Was it out on the ground? 
SAM: The shadow killed the mount? 
TRAVIS: It left the cave. 
LIAM: Right. 
TRAVIS: The mount burst from the cave and went down to the plains and in front of it, something seemed to come up out of the ground. 
LIAM: So we're talking "Dune" rules, rock-- 
TRAVIS: I think so. 
LIAM: Structure-- 
TRAVIS: I think so. 
LIAM: Safer. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Down where there's-- 
LAURA: Maybe we take a short rest and then I see if I can sense Predathos. 
TRAVIS: That's fair. 
LAURA: Just so we can get a little bit of our strength back. 
TRAVIS: It might not be a cave, it could be a (rumbles). 
ASHLEY: What if it's like a blip? 
LAURA: What if it pings us? Let's take a short rest and then I'll see if I can sense it because if it lets everyone know our location, I don't want to take that risk. 
TALIESIN: Take a short rest, then we'll-- 
LIAM: FCG can teleport us out of here. It'll be fine. 
TALIESIN: -- see what happens. 
SAM: I got it. Short rest. 
TRAVIS: Short rest? 
MARISHA: Short rest. 
MATT: Okay, y'all take a short rest. You can spend your hit dice to heal up, get back any abilities and/or spells. 
MARISHA: How much do we have? We should still have a decent amount left of our Heroes' Feast, right? 24 hours? 
MATT: Yeah, you ate it the night before you left, correct? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: To save the spell slot? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: So that would be eight hours, I'd say nine. So you have about 14 more hours of your Heroes' Feast, including the travel and your short rest here. 
TRAVIS: I'm rolling almost all of my blood hunter dice because I got fucked up down below. 
MATT: Oh, buddy. 
TRAVIS: (flaps lips) Yeah! 
MARISHA: Nine. 
TRAVIS: 37. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That would be another hour. 
TRAVIS: 44. 
SAM: I don't need to take-- 
LIAM: Damn it. 
SAM: -- a short rest. 
LIAM: Damn it! Nine. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That doesn't get you anything? 
LIAM: Damn it! I'm rolling so low on all these. 
SAM: I don't need to take a short rest, so I'm going to spend this hour baking. 
MATT: Okay, you can do that. 
SAM: I'm going to bake. 
TALIESIN: All right. How's the weather outside? 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: The storm hasn't let up. 
TALIESIN: It's still frightful, okay. 
MATT: From best you can-- You can't see more than maybe 20 feet beyond the mouth of the cave. The storm has entirely enclosed and devoured the horizon. 
TALIESIN: The wind is heavy? 
MATT: It is quite heavy, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: May I-- 
LAURA: But our max hit points are up from our new roll. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: So it's not going to that. It should be-- I should have 89. 
MATT: Just override HP for now. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Matt, question. 
MATT: Mm-hmm? 
MARISHA: If I-- 
TALIESIN: Are we lost? 
MARISHA: -- Find Familiar to get Pâté back, if I have him on me, would he also take the gaseous form? 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: So I should probably not bring him back right now? 
MATT: I'd probably recommend doing that at a place where-- 
MARISHA: We're not-- 
MATT: Yeah, you can always summon him again later if you need to at another location. But he is unaffected by that spell. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Could you throw him in the bag of holding when we gas it up? 
MATT: You could do that. 
LIAM: Pull him out later. 
SAM: Speaking of the bag of holding-- 
MARISHA: It's true, he's not really living. 
MATT: Mm-mm. 
MARISHA: So he can-- 
MATT: He is quite not living. 
ASHLEY: Oh, the possum. 
MATT: He's just aware. 
MARISHA: So it wouldn't bamf him out, I could keep him in the bag of holding while we turn? 
MATT: You could. 
MARISHA: All right, then I'll bring him back. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's good to have him. 
SAM: Here's a question. 
MATT: Yeah? 
SAM: We put a possum in the bag of holding, then you stopped concentrating. So now is it a gigantic creature in the bag of holding? 
TRAVIS: Bag of holding, there's five to 10 minutes of air. 
SAM: But how do we get it out? 
TALIESIN: We don't have to. 
LAURA: We just ask for it. We just call it forward. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you could just call it forward, but remember, we did this with Dork the Ox. 
TALIESIN: It's dead. 
LAURA: Yeah, but by that point, Dork the Ox was-- 
SAM: Doesn't it rip the bag? 
LAURA: No, no, no. It just comes out rotten and gooey. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: But this one has only been-- 
MARISHA: It's a pocket dimension. 
TRAVIS: Or in pieces. 
LAURA: This one has only been dead for a short time. Dork the Ox had been dead in there for quite awhile. 
TRAVIS: We're also assuming that Reilorans breathe. 
LAURA: That's true, it could still be alive. 
LIAM: That's true. 
MARISHA: Dork was some home game shit. No one knows what we're talking about. 
LAURA: Yeah. I know. (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Some old school folk do. 
TRAVIS: First animal-- 
MATT: We've talked about Dork. 
TRAVIS: -- we put in the bag of holding. 
MATT: Then the last. Well no. 
TRAVIS: Grog put him in there. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh, yeah. 
TRAVIS: It made sense at the time. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: (Grog) "We'll just hold this ox 'til later." 
MATT: The fun part was watching him put it in there. 
ASHLEY: (as Grog) "It's a great spot for him." 
TALIESIN: Worst case scenario-- 
TRAVIS: (ox squeals) 
TALIESIN: -- if he's not dead, we can kick him right out into the storm. 
TRAVIS: "Don't fight it." 
SAM: I guess my question is we can still get other things out of the bag. It's not consuming the space? 
TRAVIS and LIAM: No. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Not like that. 
ASHLEY: But is there a way to-- 
SAM: Isn't there a limit to bag of holding capacity? 
TRAVIS: Size and weight-wise. 
MATT: There is. 
LIAM: It's huge though. 
TRAVIS: But it's massive. 
LIAM: It's a Mary Poppins bag. You can be like: I want my umbrella, and the umbrella comes out. 
SAM: Sure, but if this thing is a ton-- 
MATT: He's taking up a chunk of space in there. 
LIAM: Sam, you know this is all make-believe, right? 
SAM: It needs to make sense for me. 
MATT: There is a limit. 
ASHLEY: There's no way to just peek to see how he's doing? 
MATT: The bag of holding-- The portable hole, you could-- 
SAM: Now that doesn't make sense. (laughter) 
MATT: The portable hole, you can look into like it's a storage chamber. 
ASHLEY: That's fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: The bag of holding, you think about what you want when you reach in and you pull it out. But you can't actually look into it. 
ASHLEY: You have to pull it all the way out. I can't just halfsies pull him out to be like: Oh shit, he's still alive and shove him back in. 
MATT: I mean, you can try, you can certainly try. 
TRAVIS: He could probably fight back. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: If he's alive. 
ASHLEY: We'll wait on that. 
TRAVIS: He can breathe. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: When we leave, we'll pull him out and leave him here. 
TRAVIS: Most likely dead. 
ASHLEY: We'll circle back. We'll circle back. 
LIAM: We'll leave him in there. 
TALIESIN: Which is why if someone doesn't know what's in the bag, they can't pull it out. 
TRAVIS: As a meat distraction later. 
ASHLEY: I was going to say, he could also be food for-- 
TALIESIN: They have to destroy the bag and then everything goes poof. 
LIAM: Alive or dead. 
MARISHA: Well that was one of the juggernauts, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Which was an automaton? 
MATT: No, just a big beefy Reiloran. 
LIAM: No, that was just a big beefcake Reiloran. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: I thought it was a juggernaut. 
LAURA: I regained one of my spells with my short rest. 
MATT: Okay. Also, as you're having the short rest, Imogen. 
LAURA: Oh fuck. 
TRAVIS: No! 
SAM: Yes! 
TRAVIS: I mean yes. (laughs) 
MATT: You're concentrating and focusing and everyone's going about their business, you notice this shimmer of the faintest bit of energy that just rests in the air, like how magnetic powers near iron filings can draw them together. There's this ever-present red energy that sits around you. If you look off into space into the blue sky for too long, you can just make out the ever-shifting pattern of this energy. It's always been there and you've come to now realize it's probably part of your essence of a Ruidusborn. But you can see it drawn in a direction and you watch it shift and the only thing that's shifting is Fearne, like there's a part of your energy that's reaching out or at least is connected in some way that you can't describe. 
ASHLEY: I'm just moving slow-mo. (laughter) 
LAURA: Dat ass, though. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ (humming) ♪ 
MATT: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
LAURA: (laughs) Can you come over here? 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
LIAM: Slowly. 
LAURA: As she walks toward me, does it get stronger, that feeling? 
MATT: It does, faintly. You saw this once before. 
LAURA: When it-- 
MATT: Right before the Bloody Bridge was created when the event happened at the Malleus Key and all the various Ruidusborn felt this previously unknown energy of, Exaltants or not, being drawn towards this central event. But that never went away, it wasn't expended. That was just a manifestation of this innate power, and now here on this planet, it seems like it's slightly more present or visible than you could previously expect and so if you concentrate, but hold still and don't focus directly on something, but let your vision take in the space, you can see this ever so faint ethereal red tether between the two of you. 
LAURA: Do you see that? 
ASHLEY: What? Do I see it? 
LAURA: Unfocus your eyes. Have you ever looked at one of those magic images, you know, where you-- 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: You unfocus your eyes-- 
ASHLEY: Where your eyes get all weird and everyone's like-- 
LAURA: -- then you see something else? 
ASHLEY: -- I see this. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: And I'm like: I can't. 
LAURA: "Oh, it's a sailboat!" 
ASHLEY: But my eyes just hurt. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you mean. 
LAURA: Try to do that. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Now Fearne, you have a pretty high passive perception. So it's very easy for you to pick up on this particular pattern. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh, this thing. 
LAURA: I know! 
LIAM: They make them in Rosohna. 
LAURA: We have a Bloody Bridge between us. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Wow. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: You begin to consider what this could be. 
LIAM: They're synced up. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: We're in sync. (sporadic laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Bye bye bye ♪ 
LIAM: We're in a mood tonight. 
MATT: I can tell. 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
MATT: Oh, we're all punchy. 
ASHLEY: It's been a while. (laughter) 
SAM: Children, just absolute children. 
ASHLEY: ♪ It's been a while ♪ 
MATT: This is extremely unrealistic for any true D&D campaign. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Everyone's always very serious. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
MATT: But even taking a moment, you had not really focused on the connection between Ruidusborn and those power sets, those seeds of Predathos' ability that rest in each of you. But you now see that it's not independent, meaning there is something that connects you all, even on some unseen level that is only just barely visible here. If you want to check your feats real fast-- 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: -- you have a new feature. 
LAURA: Me? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Stealthed it in. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
LIAM: Does that mean that-- 
TRAVIS: While we were watching him. 
LIAM: -- all the living Ruidusborn are a network? 
TRAVIS: Sneaky. 
SAM: Could be. 
LAURA: Wait, wait, where? 
LIAM: Flesh batteries? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. If those "War of the Worlds" capillary-looking vegetation is any indication, maybe it is all part of one big shared-- 
ASHLEY: What do you see? 
LIAM: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: What if y'all are like red blood cells? 
LAURA: (gasps) (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Double gasp? 
TALIESIN: What the fuck do you think they're doing over there? 
LAURA: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: You could read it aloud. 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: That's weird. 
LAURA: Sick! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! That's cool! 
TALIESIN: I don't like it. 
ASHLEY: I get a benefit just from being around her because I'm Ruidusborn, too. 
TRAVIS: Won't you share with the class? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: How's y'all doing? 
LAURA: We can share magic. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Oh. Oh? What? 
LIAM: They're in sync. 
ASHLEY: That's cool! 
MARISHA: They're synced up. 
LAURA: We're synced up! 
TALIESIN: Bound to happen. 
MARISHA: Moon stuff. 
LAURA: "You can spend your sorcery points to replenish target Ruidusborn of their expended spell slots." So I can use my sorcery points to give her some spells back and she can also sacrifice spell slots to give me sorcery points. 
ASHLEY: That's fucking cool. 
LAURA: So, if you have a ton of spells left and I have none, you can give me a spell slot basically because I can replenish from my sorcery points. 
ASHLEY: If I have a tampon and you do not-- 
LAURA: You can give me one. 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry. 
LAURA: And if you're all out of spells and I have sorcery points, I can give you a spell slot. 
MATT: I should have foreseen seen this-- 
ASHLEY: I am so sorry. 
MATT: -- immediately. 
TRAVIS: This is good. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: We've been making Bloody Bridge jokes for months. Months. 
LAURA: Matt. 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
LAURA: Matt. 
ASHLEY: It's just going to come out. 
LAURA: Moon pearls. 
MARISHA: Moon pearls. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: The pearls are the best ones. 
TRAVIS: Or if you have one spell that's really working and the rest aren't, then you can crank it into the other person. 
LAURA: Yeah. I wonder if we could maybe use this if we did a spell in conjunction with each other? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: It might amplify it in some way? 
ASHLEY: It could amplify it. 
TRAVIS: I can't handle this bloody conversation. 
ASHLEY: This is very cool. 
MARISHA, MATT, and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LAURA and ASHLEY: This is very cool. 
SAM: This is just women feeling their power. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: We should just let this happen. 
ASHLEY: We're just stepping into our bloody power. 
SAM: (laughs) 
SAM: Are you okay, Laudna? 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
MARISHA: Do I have an aura? 
SAM: Yeah, are you jealous or anything? 
MARISHA: No! 
SAM: Okay. Because they seem like they're bonding. 
MARISHA: Do I have an aura? 
LAURA: Step closer. 
ASHLEY: Yes, you do. 
LIAM: Do you have blood? 
ASHLEY: You've always had one. 
LAURA: Yeah. I see it, there's a tether. 
SAM: But can you guys share spells and stuff like you're talking about with Fearne? 
MARISHA: I don't think so. 
ASHLEY: I don't know. 
LAURA: I don't know. Is Laudna Ruidusborn? 
MARISHA: No. No, definitely not. I'm maybe Ruidus-dead. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: There are lots of threads, though. 
LAURA: Yeah, I see-- No, seriously though, everybody-- 
SAM: That's just her hair I think. 
LAURA: -- looks-- (laughs) 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. It falls out in clumps. 
LAURA: You said we could see little connections with everybody here, right? 
MATT: I mean-- 
SAM: Right? (laughter) 
LAURA: Obviously I'm not trying to take advantage of this feat. That would just be-- 
MATT: To be specific, what you're noticing here seems to be primarily, or, ultimately between Ruidusborn. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay, sorry. I misunderstood, that was my bad. 
MATT: The second thought that comes to you is if this is what can connect the two of you-- 
SAM: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: Network. 
TALIESIN: We should-- 
SAM: Then it's what can drive you apart as well. 
ASHLEY: It's a whole neural network. 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
MARISHA: Also, other people could-- 
TALIESIN: Other people who can follow the thread. 
MARISHA: Or could take advantage of that. 
SAM: Or your mom could sap your sorcery points. 
MARISHA: Yes, that's what I was thinking. 
LIAM: That was my question. Do you have to willingly give up those spell slots or can you vampirize someone else's slots against their will? 
LAURA: It doesn't say. It says they can sacrifice their spell slots. 
TALIESIN: Interesting. 
LAURA: It doesn't-- 
TRAVIS: You don't know if you don't try. 
MATT: You haven't tried it, but-- 
LIAM: Your mom is super strong. 
SAM: Maybe you could sap some magic from Otohan or she could sap some magic from you. 
ASHLEY: But I wonder, because you were made by fate and I was-- 
TALIESIN: Weren't we all? 
ASHLEY: -- made by design, I guess. So I wonder if I'm off the grid a little bit. 
LAURA: I mean, you come from the Fey Realm. 
ASHLEY: You know what I mean? 
LAURA: I don't think there's a lot of Ruidusborn in the Fey Realm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. All right, well we're going to have to tinker with this. This is cool. All right. 
LAURA: Sick. 
SAM: I love you too. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) You're great. 
MARISHA: Your aura is a soft blue. 
SAM: Oh yeah? And it's connected to you? 
MARISHA: It's just, I don't know. It could be just the way the light is bouncing off of you. 
SAM: Yeah, that's what it is. 
MARISHA: I'm not entirely sure. 
SAM: My lights are on. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Don't forget, you're a high value target. Somebody tried to kill you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I mean-- 
TRAVIS: I don't even think we know that whole story. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We'll keep our eyes peeled for anything Seelie in nature. 
SAM: Mm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Should I try to connect to Predathos? Feel it out? 
TRAVIS: I mean-- 
SAM: Yeah, sure. Are you Scrying, what are you doing? 
LAURA: Probably just a little opening up my mind to-- 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: -- what's-- 
TALIESIN: As long as we're okay having to take off pretty quick if things go south. 
TRAVIS: It could be a (shoots a flare), but we're all right. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: A flare. 
LIAM: It's also the whole reason we're here, and we're alone for now. 
MARISHA: But do you think your mother could connect to that? 
LAURA: Maybe. 
LIAM: Maybe. 
MARISHA: I'm not saying it's not worth it. 
LAURA: I think it is good that we still have this spell on us that keeps anything from prying in. That might help protect us a bit. I don't know, though. 
TRAVIS: It's not like we're super stealthy either. We made a fucking mess coming in. 
TALIESIN: We make a mess wherever we go. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: But if it goes wrong, we can leave fast. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Faster than we'd be able to tomorrow. 
TALIESIN: It's true. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
MARISHA: Do it. 
TRAVIS: We'll kill you if it goes sideways. 
TALIESIN: We'll kill him if it goes sideways. 
MARISHA: I didn't-- That's not true. 
ASHLEY: I wonder if I would feel you connect? 
LAURA: I don't know. Let me know. 
TALIESIN: Fuck around and find out. 
ASHLEY: Let's see, yeah. I'm going to turn around so I'm not looking at you because that'll make a big difference. 
SAM: I'm going to pinch Imogen-- 
LAURA: Ow! What the fuck? 
SAM: -- and see if you feel it. 
ASHLEY: I didn't feel anything. 
TALIESIN: That really hurt, you motherfucker. 
SAM: Oh, what the? (laughter) 
LAURA: We're all connected here. All right. I'm going to sit down and put my palms down, like I did in my dream. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Put my palms down on the ground and reach out with open mind and try to sense Predathos. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That energy that I felt in my dream. 
MATT: You close your eyes and recall that sensation that's simultaneously reaching out and opening up. It doesn't take long for that feeling of you dropping out of your own consciousness. 
LAURA: Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. 
MATT: Like you are tumbling out of the back of a swing and there's no ground to catch you, as you feel the cavern vanish and the shadow of the surrounding rock takes you. Here in this familiar void, you feel that presence, that overwhelming presence that vibrates like the slowest, most ancient snore, rumbling through everything that surrounds you. You feel that connection, that welcoming, earnest draw, like you've never belonged to anything more in your life. You feel that tug down, down, down. Then you feel it shift as it notices you. 
LAURA: This might have been a mistake. 
MATT: You hear in your mind, in your soul, in every vibrating atom in your body, you feel it. "Welcome home. Join us. Wake us." Make a wisdom saving throw for me, please. 
TRAVIS: Did you say "Wake us?" 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Wake us. 
MARISHA: You've got advantage. 
SAM: Wisdom saving throw with advantage, yes. 
MARISHA: You've got advantage. 
SAM: Advantage. 
MARISHA: (pigeon coos) 
LAURA: Oh, jesus. Oh god, my wisdom is so low. 
SAM: Heroes' Feast, you've got this, boo. 
ASHLEY: Guidance? I don't know. 
MATT: No. 
ASHLEY: I'm just throwing it out there. 
MATT: Hey, it doesn't hurt to try. 
LAURA: Advantage, advantage, advantage, advantage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: It's not good, it's not great. 
SAM: It's great. 
LAURA: It's 14. 
SAM: That's terrible. 
MATT: 14. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: That must've been-- 
LAURA: It's not terrible. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: It's a god. 
MARISHA: It's a god. (laughs) 
MATT: This presence, they're not even words, they're just emotions that your brain can only try and comprehend. The way that it swallows you shakes you to where the steeled will that you've worked so hard to build suddenly crumbles. In that moment of faltering fear, you let it all in. 
LAURA: (fearful moan) 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
MATT: When it does, you are pulled deeper into the darkness, and suddenly you can see hundreds of little red lights here in the shadow. So many of them. One of them that looks like Fearne. Some very bright ones. One that looks like your mother. And they're all moving down. You feel all of you (quick clicks) all connect and network and, suddenly, you can feel them all looking towards you. Through all of them, you hear once more, "Wake us." Do you resist or do you delve deeper? 
TRAVIS: (laughs anxiously) 
SAM: Go in, go in, do it! 
LAURA: No way, no way, no way, no way. 
SAM: We're here for a reason. 
TRAVIS: Woo hoo! 
SAM: We're here for a reason. 
LAURA: No way, I'm going to try to fight it. 
SAM: We're here for a reason! 
LAURA: No, I'm going to try to fight it. 
TRAVIS: Wake us! 
LAURA: I don't want to wake up anything. 
TRAVIS: Start that lawn mower. 
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
LIAM: Wake us. 
SAM: He didn't say do you want to wake them. He said do you want to let yourself go deeper? 
LAURA: No I don't want to go deeper. I don't want to go deeper. I don't want to go deeper. 
LIAM: She's all by herself. She can make her own decisions. 
TRAVIS: Why? 
LAURA: I don't want to go deeper. Because if I go deeper, I won't be able to fight it, I'll be part of it. 
SAM: You got your friends here. 
TRAVIS: Are you sure? 
SAM: You've got us. 
LAURA: I really, really, really, really think so. 
SAM: You're connected to Fearne, and you love her. 
MATT: Okay. Make a wisdom saving throw. 
SAM: I'm here too. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Does it have advantage? 
TRAVIS: Do you think your mom's fighting it? Do you think she gave in? 
LAURA: I think she tried to fight it, but she's still here. She still wasn't helping us because she got sucked in. But she was trying to fight it for so long. 
SAM: Just give into it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: Okay, that's better. 
LIAM: At advantage? 
LAURA: Yeah, that's an 18. 
MATT: It's an 18? 
LIAM: Oh, there's a little one in there! 
LAURA: Yeah, isn't it cool? 
LIAM: Oh, that's how it goes. 
MATT: That series of red connecting threads, like the tiniest little bridges between all of these people, this network of Ruidusborn, all of these seeded figures that have gathered or are still gathering here to this world, for what purpose, you don't understand or now you do. To wake them, to wake it. You-- 
TRAVIS: That's why she told you to run. 
MATT: -- begin to feel-- 
ASHLEY: I think you're right. 
MATT: -- these tethers get stronger-- 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- and stronger, and you pull back and with all of your might, in the memory of being a child lost in these dreams, surrounded by dust and red and hopelessness, you scream and the darkness shatters and you are back in the cave around your friends. You all watch as Imogen just screams loudly, her eyes bright red and you watch as all of the spider-like lightning marks on her body brighten like the end of a heated ember before they slowly subside as she returns. 
MARISHA: I quickly grab her and say: Shh, shh, shh. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
MARISHA: It's all right, it's all right. Chetney, will you go check the front? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (skitters) 
MARISHA: What happened? 
LAURA: There's still time. There's still time. It's not awake yet, not all the way. Y'all, I don't know if I-- I don't know if I'd be able to fight that again. 
MARISHA: Do you think you're like their messiah, their chosen one? 
LAURA: No. No. 
MARISHA: If it's not your mother. 
LAURA: They're all-- They're all chosen, it's all, I saw everybody here. I saw all the Ruidusborn that are here. I saw you. 
ASHLEY: You did? 
LAURA: You can't fight it. 
MARISHA: But Fearne-- It seems your experience is so unique compared to, I don't mean this in a bad way, but compared to Fearne and-- 
ASHLEY: No. Listen-- 
SAM: They seem like they need you. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: I don't think if Fearne tried to do the same thing she would have the same results. 
TRAVIS: I come back from the front. Are there are any, is anything moving, flying, crawling? 
MATT: Storm's still blowing through. 
TRAVIS: Great. 
ASHLEY: When-- From my perspective, did I feel anything when she blipped online? 
MATT: I mean, her presence, just the nature of her power is something that is very affecting in the vicinity, but when she flared-- 
ASHLEY: It's different. 
MATT: -- that tether between the two of you, for a brief moment, like the filament in a light bulb, kind of (igniting) glowed. 
ASHLEY: Did the webs of all the, did they get wider and then smaller or they just were brighter, or I couldn't tell? 
MATT: They were just brighter. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: You know, Imogen, I believe you. I'm guessing you're not wrong, but what they're all gathering here to do is they're going to make it happen one way or another. You're our best shot of getting close and understanding. 
LAURA: You want me to go back in. 
LIAM: I need you here with us, and we need to get-- We need to keep going. 
MARISHA: You don't have to do anything you-- 
LIAM: Of course she doesn't have to. 
MARISHA: -- don't want to do. 
LIAM: But you know what's at stake. 
LAURA: Of course. 
MARISHA: You're still pressuring her, though. 
LAURA: But I want to be able to-- No, it's-- I don't think you understand. My mother-- My mother reached out to me my entire life. As soon as I started feeling that pull, she tried to get me to run away from it. She knew. She knew that once you were in it you couldn't escape, and I think that's, I think that's what's happening with her, you know? 
LIAM: Okay, game it out with me. We turn around. We run away. 
LAURA: No, I'm not going to run away. I'm not going to run away. We need to fight this. 
LIAM: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: I'm just saying, I don't think if I can, if I can keep from delving like that again. 
LIAM: That's not where I'm going. What you just did was dangerous, and we know more now than we did 10 minutes ago. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: But this is going to test you. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: The risk, you're right, it's real. But I don't even want to think of the alternative. So does she have to do it? No. But I am pressuring her to do it. 
TALIESIN: Let's not pretend it's not going to happen one way or another anyway. You're either going to end up down there on your terms or on somebody else's. It's just a fucking inevitability. 
LIAM: And I'm not just pressuring her, I'm pressuring you and him and them, me. 
MARISHA: We're all here. 
LIAM: Yeah. It's not a tourist stop. 
MARISHA: No. 
LIAM: We're risking everything because we have to. 
LAURA: Don't forget, Orym, this is a research mission. We're gathering intelligence. We're not going to fight it right now. 
LIAM: You just did, and there's more to know. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I have another theory. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I actually think you might be the key. Your mom, when you saw her before, she didn't try and persuade you to join, right? It was: Run. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: If they're saying: Wake us, maybe your mom is actually, hear me out, like a secret agent. Maybe she's trying to keep tabs. 
MARISHA: She's still resisting. 
TRAVIS: And the thing that they need is you. Otohan tried to unlock you, right? So what if this whole time the thing they need is you? 
MARISHA: I agree with that. It's kind of what I meant by the-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- messiah thing, their savior. It's kind of a similar vein. 
TRAVIS: Which puts us in a very advantageous position. I'm just saying. I would rather have the thing that they want and need than not be able to affect any kind of influence at all. Plus, it might help explain why it's been connected in the sky for so long and-- 
MARISHA: Nothing's happened. 
TRAVIS: -- nothing's really happened. 
SAM: It could also be somewhere in between where they need her to make it sooner, faster, easier, but they can still do it without her. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: If it was really, if we knew that it was her, then we should not have you here at all. We should lock you away where they can't find you somewhere. 
TALIESIN: I don't think that that's an option. 
ASHLEY: But also, I feel like all the Reilorans that we've met, they seem wonderful to me, you know? This is their home. 
MARISHA: But to that point, remember when we were coming up here and the one Reiloran alluded to good guys versus bad guys up here. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Your-- 
LAURA: They called it what, the Imperium? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So, in addition to this research mission, I feel like it would be very beneficial to figure who that faction-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- of good guys-- 
LAURA: Rebel alliance. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's who we need to find. 
ASHLEY: But the thing is-- 
SAM: That's definitely something we should find. 
ASHLEY: My stomach is making so many noises. Sorry. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What if-- Okay, just hear me out. I'm just going to try to circle the square here. What if you're supposed to wake up the good guys type of a thing? I know you're a messiah situation, whatever you want to call it. But maybe your mom wanted you to run because of all the other shit going on, and maybe because you are supposed to wake something up. I don't know. I feel like the Reiloran-- 
LAURA: That's interesting. 
ASHLEY: Reilorans are not-- I feel like we should help them. I mean, this is their home. 
MARISHA: Well, and you said you saw Fearne in this group. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm not a bad guy. 
LAURA: To that point-- 
SAM: Are you? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: No. 
TALIESIN: Well, I mean-- 
LAURA: Did I get a sense, when I was there, her location? Could I sense that she was next to me? 
MATT: You could sense that she was very close, and the network of people that you saw, there were very bright ones. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: You were a very bright one. Your mother was a very bright one. 
LAURA: There's more people. 
MATT: You saw maybe two dozen ones of around that equal level of brightness with some varying, and there were dozens more that were fainter, like Fearne. All Ruidusborn, but you could make out that there were Exaltants like you, the true final evolution of what the Ruidusborn was intended to eventually be and those that are part of that network, supporting that network. You also got a sense that you could see loosely where they were, the direction where they were from you. Now that you think of where you are and where you were sitting, you also have a pretty strong idea-- 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Of the city. 
MATT: -- of where that network seemed to gather. 
SAM: Is it the direction we've been going in? 
MATT: It's loosely in that direction, but you have a much clearer pinpoint now. 
MARISHA: Stronger. 
SAM: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Question. Oh, sorry. 
ASHLEY: No, no, go. 
MARISHA: Has Imogen, above table, has Imogen always been Exalted, or when Otohan-- 
TRAVIS: Nuked her. 
MARISHA: -- forced her, did she then become Exalted? 
SAM: Above table, how does the campaign end? (laughter) 
MATT: The best that you can ascertain is that, and from what was read in some of the Grim Verity's research notes is that Exaltants are just naturally the most powerful version of a Ruidusborn, but usually through either a really traumatic event or some sort of outside stimuli causes them to exalt into their realized self. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So you get the sense that she's probably always been an Exaltant, but it took that moment to unlock her. 
TRAVIS: A walking vestige. 
MARISHA: So theoretically, Fearne could be an Exaltant, but just hasn't reached that level yet? 
TRAVIS: In waiting. 
MARISHA: In waiting? 
ASHLEY: I think it's different because I was made by design as opposed to natural, right? 
MATT: Best that you can tell, Exaltants have always been Exaltants. 
SAM: Naturals. Always the best. 
MATT: They just didn't know the full potential of their power. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: There are many more Ruidusborn that are just faintly Ruidusborn and kind of affected by those energies. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: But are the long historical predecessors of this thousands year long process of Ruidus, of Predathos, getting to whatever its end is. 
TRAVIS: Our orders are clear. Beat the shit out of Fearne until she levels up. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
ASHLEY: Nothing's happening! Ow! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Another above table. Did we ever learn about (laughs) is Otohan Ruidusborn? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Otohan-- 
LIAM: Oh yeah. 
MATT: -- is also Exaltant. 
LAURA: Yeah, she's an Exaltant. 
ASHLEY: Oh, she's an Exaltant. That's right, that's right. 
SAM: And so is Ludinus. 
LAURA: Way more powerful-- 
ASHLEY: Ludinus is not. 
LAURA: -- Exaltant than me. 
MATT: Ludinus, you don't know. 
SAM: Oh, right. 
LIAM: Liliana is, though. 
LAURA: Yeah, Liliana is a, yeah, Exaltant. 
TALIESIN: So-- 
MATT: Though, in all of your networking, you haven't seen anything regarding-- 
LAURA: Makes it sound like we're going to mixers and-- 
MATT: I know. We're all just hanging out. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: You've never been able to recognize any signature or tether towards Ludinus. 
SAM: Hmm. 
MATT: Which means either he doesn't or he's hidden it somehow. 
LAURA: Or it's hidden. 
MATT: You don't know. 
LIAM: Guess he's Tricky Dick. 
TRAVIS: Or he's not a person. 
SAM: Should we press on? Don't we still have a few hours of cloudiness? 
LIAM: Many hours. 
TRAVIS: Storm's still wrecking outside, though. 
LIAM: Short rest is an hour, and all this conversation is happening toward the back end of our hour. 
TRAVIS: Storm's still doing its thing. 
SAM: But can't we press through? We got to-- 
TRAVIS: We could, but we'd risk being dispersed. 
LAURA: Yeah, so this is-- 
SAM: When you got a direction, did you get a distance? 
MATT: Not really, because it was-- Imagine a pinpoint lattice. 
TRAVIS: Cluster of fireflies. 
MATT: Yeah, a cluster of fireflies is a good way to put it, in the middle of a shadowed space. So you have a direction, but you have no idea of the scope or scale of what you were looking at. 
LIAM: There's no map key. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm kind of glad you waited. I'm glad you waited because I feel like we need more research. We need more stuff to know because we also don't know if you do give yourself over-- Because I feel like some of the other Ruidusborn that we've seen, they don't have-- Do they have the markings that Imogen does? We don't know. 
LAURA: I mean, I haven't seen-- 
ASHLEY: I mean, I don't. 
MATT: The only other Exaltant that you've really encountered aside from your mother is Otohan. 
LAURA: Is Otohan. 
MATT: She has been armored-- 
LAURA: Covered up. 
MATT: -- from pretty much neck down. 
LIAM: Thank you for doing what you did. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: I feel like the thing that makes you such a risk is also our greatest strength right now. It makes you kind of like one of Letters' coin flips. 
SAM: They always are right, though. 
LAURA: That's right. 
TALIESIN: It only takes one wrong one, to be fair. 
SAM: Hmm, that's true. 
LAURA: Do we take the extra time, go to the city, try to see more or do we head back and let them know what we found so far? 
TALIESIN: We are not ready to head back. We need so much more. 
LIAM: We don't know anything about the Reilorans. 
MARISHA: We should go to the city. 
SAM: It would be great if we could find some glimpse of the Imperium. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Also, to find out the layout of this place. 
LAURA: Yeah, so? 
MARISHA: We can let the Imperium know that they've got allies on Exandria? 
TRAVIS: Then you give in. 
ASHLEY: Wait, did you say-- 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: -- the Imperium is what the Reilorans call the Ruby Vanguard? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Well, the Imperium-- 
LAURA: That's what I heard. Sorry. 
SAM: They're the good Reilorans, right? 
MARISHA: Who are the goodies and who are the baddies? 
TRAVIS: The Imperium are the Reiloran that work with the Ruby Vanguard. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: The Imperium is the faction that is aligned with the Ruby Vanguard. 
SAM: Oh, so they're bad. 
LAURA: Yeah, those are the baddies. 
SAM: Oh, why did I write down good Reilorans? 
TRAVIS: Because you didn't read Dani's notes-- 
LIAM: I don't know, they have a fancy name. 
TRAVIS: -- like I did. 
LAURA: Maybe you wrote down Imperium and also good Reilorans. 
SAM: Nope. Now I wrote equals. 
TRAVIS: Not to be confused with Sand Imperium. 
MATT: Yep. 
LAURA: Baddies. 
SAM: Are there good Reilorans? 
LAURA: Yeah, there are. 
SAM: But we don't know what their name is. 
TRAVIS: There are? 
LAURA: No, but the one that I called-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: -- before we left was saying that they were not part of the Imperium. 
MATT: Yeah, you've encountered Reilorans that stated they didn't have an affiliation with the Imperium. 
SAM: Mm. 
MARISHA: They looked and them and they were like: Ew, icky. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. Ooh, I don't like them. 
MARISHA: I don't like them. 
LIAM: What we know is we don't know much. 
TALIESIN: And we need to know more. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: ♪ I don't know much ♪ 
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and LAURA: ♪ (humming) ♪ 
TALIESIN: Before we head out, do we want to do a quick, well-- 
LAURA and TRAVIS: ♪ (continue goofy singing) ♪ 
SAM: Quick what? 
TALIESIN: We got to figure out how we're going to cloud out of this and-- 
MATT: Almost as rapid as it swarmed in-- 
SAM: Oh, look at that. 
MATT: The wind begins to fade. 
LAURA: Hey! 
MATT: And light begins to return to the outside of the cave entrance. 
LIAM: Oh. 
MATT: These storms can be devastating and fast, but they can also leave just as quickly as they arrived. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: On foot, here we go. 
LAURA: Instantly, let's go. 
MARISHA: Wait, real quick. Wait, wait, wait. 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: I take Pâté, who I spent the time to summon again. 
MATT: "Wait, where are we?" 
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sakes. 
MARISHA: Ooh, oh my god, that's right! You totally died right before we got to the moon. We're on the moon! 
MATT: "That's so freaking cool!" 
MARISHA: I know! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "So what's the plan?" 
MARISHA: Okay, well, we're on a sneaky sneak mission. 
MATT: "Oh, I'm good at those." 
MARISHA: You get, well-- (hums doubtfully) You got to be quiet, all right? In fact, so we're going to turn into clouds, and you can't turn into clouds, but we can fly so fast when we're clouds so-- 
MATT: "Well, I've never tried." 
MARISHA: Nope. Hmm, you can't. I'm not trying to shoot you down. I believe in you. You can do anything you want, you just can't turn into clouds. 
TRAVIS: Mixed signals. Mixed signals. 
MARISHA: But you get to take a little ride in the bag of holding! 
MATT: "Ooh, what's that?" 
MARISHA: So I actually have a little mission for you. You have a-- 
MATT: "Ooh, I like missions!" 
MARISHA: You have your little mini-mission. 
MATT: "Okay." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: All right, you ready? 
TRAVIS: Oh, this is smart. 
MARISHA: I'm going to put you in the bag of holding. 
MATT: "All right, what's that?" 
MARISHA: It's like a little pocket void where there's no air, but it's okay because you don't breathe. 
MATT: "Okay, that sounds fun!" 
MARISHA: But here's the fun part. 
MATT: "Yeah?" 
MARISHA: We stuffed a giant behemoth of a Reiloran in there. 
MATT: "Whoa!" 
MARISHA: So I need you to go in, look around, see if you can find them. Tell me if they're alive or dead or if they've exploded from extreme pressure or something like that. 
MATT: "What?" 
MARISHA: And then-- 
MATT: "Okay." 
MARISHA: I'm going to pull you back out. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MARISHA: And you're going to tell me what you saw. 
MATT: "Sure!" 
MARISHA: Okay, ready? 
MATT: "Yeah!" 
MARISHA: Thunk-unk! 
ASHLEY: Auntie Fearne's bag. Hop in. 
MATT: "Ready!" (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Got shoved in something else and then in the bag. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm digging a little hole in the back right now. 
MATT: "(Pâté groans)" 
MARISHA: What did you see? 
MATT: "It's just very dark in there. It's nothing but just darkness." 
MARISHA: You didn't see anybody else or anything else? 
MATT: "No, I just did a little loop in this space and there was nothing there." 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: I guess they're in their own little compartments. 
ASHLEY: That's a good idea. 
TRAVIS: I think it's just huge. 
MARISHA: It's just that huge? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- a better idea. 
LAURA: I thought about it here, I really did. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
SAM: What's going on over there? 
TALIESIN: All right. As long as you're-- 
MATT: So the nature of the bag of holding. 
MARISHA: You'll be in there for longer. Oh, yes. 
MATT: As you put the two and two together. 
TALIESIN: I trust you. 
MATT: It's like a void space. 
MATT: So you put the item in there and then just vanishes in this void space. There is a limit to it, but they exist in this void space, and then when you think about it, as you reach in, they-- 
MARISHA: It manifests. 
MATT: It manifests in your hand. 
SAM: I think we should pull out the big guy. What are you talking about? 
TALIESIN: We're making plans. 
TRAVIS: Just talking and talking and talking and talking. 
SAM: Do it on your own time. 
TALIESIN: This is our own time. 
MARISHA: Down here is our time. 
SAM: Should we just pull them out? 
MARISHA: The Reiloran. 
TALIESIN: I'm having a bad idea. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's fuck them up right here if he's alive. 
SAM: Just leave them here, turn into clouds. 
MARISHA: I agree, we reach in and we pull out the fatty. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
LAURA: The juggernaut. 
MATT: You reach in, you pull, you grab in and you can feel the arm, the heavy wrist, this thick, trunk-like wrist of the juggernaut, and as you tug, I mean, even getting him in there was like stretching the limits of what the bag can do and it was a group effort to like-- Well, actually, get him in there. You put him in there as a possum. 
SAM: He was a possum, yeah. 
MATT: Getting him out is a whole different scenario. 
TRAVIS: Come on, bitch. 
MATT: As you tug on him and he gets one arm and a shoulder out and it's-- 
SAM: Dead. 
MATT: It's definitely dead. The hand is limp, but it's not coming out. 
TRAVIS: You know what? 
ASHLEY: Just leave it. 
TRAVIS: There's a way around this. 
SAM: (saw buzzing) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Go to town, FCG! 
SAM: (yelling) 
TRAVIS: (yelling) Oh! It's in my eyes! 
MARISHA: (excited giggling) 
MATT: Like a "Cavern" horror film. 
TRAVIS: "Rocky Horror." Not "Rocky Horror," I was going to say "Little Shop." 
MARISHA: "Little Shop." 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: This is the Sam Raimi moment of this current session. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: Blood splatter on the wall side. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: Buzz saw sounds and cutting. Laudna in the corner grinning like a child on Saturday morning. 
LIAM: "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" Violence, violence! 
MATT: Yep, but you have now a Reilora juggernaut in pieces. 
MARISHA: Can you chop off his-- 
MATT: Individual arms, legs, head. 
MARISHA: -- index finger for me? 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: We should actually put these back because, to Fearne's point, we could need bait, we could need a distraction. You never know when you'll need a thigh. 
SAM: All of it? 
TRAVIS: Sure you do. 
SAM: Maybe just a couple pieces. 
TRAVIS: Want to leave something behind? 
SAM: Yeah, for the whatever lives here. 
TRAVIS: Oh, like a little tip, that's fair. 
TALIESIN: Is this an insane place to try and plant something? Is it like-- 
MATT: You tell me. 
TALIESIN: I've been trying to tap with my hammer and see if I can-- 
TRAVIS: Is there soil? 
TALIESIN: Soil down like-- 
MATT: Oh, to plant. 
TALIESIN: Plant something. 
MATT: What are you trying to plant? 
LAURA: Well-- 
MATT and MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: Oh wait, do we have a thing? 
TALIESIN: We owe a debt. 
SAM: Are we supposed to plant? (gasps) On the moon, we talked-- Oh, what, it's a seed. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, from the All-Minds-Burn, we owe a debt and-- 
MATT: I mean, it's up to you. Think: What does a fungus need to survive? 
LAURA: See, that's what I was saying. I think we should do it deeper. I think we should do it under because remember, it was low. It was deep underground when we found it. 
TALIESIN: That's very fair. 
LAURA: I think we need to plant it deeper. I-I-I want to do it. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I was just triple checking. 
LAURA: Deeper. 
TALIESIN: Want to do it deeper? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: The juggernaut is-- It has its helmet part on the top, its head just off to the side. 
ASHLEY: Are we keeping it in the bag? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We're going to put some of it-- 
TRAVIS: We're leaving a tip for the cave, though. 
MARISHA: We'll leave his torso and we'll put some of his limbs back in there. Limbs are easier to get out. 
TALIESIN: He didn't have anything interesting on him, did he? 
MATT: He had his bone cestus, which are these giant nasty-looking knuckle weapons that are across his fingers that are made from some sort of extremely dense bone that have these barred hooks. Like it's been either carved to make them or maybe they were naturally formed in whatever they took them from, but those are grips on the hand. 
SAM: (high-pitched sneeze) 
MARISHA: Bless you. 
MATT: That was adorable! 
TALIESIN and LAURA: That was really cute. 
TALIESIN: Well, shit, let's keep those, man. Fuck. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll take those. 
MATT: There are bits of shoulder armor and spikes, all manner of battle attire and adornment on it. 
TRAVIS: I'll take one of the shoulder spikes as a pauldron for dressing to let people know not to fuck with us. 
SAM: I'll take the other one. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: All right, there you go. 
SAM: Like father, like son. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I was just curious. 
TRAVIS: My three sons. 
TALIESIN: All right, yeah, I'm good then. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Shit, I forgot what I was going to say. It doesn't matter. (laughter) 
LIAM: I love that's a character. 
TRAVIS: Can we take the little claw weapons and get a description for them later? 
MATT: Yeah, yeah, you can totally take those. 
TRAVIS: Great. 
SAM: Onward. 
MARISHA: All right. Shoving Pâté back in the bag. 
MATT: Okay, Pâté's back in the bag. 
LIAM: (Pâté grunt) 
TRAVIS: No coins or potions or anything like that, right? Just the weapons, okay, great. Let's do it. 
SAM: Quickly, apple fritter. Apple fritter. 
ASHLEY: Thank you! 
SAM: Apple fritter. 
LAURA: Oh, thank you. 
SAM: Apple fritter. 
LAURA: What does it give us again? 
SAM: Four temporary hit points. 
LAURA: Yay! 
LIAM: On top of the max that we have? 
SAM: Yes, those are different. Those are-- 
LAURA: Ooh! 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Wait, just a flat four? 
SAM: Four temporary. 
TALIESIN: Everybody, everybody. 
SAM: If you, no, not you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fine. 
SAM: Or Travis. 
TALIESIN: That's fine. 
TRAVIS: Who's Travis? 
SAM: You're beefy. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
TRAVIS: Sounds fucking awesome. 
MARISHA: That's nice. 
TALIESIN: This fucker has more hit points than I do now, but I'm good that because I can-- 
MATT: Which parts of the juggernaut are you keeping? 
SAM: Limbs and asshole. No, limbs and head. 
MATT: Limbs and head, okay. 
SAM: Limbs and head. 
MATT: All right, so you put the limbs in the head back in the bag with Pâté, leaving the torso behind. 
SAM: Looks like a hot dog. Lips and asshole. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh, really don't. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: You gather your materials and concentrate for a moment before you all (fluttering) dart back off into the atmosphere beyond this cavern and back up into the eye-- the eye-- the sky above, coasting up the side of this mountain peak and over in the direction that you recall from your vision. You continue on for the next hour or so in that direction enjoying this breaking up of the dust storms that put you there, but you can still see the tumultuous landscape pushing around you as well as the closing of sunlight upon the surface of this part of Ruidus. 
LAURA: (high-pitched sneeze) 
MARISHA: Bless you. 
TRAVIS: Really? 
MATT: You sense the coming of night. 
TRAVIS: Another sick day coming. 
MATT: Apparently. But you begin to come towards a secondary mountain range that pushes just beneath the direction you're going. This long, thin ridge that winds on each side and you can see forks off in different directions, like a weird bone shape where the edges of it splinter off on the edges. You could see three different patterns of chasms that break around the base and one that cuts straight through and divides it in the center where it looks like the mountain range tumbled in. There's a gap of about a quarter mile or so that just falls in the darkness. You also, as you continue along, you can make out a couple more of these small herds. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: That are curling up the side of the mountain range to the right-hand side. You follow the sight of where they're going, and the next thing you see are a handful of flickering bits of light. 
LIAM: Going down. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: As you get a little bit closer, you see a village folded in part of this dual rising spires and part of this mountain range nestled in the center of it from what looks like, can only describe it as a moon ranch with paddocks, little abodes that are built into the sides of that crevice and you can see probably 60 to 70 more of these beasts all nestled in there. It's unique to have grown up where you had to see similar arrangements of the local livestock and you see figures moving and tending to it below. Beyond that, you can see the storms still approaching, though quite a distance off, but you know there'll be more dust to come. What would you like to do? 
TALIESIN: I want to seek shelter and meet some locals, personally. 
LIAM: This is what we're here to do. 
TALIESIN: This is the perfect place. 
LAURA: We should land a little bit outside of it, though, and-- 
LIAM: Walk up. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Remove our-- 
MARISHA: Question, though. Maybe it's best to do little wispy fly by. 
LAURA: I know, I want to get close and see if they look like they're dressed like the Imperium, or like the Reilorans that I've called. 
MARISHA: Because if we come trotting through as the Ruby Vanguard and they're not welcome here, that might not be good. 
SAM: Smart. 
MATT: Okay. You coast down closer and do a slow distant buzz of the top of this village and it's-- 
MARISHA: Do you have Seeming? 
SAM: No. 
MATT: You gather the population here probably couldn't be more than 1,000 people tops scattered amongst all these different homes. It reminds you of a smaller Zephrah in some ways because it is high in the mountains and nestled in, but the first thing you notice is everything here is very simple. The homes and abodes are smoothed rock or made of thatch and mud that have dried over and it gives this natural popcorn vibe amongst the different clusters of homesteads between the open portions of paddocks and holding areas for the various livestock. You can see some of that red brush and odd plant life has been cultivated in clusters here and within some of the shaded sections of the broken rock where portions of the mountain have actually been damaged and carved away to make room to plant this sustainable pattern to maintain the livestock. You also see amongst the populace in a quick glance overhead, there are, I'd say only about maybe 20% of the population appears to be Reiloran. The majority of the rest of the people here are a much shorter and squatter folk. Just at a quick pass by, there's a people here you've never seen before. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Most of them are heavily swathed in hooded shawls and tattered bits of robes made of a heavy material that when it billows, it billows like starched canvas, so when the gusts hit it, it cracks as it moves behind it and when they're moving out of the wind, it doesn't billow with them, so it's like statues moving through. Occasionally, you catch the sight of a hand, and its thick, meaty grasps that grab reins, and you begin to recall the vision you had in that cavern as being very familiar in size and form. Too far away to get much more detail beyond that, especially with the night coming to the moon Ruidus. 
LAURA: But we don't see any of the armor, like the Imperium that we've seen. 
MATT: Oh, you do see people wearing similar designs. You do not see any Vanguard. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But you do indeed see Reiloran wearing similar armor, though less battle-ready front lines. You do see a handful of juggernauts as well as just standard Reilorans, but they're half-armored and more just present and it doesn't take long to realize that they're definitely... keeping watch. They are-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: -- managing this space. They are ordering these people and there is a general air of tension in certain arenas. 
SAM: Then maybe we shouldn't walk up. We should get in there, find a shed or something to spend a minute. We don't want to walk up and get confronted by the baddies, right? 
LAURA: Said like 20%, that's like 200 Reilorans. 
MATT: 20% are Reiloran. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean, like 20, yeah, like 200 Reilorans. 
SAM: But if we could get in past them and talk to the people, the real people, we might be able to get a read on what's going on. 
LIAM: Maybe we could hover out and find a spot that is thin on Reiloran and heavy on these others. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: On the hiding spot. 
MARISHA: Tensions, do we see any percentage of the population that looks human or fey or anything like that? 
MATT: You're kind of high up, do you want to coast closer? 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: We're clouds, right? 
LIAM: We're farts. 
MATT: I mean, you are clouds, but you're not invisible. You are still a cluster of mist balls that go-- (swirling) 
LAURA: Yeah, we're noticeable. 
LIAM: Is it possible to act casual? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I mean, if we get right down to the ground, could we look like a dirt devil? 
SAM: This is how clouds move. 
MATT: You could certainly try. 
TALIESIN: Let me know, I'm going to try really quick to speed around on the ground and look like, you know, you've seen those little weird dust cyclones. 
LAURA and SAM: Dust devil. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, dust devil. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Just before we even go in, I'm just like, grade my performance. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: Let's see it. 
LIAM: You're just moshing as a cloud. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Make a-- 
TALIESIN: Nice little mosh circle. 
MATT: Make a performance check for me. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yes. 
LIAM: Definitely. 
TALIESIN: This is going to go real poorly. Yep, no, two. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You watch this wisp of cloud separate from the group and then rush down and hits the ground and goes-- (two whooshes) 
TALIESIN: Yep, no. 
MATT: (staccato whooshes) 
MATT: It overtly looks like it's trying to draw attention. 
TALIESIN: Shit, okay. 
MATT: You see it as six of the locals still hoods up, look back towards it and confused and start whispering to each other a bit-- 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: -- pointing over to this weird, errant little mist pocket that's shifting around all on the ground. 
SAM: Just kind of Jonah Hill it. 
TALIESIN: I was hoping to do this further away from an actual audience, but okay. 
MATT: I understand. 
TALIESIN: Yep. No, that's, everyone's a critic. 
MATT: It's not super close to them, but they still think-- 
TALIESIN: It's that bad. 
MATT: On a two, they pick it up. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's real bad. 
LIAM: Who's seeing it, shorter folk, Reiloran or both? 
MATT: Shorter folk. 
LIAM: Shorter folk. 
SAM: Are there any structures around here, barns? 
MATT: There are a number of structures and you can see some that resemble barns. I mean, best you can. There's no standard barns here. Everything has a domed feel to it because a lot of the material that it's built from is from the surrounding rock and/or other materials that you haven't even gotten close enough to inspect. There's definitely a mud or adobe texture in places. You can see areas of like, it's almost a thatch weave to it, but you haven't seen anything that could create thatch here. As the light continues to fade, color begins to mute and texture begins to blur, so at the distance you're keeping, you're losing detail the longer time goes. 
LAURA: We won't be able to-- We can't take a long rest here, y'all. 
SAM: Why not? These could be allies. 
LAURA: We will lose our-- Yeah, but there's Reiloran here, too, and we'll lose our misty forms. 
SAM: How many more hours do we have of it, though? 
MATT: You have about five hours left. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
SAM: That's a lot. 
LAURA: We can't take a long rest. 
SAM: We got to talk to these people, find out what's going on. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's fine, but-- 
TRAVIS: We also don't have to do it in a group. 
LAURA: We'll be traveling in the night. 
LIAM: -- we can't take eight hours, we'll lose our fast travel. 
LAURA: We got to talk and get out and keep going towards the city. 
SAM: Well who wants to talk to them? 
TRAVIS: One person go in-- 
TALIESIN: Let's find a bar, maybe. 
TRAVIS: -- ask questions, get out. 
SAM: Two people. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, if we are sneaky and go window to window, do you think we can find some sort of public house, something like that? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Yeah, you want to scout around for-- 
LAURA: Somewhere where there's not Reilorans poking in and it's just the locals. 
SAM: -- a tavern? 
TALIESIN: Something private. 
MATT: You watch as it's getting darker, and as you're having this conversation and planning amongst yourself, taking in the scenery and as the shadow of night begins to creep across the ruddied landscape of Ruidus. The interior of these abodes begin to brighten up this faint bluish-green color, some of them almost a purple tint. You can see that most of these beasts are brought into their respective paddocks and the locks and doors closed upon them. You can see many of them bundle up together and form these masses of fur and horn and bundle down so they can sleep through the storms and be unbothered. There isn't an air or tension of oppressive violence or anything in the city, but there's definitely, people are working under watch. 
TRAVIS: From where we are, can we see any signs of horticulture or mining, or is it literally the management of livestock on land? 
MATT: From what you can tell here, make a perception check for me. 
TRAVIS: I only should've rolled one of those. 17. 
MATT: 17, not too bad. You don't see any signs of an open mine or a mining enterprise here at all. The largest things and the easiest to see are the livestock management here. But there are clusters of these villages where you can assume there's probably other crafts involved or maybe less overt and land-intensive endeavors that are transpiring. 
TRAVIS: No clear rows of crops or mining or-- 
MATT: There's no crops. 
TRAVIS: -- belts? Got it. 
MATT: There's no farmland that you can see. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: What you can see are where they've planted all of this red brush, that you've only seen at a distance, into all these different cracks in the stone. You can see where some of the cracks seem natural, some look like they've been carved deep into it, and in these places of shadow, you can see where that red flora is bursting forth. Occasionally, you can watch as some of these massive bison-like creatures will stumble up and start eating from it. 
MARISHA: Hmm. Well, we should talk to people quickly before they all start going to bed and then we're very creepy. 
SAM: Who wants to do this? 
LIAM: Maybe some of our shorter members. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: I could try. 
SAM: Two shorties. 
LAURA: Oh right. 
SAM: Or unless we have someone who can change their appearance to look like them. 
ASHLEY: I can disguise myself. 
SAM: You can? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: The only thing is, is that they might not speak Common. So I can speak to them telepathically and they can understand me. 
SAM: I have-- What do I have? 
TRAVIS: Fearne, can you disguise-- 
SAM: I can touch Fearne-- 
ASHLEY: Let me see. 
SAM: -- and give her the ability to understand any spoken language. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: And speak it. 
LAURA: Great. 
MARISHA: When Delilah came back, I got Eyes of the Runekeeper again, so I can read. 
LAURA: Oh, nice. 
MARISHA: That's it. That was it. 
SAM: Yeah, I could, and it's not concentration, so I could do it on two people. I could touch two people and you can talk their language. 
MARISHA: Maybe send in our charisma people? 
SAM: That would be-- 
LAURA: Pretty good charisma. 
SAM: -- Fearne and you? Or Orym? 
LIAM: No, my charisma's not good. 
LAURA: My charisma's-- That's what my spell is based in. 
LIAM: She's max. 
TRAVIS: I'm just the smartest person in this group, that's all. 
MARISHA: I'm also max. 
LAURA: My persuasion is-- 
SAM: You're max? 
ASHLEY: You're max for your-- 
SAM: Oh, you're max charisma. Yeah, you are! 
MARISHA: Sorcerers. 
LAURA: Yeah, Sorcerers. 
MARISHA: It's our spellcasting thing. 
LAURA: Max charisma. 
SAM: Well damn! 
TRAVIS: Get in there. 
ASHLEY: Should you guys go? 
LIAM: All right, ladies. 
MARISHA: We can do it. 
SAM: But you can't look like them, but usually it doesn't matter if you've got high enough charisma, you can still-- 
LIAM: None of us look like them. 
SAM: Yeah, you guys go. 
MARISHA: Do you want to go? 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: ("intimidating") Do you want to go? Do you want to go? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Maybe we can find some children. 
LAURA: (doubtful) Mm. 
SAM: I don't like the way you said that. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (mumbled justification) All right, all right. 
TALIESIN: I was with you. 
LAURA: They're innocent. 
MARISHA: They're innocent and they're brutally honest and they tend to not have machinations or a motive to hide things. 
TRAVIS: Plus, dressed this way, they'll listen to you if you ask them to come over, right? 
MARISHA: We should maybe change. 
TRAVIS: The Ruby Vanguard seem to be in charge around here. 
LAURA: Well. 
MARISHA: I don't know if, well-- 
LAURA: It could just be Reilorans-- 
ASHLEY: Is there anything we can do to buff you guys up? 
LAURA: -- are not nice in general, I don't know. 
TRAVIS: Could be. Go find out. 
LIAM: What did you say the features were of these? 
LAURA: We couldn't see them. 
LIAM: We're too far away. 
TRAVIS: He said meaty hands. 
MATT: You're too far away. You can see that they seem to be bipedal humanoid, but they're definitely squat, and as they move, you can see when their hands reach out and grab, their fingers are that thick and it's very, these massive extremities proportionally to what are shorter, thicker-- More exaggerated than dwarves to a certain extent. There seems to be a hunch and a hulkingness to them, but you have no real proportional size beyond the few Reilorans that pass by and you gather they're probably no more than four feet tall. They're just bulky. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm willing to put, I guess good money, whatever that means here, that most Reilorans are fucking fine. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We have only met ones at military and battle posts, and if I only met people from military and battle posts, I'd think everyone was a piece of shit, which I kind of do, but still. 
SAM: Can we find a spot outside of the visual range to transform? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Like a barn. 
SAM: Yeah, shed, something. 
TALIESIN: Esque. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's what we were looking for. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: You find some sort of a storage shed-like dome that sits on the outskirts of the nearest side of this village. 
SAM: Skrrt. 
LAURA: (chuckles) 
MATT: You shift over to that space and you can see this one fenced-in area, there's one figure that's currently in the process of carrying a large satchel that is filled with those red leafy bush, harvested clusters inside, as well as another odd looking, like a faint aqua or turquoise-colored material, you don't know what it is. You watch as they're reaching and putting them out into a round trough. 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: There's currently, there's no other creatures in this area, it's like they're preparing for something. You can just see them from the back, their hood up. But the storage shed that they came from, the door's ajar and it looks like it's maybe about 15 by 20 feet, an ovoid shape a little bit, for the strongest dome structure. 
LAURA: Yeah, can we-- 
SAM: Do we go in there? 
LAURA: Especially if it's getting dark, we can-- 
MATT: It's getting dark, it's easy enough. You all filter inside. 
ASHLEY: Sun's getting really low. 
TRAVIS: Do some of us want to stay in wispy form and be over watch? 
MARISHA: I think so, I think so. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: In case you get a visitor. 
LAURA: Smart. 
SAM: I'll have to change to cast this on you. So I'll start the process of changing back. 
TALIESIN: Do we want some emergency muscle? I'll wait behind, but-- 
SAM: Sure, just to stay in here, just in case. 
LIAM: That makes sense. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Since it's going to take 10 minutes for everyone to change over. 
MARISHA: So, wispy, wispy, wispy. Going in. 
LAURA: It should only take two minutes. 
LIAM: We can talk in our minds even from cloud to-- 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah? Cool. 
MATT: So who's staying in-- 
LIAM: I'm clouding it for perception. 
TRAVIS: Clouds, hands up. 
MATT: Okay, so that's three of you are staying up there and the rest of you are going down. Okay. 
MARISHA: I don't know if the Ruby Vanguard cloaks are the right approach. I'm wondering if we should-- 
LAURA: I think we should take them off when we-- 
MARISHA: Talk to them. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: You're going-- 
TALIESIN: Good for walking around. 
SAM: I have to be-- 
TALIESIN: Take if off when we talk to somebody. 
SAM: I have to cast spells on them. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go down with FCG. 
SAM: Great, come on down. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So that's five of you down, two of you in the air. 
SAM: Great. 
TALIESIN: That works, too. 
MATT: Okay. The five of you (wispy floating) just down into the ajar entryway to this storage chamber. As you pull in the dark space inside, there is no light source in here. You get the sense that the entity that was using it probably brought along some sort of light source or doesn't need it, you're uncertain. But you come inside. You have darkvision, so you can make up the interior here. It is shelves and bundles of supplies. It's a storage room. You can see there's lines of tools, some for harvesting, some for training and domestication of beings. A lot of harnesses. You can also see a lot of empty containers and satchels that are hung up on the side. All sort of yard and farm work type materials, but familiar in the sense that they're all completely unfamiliar until you begin to see them in context. You're like: Okay, this is a tool shed, this is a storage shed. But yeah, it's pretty full, so it's not a wide empty space. You're all cramped if you were to revert, but you can do it. 
MARISHA: All right, we do it. 
MATT: All right. You all begin to transform back, your bodies coming to form. About 30 seconds into that transformation, the two of you notice the figure finishes up and starts walking back towards the storage shed. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: Incoming. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
LAURA: Oh shit, we're going to just pop up right? 
MATT: Comes around the corner, you hear this dull whistle. "(absent-minded whistling)" Steps inside and they pull this little necklace up from their neck and flick it twice with their giant meaty hand, and you hear the (tinging) as it does. (soft illuminating) 
TRAVIS: Sweet. 
MATT: It glows this faint, blue glow. All of you, mostly apparated, stand there in the middle of the space-- 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: -- as the creature looks up towards you. 
LAURA: Don't scream. Please don't scream. 
MARISHA: Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
LAURA: In his head he hears it, just in case he can't understand what we're saying. 
MATT: Now, as you look at the face lit up, you can see the hood pulled back a little bit. This extremely rotund, almost cherub-like face with mostly black eyes, just the very edges of it you can see whites that are available with wrinkles underneath here and smile marks. Just a flesh nub where the nose would be with slits, and this deeply-set mouth that is open and agape, and the rest of it, the cloak is covered around it as it holds the thing. "(fearful sputtering)" 
LAURA: No, no. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Can I assist her? Can I aid in that by throwing up my hands and telling them hush? 
LAURA: Or would that give me disadvantage? 
MATT: No, no, that's what I'm thinking. Because it's Laudna. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: But neither of you look like them. 
MATT: I'll allow it, I'll allow it. 
LAURA: Yeah, we don't look like them, they don't know that she's scary. 
LIAM: Yeah, you're aliens to each other. 
LAURA: We're both scary. 
MATT: That's true, you're both scary, so yeah, it won't make a difference. 
MARISHA: Fearne is there too, right? 
TALIESIN: And I'm there. 
LAURA: Natural 20! 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
LAURA: For a total of-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, we're all in there. 
LAURA: -- 33. 
TALIESIN: Whoa. 
MATT: He goes, "(quick gasps) What? Who? Who are you?" 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: He speaks in Common. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: Just saved me two spell slots. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: And that's where we're going to end tonight's episode. (uproar) 
ASHLEY: No! 
SAM: We want to talk to him! 
MATT: I know, and we'll start the next episode with this conversation. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: I envision this almost like a weird muscular pod person from Dark Crystal. That kind of face vibe a little bit. 
LAURA: Oh, so cute! 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Human skin tone or a certain color? 
MATT: The blue is-- 
TRAVIS: Blue, got it. 
MATT: -- making it change, everything here is lit blue around his necklace, so you can't really tell in this dark light. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. Cool. 
MATT: But yeah. 
TRAVIS: Whoa, we got a new type of person! 
MARISHA: Oh boy! 
TALIESIN: Knew it! 
LIAM: We're on the fucking moon. 
SAM: Cool, cool, cool. 
ASHLEY: We're on the moon! 
MATT: Ruidus has been around for a while and it has its own ecosystems. 
TRAVIS: Oh man, I'm stoked. 
SAM: A moon man. 
MATT: This is only the surface. 
TRAVIS: I'm stoked. 
TALIESIN: Stop it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: (excited groan) 
MATT: I've been waiting for this for so long! 
TRAVIS: Good shit, Matt. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: This is the game. 
LAURA: This is really fun. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is a good game. 
LIAM: Fun game. 
MATT: Well, we'll pick this up next episode. Thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)

Cooldown[]
TRAVIS: So we can't see skin tone.
TALIESIN: My money's on grey.
TRAVIS: Thick hands.
ASHLEY: Your money's on grey, that it's--
MATT: Yeah, and you can see now the hands are four fingers and a thumb.
TRAVIS: Four fingers and a thumb.
MATT: Four fingers and a thumb.
TALIESIN: I'm thinking also of the masks from Brazil.
MARISHA: Are they webbed?
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Baby masks.
MARISHA: No. (laughs)
ASHLEY: Yes!
SAM: Is it a fungal-type creature?
TRAVIS: No idea.
MATT: You don't know.
TRAVIS: No idea.
MATT: You just saw it.
LIAM: Well, I've been thinking about this whole game.
TALIESIN: Is his name Phil?
LIAM: There wasn't really a time to bring it up.
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah. I always wanted to meet a Phil.
LIAM: This planet, this moon, was made to imprison the god-eater.
TRAVIS: Uh huh.
LIAM: Where did all these beings come from?
LAURA: Or was it already here?
ASHLEY: How do we know that that's what it is?
MARISHA: No, no, no.
LIAM: We don't, but going by mythology.
MARISHA: Wait, wait, we do know. We do know a little bit. They said they took a chunk of Exandria.
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: Oh, that's right.
TRAVIS: Ripped it.
MARISHA: Ripped it with him to...
LIAM: Threw it in the sky.
SAM: So this could be Exandrian-type--
LIAM: Oh, right, right, right.
TRAVIS: Ancient Exandrian.
LAURA: Ancient Exandrian.
TALIESIN: Atlantian-esque, yeah.
SAM: --animals and stuff that have their own evolutionary path.
ASHLEY: Evolution.
MATT: (taps nose)
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: It's like Madagascar, how they have their own thing.
LAURA: Guada--
LIAM: Man, what a fucking ride that must've been.
LAURA: What's that island?
TRAVIS: With the tortoises and stuff.
SAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Galapagos.
TRAVIS: Galapagos Islands.
MARISHA: Yes. Where they've just--
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: Nothing like them exists because they've just evolved.
TALIESIN: They had their own shit going on.
SAM: They could have cross-bred and made all sorts of new species and things.
LAURA and ASHLEY: Cool!
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: They've had to evolve to deal with no vegetation, just fungus?
TALIESIN: As far as we know.
LIAM: Dragged some amount of oxygen up with it?
MATT: As far as you know.
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Wait, so we don't know if the Reilorans--
MARISHA: It's got an atmosphere, right?
TALIESIN: I get the distinct impression that this is not a monoculture up here. I think this is just a continent and then we're going to find weird shit.
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Do we know--
TALIESIN: What's the dark side of Ruidus look like?
ASHLEY: --if Reilorans are indigenous to Ruidus?
LIAM: Super flat.
MATT: You have no concept.
ASHLEY: We don't know.
TALIESIN: We don't know shit.
TRAVIS: We've seen Reilorans. We've seen this new--
ASHLEY: I think I've always assumed that--
TRAVIS: --race of creature, and then--
TALIESIN: A buffalo.
TRAVIS: --a buffalo and the dogs-things.
TALIESIN: The little shadow dogs with the-- they had teeth.
MARISHA: They were weird dogs.
TRAVIS: We haven't seen those before, right?
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: We haven't even seen dogs.
LIAM: A massive creature that came out of the--
LAURA: They were at the camp.
MARISHA: They were attacking us.
SAM: They were being ridden.
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: The mounts. Yeah.
LIAM: The thing that came out of the earth went (chomp).
LAURA: Oh, god.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think it was described as something that came up and went like that, right?
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Or did it envelop it like a pseudopod or something?
MATT: You saw a dark shape come up and swallow it.
TRAVIS: Swallow it, okay.
TALIESIN: Like a Super Mario villain.
MATT: You couldn't make out the--
TRAVIS: A jaw or a mouth or arm or--
MATT: No, no. No details about how, you just saw whatever-- You saw it just envelop whatever you were riding.
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck, so that might not even be like a mouth. It could just be like a-- Get the fuck out of here with that thing.
LIAM: So are you making a duplicate?
TALIESIN: It could be a tendril of the thing that sleeps--
LIAM: Are you making a duplicate copy--
TALIESIN: --at the core.
LIAM: --of this extra content?
ASHLEY: But the thing-- the thing that you were saying--
LIAM: This is already going to be seen.
TALIESIN: We're going to get a nosebleed, man.
ASHLEY: --she was feeling it deeper. Does that, like-- in the middle of the fucking--
LAURA: I know, is it in the middle of--
ASHLEY: Is it in the middle?
MARISHA: Wait, what's in the middle?
LAURA: We don't know, or is it a-- 
TALIESIN: Or the heart of it.
ASHLEY: I feel like in the center.
LAURA: It's Predathos in the center of Ruidus.
SAM: Oh, where they were all going down to?
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Is it the core of Ruidus? Or is it like--
ASHLEY: Like maybe the farming is underground or something.
LAURA: Is that just like a mental space?
SAM: Weren't you describing a chasm that goes down?
LAURA: Yeah, like we saw it going deeper and deeper and there were like--
MATT: You dropped--
LAURA: --blue crystals, I remember.
MATT: You had a vision when you gave into the draw of Predathos once. You fell through the layers of Ruidus in this vision.
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Whether or not the vision is truth entirely or just representative, you're uncertain. But you recall falling through the surface, deeper, deeper, and saw caverns and tunnels and structures.
LAURA: That's right. We got to go down.
ASHLEY: I want to go back to that and watch it again.
TALIESIN: I want some warlocks.
LAURA: It's possible that the entrance to those lower caverns are in the city.
LIAM: Land of the Lost.
LAURA: Like maybe that's like--
TALIESIN: Man, I love that show.
MARISHA: Totally.
LAURA: Because we were seeing all the red lights, the energy lights go toward that city, right?
ASHLEY: Entrance is the subways.
LAURA: So maybe that's where the entrance is.
LIAM: Yeah, maybe.
TRAVIS: Now what the fuck does "Wake us" mean?
LAURA: I know, wake--
ASHLEY: I know.
TRAVIS: That was not what I was expecting.
LAURA: Well, I think that Predathos is a fully--
TALIESIN: Hold on, let me tell my iPhone.
LAURA: Sentient. Yeah, I mean, or like fully powered.
ASHLEY: I feel like Predathos--
TALIESIN: That's a plural, though.
LAURA: He's sealed away though.
SAM: He's sealed. So "Wake us" means he has to be unsealed.
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I think it's different.
LAURA: I feel like you got to open the gate.
LIAM: Is it the royal we? Or are all those Ruidusborn getting (sucking sound).
TRAVIS: Yeah, does he have to collect all of his deposits on Exandria?
LAURA: Is he eating them?
ASHLEY: I don't feel like Predathos is--
LIAM: Are they like little materia spheres all throughout?
TALIESIN: I think there's a lot of conjecture here.
SAM: Wait, I'm sorry, wait. You don't think that Predasos is a thing?
ASHLEY: Predasos, no. (laughs)
SAM: I'm sorry, Predathos. You don't think that he exists? It exists?
MARISHA: You're a Predathos denier?
SAM: You're a Predathos denier.
LAURA: What?
ASHLEY: I feel like it's-- I don't know. I'm still trying to figure it out. I feel like it's a cover for something.
SAM: Like it's a "Wizard of Oz" thing?
TALIESIN: Yes! No, I'm with you on that.
SAM: There's a little guy--
TALIESIN: There's a whole bunch of this that's bullshit.
ASHLEY: I feel like there's-- I got to call bullshit.
MARISHA: Wait, oh.
TALIESIN: Oh, no, I think "Wake us" is because a bunch of like-- I think it's to free the power and let the Ruidusborn-- I think it's all them trying to gain their power. I think that we're--
LAURA: "Wake us."
TALIESIN: I think "Wake us" is actually the good guys trying to get their shit together.
MARISHA: The waking us is from the imperials who want to help like release Predathos, or they are the good guys.
LAURA: She's not even like in the picture. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
TRAVIS: Now why would Imogen's mom not want her to be a part of the good guys, though?
TALIESIN: I think her mom is--
LAURA: I don't think they're--
MARISHA: Unless her mom is--
LAURA: I don't think it's good guys. I don't think it's good guys.
TALIESIN: I think her mom is fucking power--
ASHLEY: I don't think mom is with the good guys.
LAURA: No, I think--
TALIESIN: Or she's being evil.
LAURA: No, here's the thing. I firmly believe that mom was a good guy and I think she still wants to be a good guy.
TRAVIS: I firmly believe.
LAURA: I firmly believe. But she can't fight it.
ASHLEY: I'm with you on that. She's not strong enough.
LAURA: Maybe she's got part of herself is still there, but she can't break it.
ASHLEY: Because they need you.
MARISHA: I mean there's still the potential, though. Same with you, that she's trying to fight it from the inside.
LAURA: Sure. Maybe that was the original goal and now it's too late for her.
MARISHA: It's too late for her.
LIAM: Or maybe Luke only pulls Vader back at the last possible second.
LAURA: Right.
TRAVIS: Sam, did you get that reference?
SAM: Yes. It's from Harry Potter.
LIAM: But we've got all this time on the surface left and we're going to be doing cave delving and then the ushy gushy center.
SAM: Remind me, Mercbor.
MATT: Yes?
SAM: Remind me, Mercer, we've never seen the dark side of Ruidus.
TALIESIN: I want to.
SAM: We only see the same face.
LIAM: Because it's held by the leash.
LAURA: It's stuck in place along with Exandria.
SAM: So it could just be--
TRAVIS: The other side is like--
TALIESIN: This could be your flag.
MATT: But then, Exandria's not the light source.
SAM: No, I know that. But there could be an edge that just sort of like-- it could just be a chunk.
ASHLEY: Wait, what did you just say? Exandria's not the light source?
TRAVIS: No.
MATT: Exandria's not a light source. The sun's the light source. One of the weird things about Ruidus is--
LIAM: He's bouncing.
LAURA: So wait, the sun-- Yeah, because I was wondering about this. If we're tethered to Exandria, there's still day and night...
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: It's weird, though, because Exandria's flying away-- we're getting blocked by Exandria.
LAURA: So wouldn't it--
TALIESIN: This is not a real--
LAURA: So the sun goes in a different way.
MARISHA: Well, if they're tidally locked--
LAURA: We still get day and night on Rui--
MARISHA: If they're tidally locked then they're still-- We're not tidally locked to the moon.
LAURA: I was trying to figure--
MARISHA: The moon and--
LAURA: That's it, right?
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's moving with--
MARISHA: It's still moving.
LAURA: But there's still-- but it would be very much like an Alaska situation, though, where some places get a lot of day and--
MATT: Others get more night, yeah.
LAURA: Right?
MATT: There's a lot of interesting things about historical visuals on Ruidus that aren't matching what you're experiencing. It took that lens and the construction of Ira Wendagoth's massive telescope to even--
LAURA: Oh, Ira's there too.
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: That's right.
MATT: --pierce the illusion to see the city that was here. To see the network around it.
LAURA: Oh, they were hiding.
MARISHA: Oh, fuck, Ira's here? I forgot about that.
LAURA: Ira's here!
TALIESIN: Now it's a party.
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ira's like, "I've been chilling and talking with the Aeorians and scheming."
LAURA: Oh, my gosh. Are you going to leave before Ira on the moon?
TALIESIN: He's in the VIP lounge.
SAM: But there's my initial question. 
MARISHA: I mean, he's very handsome.
SAM: There's no confirmation that this is a sphere, either. We've never seen it twirl around.
LAURA: Is he flat earthing?
SAM: No, I'm serious.
TALIESIN: No, I get where you're at. I get where you're at.
SAM: It's a chunk of our planet that was moved up and always faces us the same way. We don't know what's on the back side of it.
TRAVIS: Maybe it could be like half a golf ball.
SAM: We've never seen it, right?
LIAM: Right, it could be a big (blows raspberry).
MARISHA: I love that this is a--
TALIESIN: It could be the-- Asgardian-like big drop.
LIAM: Yeah, there could be like a dangleberry from where it was pulled through exact, though.
TALIESIN: I know it's not.
MARISHA: There's a boy who cried wolf situation, though, where you played into the flat earth bit so hard that now when you're trying to be serious
SAM: No, I really don't know what it is.
MARISHA: We're like, "Shut up!"
TALIESIN: It's also like it phases in and out of reality. I mean, god only know where it goes.
MATT: There's a lot of weird stuff that happens with this moon.
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Beyond just being--
ASHLEY: But I also feel like Catha has a big piece of this that we still haven't even--
SAM: Don't drag Catha into this.
ASHLEY: No, but I mean there's something-- there's more to the puzzle.
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Obviously.
TALIESIN: I agree.
ASHLEY: This is what the game is.
TALIESIN: Catha is definitely another vibe.
ASHLEY: But there's something weird with Catha.
LAURA: I like the nails.
ASHLEY: Because he's also been so silent about Catha.
MATT: I love watching you all spiral. It's my favorite.
LAURA: By the way.
SAM: Are we going to get to talk to a buffalo?
MARISHA: Oh, wait, well, right here.
MATT: You tell me.
SAM: I wrote down, "Buffalo creatures. They have all the answers."
TRAVIS: Yeah, why do they-- Why are they collecting blood buffalo? Why are they cultivating the red vegetation?
SAM: Wait, blood buffalo?
TALIESIN: We just started calling them--
LAURA: Buffalo.
ASHLEY: Yeah, and they're eating the-- I want to find out what that red bushy vegetation is.
TRAVIS: What's the blue stuff?
TALIESIN: How does it taste?
LAURA: Should we eat it?
SAM: It could be fungal, though.
TALIESIN: We should.
ASHLEY: Yeah, we should eat it.
SAM: But it feels like everything here is fungal.
LAURA: You should definitely lick it.
ASHLEY: Of course, eat it.
MATT: You haven't got a close look at it.
LIAM: I want to find one of those big creatures.
SAM: I want to point out that during combat, every single time it got to Marisha, you said, "Marisha, you're up." Marisha said, "Fuck."
LAURA: Yeah, every time. Every time.
MARISHA: Because things kept changing.
SAM: Every time it got to Ashley, it was, "Huh?". 
ASHLEY: Wait, how did you roll a 40?
SAM: And every time it came to Laura it was, "Sorry sorry sorry."
ASHLEY: Sorry, I'm just trying to figure out how to play this again.
TALIESIN: All right.
MARISHA: Things kept changing. I would have an idea and then--
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, things were changing a lot.
TALIESIN: Then it would be fucked. Immediately fucked.
MATT: It's the nature of initiative order.
LIAM and TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Then also none of it seemed useful. I kept looking at my character sheet.
SAM: It was a good combat, though.
MARISHA: We did good.
TALIESIN: We did it. The Darkness ended up being--
LAURA: Clutch. At first it seemed like, "Oh, fuck." Then it was, "Oh, fine."
ASHLEY: It was a good distraction.
MARISHA: And nothing else.
MATT: Well, it ended up being a very good example of a major combat where the goal was not doing any damage. The goal-- or at least that wasn't the win thing. It was trying to survive and get out in some way, shape, or form.
MARISHA: Well, especially when you were like, "There's 40 people here." It's like there's no way.
LAURA: There's no way you can fight that.
TALIESIN: Yeah, get out of this. No, yeah, run.
SAM: If I had been smarter and teleported us away, we could have gone somewhere. I just have to know the place. I don't have to know where it is, right?
MATT: You have to know the place. But if you're very unfamiliar with it, then the modifiers to the roll you have to make are much worse. Which means there's a higher chance of you teleporting to other places that are kind of close to it, or having a--
LAURA: Or bamfing into the middle of a mountain.
MATT: Fun stuff, and then have to be shunted out.
TALIESIN: We don't know if magic is weird here, too. Is magic weird here, too? We don't know.
MATT: So far, I mean--
LAURA: Seems normal, right?
MATT: --you haven't tried anything that was the same scenario.
LIAM: Oh, we could try all our--
LAURA: Oh, we can try Sending and all that stuff, right?
LIAM: Yeah. We could try. But they're still down there.
SAM: Wait, can you send from the moon to the other planet?
TALIESIN: There's only one way to tell.
MATT: Yep.
TALIESIN: We haven't tried.
SAM: It might work. We're not on a different plane of existence.
LIAM: Well, we obviously got to give it a shot.
TALIESIN: There's some weird shit that keeps things from going back and forth, but--
SAM: Oh, yeah, there's a Divine Gate.
LAURA: Oh, because there's a gate.
TALIESIN: Yeah, but maybe this is like--
MATT: Yeah. That prevents Teleportation to the surface. That's why the Bloody Bridge is required.
LAURA: That's why you can't--
MATT: There are unique boundaries. You just don't know where those boundaries lie.
TALIESIN: Can we Message on the surface back and forth, if we can't Message to the planet below?
SAM: That's true.
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I want to try. I want to see if we can--
TALIESIN: That'd be great to know. A little experiment.
SAM: Because you could try Send to Ira, or your mom, or-- 
LAURA: Yeah, because you could Send to Ira.
TALIESIN, LAURA, MARISHA: Ira.
LIAM: Ira's a good place to start.
LAURA: Although, I feel like they know we're here. I mean, obviously, Otohan knows we're here.
MARISHA: For sure.
SAM: Ira might not.
LAURA: Ira might not know we're here, Otohan and my mom, like all of those Exaltant and powerful people.
LIAM: You just lit up the whole network.
LAURA: They know we're here. But they knew before that because they chased us.
SAM: Do we know anyone else on the moon? Besides Ira and the bad guys?
TALIESIN: I don't know.
TRAVIS: Not that we know of?
MARISHA: I don't think so.
LAURA: You know what? We would know the Reilorans that I've called.
SAM: Oh! They live here somewhere.
LIAM: This is where Grog is from.
TALIESIN: Grog's on the moon.
TRAVIS: Grog is Predathos.
SAM: They're just like random--
LAURA: Which makes me feel terrible.
SAM: So, yeah, when you call your Reiloran friends, is it just like a dad who's reading a bedtime story to his kids?
TALIESIN: That Deck of Many Things meant things got weird.
LIAM: He's on the toilet.
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Whoa.
TALIESIN: You just really wanted some cheese and you made it weird.
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: And then-- (transporting sound)
LAURA: Yeah, I think that's what it is. It's like a weird form of what Jester did. She could just pull them from anything.
TRAVIS: "Wake us."
MARISHA: Little frog people.
TRAVIS: Or wait, "wake"? No, "free".
LIAM: Maybe, when they're dreaming?
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Did I say wake? Free.
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, my gosh.
TRAVIS: What?
SAM: Can you make Laura feel better about her power?
MATT: Why?
LAURA: When I pull a random Reiloran through, could they just be going about their business or would they be dreaming like Orym?
SAM: Or were they in the middle of delicate brain surgery, and this next slice is going to--
MATT: You don't know.
TALIESIN: They've never said anything weird about it.
LIAM: That's why I think it might be a dream, because they're not like, "What the fuck is going on?"
LAURA: I know, nobody ever seemed freaked out.
TALIESIN: They're weird. They seem like they're in that weird dream fugue.
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: One's holding a loaf of sourdough, and and's like, "Shit."
LAURA: I just have to go through and find one of the names.
SAM: Someone's making a mixture and's like-- (looks around)
TALIESIN: Mom? Mom?
LAURA: I feel like one of the ones that I pulled through was Imperium.
MATT: Could be.
LAURA: I feel like the one I pulled through at... in Zephrah.
MATT: That one was fairly intense and seemed to be at least closest to Imperium that you've had a conversation with.
LIAM: So that's the random pull.
ASHLEY: What about the one when we were in...
LAURA: In Whitestone.
TALIESIN: That's a random flavor. 
ASHLEY: Whitestone. Is that what you remember?
LAURA: Yeah, that one seemed okay. No, the one in Zephrah when I pulled through, that one seemed like he was really stern, and like...
ASHLEY: He was kind of grouchy.
MARISHA: Pissed off.
LIAM: Like a blind box. You don't know what you're going to get.
LAURA: But the one that helped us unlock the door in Whitestone, that one seemed fine.
TALIESIN: I have so many batshit theories.
LAURA: And then the one that we pulled through right before we went up the bridge, that one seemed nice.
MARISHA: Seemed nice, yeah. That's kind of cool.
TALIESIN: I think it's a random dreamer.
ASHLEY: Yeah, the one from Keyleth was like--
LIAM: Think of how much more effectively we used the cloud spell. All these years later.
LAURA: Oh, gosh.
SAM: You did great. You did great.
MARISHA: We did.
LAURA: We've been great so far.
MARISHA: It's amazing when you realize how it's supposed to be used.
MATT: (laughs) Hey, that's how you figure it out.
MARISHA: And use it for its purpose.
MATT: You use things incorrectly and then you go, "Okay, now I know."
LAURA: You know what?
ASHLEY: I want to keep playing.
MATT: Soon enough.
TALIESIN: So many bad turns.
MATT: Yeah, she definitely let you know because she's...
LAURA: She's been there?
MATT: She's been there.
LAURA: If Keyleth hadn't warned us before we started that you're going to be vulnerable for a full minute before you do this, then we would've fucked it up again, probably.
SAM: Matt knows that we will not remember anything.
