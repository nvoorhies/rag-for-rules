Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (yelling) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: Yes. Before we get into our episode tonight, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with the sponsor tonight, which is One-Shot Wonders, Sam. 
TRAVIS: One-Shot Wonders. 
SAM: One-Shot Wonders is a collection of more than 100 One-Shot adventures for 5e designed to make running sessions easier than ever. All the plot points, characters, and locations you need are provided in two pages or less. The stories are designed for Dungeons & Dragons 5e rules, but can provide inspiration for any fantasy RPG system. The book is actually something that I actually really actually use in real life with my actual kids and our campaign at home. 
MARISHA: Actual kids. 
SAM: Actually. If I don't have time to write a super intricate story, I just flip to one of the One-Shot Wonders adventures, like this one. And we're off to the races. 
TRAVIS: That was the index. (laughter) 
SAM: In my home game, I put a heroes wanted job board in my kids' campaign and every time they visit it I whip out the book and I read off a couple titles for them. My kids have loved it and actually, I met the authors in London and they were very lovely people and you should support them. 
MARISHA: Aw! 
LAURA: Awesome! 
SAM: Trust me, as the busiest cast member of Critical Role, this book is my life hack. 
LIAM: Pfft, life hack. Whatever, that's nothing. 
SAM: Oh! Oh, you think you're busier than me, O'Brien? 
LIAM: (guffaws) Way busier! The only way I get by is with my food hack. I actually don't eat meals anymore, actually. Instead, I actually use this. 
SAM: Wow. 
LIAM: It's sort of like a nicotine patch, except that it feeds me. This one's beef stroganoff. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LIAM: It's savory, actually. I can really taste the meat in my arm. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Dang it! I thought I smelled beef. 
LIAM: It saves me an hour everyday. 
LAURA: Ha! An hour? 
LIAM: What? 
LAURA: I'm so busy, I need like an extra two hours a day. So I do the meal patch thing too, plus, I've stopped bathing all together. So instead I use a smell hack. I use this. It's Ma Breeze perfume. I haven't bathed in like two weeks, and none of you even noticed. It smells so good. 
ASHLEY: Okay, now I actually understand where the beef smell is coming from. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: A meal and a smell? That's small potatoes. I so busy that I no verbs. It me three hours of time everyday. 
LIAM: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wait, I got to parse this out. Are you saying-- 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Are you saying you stopped saying verbs to save you three hours of talking time? 
TALIESIN: You would right, Liam. In the language. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's like the beast jammer. 
MARISHA: Pretty good. 
TRAVIS: My brain's hurting. 
ASHLEY: Now I'm hungry for beef! 
SAM: Anyway, thanks guys. If you're extremely busy or just want inspiration, this book is an awesome gaming hack. Head to RollandPlayPress.com/Wonders and use code REDMOON10 to get 10% off your copy of One-Shot Wonders. Be quick! As this offer ends on February 29th. 
ASHLEY: Ooh, leap year! 
SAM: February 29th. 
MARISHA: In a language. 
SAM: Matt... to you. 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
MATT: Pffft. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, One-Shot Wonders, for sponsoring the show. Marisha, you got some announcements, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah, so yesterday was the season three premiere of "Midst." (oohing) 
LAURA: Woo! 
MARISHA: This season has everything. Reality-bending Fold terrors. Crumbling economics. New unhinged leaders. Hunting pests. And a new manhunt through the cosmos. 
TRAVIS: Cosmos. 
MARISHA: So yeah, we can't wait for you to see what's in store for Lark, for Moc Weepe, for Phineas, and finally answering so many lingering questions. So many lingering questions! It is truly a podcast listening experience unlike anything you've ever heard. This is it, this is the season, you guys. You got to get caught up. You got to watch it! Episode one is available for everyone right now on YouTube, and of course, where you get your podcasts. Subscribers at Midst.co can now enjoy the first three episodes. You'll always stay two weeks ahead of the free feeds. So you can, you know, lord that over all of your friends. 
TRAVIS: (bleats) 
MARISHA: You know, feel elitist. Anyway, your subscription-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: -- also gives you behind the scenes bonus episodes with the narrators, music downloads-- I spit on myself. 
LAURA: Yeah, you did. I saw it. 
MARISHA: And more! It's so juicy it's making me salivate. It's great. 
LAURA: Plus-- 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Plus, and a way to celebrate this new season. Merch, merch. Our Midst T-shirt and pin are currently on sale. 
ASHLEY: Nice, nice. 
LAURA: Check them out in our US Critical Role shop. I know which one it is. Then for Valentine's Day, which is, guess what, this-- Was it today? 
SAM: Is today Valentine's Day? 
MARISHA: Yesterday. 
MARISHA: It was yesterday. 
LIAM: Everybody knows that! 
LAURA: Yesterday was Valentine's Day! 
SAM: Yesterday was? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: That's why you're wearing pink. 
MARISHA: Did you get anything for Q? 
SAM: I definitely did. (laughter) 
SAM: Keep going. 
LAURA: Well, if you need a late present for Valentine's Day, our friends at Pin Club have just launched this stunning Briarwoods "Til' Death" pin set. You guys, it's so cool. 
MATT: What? That's awesome! 
LAURA: Freaking cool! 
MARISHA: Are those the cameos? 
LAURA: Yeah! Yeah! 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
MATT: That's cool! 
LAURA: They're enamel pins. They're sculpted. I'm going to take them out because you guys can't see what I'm showing you, anyway. But it's so beautiful. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
LAURA: I know! 
ASHLEY: Oh and it's got the chain! 
LAURA: I know! The enamel pins are sculpted, detailed portraits of Sylas and Delilah. 
LIAM: They're chained together. 
LAURA: They're chained together. So you can wear them on your collar. Guys, or you know, however you want to do it. 
ASHLEY: Can you put it on my collar? 
LAURA: Do you want to do it? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let me do it. 
LAURA: You can visit PinClub.shop to check it out. And guess what? We get to keep these ones. So if you want them, Ashley. Or if you want to give them to Q, Sam. 
LIAM: Classy. 
SAM: Oh, for yesterday? 
LAURA: Yeah, because you didn't get her anything. 
SAM: Yeah, she won't notice. 
ASHLEY: I love the pin chain situation. 
TRAVIS: She won't notice! Here's your belated Valentine's Day gift. 
LAURA: It's so cool! 
SAM: It's Canadian Valentine's Day. 
TRAVIS: Yes. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The 15th. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Fantastic. 
SAM: Is that it, Laura? 
LAURA: That's all I have. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Stop looking at me, swan. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Did you "Happy Gilmore" in here? 
MATT: Wow. Thank you. 
TRAVIS: Really nice. 
MATT: Thank you, Laura. 
ASHLEY: It doesn't work with this flannel. 
LAURA: Let me see. It's cute! 
SAM: I think it works. 
LAURA: But it does need to be buttoned up. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It needs to be buttoned up. 
MATT: That's okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it'd be nice on a nice blouse. 
LAURA: Yeah!

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So last we left off, Bells Hells had finally climbed the Bloody Bridge from the Malleus Key to the surface of the red moon of ill omen, Ruidus. Upon arriving into a bit of a dangerous scuffle, being pursued by some stragglers, you managed to escape the outpost and head in any direction to try to get to safety. After stopping through the middle of a storm and taking cover, you dove into your own visions and connections with what seems to be Predathos's power and other Ruidusborn in the region and seem to triangulate a location where they are converging. Focusing yourselves in that direction, you begin to head that way. Trying to avoid any dangerous weather patterns. Learning a little bit about the strange, alien landscape that you're still very fresh in arrival to. Then you eventually stumble upon a little place called Razora. A little village on one of the mountain ranges along the path. Not too much of a divergence from the direction you were taking, and there you went to investigate. You encountered some new creature types that you were unfamiliar with. Denizens of Ruidus. Bormodos and the cytaas that have a symbiotic relationship. You befriended one of the bormodos who brought you to one of the village elders, known as Elder Barthie. After some discussion, a bit of convincing, you seem to have presented yourselves as allies to those who do not wish the Imperium's rule to continue to press down upon the free peoples of Ruidus. As such the elder seemed to take a liking to you. Though warned of it being a dangerous place to flaunt that sort of allegiance, the Imperium taking no quarter. After some lore being spilled, some information about the essential capital of the entire Reiloran society. The Kreviris Imperium resides, the core of it, in the city of Kreviris. Which you assume to be the location that you are heading towards. Also, a caravan seemed to be coming by. About the time that this caravan arrived, an entity with the title Willmaster came to the door of the elder. The elder seemed surprised and it took notice of the strange individuals in Vanguard garb within the abode. One transforming into mist and others seeking to immediately make friends by failing to cast a spell upon them. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Hey, it was a good shot. If it had succeeded, it would have been a very different outcome. 
SAM: Well, we tried. We can only try. 
MATT: Indeed. However, this led to a bit of conflict. A battle here in the middle of the night of the streets outside of the elder's abode led to the Willmaster taking all the minds of the surrounding villagers and pulling them in to protect them. As it looked like a few Vanguard members flanked this Willmaster. Young and a bit spooked by the sudden violence as they were exploded with a fireball, a bunch of loud noises and detonation cracks sent nearby beasts of burden into a frenzy before they broke free of their pen causing a stampede through the center of this town. A number of these figures were either slain or knocked unconscious. We left off, as you pulled them into the house of the elder. Imogen still a wisp of cloud from Keyleth's spell. Still clinging on for another four to five hours of length. As you all assess how to deal with what comes next. So as you pull the bodies into this abode and plan out what you're going to do, Bells Hells, what are we doing? 
LAURA: Am I still above? Am I floating up above? 
MATT: Unless you said you were coming back. 
LAURA: Which I didn't. Can I see how close any of the other guards are to the-- Is anybody running this direction? I assume, yeah. 
MATT: I mean. Make a perception check for me. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah! That's a three. 
MATT: It's a three? (laughter) 
MATT: I mean, there's a lot of commotion in the town. There are people moving around in the streets. So you are uncertain if people are coming towards the location where your friends are or if they're just investigating. 
LAURA: I don't see anything! 
TRAVIS: Before the battle kicked off, I was looking for the door. The trap door of the floor. Could I run back inside and try and find and lift the door that Elder Bartho was talking about. 
MATT: Sure, Barthie. 
LAURA: Barthie. 
LIAM: Are we freeze framed in having drug all bodies unconscious indoors? Or are we in the middle of that process? 
MATT: I mean, since we ended last time, I'd say we're finishing that process. 
LIAM: Okay. So still in the open. 
MATT: So you rapidly grabbed. Still grabbing corpses and unconscious bodies and pulling them back. So you're just now starting to finish up that process. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: I will fly down and go back in the building and try to-- 
LIAM: Un-fart? 
LAURA: Un-fart. Can I plant myself against a wall or something, so that if anybody barges in I won't be out in the open farting? 
MATT: Sure. You pick one little alcove behind one of the shelves where there's a couple collectible knick-knacks that the elder had are present. Where you can like, shift off to that side and begin to transform. While this is happening, Dono has left. Dono, as soon as the violence ended, just went away. The elder is getting back into the household and is like. "(heavy breathing) Well, that's a real uh-- This is the most exciting and terrifying evening we've had here in a long time. It's uh-- What uh-- what are we to do? We're in a lot of trouble." 
TRAVIS: We're people of action. We need to find that trap door you mentioned before. Where is it? 
MATT: "It's right over here. Let me show you," and he walks over. 
TALIESIN: Is there enough room to open the hole, by the way? In here? 
LIAM: Inside? 
MATT: Inside here? Yeah. You can move one of the tables to the side. 
TALIESIN: All right, we're setting this up. I'm so sorry, sir. This is going to get a little weird...er. We're opening up the hole while you're looking. 
MATT: "Oh, that looks pretty interesting." 
LIAM: Are you good at tracking the time? 
SAM: Yeah, of course. I've got an internal clock. It's been-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: ♪ It's been ♪ 
LAURA: ♪ One week ♪ (laughter) 
SAM: It's been six seconds so far. 
LIAM: Can the egg timer go off in 10 minutes? 
SAM: 10 minutes? Why? What happens in 10 minutes? 
LIAM: The bag is 11, isn't that it? 
LAURA: No, it's 10 minutes. 
LIAM: 10 minutes, so nine minutes on your timer. 
TALIESIN: No, once we close it. 
LAURA: They'll die in nine minutes. 
LIAM: Nine minutes we need to open it. 
SAM: All right. 
TALIESIN: But it's only once I close it. So as long as it's open, we're fine. Once it's closed, then we have a time limit of about 10 minutes. 
SAM: Fresh Cut Alexa, set timer for 10 minutes. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Nine minutes. 
TRAVIS: If that set off somebody in somebody's house, I want to hear about it. 
MATT: You take 20 points of psychic damage. No. 
MARISHA: Although, Fresh Cut Grass Alexa pack, voice pack. 
SAM: Let's do it. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: No! 
TRAVIS: Smiley day to ya! 
MATT: Oh no! 
LAURA: So cute! 
MATT: No! 
SAM: I'll just try to keep track of the time. I have no special skill that does that better than anyone else, but I'm confident. 
TALIESIN: We're throwing everything we can in here that's a problem, I assume. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: The elder is currently righting his furniture. 
TRAVIS: Just in case the basement is tiny or something. 
MATT: Yeah, exactly. You look over at his shoulder, you see Chu is just staring daggers at the rest of you, like. 
TALIESIN: Did you recognize those guards or were those brand new people? 
MATT: "Well, I didn't recognize the robed figures that were moving alongside with them. You did take out Edmuda." 
SAM: Oh, hey, confirmation! 
MATT: "So that's, I believe I was sighted amongst the rest of you, so if you do speak to them, I would recommend you, or I will say that I was put under duress and was about to scream for their aid because I cannot be affiliated with the violence that you have wrought here in my home." 
SAM: Hopefully no one will know about this violence because we'll just say it was a big stampede and lots of chaos and we had nothing to do with anything. 
TRAVIS: To be clear, we plan on lying going forward. 
LIAM: Do we want to come up with a story for if anyone saw a large blast of fire from a distance, what that might have been? You want to start thinking-- 
MATT: "If they didn't see it--" 
LIAM: -- about that now? 
MATT: "-- they certainly heard it." 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Twice, two explosions, very loud." 
LIAM: So just start noodling on an excuse. 
LAURA: Am I still gas? 
SAM: You and me, come up with something. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: About now you've reformed. 
ASHLEY: We'll figure out the fireball sound-- 
LAURA: Do y'all have anything in town that would make an explosion? 
LIAM: Welcome back. 
LAURA: Thank you. I'm sorry! 
SAM: Oh, you're here! 
LAURA: I'm so sorry. 
MARISHA: Well, are you all right? 
LAURA: I'm so sorry. 
MATT: "Not in particular, we're kind of a farming community. We don't really keep those sort of--" 
ASHLEY: Like a fertilizer situation? 
LAURA: What about wuukor poo? Doesn't it, it causes a-- 
MATT: "It certainly burns, but it's not really an explosive material." 
SAM: How about me? How about me? 
TALIESIN: Unless it's under pressure. 
SAM: You say it was me. You say I'm a new piece of farming equipment that you just had been developing and you were demonstrating it and it made such a loud explosion. I malfunctioned, made such a loud explosion that it caused the wuukor to stampede. 
LAURA: Oh, I love it. 
SAM: I can shoot some fire out of me. I've got Flame Strike, so I can-- 
LAURA: Sure, maybe we can, can you put some char marks on you? 
ASHLEY: Okay, but what was your purpose? 
TALIESIN: Is this really a good idea? 
ASHLEY: You cut grass! 
TRAVIS: Trap door. 
SAM: I cut grass. 
TRAVIS: Trap door! 
MATT: Yes. You found it and pulled it open. 
SAM: I'm a lawn mower. 
MATT: Indeed, there's a-- 
TALIESIN: I can't believe this. 
SAM: I'll put on my saw blade. 
TALIESIN: What is an adult doing right now? 
MATT: There is a set of, maybe six feet down of carved steps into the ground that leads into a storage chamber beneath, you can see, you can smell herbal smells, like it's some sort of a storage space for like whatever processing of local odd, hardy flora would be, as well as some of the dried foods and stuff. That's it. It's maybe a quarter full. 
TRAVIS: The space down there, having seen the hole open before, could it be open down here in this space, or is it too small for that? 
MATT: I would say it could be done if you were to move everything out of it, but it's too small currently-- 
TRAVIS: Up and out of it-- 
MATT: Correct. Yeah-- 
TRAVIS: -- not like shove it to the side. 
MATT: -- it's about 10-foot by 10-foot. 
TRAVIS: Stick my head back up. Stop peeking up through the hole. Get everything in there now and we can fold that bitch up and come down here if we need to. 
TALIESIN: If the door knocks, we'll just pull the rug, fold it up, and run down there. 
MARISHA: I take some of my black ichory goo and I smear it on FCG to look like an oil leakage. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Then I head towards-- 
SAM: I'm a lawn mower, I'm a lawn mower. 
LIAM: Are we taking the Ruby--? Orym's on the window. 
TALIESIN: I feel like this is how we got into this problem. 
LIAM: Orym's on the window just looking out. Are you still, are you taking off your Ruby Vanguard outfit because you're dressed like-- 
SAM: Take it off, I'm a machine. I'm a machine. 
LAURA: You're just lawn equipment. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Oh, I'm still a fucking wolf. Shit. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Don't sound intelligent. Don't speak. ♪ Don't speak. ♪ 
LIAM: But who do you-- 
TALIESIN: We have an outside observer. Does any of this sound credible to you, sir? 
LIAM: Who do you belong to if you're farm equipment here? 
SAM: You're a traveling salesman. You were showing me to the farmers here. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, we got this, it'll be fine. We can-- 
MATT: "To be entirely honest, you all stand out by the nature before we met." 
MARISHA: I'm going to go down into the basement with Chetney. 
TRAVIS: We're going to start sliding the bodies in first. 
MARISHA: Yes, we've been doing that. 
MATT: You're looking out the window. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: You do see a larger shape that resembles the hulking appearance of a juggernaut and a couple other figures walking alongside, coming and inspecting the recent scattering around, so there is an investigation actively happening 15, 20 feet from the front door. 
LAURA: We don't know of anybody in-- 
TRAVIS: Fold up the hole and let's get it downstairs. 
LAURA: -- on the moon that's a sales person. 
SAM: All right, we're not salespeople. We were developing it ourselves. Just get rid of them! 
TRAVIS: Any non-essential lying personnel should get downstairs STAT. 
MARISHA: We fold up the hole, we go down. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: Who's we? Everybody but-- 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: I'm going down. 
ASHLEY: I'll go down, too. 
TRAVIS: I thought you were a good liar! 
ASHLEY: I'm shit at lying, but I can really persuade someone if I need to. So can she. 
MARISHA: Persuasion can be a form of lying. 
SAM: You can Guidance. 
ASHLEY: It can. I can Guidance, okay, I'll stay up, I'll stay up, I'll stay up. 
TRAVIS: Guiding is also very visible when you do it. 
LIAM: Unless you do it right now. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. (laughter) 
MATT: "So I'm not really a talented fibber, you would say, so--" 
SAM: Don't say anything. 
MATT: "-- I should not take point." 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: I can sit with you if you want. 
MATT: "Sure, I'll be present. Definitely I should be present." 
LAURA: I'll crouch down like I'm trying to work on you. Anybody got some equipment like tools or something? 
MARISHA: I throw over my scissors. 
LAURA: Scissors? 
SAM: I got a hammer. (loud knocking) 
LAURA: Oh, shit. 
ASHLEY: Sit with me. Sit with me. Sit with me. Sit with me. 
SAM: I lie down on my back. 
LAURA: Oh, god. 
TRAVIS: Nobody say shit. 
LAURA: I take some of the ichor and I wipe it on my face. 
SAM: Oh nice. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to just sit and drink tea. 
MATT: The elder comes over to the door, opens it up slowly. (door squeaking) You see there is a Ruby Vanguard figure you don't recognize sitting at the door who takes a step back and you can see there is a figure, definitely a juggernaut, but a juggernaut that itself is in a thicker piece of armor on each shoulder. Doesn't enter the abode, and a third Ruby Vanguard figure that steps forward that you do recognize. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh, fuck. 
MATT: You see these, the same Vanguard robes, but the relatively frustratingly pursed expression of Hytroga of the Heartmoor Hamlet, whose museum you had-- 
TRAVIS: We have. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Wait. 
MATT: -- tooled through. 
LAURA: He's Vanguard? 
MARISHA: We pissed him off? 
TRAVIS: No, he's just Vanguard. 
LIAM: No, he just happens to also be Vanguard, apparently. 
TRAVIS: That POS. 
SAM: Does he know us? He knows us very well. 
LAURA: Did we piss him off? But how did we leave it? Did we piss him off or he just knew us? 
ASHLEY: We won. 
TRAVIS: I think he knew us. 
MARISHA: He hired us to break into his-- 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: It was a contest. 
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MARISHA: And we won. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: We did. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Hytroga was his name? 
MATT: Mm-hmm, Evon Hytroga. 
MARISHA, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Evon. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: One of the figures says, "Hello, you are the elder of this village, yes?" (Barthie) "Yes, indeed. I heard some loud noises outside and a bit of a scuffle. I went and fled with my companions here, also of your particular faction and interests, so we were just--" 
LAURA: That noise was us. Sorry about that. 
MATT: They all look over, looks past and you can see that the figure stepping in is very gaunt elven, almost a pale, almost translucent skin. Like you can see blue veins that curl up the sides almost, very powdery skin. 
SAM: He doesn't know that we're not Vanguard? 
LAURA: Yeah, no, he doesn't, no. 
MATT: Steps in and looks at the rest of you. Hytroga walks in afterwards and goes, "Oh, interesting. So, the noise was you, but you also blew up the outside and, wait, don't I know you?" 
LAURA: Yeah, I know you. When did you get here? 
MATT: "Oh, I've been here for the better part of a couple weeks. But you, I-- You're that lot of strange individuals that I hired not long before. Interesting, I didn't know that you joined with the Vanguard as well." 
LAURA: You didn't know you had such good taste? 
MATT: Make a deception check. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (snaps fingers) 
SAM: Here it is, here it is. Probably have Guidance on this one. 
ASHLEY: You also have Guidance. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. (speaking gibberish) Okay, so that's 17 plus nine, 26. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
SAM: That's a lot. 
MATT: 26. Gives you this intense stare, as does the companion who hasn't entered the chamber, who's just arms crossed and looking at you in the interior here. Hytroga goes, "Well, isn't this just good fortune for us all? Well, I certainly am happy to have you amongst our-- How long have you been here then?" 
LAURA: About a week now. 
MATT: "About a week." 
ASHLEY: I'm happy to have you here as well. How long have you been here? 
LAURA: He said a couple weeks. 
MATT: "Couple weeks." 
ASHLEY: Couple weeks, I'm sorry, I know, that's right. 
MATT: "That's all right, so you've come here more recently." 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
SAM: Your hands are shaking. 
MATT: "What--" 
SAM: How are you doing? How are you doing? 
MATT: "If you've come--" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: This is what you do with hands, right? 
MATT: "If you've come here more recently, if I might inquire, did you bring any fun Exandrian supplies? Any, you know, bits of home to keep yourself?" 
LAURA: Well, I brought this thing. 
MATT: "Oh, right." 
LAURA: You remember it, right? 
MATT: "Strange and unique automaton, hmm." 
SAM: Just not moving except every once in a while. (mechanical zipping) 
LAURA: We've had a bit of malfunction, hence the kerfuffle outside. 
MATT: "Interesting. Back to the matter of hand, like anything from home? Nice blanket? Biscuits?" 
LAURA: In his head, he hears: Homesick? 
MATT: You hear back in his head. "This place is dreadfully bland. I don't know how they live here in such squalor. I hate it here." (laughter) 
LAURA: Strange. 
MATT: "I can't go back, but I hate it here." 
LAURA: It feels right at home to me. 
MATT: "Hmm, give it time, give it time." 
LIAM: Can I ask a question? Orym is being silent. I'm up here, but just acting like her guard. You said that one of these people is a stranger with pale, translucent skin. 
MATT: Very, very powder-pale skin. 
LIAM: What color is their hair? 
MATT: Oh, no hair, just a hood that's just over. 
LIAM: Are they by any chance reminiscent of Dusk? 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: No, not the same sort of fey. 
MATT: Not super exaggerated fey features, just elven. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Looks like they're either sickly or never went outside a day in their life. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: The elvish figure steps in after Hytroga, goes, "Hytroga, are these friends of yours?" Says, "Yes, sir, we're quite acquainted. I hired them quite a bit back and they were impressive. I give them a solid B, B+. So I think they are indeed a grand addition to our merry band, so much so that I think it would behoove us to go and check in back home to see what more they could bring." The figure shakes their head. (Elf) "We're here on business, boy." 
LAURA: In Hytroga's head, "Are you part of the caravan?" 
MATT: Hytroga responds, "Yes, we bring supplies. It's great, I get so close to home and have to go away again." 
LAURA: I'd love to join you. 
MATT: "Really?" 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "All right. I don't know if we have much room, but as long as you're okay with walking on foot for days at a time." 
LAURA: I guess, get us out of this city, this town. There's got to be better stuff around here, right? 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
SAM: Come on, come on. 
LAURA: Okay. 22. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MATT: 22, okay. You hear back in your head. "Mmm, are you sure you don't have any little memories from home?" 
SAM: Give him something. 
TRAVIS: Don't you have the bag of holding, Fearne? 
MARISHA: Yeah, give him some biscuits or some shit. 
LAURA: I mean, not on me, but my friends have plenty. 
LIAM: Pastries. 
MATT: "Maybe on the way. (laughs)" Hytroga turns and goes, "How about they continue with us on to Kreviris, and I could introduce them perhaps to some of our compatriots. They would likely have better use there than they would here in this little podunk." As he looks over at the elder and the elder's like, "No offense, we like the podunk lifestyle." (laughter) At this point you can see Chu crawling up the shoulder and looking out towards the hooded figure and is like looking out at the rest of you. 
LAURA: I'm going to stare at Chu. 
SAM: Is he going to rat us out? 
LAURA: Can I speak to it, him in his brain? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
LAURA: What are you thinking? 
MATT: Looks back at you. "Just looking out for my special someone, you know." 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "Making sure you're not going to pin this on him, you murderers." (laughter) 
LAURA: I was a cloud, darling. The only way to get us out of your hair is to let us go in peace, all right? Your buddy will be fine. I'm keeping him safe. You should, too. 
MATT: Make a persuasion or intimidation check, your choice. 
TRAVIS: Remix it. 
LAURA: 24. 
MATT: 24. See Chu buckles back into part of the cloth robes around the shoulder shawl of the elder and peeking out goes, "We've all just been sitting here playing little games." (laughter) 
MATT: "Having tea. Nothing weird about it." Curls back inside, like bundles inside. The elder "(sighing)." Hooded figure goes, "Well, if you were the source of the noise, have any of you seen the Willmaster?" And looks straight at you. 
LAURA: I believe I did see them. I didn't say any words. They left shortly after the stampede. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
MATT: Make another deception check. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MARISHA: Come on, Imogen! 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Let's go! 
SAM: Pick a good die. 
TRAVIS: Nothing to it. Nothing to it. 
SAM: Easy. 
LAURA: 28. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: ♪ Unstoppable ♪ ♪ Unstoppable, unstoppable ♪ 
LIAM: Did you just turn into a Sia video? 
MATT: Apparently. I legitimately set that 25 is the climbing DCs of him, just like not-- 
LIAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Hytroga is more of a pushover in the circumstance, but this figure is not having your bullshit. Through force of personality, confidence, and the inability to confirm or deny information, the figure seems to relax the tension, but still keep their eyes trained on you. "Very well, you'll travel with us. We'll leave at first light." 
ASHLEY: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's your name? We didn't get your name. 
MATT: "If I decide you're worthy of it, I'll tell you." 
ASHLEY: Wow. (scoffs) 
LIAM: On a related note, it's been way longer than a minute. Using Know Your Enemy, how much of a heavy hitter is this person? Total class levels higher than Orym's? 
MATT: Class levels, this figure would be a little bit higher than Orym's, yeah. 
SAM: (squeaks) 
LIAM: How about HP? 
MATT: HP? 
LIAM: I'm at 130. 
ASHLEY: HP. 
MATT: That's right, because you got that feat. Not quite as high as your hit points. 
LIAM: Okay, thank you. 
SAM: We can take them. 
MATT: The figure leans back, and you see the massive Reiloran figure that stands behind (heavy footfalls) steps behind it, and then turns and walks away. Hytroga goes, "Well, that seemed to go well. (laughs) Well, this is nice. Conversation for the trip. Normally it's so quiet and boring and... I'm looking forward to this." 
LAURA: We'll talk. 
MATT: "Mm. Ah." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Reaches over and grabs one of teacups. 
TRAVIS: Who thought we'd see this guy? 
MATT: "(sputtering)" 
LAURA: (laughs) (laughter) 
MATT: "I hate it here." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: (sputtering mockingly) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Well, we're going to go rest." He goes and puts his hood up. "Wait for me!" Leaves out into the evening. The door closes behind as the elder shuts it. (Barthie) "(sighs in relief)" 
TALIESIN: Quietly coming up from down below, and I'm spreading the hole back out so that they get air in there. 
SAM: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You had one job! You had one job! 
TALIESIN: Is anyone conscious in there? 
SAM: ♪ It's been ♪ Five minutes, maybe? 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're fine. 
LIAM: That's what it felt like. 
SAM: I don't know. 
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw. 
LAURA: Oh no, oh no. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
LAURA: What? Oh no! 
ASHLEY: Wait, for what? 
LAURA: That thing is awake. Is it awake down there? Is it awake in there? 
TRAVIS: It was just unconscious. 
MATT: A few minutes ago. 
MARISHA: Right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: ♪ It's been ♪ 
TALIESIN: Remember, all you've got to do is pull that thing. Wisdom save. Nope. 
MATT: You put the hole out, and just white. You all watch Ashton immediately stand up. Eyes go white. Take the hammer. The closest to you, I'd say, given the fact that you were at the center of the conversation, is Imogen. I need to you to make a full round of attacks on Imogen. 
TRAVIS: Oh! Wait, how many rounds? 
MARISHA and LAURA: A full round. 
MATT: Just a full rounds of attacks. 
TRAVIS: I thought you said four rounds of attacks. 
ASHLEY: I did too. 
MATT: Rage first. 
ASHLEY: I was like, wait, what? 
TALIESIN: Rage first. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait, wait! 
MARISHA: Can we kick the hole closed when this happens? 
TRAVIS: He's got to freak out first, I think. 
MATT: Yeah, this happens right now. 
LAURA: Instantly? It's been saving-- 
MATT: Like (snaps to attention) (hammer swings) 
TALIESIN: Yep. So I attempted to save, and boy did I fail. Rage first, so that's attack number one is 13 to hit. 
LAURA: Oh! Misses! 
TALIESIN: (stressed sigh) 
MATT: How did you roll 13 to hit? 
TALIESIN: I rolled a three. 
MATT: That's amazing! That's so good! All right, cool. That's really lucky. 
TALIESIN: Second attack. 24 to hit. 
LAURA: (sneering wince) 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Take it like a-- 
TALIESIN: That's, and I'm so sorry. 
TRAVIS: Rhyme Ruidusborn? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's a six and a nine. 
MARISHA: Rhyme with "Ruidusborn"? 
TRAVIS: Ruidusborn? 
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage. 
LAURA: He's going to kill me. 
MARISHA: Well, that's it. That's his two. 
TALIESIN: That's my turn. 
LAURA: Okay, that's it? That's it? 
LIAM: I was right behind her. Can I Bait and Switch right now? 
MATT: You can. 
LIAM: Okay. Add five to your AC for this split second of time. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm with Chetney. We were right next to the hole. Can we immediately throw the hole shut? 
TRAVIS: I'm going to jump in that bitch. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: In the hole? 
ASHLEY: I know, I was going to jump-- 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Okay, so-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, he has one HP. 
MATT: Now we're going to keep this into-- We don't need a battle map necessarily, but let's do some quick initiative on this. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
ASHLEY: I was going to jump in there, too. 
TRAVIS: I was kind of thinking-- 
LAURA: 14, but I had-- 
TALIESIN: God-- 
TRAVIS: -- but I didn't think it would happen that soon. 
TALIESIN: -- fucking damn it. That was super fast. 
LAURA: -- whatever up. 
TRAVIS: We're fine, yeah. 
MARISHA: I mean, you could get in there and we could close the hole. 
LAURA: Mage Armor. 
TRAVIS: Totally. 
MARISHA: Tear into him. 
TRAVIS: (rabid snarling) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty, 25 to 20. 
LAURA: That was eight hours. 
LIAM: Oh, we're all-- Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, we're all rolling? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Anyone who wants to take an action. 
LIAM: 15. 
SAM: God. 
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody? 
LAURA: 20. 
MATT: 20. 
TALIESIN: Thank god. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 20 here as well. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Fearne. 
MATT: Okay, we have-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Every barbarian's worst nightmare. 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
TALIESIN: 17. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Orym and then Chet. 
TRAVIS: 15. 
MATT: 15, okay. Chetney. 10 to five? 
ASHLEY: Who was in the hole? 
LAURA: Chet jumped in the hole? 
MARISHA: 11. 
LAURA: Did you already jump in the hole, or are you basing that on initiative? Well, I was waiting. 
LIAM: Go to your hole! 
TRAVIS: I have no idea. 
MATT: FCG, what've you got? 
LIAM: Don't you want to go to your hole? 
SAM: Seven. 
MATT: All right. So as this transpires, Imogen, you're up first, with Fearne on deck. 
LAURA: Can I see in the hole? Or I just saw Ashton immediately attack me? 
MATT: You can't see into the hole. Ashton just rushed you and swung once, and you barely dodged it, but using momentum, he spun around again and hit you right upside the shoulder. You felt it pop almost out of the socket, and it throws you almost to the ground, the sheer force of it. You both are in a burst of pain and a newfound respect for exactly what being on the other end of that hammer feels like. 
LAURA: (winces) I'm going to-- Fuck, I'm going to use Mage Hand, just Telekinesis, and try to throw the fabric to shut the hole. 
MATT: To shut the hole? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, let me look at the specifics of this hole here just to make sure that that's something we can do-- 
MARISHA: I wonder if it cuts off his control on him? 
MATT: -- with the Mage Hand. 
LAURA: Maybe. 
TALIESIN: It is a different dimension. 
ASHLEY: That's a good idea. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Should be okay. 
SAM: Oh, how heavy the hole is? 
MARISHA: Hmm? 
SAM: Mage Hand can only grab 10 pounds of stuff, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm not trying to throw the hole. I'm trying to throw the fabric, the corner of the fabric-- 
SAM: Sure, to break the circle. 
MATT: Yeah, it's an action to unfold, so if you're using your action as part-- Does Mage Hand cost an action to cast? 
LAURA: No, it's just my telekinetic ability. Oh, well, hold on. 
MATT: To use it, though. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: Mage Hand is an action to cast. 
LAURA: As an action, yeah. As an action. 
MATT: Yeah, so you create the hand, then you have to spend an action to spend it. So next round, you'll be able to do that. 
MARISHA: Can you Quicken it? 
LAURA: I can, but-- 
MATT: You could Quicken it and then use your action to do that. 
LAURA: Yeah, I just didn't know if having actual telekinetic... I guess that is just to cast Mage Hand. 
TALIESIN: I'll also say that my move is next, so. 
ASHLEY: I could-- 
LAURA: Sure, I'm going to Quicken. I'll Quicken it to make it a bonus. 
MATT: Yeah, that'd be the way to do it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. So yeah, so you pull the hole closed, and it rolls up and furls up and wrinkles. 
LAURA: Then, I'm going to try to get up and skitter away from Ashton. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Is he still controlled? 
LAURA: I don't know yet. 
MATT: Yeah, the spell wasn't broken. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: You're right to get away, but you'll lose that AC bonus. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: If you depart. But you're also getting away, so. 
LAURA: Oh, well if I'm standing behind you, maybe I'll just roll behind Orym. 
MATT: Okay, so you use Orym as a guard, which is like using a small chair as protection. You get down below. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Stout chair. 
MATT: Perfect. So that finishes your go, Imogen. The hole has been pulled away from its opening. The eyes are still white on your friend here. 
LAURA: Ugh! 
LIAM: Okay, so hole's shut. He's still the Terminator. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hm. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: They're still the Terminator. 
MATT: Fearne. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to go finish picking up the hole. 
MATT: Okay, you grab the hole. 
ASHLEY: Finish folding it up. 
MATT: Pull it up into this little bundle. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Is anything happening to him? 
MATT: Doesn't appear to be-- 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: -- changing his perspective currently. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to start railing on people. 
LIAM: You're going to start railing me? 
TRAVIS: Open the hole! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, we should get the hole back open. 
LAURA: Sorry! 
MATT: It's now the Willmaster's turn. 
MARISHA: I know, I was hoping it would break it. 
MATT: It's not present. It's now Ashton's turn. 
MARISHA: Okay, well-- 
MATT: Ashton stands still, eyes still white, and does nothing. 
MARISHA: -- the Willmaster. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: He needs to be commanded. 
TALIESIN: Do I get a save? 
LAURA: Yeah, so he can't do it, because he's in another dimension. 
TALIESIN: It's the end my turn? 
MATT: No, let's see here. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
LAURA: It just didn't break it. 
TALIESIN: That would be so nice. 
MATT: I know. 
MARISHA: So the Willmaster is after Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Which means-- 
MARISHA: But because he can't access Ashton-- 
MATT: No, you do not get a save. 
TRAVIS: She. 
TALIESIN: Which means if the hole-- 
MARISHA: She. 
TALIESIN: I can't help. Never mind. 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: I'm out. 
MATT: After the swing, as soon as the hole gets pulled up, you watch Ashton go-- (silent disengaging) Just stand, limp, like they're some statue. 
TRAVIS: As if there was any part of Ashton that could possibly be limp. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM and LIAM: (laugh) 
SAM: So we could just-- 
MATT: Orym, you're up. 
SAM: -- wait it out for a minute. 
MATT: Chetney, you're on deck. 
SAM: Unless it's a 10 minute-- 
MARISHA: Can we put Ashton in the cellar? Can we close him in the trap door cellar? 
LAURA: Then open the hole back up? 
MARISHA: And then open it. 
LIAM: Is that open? Is the trap door open in the room? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's still open. We came up through it. 
MATT: Yep. 
LIAM: Okay. All right, so since we're theater of the mind here, how close are we to that hole? I'm right between these two? 
MATT: It's not a massive interior here, so you're about 10 feet from it. 
LIAM: All right, I'm going to attack. 
SAM: Attack who? 
LAURA: Ashton? 
LIAM: Ashton. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Non-lethally. I'm going to make it a pushing attack. 
MARISHA: Yeah, push him in the hole. 
LIAM: That is a 19 to hit. 
MATT: 19 to hit your AC? 
TALIESIN: That hits. 
MATT: All right, roll damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: He's raging, so it's half damage. 
LIAM: Okay, and you have to make a strength save, which I know you're likely to do. 
MATT: He has advantage on those, yeah. 
LIAM: Oh, awesome. 
MATT: While raging. 
TALIESIN: But I can't physically do anything, so I don't know if that would apply. 
MATT: That's true, the rage is technically dropped. 
TALIESIN: Oh, the rage is dropped? 
MATT: It is, because you didn't attack, since you didn't continue to attack at the end of your turn. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I had a full round without an attack or being attacked. 
MATT: You're not resisting it, because you're standing there. 
TALIESIN: There's no resistance. 
MATT: Yeah, so just-- 
LIAM: So it's 10 points of non-lethal damage and you have to make a strength save, unless you're saying it auto-fails. I don't know what we're saying yet. 
TALIESIN: I think it might auto-fail. I'm also not raging anymore. 
MATT: Yeah, I'd say make one with disadvantage, because you're just standing still. It's less about you trying to resist it and more if the strength of the attack can push you back based on-- 
TALIESIN: Strength save with disadvantage. 
MATT: Correct, this is you just standing there, and your physical denseness deflecting this. 
TALIESIN: That's 17? 
LIAM: Meets it beats it. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
MATT: Okay, so as you strike-- 
TALIESIN: 10 points of damage? 
MATT: Skids back a little bit. His sheer stone form seems to be hard to push. However, because you took damage, you do take another wisdom saving throw. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I get a wisdom save from that. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's so nice. 
LIAM: I'll also do it again. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a 20. 
MATT: A 20 succeeds. (cheering) 
MATT: Make another attack. (laughs) 
LAURA: He's back! He's back! 
TALIESIN: Ow! 
SAM: He's back, he's back. 
TALIESIN: Ow! 
LAURA: He's back! Ashton's back! 
LIAM: I don't think I would know. 
TALIESIN: Do I remember any of this? 
MARISHA: Oh! Ashton's back. 
MATT: He said before you made the save he was going to make a second attack, so your eyes blink back as the second razor fast strike of Orym comes in. 
TALIESIN: That really fucking-- 
LIAM: That was a 15. That's not going to hit. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: For the third attack, it is 19 again. 
TALIESIN: That hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: What the fuck? 
LAURA: Going for a third attack? 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Just for the fuck of it? 
LIAM: Yes, I'm pushing him in the hole, because I would have just gone at him. I wouldn't have necessarily realized. 
MATT: Yeah, he attacked really fast. 
LAURA: That's true. 
MATT: He comes to in the middle of it. 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
LIAM: 17 points of non-lethal damage, and then also you would make a strength save, probably flat roll since you're not out of it anymore. 
TALIESIN: Flat roll. 
MATT: Flat roll for this. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no advantage, because I'm not raging. 
LIAM: I kind of want to push you in the hole. 
TALIESIN: Well, you'll be happy to know that's a 12 to my strength save. 
LIAM: Okay, so Ashton leapt up... Ashton? Orym leapt up off of Ashton's knee, smacked him in the jaw with the flat of the blade, rebounded and tried to do it again and you, I guess, dodge at the last second-- 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
LIAM: -- and the last time, I just hit you with the pommel in between the eyes, and Ashton has just stumbled back into the hole. 
TALIESIN: Ow! 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's open. 
MARISHA: Wait, it's closed. 
SAM: Into the portable hole? 
LIAM: No, the basement. 
LAURA: He's not controlled anymore. 
SAM: The basement hole. 
ASHLEY: Got it. 
SAM: The basement stairwell. 
TALIESIN: Ow! Fuck! 
MARISHA: The cell-- it's the basement. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that wouldn't have actually hurt that much. 
LIAM: No, no, no. 
TALIESIN: That would have just been shock. Ow! 
LIAM: You're made of rocks. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to lie down there for a second, because I do not know what the fuck just happened. 
LIAM: You've fallen. 
ASHLEY: Go sit in the corner. 
LAURA: Okay, so it's awake again. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: So we could open the hole back up and try to knock it out immediately now that we know what's going to happen. 
MARISHA: Yes, this basically holds initiative, right, Matt? 
MATT: No, initiative's done. There's no immediate threat now. 
MARISHA: Initiative's done, okay. 
SAM: I do have a Silence spell. I could cast it so that if we open the hole-- 
LIAM: It's probably mental, not magic. 
SAM: I know, but if she screams for help or anything-- 
LAURA: At least we won't make any noise. 
SAM: -- I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Ah! I'm just slowly crawling up. 
MARISHA: Are we able to open the hole and let Chet go in and do his thing? 
LIAM: They're really hurt, so pile drive them. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Knock them back out. 
TRAVIS: But as soon as we open the hole now, we'll restart the process, so they'll cast on somebody. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I'll open the hole, they can cast it on me, and then you can be right behind me ready to pounce. I'll take it. 
TRAVIS: But you've got a buzzsaw! (deeply) You've got a buzzsaw. 
LAURA: Take all your weapons off. 
SAM: That's true. I'll take all my weapons off. 
MARISHA: Wait, didn't you say you could theoretically be the one to cleanse somebody of this? 
SAM: I have Restoration, so I could undo, if someone gets hit with this-- 
LAURA: Yeah, but Chet's going to hit them right away. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That was terrible. 
LAURA: There's an Exalted down there, too. 
MATT: Fearne, you were saying something? 
ASHLEY: If you're in the hole, can you see out of it? 
MATT: When the hole is-- 
ASHLEY: When it's open? 
MATT: -- fully unraveled, then yes. 
MARISHA: I could Darkness again. 
TALIESIN: Can we do it hiding? 
TRAVIS: We should just open the hole and three people jump in. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: It can only charm one. The other two can-- 
MARISHA: Can pummel them. That's what I think as well. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Then we deal with whoever gets charmed. 
LIAM: I'll stand on the edge from a different angle than Chetney. 
TRAVIS: My suggestion would be melee people or somebody-- 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ashton, Orym, and Chet? 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I will not be as dangerous next time. But that was not fun. Okay. 
SAM: If you're up for it. 
TALIESIN: (uncertain affirmative) 
MARISHA: Yeah, just be on standby with a Resto. 
SAM: I'm ready to restore. 
LIAM: Ladies, be ready to take out or manage any of us who get whammied. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: The plan is to open it-- 
LAURA: You guys are going to jump in the hole right away. 
LIAM: Yes. 
TRAVIS: We open the hole, and we'll jump in midair like "Three Ninjas." 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Uh-huh! Freeze frame! 
LAURA: Just punch whoever you find, right? 
TRAVIS: If you know, you know. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: All right, so who's going in? 
LIAM: We're looking for a Reiloran. 
LAURA: All right, we're backing up. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
SAM: The hitty guys. 
MATT: "Surf Ninjas." 
LAURA: Punch all of them. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
LIAM: Cowabunga, dude. 
LAURA: Because that Exalted will probably be dangerous, too. 
TALIESIN: Knock them all out. 
MARISHA: Okay, so we get the portable hole almost all the way flat. 
MARISHA: Right. 
MARISHA: Then with just-- 
TALIESIN: Count of three. 
MARISHA: -- wait to lay that corner down until the count of three. 
MATT: Okay, and we have Chet, Orym and-- 
ASHLEY: Ashton. 
MATT: -- Ashton, all on the edge. Okay. 
TRAVIS: We're like, one, two, three! We'll jump in the air, and then they flip it open. 
MATT: Okay, so you jump in the air, holding your action. As soon as it opens, you watch as the black cloth mass immediately goes like (whooshing) In an instant, suddenly, it's like someone had pulled the blinds up or something, and you can see the interior of the hole where, staring up at you, its cold, angry eyes, bloodied face, you can see the Willmaster, the Reiloran shark-like eyes looking back up at you as it pulls back its hands. But you're all holding your actions. Each of you get to make your attacks on it. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
TALIESIN: If I were holding, I get two attacks, right? 
TRAVIS: Non-lethal because we need-- 
TALIESIN: Non-lethal, but I get two. 
TRAVIS: -- probably just one. 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to start-- 
LIAM: Just pool cue him. Just billiards, boop! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay, so just attempting to clock on the head. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: Nice and gentle. 
TRAVIS: You could flick him, basically. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm, you know-- 
TRAVIS: With your granite digits. 
TALIESIN: -- rolling because I don't know if I have disadvantage on my attack. 
LAURA: A flick would definitely do it. 
TALIESIN: That's a 27 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
MARISHA: Granite digits? 
TALIESIN: Again, this is nothing. 
MARISHA: What a phrase. 
TALIESIN: I'm doing nothing. That's 18 points of damage. 
MATT: As soon as it looks up at you angrily-- 
TALIESIN: (whistles) 
MATT: -- you watch in slow-mo, the hammer (slow-mo thudding) It just (thumps) rapidly on the ground. The two of you go... (grunting) 
TALIESIN: There's a second one. 
LIAM: Fair play. 
MARISHA: Yeah, where's the kid? Is the kid still out cold? 
MATT: The kid's still unconscious. 
TALIESIN: Okay, is-- 
MARISHA: Great. 
MATT: Or is playing unconscious. You don't know. 
MARISHA: Oh, maybe clock the kid for good measure. 
LIAM: No, because that could kill him. 
TRAVIS: I think we can bind the kid. 
TALIESIN: Is he unconscious or did that do too much? I was trying to be really gentle. 
MATT: No, I mean gentle as it can be. You probably broke something but he's not dying. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: Can I take a second to check the kid and make sure that the kid is still breathing? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Is that medicine? 
MATT: Make a medicine check. 
LIAM: Yeah, okay. 
TALIESIN: I bet it's hard to do this while you can't see. 
LIAM: It's a one, which I will reroll. That is a 12. 
MATT: 12. 
LIAM: No, 14. 
MATT: 14. Kid is still breathing, and you catch the corner of the eye like. (laughter) 
MATT: Closing. 
ASHLEY: He's playing dead. 
MARISHA: Clock the kid! 
TRAVIS: I'm going to go over and hogtie the kid. So I get his wrists and ankles together. Ha! (laughter) 
SAM: 4.3 seconds! (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. The kid does not react to any of it, but you can swear with your passive perception you can hear the faintest bit of soft whimpering. 
SAM: Aw. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Just lay there. It'll be fine. 
MATT: What are you doing with the Willmaster? 
MARISHA: We should hogtie him too. 
SAM: Is the Willmaster unconscious and stable or is currently dying? 
MATT: Well, unconscious and stable because there wasn't an intent of lethal damage. If people continue to pummel onto them, it'll be a different story. 
TALIESIN: I say we get, we get him in the siphon right now. 
SAM: Her. 
TALIESIN: Succeed. Oh, her. 
TRAVIS: A blindfold might help. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
ASHLEY: So she doesn't know what's going on. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: That's a good idea. 
TRAVIS: Hands are one thing, but eyes. 
ASHLEY: Here, I'll throw some ribbon. 
TRAVIS: Ah! Oh, thank you Fearne! (deeply) Why am I talking like that? (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I grab blindfold around his eye, her eye. 
LAURA: Did you turn back into a wolf? 
TRAVIS: I've just been this way, it lasts for an hour. 
LAURA: I thought you changed back into-- 
SAM: He was contemplating turning back, but I don't think he ever did. 
LAURA: But you didn't actually? 
TRAVIS: I actually can like (vocalizing) back and forth. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: Really? 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: All right, so are binding the Willmaster as well? 
TALIESIN: We're binding him and I think we're blindfolding both of them. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Because I don't think the kid should see what we're about to do either. 
LAURA: Can I see the little tether on the kid? Like can I see the red tether going? 
MATT: Do you want to try and concentrate on it? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I only had line and a rope. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: As you step into, you're getting near the kid, you can let your eyes get out of focus a bit and you can indeed see that red tether, brighter than the one that connected you to Fearne. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MATT: But present. 
ASHLEY: The Fearne from-- I mean the, Fearne, fuck, the tether from Imogen to (laughs) the Willmaster's stronger? 
MATT: Not the Willmaster, but the-- 
LAURA: I'm focusing on the Exalted. 
ASHLEY: Oh, the Exalted boy. 
MATT: Yeah, the young Exalted boy. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TRAVIS: This Reiloran has nostrils or something like it, right? 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: So we're going to stuck just a little bit of a muffle in the mouth as well. So ribbon, hogtied both of them, and then just a little. 
MATT: Okay. There is also the third. Now that you get a better closer look at them, the unconscious half-orc. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MATT: Ruby Vanguard figure, the third one that you took as unconscious. 
LIAM: I forgot him. 
LAURA: I forgot. 
MARISHA: Do we have more rope? 
SAM: I might have some. 
TALIESIN: I have more rope. Or we can always just do the easy thing. Is he unconscious? Like against the wall? 
TRAVIS: Oh, that-- 
MATT: He's not moving, yeah. 
TALIESIN: But breathing? 
TALIESIN: Give me a rope! 
SAM: Here's 25 feet of rope. (gagging) 
MATT: (laughs) Oh god! 
TALIESIN: I could have saved us this, but that's okay. 
MARISHA: Are you binding their legs and their arms? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going to do the-- 
MARISHA: Do it? Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Time me! Hiyah! (laughter) 
SAM: 4.1, you beat it! 
TRAVIS: Ooh Nelly, look at the belt buckle! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Why am I using that voice again? (deeply) Fuck! (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's canon. He's just been faking the deep voice this whole time. (laughter) 
MATT: Somehow his voice gets higher when he turns into a werewolf. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) It's part of this form, I swear! (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so all three are hogtied, both the Exaltant boy and the Willmaster have been blindfolded and partially gagged. 
LAURA: Aww, poor kid. 
MATT: The elder's over the by the table whistling quietly like, "You're planning to stay here tonight, or you got other plans?" 
TALIESIN: I think we're going to be out of your hair in a little bit, I promise. You actually probably don't even want to watch any of this. We can just go downstairs. 
MATT: "Appreciate it." 
TALIESIN: Let you know when we're done with this. 
MATT: "Plausible deniability." 
TALIESIN: As much as you need. 
MATT: He hobbles over to the side, sits down, and starts whistling. 
TRAVIS: Hey, Fearne! 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
TRAVIS: Toss me the funnel! 
TALIESIN: Here we go. 
ASHLEY: Okay, wait. 
TRAVIS: What? Fuck, this voice. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: We're sure we're going to do this? 
TALIESIN: It's just 24 hours. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) No, no, no, (normal) it's actually just one minute. We'll remove her magical abilities and give a temporary buff. 
SAM: For 24 hours they'll be removed? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Unless you want to hold it on them for an hour, and then they're destroyed and you get a permanent buff. 
MARISHA: But I think we should at least remove their abilities for that one minute, and then we should interrogate her. 
LIAM: That's quick. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Then maybe take it from there. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Funnel for one minute-- 
TRAVIS: You want to wear it? 
TALIESIN: -- 24 hours. 
LIAM: Wear it to? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Gain a boon? 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
SAM: It's magic stuff though, can you? 
TALIESIN: Anyone can take it. 
SAM: You can take it? 
TRAVIS: Anybody can take it. 
LIAM: Or I could take it. 
TRAVIS: Doesn't say anything. 
ASHLEY: Take it. 
LIAM: I'll take the leg up. 
TRAVIS: I mean, nothing in this card says anything bad will happen or who could take it. 
LIAM: I'll be that guinea pig. I'm a little more concerned about what we're doing after this step, but let's do this step. 
TRAVIS: I get it. I get on and start forcing it on Orym. Cinching it down. 
LAURA: I'm confused what our plan is to do with them after this is done. 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: Yeah, that's the question. 
SAM: Did the elder leave? 
MARISHA: Well. 
MATT: The elder is sitting in his room, but he's just facing away and whistling and-- 
SAM: Okay, I'll go up to the elder. Elder Barthie. If we had, hi, I know it's been-- 
MATT: "Hi." 
SAM: -- wild and wacky stuff tonight. 
MATT: "Yeah, real interesting 15 minutes." 
SAM: We apologize so much. You'll be able to break for commercials soon. (laughter) 
SAM: But before that, if we had-- We don't want to cause more harm than we already have. If we had a prisoner or two, do you guys have like a prison? A place where you could stow someone safely and out of the way for a couple days, or can you strap them to the back of a wuukor and send them off into the desert? 
MATT: "We're a farming village." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: You don't have prisons? 
TRAVIS: Our penitentiaries, slightly underfunded. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: He's got a barn. 
MATT: "The punishments in this region usually involve a brief lashing or a harsh talking to, and then there's anything more severe, then we send them to Kreviris. So the rightful action would honestly probably put them on the caravan that you're looking to go on, which I don't think is going to work out given the circumstances. So I could probably hide them in a storage bin somewhere and feed them on occasion. I'm not used to this sort of thing." 
SAM: Yeah, that could work, that could work. If you have some sort of a corral or something you can lock them up in. 
TALIESIN: That's a problem for-- 
MATT: "Well, I can keep one in the basement for now I suppose, but what happens when I release them? I'm not--" 
MARISHA: Hey, whoa! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
MATT: "I'm an accessory to this if I agree." 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. You're fine. 
MARISHA: We're all getting ahead of ourselves. I agree with what Ashton was saying. 
LIAM: What you think? 
MARISHA: We just need to interview this Willmaster. 
TALIESIN: We'll figure out where we go. 
MARISHA: Then we'll figure out, depending on what she says. If she's like, "Oh, you attacked a Willmaster, that is punishable by death and I will murder you and everyone that you've ever known," then, you know, we'll take it one way, and if she's amicable, then we go another. 
TALIESIN: Let's start this process now. I don't want to deal with if-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got three people down here with three potential magical possibilities. 
LAURA: One time a day, right? 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
LAURA: The siphon can only be used once a day? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: No. 
SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: The person can only use it one time a day. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. If you do it-- 
MATT: You can use it multiple times in a day, but if it's used more than once in a 24 hour period, there's a 20% chance-- 
SAM: It could break forever. 
MATT: -- it'll break forever. 
TALIESIN: So why don't we use it on the big problem and go from there? 
TRAVIS: That sounds safe and boring. 
MATT: Break to the point where it'll have to be fixed again, which was an extensive repair last time. 
TALIESIN: Once. 
LIAM: One time. 
MARISHA: That newly Exalted is looking quite juicy. 
SAM: All right, why don't we-- 
LAURA: He's awake! 
ASHLEY: Exalted or the-- 
LAURA: Can I look down at the kid? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: What's he doing? 
MATT: Well he's hogtied and he's blindfolded and he's gagged. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: So he's not doing much. 
LAURA: Uh-huh, can I see him moving at all? Like is he? 
MATT: Yeah, he's occasionally like. 
LAURA: In his head, I'm going to say: You can hear everything we're saying, right? 
MATT: "I-I can hear. I don't hear anything." 
MARISHA: (whispers) We still have that scroll on us that blocks. Oh, well, this just blocks scrying, right? 
LAURA: Oh yeah, are we speaking to each other in our heads or are we? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: Oh, we've been in our heads this whole time? We haven't been saying it out loud? 
SAM: I've been saying all my verbs to you in our head. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
SAM: But all-- 
TRAVIS: Which makes me switching voices even stranger. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah, I assume that a lot of your conversation right now is telepathic except for when you're talking to the elder or talking about things openly, which means the elder's getting very interesting spaces of all of you quietly looking at each other. (laughter) 
LAURA: Got it, got it, got it. 
MATT: Reacting and doing things, and he's like. But also he works with Reiloran of the Imperium and that's the usual thing a lot of the folks here are used to, you know? Like you heard a little bit of verbal communication is common for most folk who aren't, you know, Reiloran of a certain rank or above, and at a certain point, people just quietly talk through their minds. 
LAURA: Got it. Amazing. 
LIAM: There's a lot of meaningful staring. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I'm normal here! 
MARISHA: Except for Laudna, who is still just as animated in her head speak, so she's like. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We have a-- 
TRAVIS: (deeply) I'm excited for this. I hit Orym in the back towards-- 
SAM: Let's do it. 
TRAVIS: -- the Willmaster. 
LIAM: The funnel has to press against the Willmaster for a minute, that's how it works? 
MATT: You attach the harness. The funnel comes off, in the base of the neck. 
SAM: Where does it attach to on the Willmaster? 
MATT: Someone needs to hold it against the funnel. 
SAM: Like press her face into it or something? 
TRAVIS: I don't know, y'all, just. I'll strongarm the Willmaster's limp body and (thump) lay it up against Orym. 
MATT: As soon as you hold it against the funnel, you watch that arcane flicker begin to build up within the funnel. You feel this odd warmth, but also cold feeling, like an Icy Hot sort of energy that's right at the base of your neck and shoulders. 
LIAM: It's my beef patch. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: All the various tiny little runes begin to light up around the harness once more, and as it does, the weight of the Willmaster begins to vanish and it becomes just held aloft and slowly rotating about two or three inches away from this funnel. 
LAURA: I'm going to push the kid five feet away from it, if I can. 
MATT: (whoosh) (creak) Into one of the chairs. You hear (whimpering). (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh dear. 
MATT: You can't move. Your chest is locked in place, like there is an odd-- As part of this moment, you are currently bound to this process. 
LIAM: Well, it doesn't feel great. 
MATT: As it gets warmer and warmer, time begins to pass, and you watch as energy begins to seep out of parts of the Willmaster's form, which is some sort of magical energy (whoosh) into the funnel, and you begin to feel that sensation. 30 seconds. 40 seconds. 60 seconds. A minute and a half. 
TRAVIS: (grunts) 
SAM: Oh, a half, oh yeah, take it-- 
MATT: You pull away from that point, and you (gasping) feel the strange surge into yourself. You feel like a part of your mind grasps the threads of others' willpower, and a way to pluck at them as you please. Until your next long rest, you can cast Dominate Person once. 
LIAM: Yeah! 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
TRAVIS: Once per--? 
LIAM: Once within this 24-hour period? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT and LAURA: Until your next long rest. 
LIAM: Until my-- But it's not permanent, right? It's temporary. 
MATT: Temporary. 
TRAVIS: After we pull the Willmaster off. 
MATT: Mm-hmm? 
TRAVIS: What does the vest look like? Is there a power down period? Like a cool down, or does it just (energy diminishes)? 
MATT: As you pull it off, you now have control of your body in space, Orym. You watch the runes slowly darken, the energy spiral that comes out of the back of the funnel begins to subside and then it becomes inert. 
TRAVIS: I'll help you with the vest and take it off. 
ASHLEY: What's Willmaster doing? The Willmaster? 
MATT: The Willmaster is currently bound and gagged and not moving. 
TALIESIN: Unconscious, or--? 
MATT: You have them bound and gagged and blindfolded. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're not magical anymore, so you should be able to interrogate mentally, or-- 
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull a gag. How do you feel? 
MATT: "(gasping)" 
TALIESIN: Just so we're clear, don't yell, it'll just make us close this again, and then if something happens to us and we can't open the pocket, you're just going to suffocate, and I genuinely would feel bad about that. That is not the intention. 
MATT: Just gritting its sharp teeth. "(uncomfortable noises) 
TALIESIN: Sorry about that second hit, too, but you know. Taking over someone's body isn't nice, but I think we're even now. 
TRAVIS: That's the most polite barbarian ever. 
MATT: Still ignoring you from under the blindfold. 
SAM: Get in there, get in there. 
MARISHA: I cast Unsettling Presence on them. 
SAM: Oh, they can't see. 
MARISHA: Still makes you get the heebie jeebies. 
MATT: They feel it. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
LIAM: Her goopy audio is horrific. 
MATT: As they're blindfolded, look away, and they're gritting and essentially holding an anatomical position here on the floor that they're tied down, and as soon as you focus on them-- 
MARISHA: I'm going to make my face look gaunt and chunks of my flesh are falling off from my Form of Dread. My eyes turn into empty sockets like a far decayed corpse, and I-- 
MATT: Horrifying. 
MARISHA: Lift up her blindfold, and I say: You're going to answer some questions or else we're going to send you to a place far worse than your grave. Take it from me. 
MATT: Make an intimidation check. 
SAM: Come on, come on! 
ASHLEY: Guidance, Guidance! 
MATT: With advantage. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) That combination of things, yeah. 
MARISHA: (chuckles) That is a 27. (cheering) 
MATT: Okay. The somewhat furrowed, mostly bone brow that sits atop the Willmaster's head softens, and you can see the cartilage pop as the eyes go wider. The gritted teeth turn into a bit of a grimace. 
MARISHA: Don't feel any magic running through your veins, do you? So you best trust me when I give you this warning. But if you answer all of our questions and you're a good little girl, then maybe we can make a deal. Understood? 
MATT: "(grimaces)" 
MARISHA: You start now by answering questions. That was the first one. 
MATT: You see it trying to-- Its expressions shifting. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: "(sharp inhale)" "(frustrated sigh)" 
SAM: It can only communicate telepathically and we took away its powers. 
LAURA: We robbed it of the ability to do that. 
TRAVIS: Well, somebody has telepathic powers. 
MATT: (strained) "I--" 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: Maybe they just don't speak much. 
MATT: You get the sense that this is, it's having to remember how to talk-- 
MARISHA: How to talk. 
MATT: -- with its mouth. "(raspy, forced exclamations) I will talk, yeah." 
MARISHA: Good. 
MATT: "(snarls)" 
MARISHA: I think first and foremost, we would love a little insight into this little plan you dream weavers have. What, what do you aim to do with The One Who Sleeps? 
MATT: "To wake it." 
SAM: Makes sense. 
LAURA: What are you waiting for? 
MATT: You see it contemplating carefully. 
LIAM: Orym speaks and says: Tell us all your secrets. I cast Dominate Person. 
SAM: Oh! 
SAM: Right away. 
LAURA: Just use it! 
LIAM: I don't know what the DC is-- 
LAURA: We have it. 
LIAM: -- because I'm not a wizard. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. The DC would be... I'll say, which is your highest stats, intelligence, charisma, or wisdom? 
LIAM: Intelligence, wisdom, or charisma? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Wisdom. 
MATT: Wisdom. What's your bonus? 
LIAM: Plus three. 
MATT: Plus three. So that'd be eight. Eight plus your proficiency modifier, plus your wisdom modifier. 
LIAM: Okay, eight plus four plus three? 
LAURA: It's really good. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: 15? 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So 15. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: -- on your initiative. Damn! 
MATT: All right. As they're contemplating, they look you in the eyes and the eyes go white as well, like yours once were. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: The jaw goes slack. You've never experienced something like this. You feel like you're in yourself and inside its mind. Its mind isn't open to you. It's not like you can see its personality, but it's almost like you can feel its limbs just beyond yours, like putting on gloves that'll control them, like you can ply and pluck at them. They seem to-- You feel a sense of trust coming from it towards you. 
LIAM: He'll think quickly, what do you intend for Predathos to do? Tell us everything. 
MATT: "Predathos is the heart of our people. Predathos is what has made us into what we are. We are its children and it wants to be awake, it wants to feast. And when the gods are gone, the world, the Blue Promise will be ours." 
LIAM: What do you intend for those who live on the Blue Promise now? 
MATT: "Well, there are not many of us and many of them. Some would like to live in harmony. Others know the nature of violence that others like you carry. We are not all that different. So perhaps we carve a place that is ours, and then we talk." 
LAURA: Why are you waiting for Predathos to awaken before you, before you come over? There's a bridge right now. 
MATT: "So much of the strength of your world lies in the divinity and the power granted by the deities. If they are gone, the playing ground becomes more even." 
MARISHA: You should answer the pretty lady's first question. What are you waiting for? What do you need? What's the final key to releasing Predathos? 
MATT: Dominate Person lasts for one minute. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Oh, no. 
MATT: Your connection fades on the entity. 
SAM: (groans) 
MATT: The eyes come back. "(angry snarl)" You can see there's an immediate look of spite and frustration that comes over their face as they realize that they were forced to speak in this manner. It grits its teeth once more, looking at the two of you. "You'll find out soon enough." 
MARISHA: Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. You see, that was not part of our original plan, our original deal here. We said you would answer all of our questions and then maybe we would make a deal. 
MATT: "What benefit to me is that? My life does not matter." 
MARISHA: Do you know what she is? 
MATT: "You are one of the Exaltants, yes?" 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Then you walk the path as intended. You'll know in time. You want to know, but I'm done talking. These lips are dry and I hate your words in my mouth." 
MARISHA: I honestly can't argue with that. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Should we talk to the boy? 
LAURA: So what do we do with him? 
SAM: Yeah, what do we do with any of them? We can talk to the boy. 
ASHLEY: I feel like he's more reliable. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Has something to live for maybe now. 
TALIESIN: I'm watching. 
TRAVIS: Anybody else got Dominate Person? 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: Best I got is Fast Friends. 
LAURA: Which might work. 
MARISHA: I have a feeling the boy has more to live for. 
LIAM: The boy might just want to talk. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
LAURA: Can we lift him up and out of the hole? Get him away from the-- 
ASHLEY: That's a good idea. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- Willmaster. 
LIAM: Shut the hole temporarily so we can speak in private. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MARISHA: So with this cone-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- there is a cumulative 20% chance each additional use that it breaks. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: 20, 40, 60, yep. 
MARISHA: Is that a d100 roll? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: 20 or under? 
MATT: 20 or under and it breaks. 
LAURA: I don't want to risk that. 
TALIESIN: I got better plans for this thing-- 
LIAM: Not worth it. 
TALIESIN: -- than this kid. 
LAURA: I don't want to risk that. 
TALIESIN: This kid will go down fast, he's not-- 
MARISHA: I know, I just kind of want his juices. (laughter) 
LAURA: Can we pull him out? 
SAM: His youthful juices? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's take him out of the hole. 
LAURA: Can we pull him out? Chet, can you lift him up and out? 
LIAM: Above the table, it's essentially a single spell slot. 
TRAVIS: (tossing boy) (laughs) 
MATT: (toss and crash) 
LAURA: Oh. Poor guy. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Was that really necessary? Also, now he's unconscious again. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to drag him. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: If you kill him, I'm going to be very upset. 
ASHLEY: I'm just going to drag the boy and sit him up. Sorry, they're a little rough. 
MATT: "(whimpering)" 
SAM: We should be nice with this one. 
MARISHA: I'm also, I'm still more or less in my form of dread, so as soon as he opens his eyes-- 
LAURA: I'm going to go kneel in front of him. 
TALIESIN: I'm not out of the hole yet. 
MATT: Is the Willmaster still in the room, or you put the Willmaster back in the hole? 
LAURA: The Willmaster's in the hole. 
TALIESIN: He's in the hole. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Maybe we let Fearne take care of this one because she can be nice. 
LAURA: Oh, sure. 
SAM: Oh, I mean you can, too. 
ASHLEY: So can Imogen. 
TRAVIS: I'll stay down in the hole with the Willmaster and the half orc. 
SAM: As long as we're not too crazy. 
LAURA: I wasn't going to be me. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Ditto. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: You have a mean face on. 
LAURA: I always have a mean face on. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: (gasps) That's not true! 
SAM: I didn't say it, she did! 
ASHLEY: Doh, doh, doh. 
LIAM: Resting witch face. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
SAM: Okay, you do it, you do it. 
MARISHA: I am going to stand behind Fearne though, and be a little intimidating presence behind her. 
LIAM: Just a dead intimidating person. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: 15 feet behind the shadow. 
ASHLEY: Did we blindfold him? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: He's blindfolded. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to start taking the blindfold off. 
MATT: Okay. Now with the blindfold off you see he has shaggy brown hair. As you pull the blindfold off, he's got dark blue eyes, a little bit of that mustache scruff, that first time trying to grow a mustache. You can see the blindfold's a bit soaked with tears, dirt and dust smeared, and as soon as the blindfold opens, you can see him trying to hold his eyes shut. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. 
SAM: Before you guys start-- 
ASHLEY: I'll fix his hair a little bit. 
SAM: Sorry, before you guys start, I'm going to sympathetically bind to both of you, and you too. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm going to, who's talking to him first, you? 
ASHLEY: I think we both are. 
LAURA: Yeah, we're going to talk. 
ASHLEY: Because she might have more to say. 
SAM: I'm going to give, whoever's going to talk to him first, I'm going to give you a d6 to roll a bonded blessing. 
MARISHA: The big thing we're missing, right, is what do you need to release Predathos, right? It's kind of the big piece of the puzzle we're missing. 
SAM: He might not know that. 
MARISHA: He might not. 
LIAM: But worth asking. 
LAURA: Because he just exalted today. 
SAM: Yeah, well, I was-- 
ASHLEY: Take the-- Because you're-- 
MARISHA: But he's also been palling around with the Willmaster, so who knows? He might have heard something. 
LIAM: Might not know it all, but at the very least, what are your higher-ups telling you? 
MARISHA: Yeah, what do you need? What are you waiting for? 
SAM: But also, we know the destination of this caravan. 
LAURA: Caravan, yeah. 
SAM: Is there anything else we need to know about defenses or distance? 
MARISHA: The city? 
SAM: The city. 
LAURA: We know it's a couple days. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: You know? 
SAM: Yeah. Or if we leave them here, I guess we already have an invite to go on the caravan, right, so we don't need anything there. All right. 
LAURA: Honestly, I'm looking for an excuse to keep him alive because-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: At this point, it's more dangerous to keep them alive. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to wipe the tears off his face. 
MATT: "(whimpering)" 
MARISHA: Do you have any type of memory wipe or anything like that? 
SAM: Memory wipe. 
LAURA: In his head: I know this is scary, I'm sorry. 
MATT: "You're not going to kill me, are you?" 
LAURA: You exalted today, didn't you? 
MATT: "I did. It's only happened two times before." 
LAURA: Oh, it's happened to you before? 
MATT: "Just when, recently, moments, emotion, I just kind of can do these strange things." 
LAURA: You're very powerful. 
MATT: "It scares me." 
LAURA: How long have you been here? 
MATT: "Oh, I just got here not but a few days ago." 
LAURA: Really? This Willmaster, Edmuda, did they find you right away or did you get assigned to them? 
MATT: "I was sent here with the caravan to be greeted by them and then brought to the city." 
LAURA: So you're part of the caravan? 
MATT: "I was brought here with it, yes. We all were, we're all new recruits to the Vanguard." 
LAURA: Right. How did they find you on Exandria? Where were you? 
MATT: "Please, please don't kill me." 
LAURA: Honey, I don't want to. 
MARISHA: I make some wispy smokies billow up as I'm behind them. 
MATT: "(choked whimpers)" Make a persuasion or deception check based on however you're going at this, you don't have to tell me. 
LAURA: Okay. 30. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
MATT: (laughs) He goes-- 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "(sighs) I just started having dreams. Like a part of me was, a part of me was being called to Marquet and I worked hard and saved up money and I got ship passage and I found others that were traveling like me. In Ank'Harel I met members of the Ruby Vanguard and they said that I was following my destiny, and they brought me to the Key." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "It was there I met the Reilorans, these strange, wonderful creatures, but the kinship, I can't explain. They said I was to be brought to the Weave Mind for exaltation, that they could teach me how to, how to control this." 
LAURA: Yeah, it's scary. 
MATT: "It is." 
LAURA: I had the same things, the dreams. 
MATT: "You did?" 
LAURA: Yeah. It feels really wonderful to be here, doesn't it, almost like you're finally at home? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LAURA: Yeah. Can you feel him talking to you, too? 
MATT: "Maybe. I'm scared to listen." 
LAURA: Me too. 
MATT: "(sighs)" 
LAURA: Listen, it's all very confusing and we're trying to do the right thing, obviously. I want to get to Predathos as much as-- The One Who Sleeps as much as you do. We were thinking about traveling with the caravan for a while, doing the same thing, but I need to know we're safe. 
MATT: "I... I... I was traveling under the Willmaster's protection." 
LAURA: Right. I'll protect you. What's your name? 
MATT: "My name is Petrov." 
LAURA: Petrov. 
MATT: "Petrov Godo. What's your name?" 
LAURA: Imogen. 
MATT: "Imogen." 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "Imogen what?" 
LAURA: Temult. 
MATT: "Temult." 
LAURA: My mom is here. I'm coming to visit her. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MARISHA: Does it look like the name rings a bell to him? 
MATT: You see he's been searching for something, like a thread that's loose, and when you say Temult, he's like-- 
LAURA: Have you met my mom? 
MATT: "No, but I feel like I've seen her in--" 
LAURA: In your dreams? 
MATT: "When I got here." 
LAURA: What was she doing? 
MATT: "She was telling me to go to join them." 
LAURA: Good. I think the Willmaster was doing something bad. 
MATT: "How so?" 
LAURA: When my mom talks to me in my dreams, she was telling me that Willmaster Edmuda was betraying us. Said we had to do something to stop them. 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
TRAVIS: Come the fuck on! Let's go! Paint that picture! 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. It's not bad, but I'm just-- Oh! 
LIAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: 17 plus nine, so 26. 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. He goes-- 
MARISHA: It's not bad. 
MATT: "Oh. Oh! So you are still of the Vanguard's will?" 
LAURA: Of course! 
MATT: "Oh, I'm so-- Oh, I was so confused." The rest of you are just watching them stare at each other and he's going through this whole range of facial expressions. "(sigh of relief) Oh, okay. Okay, I was afraid that I was in trouble." 
LAURA: Not at all! But-- 
SAM: I'm going to give you another d6. 
LAURA: Oh, thanks. But it's imperative we don't tell anyone what happened here. I don't know how deep this traitorous scheme goes. 
MATT: "What do we tell the caravan? There are other Vanguard traveling with us." 
LAURA: We tell them Willmaster ran away. There was a stampede and they disappeared in the fray. 
MATT: "Okay." 
LAURA: We all saw it. 
MATT: "Okay. Okay." 
LAURA: All right. I'm going to unbind you now. I just wanted to make sure. 
SAM: Imogen. 
MATT: "Okay." 
SAM: What about the other one? 
LIAM: The half orc. 
LAURA: The other guard that was with you down there, in the hole, were they close to Willmaster? 
MATT: "Verdo? No, just another, it's one of the others that I met in Ank'Harel before coming here." 
LAURA: A new recruit? 
MATT: "Yes." 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "He's a bit gruff, but he's not a bad person. Just a bit guarded." 
LAURA: Got it. 
SAM: Harder to convince, probably. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. I'm going to relay everything that we've been talking about to the rest of the group so that you'll know. But I'm not sure what to do with Verdo. 
SAM: Or the Willmaster. 
TALIESIN: Willmaster's getting easier. 
LAURA: Willmaster's got to go. 
SAM: Like as in-- (executes) 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: But we don't kill people, we're the good guys! 
LAURA: Sure, and that's the bad guy, and they are going to tell everyone what we did. 
SAM: Can't we just put them on an animal and send them off into the desert? 
LAURA: No. 
TALIESIN: That's killing someone. 
LAURA: I can send messages miles away. You think they can't either? 
SAM: Not for 24 hours, they can't. 
LAURA: 24 hours is not enough time. We're going to be here for at least three days. 
LIAM: Blow our cover on this whole operation. 
ASHLEY: Well I mean, if we're going to do that, we might as well just suck out all the juices out of-- 
SAM: Juices? 
MARISHA: I agree. 
TALIESIN: We have to find another metaphor for that, because that's really starting to fuck me up. 
ASHLEY: I know, there's got to be a different metaphor. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, Matt, so would that 20%, above the table, would it count if Orym picks up where he left off and went for the full hour long? 
SAM: That would be using it again. 
MARISHA: Hour long sucky suck? 
MATT: That's an interesting question. I'd say if it's the same vessel and the same figure, it would continue the same ritual. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. All right. 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
LAURA: Good to know. 
MATT: Since it is a continuation. 
MARISHA: I understand-- All in our heads. I understand, Fearne, but also even if we try to leave the Willmaster here, that will only implicate Barthie, and the rest of the townspeople. They would face the retribution, not us. 
ASHLEY: There's a part of me that feels weird about using this thing that Ludinus created the way that he intended it, which is to kill people, because then I'm like how are we any better than him? I'm just putting that out there. 
TALIESIN: The kid wouldn't be alive. 
ASHLEY: But I still want to see what happens. (laughter) 
MARISHA: What did you say, Ashton? 
TALIESIN: I said the kid wouldn't be alive. 
LAURA: What kid? 
TALIESIN: The one that-- 
SAM: The other one? 
TALIESIN: The other one, the one that we've been talking to, that you've been talking to. I will also say, you know, if the Willmaster wanted to live, she could've done an awful lot of anything right now to actually defend herself. She has just given herself to something bigger, and that's the end of it. There is no negotiating. 
LIAM: Can I ask a question, Orym thinks to the group. While we're weighing our options here, if we wanted to, can that staff be used to send this kid and his buddy to the Bloody Bridge? Can you use it to teleport people away that aren't us? 
SAM: I don't think that's how it works. 
LIAM: I have no idea. 
LAURA: I mean, it might, but-- 
SAM: It's a teleport spell. 
LAURA: So it might open it up without-- 
SAM: Doesn't it have to go with? 
MATT: You and up to eight willing creatures. 
LAURA: Oh, so yeah. 
LIAM: So you'd have to go. Okay. 
LAURA: Plus, I don't think this kid wants to go anywhere. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: No. Summon against his will. 
SAM: So we're talking about the kid lives, the Willmaster dies a horrible death where we suck out her life force and her magic until she withers away? 
TALIESIN: Or if you prefer-- 
SAM: And this other random innocent person, we're going to slaughter? 
TALIESIN: Well, no. 
LAURA: I don't know! 
TALIESIN: We're going to have a conversation with them. 
LIAM: Yeah, we're taking this a beat at a time. 
TALIESIN: I'll say, we don't have to slowly suck out the power of the Willmaster, we could put her on a beast and let her slowly starve and die being beaten by sands for a few days, if that makes you feel better. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It's the cliff problem, it's not you pushing them off-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, the old ways. 
TALIESIN: -- it's the stop that really does it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: If we're playing that game. Or the Willmaster could decide to have a deal, and the minute they start talking, the minute they decide their life is worth anything-- 
LAURA: The Willmaster had a deal. The Willmaster had a deal and chose to not take the deal. 
TRAVIS: Matt, since I'm sitting down there babysitting our friends, I have the harness still. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Waiting. 
MARISHA: (knowing laughter) 
ASHLEY: He was smirking over there. I knew he was up to something. 
TRAVIS: Having seen it light up and do its thing, not with a fork this time. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Can I use Grim Psychometry on the harness? 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Oh whoa! 
TRAVIS: Thinking if maybe I can figure out how Ludinus might have used it at some point? 
MATT: Go ahead and roll for me. 
LAURA: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Cool. Cool! 
LIAM: Come on! 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: Come on, come on. 
TALIESIN: I go to stop you-- 
LAURA: Get it, Chet! 
TALIESIN: -- and stop once I figure out what the fuck you're doing. 
LIAM: Play the slots. 
TRAVIS: It says advantage on-- 
LIAM: Big win. 
LAURA: (slot machine winning alarm) 
TRAVIS: -- history, but I think that's only certain things, so it's just a straight. 16 plus three, 19. 
MATT: 19. While they're up there having these silent-ish conversations-- 
LAURA: Staring contests. 
LIAM: Silent moral dilemmas. 
MATT: -- you hold-- 
TRAVIS: It is advantage to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching or a location you are present in. 
MATT: Correct, so roll again. 
TRAVIS: Just in case, since I already-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: Okay. As you clutch the harness in your hand, you can see the spaces and the gaps where the arms would come out and the head, you know, emerges. Just the empty vessel, and you blink and then (apparating) in just a brief minute, you can see a figure in there. You pull back and you look around you and you're no longer in the hole. You're in a tower. You're in a chamber. This massive, beautiful arched roof. As you look down towards the harness, it's not there, it's on you. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: You see the robes billowing from your arms. 
LIAM: Oh, the fancy-- 
MATT: You see the chains that pull down from the ceiling and you see the faintly glowing beautiful struggling fey creature, this winged entity of beautiful butterfly wings. These curls of hair that tumble down its back. You see it's an air nymph type of a creature that is just currently bound and held there, and you could see it trying to scream through its binds, but no sound emerges, its eyes fearful. As you see yourself poring through the book, you see a couple of servants running around and asking questions, but you don't hear their words, you're just in this visual vision. Conversation around, you slam the book shut, and you feel a sense of hunger. You approach as the servants pull the chains and hold the figure taut as you turn around and back into it, and feel the runes light up and warm up. You feel the torso begin to vibrate with energy, and you can feel the screams of the creature as it feels its life force being plucked from it. As it does, like a charlie horsed muscle, you can feel this lump at the base of the neck where the funnel is mixed with the skin, and you feel it thrum with the promise of power. As that silent scream echoes and bounces through your mind, (gasps) you come back to the inside of the hole, clutching it in your hands. 
SAM: You would have the power. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: We already knew that Ludinus was obsessed with fey. 
TRAVIS: It did break at one point, though. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: No matter what we decide to do though, lawmaster is not-- 
LIAM: Willmaster. 
SAM: Willmaster. 
TALIESIN: Willmaster. Wow, I'm just, I know where I am right now. 
MATT: (laughs) It's okay. 
TALIESIN: Wrong game. They're not going to live through this. One way or another. It doesn't have to be one way, but, and honestly, I think that's up to Orym in the end. 
SAM: Well, should we at least talk to the other fella? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Sure. 
ASHLEY: What's going on over there? What are you thinking? 
TRAVIS: I want to make sure it's not calling out to him when we use it. 
LAURA: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: It's been broken, right? We fixed it, but we don't know what any of that stuff means. I just don't want using it to be like, (echoing ping). 
SAM: Well, he didn't invent it, did he? 
LAURA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yes, he did. 
SAM: From scratch? 
ASHLEY: Wasn't it in the notebooks? That he drew it out? 
MATT: You saw the designs in some of the tomes you recovered. 
TRAVIS: Can I take out the monocle? 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Sitting down here all by my lonesome wishing I could eat me some half-orc, and can I-- 
TALIESIN: I'm sitting down here with you. 
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you. Not by my lonesome. 
LAURA: Oh, I thought you were up there with us. 
TALIESIN: No, I'm sitting down as a double, checking because-- 
TRAVIS: He's just hopping in and out. 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I-- 
ASHLEY: Feet over the-- 
TALIESIN: -- said I was staying down there so there's two pair of eyes on him. 
TRAVIS: They can easily split-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- audiences. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Can I use See Invisibility and see if anything's going on with this? I mean, it's dormant now, but. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, you put the lens up, and as you glance through, you don't see anything revealed. There's nothing invisible around its form or nature that you can tell. 
TALIESIN: While it's on next time. 
TRAVIS: Anything? I'll look at the Willmaster and the half-orc folk as well just because I have it on. 
MATT: Yeah, fair enough. No, everything here seems pretty by the book. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Or no, Verdo. 
MARISHA: It's interesting because it broke, and we know that this was basically like one of his prototypes, right? 
TRAVIS: I think so. 
MARISHA: We can assume that he built another one. Not to say that this still won't connect to his Bluetooth. (laughs) Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: All right. I'm going to send Petrov back down into the hole and bring Verdo out. I'm going to let Petrov know I need to ask Verdo some questions and make sure he's not working with Willmaster. 
MATT: "All right, yeah." 
ASHLEY: I thought you were going to say Willmott. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I know. What's just happening? 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "All right." 
LAURA: All right, I'll help Petrov back down to the hole, very kindly. 
MATT: "Thank you. And th-thank you." 
LAURA: Everybody's looking very intently at Petrov. (laughs) 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, you're welcome. 
LAURA: Is Verdo awake or asleep? 
MATT: Verdo is conscious. 
SAM: I will bond with you again and also as my trusted companion, I will give you a Bonded Blessing of another d6. 
LAURA: Oh! All right. Can we get Verdo up and out of the hole? 
MATT: Yep, get Verdo up here. 
TRAVIS: (air whooshes) (thump) 
MATT: (grunts) 
LAURA: Can I soften the blow with Telekinesis? 
MATT: Sure. (grunts) 
LIAM: Hole's open with you in it, right? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: We're not closing up for privacy or anything. 
TRAVIS: No. 
LIAM: All mind talking? 
MARISHA: Jesus. (laughter) 
LAURA: It's just the way he did it, too, you know what I mean? 
LAURA: Hole's open, you're in it! 
ASHLEY: Hole's open with you in it. 
LIAM: Yep, sorry. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Someone said something-- 
MATT: Sorry, road. (laughs) 
LIAM: -- way worse an hour ago, and I didn't call it out. 
TRAVIS: I don't have answers for you, kiddo. 
LAURA: No, I know. 
MATT: All right, so this half-orc now sits in the middle of the floor. still bound, gagged, and blindfolded. 
LAURA: Anybody else want to take point? Oh, I'll let everybody know. Like I told Petrov. You know what I told Petrov, right? 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, you told us everything. 
LAURA: All right, cool, cool, cool. 
MATT: You don't have to-- 
LAURA: Should I try the same shit on Verdo? 
MARISHA: Well, let's see. No, this is-- 
SAM: Unless you want to try? 
MARISHA: I think, okay, so we know Willmaster's tough and doesn't give a fuck. I think you talking to the kid was the right approach because you have the soft touch, but we know that this guy is not. 
LAURA: Is tougher. 
LIAM: We don't know. The Willmaster will see us dead. 
LAURA: But I do think we should keep up this ruse that the Willmaster was a traitor. 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: That we were in charge of taking them out. 
LIAM: I think because the best case scenario-- 
TRAVIS: Did you guys loot the bodies before they went in the holes for rings, pendants? 
LAURA: We have not looted. 
TALIESIN: No, they're all in here. 
TRAVIS: No, they're all wearing their own stuff. We haven't taken anything. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, they're all down here. 
LIAM: Best case scenario is we convince both of these two to go along in the caravan because if we end up having to ice the new guy, who's all mind talk, then we have to, that might shake what we've got going with Petrov. 
LAURA: Right. 
LIAM: So we want to try to replicate what happened with the last conversation. 
SAM: Or at least convince him to go AWOL and-- 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
LIAM: Yeah, that works, too. 
TALIESIN: What we used to-- I mean, what we used to do with, you know, fuckers like this is you come at them from the negative point, is, you know, we start with the interrogation of were you working with him? Did you know? What did you know about what was going on? 
SAM: Oh, like we're internal affairs? 
TALIESIN: More or less. Sort of like, we know that the Willmaster was fucking corrupt, and we think that he's in on it. 
LIAM: Yeah, your mother's name seemed to hold weight with Petrov. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: So maybe we start with that, lead with that. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: He had an accomplice. Maybe it was him. 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. 
LAURA: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Or he's seen you in his dreams, too. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. Sure. 
TRAVIS: Can we pat down the bodies-- 
TALIESIN: She's got allies, obviously. 
TRAVIS: -- for rings, necklaces, pendants, pat down whatever they got. Just do a inventory check on-- 
MATT: Sure. I'll say amongst the bodies that are there, you get about 163 gold-- 
TRAVIS: (scoffs) I'm rolling. 
MATT: -- of total stuff there. 
TALIESIN: I have five coppers. 
MATT: You find a little bit of jewelry. There's two silver rings and a gold band amongst them as well as on the Shrikes, they have all manner of chains. You can see now that you get a close look, the chains here, metal is rare on their armor. It's mostly bone and other hide-like materials that you don't quite recognize. But the chains that they keep amidst them are metal. So you have these rough-looking, jagged sets of chains. 
LAURA: You're so messy. 
MATT: There are arm blades, any of the other weird-- 
ASHLEY: Such a mess. 
MATT: -- jewelry elements that adorn them. That's all present. You can see a lot of the jewelry is bits of bone along a metal chain and occasionally that same glass, that odd deep blue turquoise glass. 
LAURA: Okay, so Verdo-- 
MATT: Mm. 
LAURA: I'll do the same thing and pull his blindfold off. 
MATT: "(grunts)" 
LAURA: Verdo was it? 
MATT: Yeah. You can see his, a pale green to gray gradient on him, a heavy widow's peak that comes down pretty deep into the forehead. Also pretty youthful, probably in his mid-twenties or so. Not quite as young as Petrov by any means, but still in that youthful phase. Hair's a bit curly, ends just past the ears and has some buoyancy to it, through there is a bit of a blood smear across it on one side. Has these two tusks, one that has a band cap over it, looking at you. "(grunts)" 
LAURA: I need to know, you're new to the Vanguard as well. How close were you with Willmaster Edmuda? 
MATT: "They met me at the bridge, but we've traveled and not spoken much. They're just our guide." 
LAURA: I can look into your mind if I need to. You weren't part of their schemes? 
MATT: "What schemes?" 
LAURA: Willmaster Edmuda was going to betray us. 
MATT: "Why?" 
LAURA: Why do they do anything they do? 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LAURA: Okay. Oh, this is-- (singsong murmurs) Okay. 
SAM: 45. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LAURA: 14 plus, wait, nine is 23. 
MATT: 23, okay. He's like, "I don't know anything about that. We were just taken and brought in the caravan. We were supposed to be told more when we arrived at the big city, so I don't know anything about that." 
SAM: I'll give you another d6. 
LAURA: Oh, thanks. 
SAM: I sort of wobble and clutch my head. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, gosh. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Already stressed? 
SAM: Little bit. 
LAURA: I'm glad you're here. I'm glad we get to go see them together. We're going to join the caravan with you, keep you safe. But if you see anything, any traitorous behavior, you come to us and you let us know. We don't deal kindly with those that betray our plans. 
MATT: Make an intimidation check. 
LAURA: Oh no. (laughs) Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Can I give her advantage by standing behind her and (smokey poof) looking spookies? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Self 
SAM: Just by being? 
MATT: Just by being you? 
MARISHA: Still Form of Dread. 
MATT: Here's what I'll say. Not advantage, but you get to roll Intimidation on your end as well. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: We'll take the better of the two. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay, I like that. 
SAM: (cooing) Okay. 
MARISHA: (cooking) Okay. Okay. 22. 
LAURA: Great. 16. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Okay. "Of course, I-- Still figuring things out. Robe's still fresh, though I may need a washing. I got my-- Anyway." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Yes, whatever you need. We're here for the Vanguard." 
LAURA: I am sorry you got caught in the fray. 
MATT: "I guess that's the danger of these times, yes?" 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: "Whatever the Martinet needs for his vision, we are here to help." 
SAM: Do we kill him? 
LAURA: Let us awaken him. 
MATT: "Yes." 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You do not see that same energy tether to this gentleman. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LAURA: This kid's weak. 
LIAM: Ya basic. 
LAURA: Ya basic. (laughs) (laughter) 
MATT: You get the sense that Ruidusborn are rare in general. Exaltants are extremely rare, but a lot of the Vanguard are just people that have joined the cause. 
LAURA: Oh, and he might just be a person? 
MATT: Yeah, the numbers of the Vanguard have grown quite large after all the propaganda movement post the Solstice, and you get the sense that he's one of the standard Vanguard supporters. 
LAURA: Got it. 
MARISHA: Laudna pops into Imogen's head. I would love to know more about what he knows about Ludinus' plan, but don't want to reveal that we don't know. Are you able to push into his mind? Say, you know, we got to make sure you're telling the truth. Just protocol. 
LAURA: Sure. 
LIAM: Also, might be able to get that out of him on the road. 
LAURA: Yeah, but also, I don't think they know very much. 
SAM: Yeah, seems like a grunt. 
LAURA: But I can push in if you think it'd be wise. 
MARISHA: I don't know. Grasping at straws, but-- 
TALIESIN: I think this is a good in. I think just having some friends is a good idea, especially if they're not in too deep and don't know too much. 
LAURA: So don't push in. 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
SAM: I don't think he's going to know anything. 
TALIESIN: Not yet. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Unless, could you do that on the Willmaster before-- (clicks tongue knowingly) 
LAURA: Oh, I could. Yes, I could do that. Let me see what I have. Yeah, I could do it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: So what's the plan? 
MARISHA: Well, I like this story. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Willmaster is a traitor. We can roll with that. 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: Is this kid okay? 
TALIESIN: Let's take both of them with us. 
SAM: We haven't convinced him of anything yet. We just said that the Willmaster is a traitor. 
LAURA: Sure, and we're joining the caravan. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: So we are releasing them. 
LIAM: They seem convinced. 
LAURA: Verdo. 
MATT: "Hmm?" 
LAURA: Do not speak of this to anyone else. I don't know who all on that caravan is a traitor. 
MATT: "Of course." 
LAURA: We'll seek them out, though. 
MATT: "If I hear or see anything, I'll let you know." 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MATT: "Discreetly, of course." 
LAURA: Of course. You and Petrov, I believe, can head back to the caravan. 
MATT: "Very well." 
LAURA: If anyone asks, Willmaster disappeared with the stampede. 
MATT: "Right, right." 
TALIESIN: Do we-- 
ASHLEY: Do you need anybody to go with you? 
MATT: "Maybe." 
TALIESIN: Do we have any healing? 
SAM: A little, yeah. 
TALIESIN: It wouldn't hurt to-- 
MATT: They do look a bit fucked up. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: To butter him up. 
TALIESIN: Take them up a notch might not be a bad idea. 
LIAM: A little honey glazed. 
SAM: Ooh boy, oh boy. 
MATT: They are fairly bloodied and beaten. (laughs) 
SAM: I have one spell-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: -- that I'd like to use on one of them. 
ASHLEY: I can do some. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it might be good-- 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: -- to not send them back looking-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: Like ass? 
MARISHA: Like ass. 
ASHLEY: I-- 
SAM: I'll heal this guy. Cure Wounds, level three. 
MATT: Okay. Level three. Go ahead and roll it up. 3d8 plus your wisdom. 
SAM: 3d8. 
MARISHA: Right before he reaches his hand out to heal him, though, I grab FCG's hand-- 
SAM: (gasps) 
MARISHA: -- and I lean in super close to this guy. 
MATT: "(uncomfortable groan)" 
MARISHA: You're talking to the daughter of Lilian Temult, one of the highest-ranking people in the Vanguard. 
MATT: "All right." 
MARISHA: If you betray her, if you betray us, we'll know. 
MATT: "Okay." 
MARISHA: Then I'll let FCG heal him. 
MATT: All right. (laughs) 
SAM: Here, let me heal your wounds. 
MARISHA: Just one more for good measure. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
SAM: Sweet, sweet child. 
MARISHA: A little bit. 
SAM: 15 points of healing. 
MATT: 15 points of healing. Got it. 
TRAVIS: Let's go, back up. 
TALIESIN: I'm thinking over-- 
ASHLEY: Was that for Petrov or Verdo? 
LAURA: That was for Verdo. 
SAM: Verdo-do. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's a shame they got caught in the stampede. 
ASHLEY: Cure Wounds on Petrov. 
MATT: Petrov? What level? 
TALIESIN: That's why they-- 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: They heard an explosion. 
ASHLEY: Let's see what I got. 
TALIESIN: Then came over and saw cattle running. 
ASHLEY: Let's do 3rd-level. 
MATT: Okay, so 3d8 plus your thing. Go ahead and roll that. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MATT: As you heal both Petrov and Verdo up, their wounds look, they look a little roughed up, but not more than heavy travel would be. They look around and Elder Barthie comes over with this scraggly looking towel, looks like it's made from some sort of a sponge and hands it over and goes, "Don't worry. We'll get you cleaned right up." He starts wiping them down a bit and helps getting them look good and pull on their robes and tuck them in. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: That older paternal figure of a community that's used to trying to make the kids clean up a little better. How much you heal him for? 
ASHLEY: 18 points of healing. 
MATT: 18 points. Okay, great. Okay. (Petrov) "All righty. We'll return to the caravan then." 
LAURA: Yeah, we'll see you all at first light. 
MATT: "First light, okay." 
ASHLEY: I'm going to say in everybody's heads: Should we send them alone? Should I go with them? 
TALIESIN: I think they're fine. 
LAURA: What do you think? 
TALIESIN: I think-- 
SAM: We go with them to get a look at where the caravan is, I guess. 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Let us know if anything's weird. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'll go with them. 
SAM: Do you need a second with you? 
TALIESIN: But if we can't trust them alone-- 
ASHLEY: No, I got it. Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- we can't trust them, period. 
SAM: You got it? 
ASHLEY: I'll go with them. 
SAM: Maybe I should go with Fearne. 
ASHLEY: It's fine. 
SAM: Just in case something goes wrong. Also, I think they're going to kill the Willmaster, and I don't want to be here for that. 
ASHLEY: I don't want to be here for that either, you know what I mean? I'm curious, but-- 
SAM: I'm going to come with you. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Okay, so the two of you are coming to escort. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. All right. So, you take the two boys, and they lead you out of the chamber. You come back to the-- 
ASHLEY: Come on, boys. 
MATT: -- the exterior of this, and you can still see there's the ruined gate-- 
LAURA: Come on, boys. 
MATT: -- off to the side, the chaos of the stampede, the crumbled stone ramp that you had crafted previously, and you can see some of the lanterns out. A lot of the folks have come out, just like curious folks do to check in on the commotion. While the energy has died down a little bit, you can see a lot of the farmers are out in the corner talking to each other, arms crossed and pointing things out and looking in the area. It's definitely some of the more interesting news that has struck this comparatively remote portion of the surface cultures here. You begin to walk back towards the southern side of it, and you can see there are other Reiloran guard wearing the signature Imperium armor. The Kreviris Imperium gathering towards about seven carts, heavy carts, some covered, actually enclosed, and some that look like they just have a heavy material drawn over them. You can see a lot of the folks setting up tents on the outside of it, and there's definitely commotion and conversation. Actually-- 
SAM: I don't like these rolls. 
ASHLEY: You're better at deception. 
TRAVIS: I love these rolls. 
SAM: What are these rolls? 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I don't like these rolls. 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
LAURA: (anxious squeak) 
SAM: Us? Both of us? 
MATT: No, just Fearne. 
LAURA: Oh god, what if Otohan's here already? 
TALIESIN: We checked the ball not long ago. 
LIAM: Oh no. 
MARISHA: I did check the ball not too long ago. 
SAM: Yes, she did. 
LAURA: O-do-han. 
LIAM: O-do-han. 
TRAVIS: That thing's only a thousand-- 
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural one. 
MATT: A natural one. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Fuck! 
MATT: You walk up with them, and you can see the conversation happening. There's a couple other Vanguard figures here that are in mid-conversation. As the two children and you arrive amongst them-- 
ASHLEY: I'm trying to keep covered a little bit. 
MATT: I understand. One of the Vanguard figures goes, "Ah! Right, so there's two of them. The others we're still looking for, but we haven't seen anyone like that." And-- 
SAM: Are they pointing at us? 
MATT: Pointing at the two boys as they're approaching. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: The other voice goes, "Ah, well, I will keep my eyes for them closely." A voice that you both recognize. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: As you see talking to the two of them, the crimson cloak that runs off the shoulders and the tightened curls of gray of Otohan Thull-- 
LAURA: Shit, shit, shit, shit! 
ASHLEY: Why-- 
MATT: -- is standing but 15 feet from the both of you. 
MARISHA: Fucking shit! 
LAURA: Shit, shit, shit, shit! 
MARISHA: The fucking scry ball, I-- 
MATT: And that's where we're going to take a break. (screaming) 
TRAVIS: Fuck! 
SAM: At least we know. 
LIAM: This shit is serious! 
MARISHA: At least you know. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MARISHA: At least you know. 
TALIESIN: I just want a nap. 
MARISHA: Goddamn it! 
TRAVIS: ♪ Hope you got your backup ready ♪ 
SAM: My backup? I have one spell slot left. (laughter) 
MARISHA: No, we can't fight her again! 
TALIESIN: Not right now. 
LIAM: Not right now. 
MATT: So we'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll see you shortly. 
LIAM: Oh, we're still rolling?

(creepy music) NARRATOR 3: Phineas Thatch is falling. NARRATOR 1: Bodies tumble around him in a brilliant void of clouds, plummeting through thin air, surrounded by shimmering rain. NARRATOR 2: Mica fragments like gleaming razors scratch and cut abrading his skin, scouring his lungs. He's probably about to die, but strangely, it's situations like this where he tends to feel the most calm. His life has never really belonged to him anyway. NARRATOR 3: The Cosmos's interminable gravity is pulling him down, down, down, plummeting through space, through the yawning void that is the Un. NARRATOR 1: Everything is falling to pieces around him, but he feels a rare certainty in this moment. No one else is going to tell him if this choice was right or wrong, but he thinks he can live with that. For a few more moments at least. NARRATOR 2: He cannot survive a fall like this through open air for long. NARRATOR 3: More on that later, Phineas isn't falling quite yet. NARRATOR 1: In fact, very much the opposite. NARRATOR 2: Surely the two things aren't related. Whoever said that, things that go up must come down. NARRATOR 3: Because right now it's all about going up.

LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. Roll an Investigation if you want, it's basically perfect. Oooh, so comfy cozy. Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself. Can you put donuts in this? Only one way to find out. Look at this. Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here. I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. This is a lot of stuff, you guys. We have so many cool things right now. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. (adventurous music) 
TALIESIN: Our radiant order is bound to a sacred mission: Reduce, contain, and eliminate bleed. For those that attempt to harness its chaotic power, great danger awaits. When caught in the crossfire of such phenomena, one cannot be held to account for the scars they are burdened with. Though, time is a fleeting luxury when a circle is knowingly assembled outside the parameters of our belief. A grim demise awaits those who leverage the powers of magickal bleed. The Circle of Tide & Bone. Assignment Number 39-26: Candles in the Dark.
MARISHA: Hey, Critters, it's me, Marisha Ray. I had exactly a minute and a half of free time today, so I thought I'd make a little unboxing video for y'all unpacking everything you get with a Twitch subscription to Critical Role. (bright music) (noises of struggle) Okay. (clicking) Safety third. (clicking) (ethereal voices laughing) What the fuck was that? (excited noises) So the first thing we've got here is our live and professionally moderated chat. Twitch is the only place that you can actually get this. You know, it's a little strange to hold because it's an amorphous concept, but honestly, you can't deny this craftsmanship. It's really well made, and-- Ah! Oh, you can post links in this, too! That's really cool, so yeah. Put that in your chat and click it. Oh yeah, this is cool. This is the ability to watch all of Critical Role's VODs immediately after the live broadcast ends and before they're uploaded to YouTube. Oh, it smells like... ranch? Oh wait. Oh, no, that's me. I had ranch on my salad earlier. Yeah, this smells like nothing. Oh, oh, here we have (grunts) gift subscriptions, which you can either give to a fellow Critter by name or at random using a fancy Twitch algorithm. You can give away a lot of subs with this, which I guess is why it's so heavy for something that's technically non-tangible with a value that's deeply subjective to the consumer. Oh, sick, yeah, I'm so excited to show y'all this part. With a Twitch subscription to Critical Role, you can use all of our incredible custom emotes in chat. We have so many emotes in here. Let's see, we have, oh, Art Dad, super cool. We got Ashley Hype, fun one. Oh, look at Trinket here, he's so-- Oh, oh god. (clattering and crashing) Oh god. (glass breaking) Uh, uh, ah! Broom, broom. Hang on, I can fix this. I can fix this. I'm fixing it! Jerry! Oh god, okay. I'm sorry, Trinket. (machine whirring) Yeah, that'll work. (gasping) I need more glue, this is not going to be enough. (tape stretching) Don't tell Rachel, okay? Okay, please nobody-- (crashing) (clattering) Schapiro, will you cut all this out? (electronic buzzing)

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, here in the shadowed mid evening across the red moon Ruidus in the Razora outpost, Fresh Cut Grass and Fearne-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs anxiously) 
ASHLEY: What? 
MATT: -- dressed in the garb of the Ruby Vanguard after the chaos that ensued about an hour or so ago in the middle of this village, you walked two youthful recruits of the Vanguard, of your allegiance to them and sent them to return to the caravan and escorted them. Upon arrival at the outskirts of the caravan's current place on the southern edge of this locale, you heard a familiar voice. Now, not but a few feet away from you, do you see Otohan Thull, the Legend of the Peaks-- 
LAURA: 15 feet. 15 feet. 
MATT: -- conversing with a couple other members of the Vanguard, as they refer to the two compatriots that you just brought to the caravan. What do you do? 
SAM: Okay, before we "what do we do" this, can you just describe-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) "What do we do." 
SAM: Are we near structures? Are we in the open? Are we on a hill? Are there trees? There's no trees. 
TRAVIS: Use your paintbrush. 
SAM: How many people are around? 
MATT: There aren't trees, but there are bundles of that cultivated-- 
ASHLEY: Caravans. 
MATT: -- red moss-like growth that has been brought to feed both the locals and a lot of the livestock and such. You can see these large bundles and you can't tell if they're just piles of it or where its source is growing in these large masses. There's-- 
SAM: Like hay bale size? 
MATT: Like 15 feet tall piles of them. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: There's two of them to, actually, it'd be to the right of where you are. There's one a little to the back. You can see there's multiple carts and caravans on wheels that are all set up and aligned with tents being constructed on the side so the encampment can set up at a space that's not built to take this many passengers. There isn't an inn in the village or anything. There are some huts and abodes of local villagers about 20, 25 feet in any direction. There are some fence lines for other areas where beasts are being kept for the night, about 30-ish feet to each side of you as you were walking down the center of the street with them towards the caravan. Would you like me to show you a layout? 
SAM: Oh, yes! 
LAURA: (stressed scream) 
SAM: Yes, we would. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I don't know if this is an encounter but-- 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
SAM: First encounter on the table by Bells Hells. Now you can own your own brumestone-embedded hovering horror. Order your Shade Mother today at wizkids.io/shademother. 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
MARISHA: The Shade Mother! 
SAM: So oh boy! 
MARISHA: Wow, throwback. 
MATT: This is an approximation. 
LIAM: Still got my damn robot. 
SAM: Wait, an approximation? This isn't to scale? 
MATT: (laughs) So the two of you-- 
LAURA: Oh no! 
LIAM: Beep boop beep beep beep. 
LAURA: No, no, don't be that far. 
MATT: Right about there. 
TALIESIN: Wearing cloaks. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I look so big. 
MATT: These shifted a little bit. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I look so big. 
TALIESIN: Wearing cloaks. 
LAURA: Does this figurine made me look big? 
TRAVIS: What's it say? 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: It's doing a countdown. 
TALIESIN: "Flask reveal in 2" 
MATT: The-- 
LIAM: It's a prolonged bit. 
MATT: -- figures that you have been walking with approach here. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: You can see there are-- 
TALIESIN: We're so fucked. 
LIAM: No, they're fucked. We're all right. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh, those are the boys. 
LAURA: You have telepathic connection. 
LIAM: The boys, the boys! 
MATT: These are your other-- 
ASHLEY: Still? 
SAM: ♪ Boys my boys ♪ 
ASHLEY: Even how far away? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Let's hear it for the boys ♪ 
MATT: Vanguard members here. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
LIAM: Immortalized. 
MATT: Otohan Thull, about 15 feet from you. 
LAURA: (groans) 
LIAM: Wow! 
TRAVIS: Look how passive she looks, though. 
LIAM: Wow! 
SAM: She's running that way. Look, her cape is blowing because she's running. 
LIAM: Wow, she is focused on that. 
ASHLEY: Is she paying attention? Does she see us? 
SAM: Yeah, that's the next question. 
LAURA: He just said that they pointed towards the boys. 
MATT: Towards the boys. So she's looking, she's about to turn in your direction. You recognize her as they're having this conversation. So you have a moment to do something before this all transpires. 
ASHLEY: I forgot my purse. I'll say to the boys, be right back. 
SAM: Oh. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No? 
SAM: You're just going to turn around? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to fucking 180 and turn around and try to go around that red floof, the bush, right? What are you doing? 
TRAVIS: At a normal walking speed? 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Or hurriedly? 
SAM: Yeah, you do you. 
ASHLEY: What are you doing, FCG? 
SAM: I will, hearing her say that, I'll say-- Me, too, and as I say that, I'm going to cast Misty Step and I bamf behind that. 
MARISHA: Yes, sir. 
MATT: Behind here? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to Homer Simpson into that thing. (laughter) 
MATT: You just-- (vibrating whoosh) Okay. So you-- (poof) You turn around and start walking away. Are you-- 
LAURA: It doesn't look like a tongue. 
LIAM: Stop, stop that. 
MATT: Are you trying to-- 
LAURA: It does not look like a tongue. 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: Put it away. 
LAURA: It's really-- 
TRAVIS: Listen, in times of great need or dire-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You need your emotional support tongue. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Flick the tongue. 
LIAM: Really, the only winners-- 
MATT: So you say this-- 
LIAM: -- are the podcast listeners. 
MATT: -- you turn around and start walking away. Are you just playing it nonchalantly? Are you trying to get into the shadow? 
ASHLEY: We're trying to get in the shadow nonchalantly. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. I am. 
MARISHA: You are a seven-foot tall-- 
ASHLEY: Correct. 
MARISHA: -- curvy-- 
TRAVIS: Goat woman. 
MATT: -- deer goat woman. 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: I'm trying to not walk like me and not make it-- 
SAM: Oh, how are you going to walk, then? 
ASHLEY: Just really flat and straight. 
MATT: Make a deception check for me. 
LIAM: Oh damn. 
SAM: Important roll. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Do you want to roll on the tongue? 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Do you want to roll on the tongue? 
LAURA: No! 
SAM: You can drop it down there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: If it's a one-- 
TALIESIN: You have to roll those-- 
TRAVIS: Oh oh! 
LAURA: It's stuck. 
LIAM: That's the dumbest thing. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's stuck up in there. 
MATT: That's what he does. 
LIAM: (groans) 
TALIESIN: It's going to choke on the die. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: The tongue provides. 
ASHLEY: Right. (laughter) 
SAM: Don't listen to them. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay, deception, you said? 
MATT: Deception. 
ASHLEY: 22. 
MATT: 22. 
ASHLEY: ("inconspicuous" hums) 
LAURA: Don't you have a d6 from earlier? 
ASHLEY: Can I Guide myself? I can't Guide myself because that'd be-- 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: Don't you have a d20? 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: The results-- 
MATT: A voice rings out. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
LAURA: (knocks) 
MATT: "You, there." 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
MATT: "I want to ask you some questions," you hear behind you. What are you doing? 
MARISHA: Keep walking. She could be talking to the boys! 
ASHLEY: I'm just going to keep walking. I'm just going to keep walking around the bush. 
SAM: Oh, she's going to keep running? 
MATT: Going to keep walking? 
ASHLEY: Because I don't think she's talking to me. I'm going to pretend I don't even hear her. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. Oblivious, sure. 
ASHLEY: Oblivious to it. 
MATT: What are you doing? You hear this-- 
ASHLEY: I got 35 feet. 
SAM: What am I doing? I don't have anything to do. I have one spell slot. I've got to save it for in case something shitty happens. 
MATT: Are you going to go anywhere? 
SAM: There's a fence line there? 
MATT: Yes. 
ASHLEY: We still have cloud. 
LAURA: No, but that takes a minute! 
ASHLEY: Fuck! 
LAURA: You think Otohan can't walk over there in a minute? 
SAM: Still keeping the bush between me and Otohan. I'm going to just continue on to that fence. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: And get as far away as-- The way that we came. 
MATT: Yeah. Over here. 
SAM: Yeah and try to get as far-- 
TALIESIN: Stay out of that eye line. 
SAM: Far that way. 
LIAM: Oh no, Letters. 
SAM: Shit, you just broke me. 
LIAM: Has to go to the hospital. 
MATT: I did. I'll fix him later. 
LAURA: Oh no, it's a sign. 
MATT: (laughs) You just keep walking? 
SAM: If I can try to make eye contact-- 
ASHLEY: Just keep going, just keep going, just keep going. 
SAM: She's just looking like she's walking, so I'm just going to walk with her, I guess. 
MATT: Okay. You both wheel up alongside Fearne. (gentle thump) She falls out of the air, having leapt over both of you and-- (gentle thump) 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
LIAM: Oh, what's right? 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
ASHLEY: Where's she at? 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: Right in front of you. 
SAM: In front of us now. 
MATT: She is now-- 
LIAM: She just wire work-- 
MATT: -- here. 
LIAM: -- leaped in front of you. 
SAM: What if we just keep walking and pretend like we didn't see her? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: She just General Zod-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: -- hopped over that bush. 
MATT: You both continue to walk. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: And the first thing that stops you is the sharp pain at your neck. As you realize she's-- (blade extends) Held both blades out to each of your throats. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: "Please-- Sit a moment." 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. What are you doing here? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Otohan? 
TRAVIS: Oh, you know her? 
ASHLEY: That's your name. 
MATT: "We both are-- Extremely familiar." 
ASHLEY: You are familiar to me, too, and I can't quite place it. But I have to-- I left something-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Where I was before this. What are you doing here? 
MATT: "I'm looking for some individuals." 
ASHLEY: Oh, who? Can I help? 
MATT: "They were a few Exandrians who were not invited here. Caused a ruckus." 
ASHLEY: Shit. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Do you know anything? 
SAM: I'm sorry? Exandrians? 
ASHLEY: Have you seen any? 
SAM: The Dreamers? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, the Dreamers? 
SAM: I don't think so. 
ASHLEY: What do they look like? 
MATT: "They look-- A little bit like you." 
ASHLEY: That's crazy. (laughter) 
SAM: She gets that a lot. She actually looks like a lot of people. 
ASHLEY: I do look like a lot of people. A lot of people are always like, you look like my cousin. 
SAM: Famous performers. 
ASHLEY: You look like my sister's friend. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (echoing whooshes) You see three other shadow versions-- 
LIAM: Oh my gosh! 
MATT: -- of her appear behind each of you. 
LIAM: This is quite the meet-cute. 
ASHLEY: I think we have to-- 
MATT: I'm dividing a space there. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: I'll throw this one there for now until I repair it. 
LIAM: Holy shit. 
SAM: Ah! 
ASHLEY: What? 
SAM: Oh, look at that. 
ASHLEY: I thought that was an animal. (laughter) 
SAM: It's a producer. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I was like, who's in here? 
TRAVIS: That was like something out of "Pan's Labyrinth." 
ASHLEY: I got so excited. Yes, it was! 
MATT: That was great. 
ASHLEY: First I was like, it's not moving like an animal. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It's the same height and it's wearing clothes. Okay. 
LAURA: It's wearing clothes. 
SAM: There's no need for any violence. We're not going to fight you. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no. No. 
SAM: We came to deliver a message to you. 
ASHLEY: Yes, we did. 
SAM: The one that you seem so keen to meet with, Imogen, She wants to talk to you and she sent us to arrange a safe time and date for such a meeting. 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
SAM: Fuck, I don't what I'm saying! 
LAURA: Oh no! (laughter) (laughter) 
SAM: Yeah, that's a 12. 
MATT: "Curious, indeed. And where would Imogen be?" 
SAM: Oh, she's-- 
ASHLEY: Bloody Bridge. By the Bloody Bridge. 
MATT: "Back at the bridge, you say?" 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: If she's still there. She's mentally gifted. She knows many Reilorans. She's related to both Liliana and Lily Temult. (laughter) 
SAM: She will blend in. You'll never find her. She could be anywhere on this whole moon. 
ASHLEY: Anywhere. 
SAM: You need us to find her to bring her to you. 
ASHLEY: Yes, you need to keep us alive to find her. 
MATT: "That's interesting because the whole reason I'm here is because I could feel where she was." 
SAM: Or maybe you thought you could. 
ASHLEY: Maybe it was me you felt because-- 
SAM: Because she's also a Ruidusborn. 
ASHLEY: We know Imogen. You felt her on me. 
MATT: "You are Ruidusborn?" 
LAURA: Oh, fuck. 
ASHLEY: No. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no. I just-- 
MATT: "You're the one he spoke about." 
LAURA: Uh-oh, oh no! 
SAM: Wait, what? 
LAURA: Oh no, no! 
SAM: Okay, we got to get out of here. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: SOP is... 
ASHLEY: Should we just try to poof through the clouds? (laughter) 
MATT: "How wondrous, all these friendly reunions at once. This is a fortuitous day, is it not? Well, I cannot harm you because you're important to everything we're building. You, we can do without." She immediately goes-- 
ASHLEY: No, wait, wait, wait, wait-- 
MATT: -- into a series of strikes on you. You. 
ASHLEY: Can I have a reaction? 
MATT: (laughs) Roll initiative against her. 
ASHLEY: Fuck! Cool. 
SAM: Awesome. (laughs) 
MATT: It's 25 on her. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Rolled a natural 19. 
SAM: I got a five. 
MATT: Great. 
ASHLEY: I got a nine! 
MATT: Okay! So first-- That's not a great roll. So the first attack is going to be an 18. 
SAM: Yeah, sure. Wait, that's my armor class. 
MATT: So it does hit you. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. So you take 13 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: She's going to spend a bit of a Psionic Strike. 
LAURA: A bit of a Psionic Strike? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Psionic. 
LIAM: Just a tad. Just a skosh. 
TRAVIS: Psionic strike! 
MATT: You take an additional-- 
ASHLEY: It's managing stress. 
MATT: -- take an additional seven points of psychic damage and make a strength saving throw for me. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: She's going to freeze you up. 
LAURA: You're so strong. 
TRAVIS: Go with the tongue, yeah. 
LAURA: Your tongue, your tongue. 
LIAM: Burn it, burn it, burn it! 
MARISHA: It does not work. 
SAM: That was a natural one. 
MATT: You are immediately knocked prone and thrown back 10 feet. As she darted in. 
TRAVIS: (boof) Then-- (jumping whoosh) jumps and lands on the other side and is going to take the other two attacks on you-- 
LAURA: Oh no, she's at advantage! 
MATT: While you're prone on the ground, which would be-- That means that one would actually be advantage. 
SAM: No, if I'm prone, it's-- 
LAURA: Oh, it's disadvantage. 
SAM: It's disadvantage. 
MATT: No, not on melee, it's not. 
LAURA: It's ranged attack is. 
MARISHA: Ranged. 
MATT: That's going to be a-- 22 to hit? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. You take-- That's three-- That's 13 points of slashing damage. Plus initial nine points of force damage because you're prone. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Then the last attack on you with advantage is going to be-- That's going to be the same, 22 to hit. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So then you take 15 points of slashing damage plus nine points of force damage because you're prone. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: She just (slashing) does a rapid slice to the center, sends FCG skidding. Before you even blink, she's in the air and landing, strikes twice more with the blade that's still stuck in his chest and is just looking at you. 
ASHLEY: Stop, stop, stop! Remove your blade, please. 
MATT: "Where is she?" 
ASHLEY: In the city of Krev-- Kreviv-- Whatever the fuck the place is called. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Kreviris. 
ASHLEY: Kreviris. She's there. 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
MARISHA: Come on, bish! Come on! 
TRAVIS: I know you're persuasive. That means you're deceptive. 
ASHLEY: Persuasive. I'm not deceptive very much. Come on. 
LAURA: You got this. You got this! 
LIAM: Roll like a killer. 
ASHLEY: Oh! Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MATT: 19. "And what is she doing in Kreviri-- whatever the fuck it's called?" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I can't tell you that, but if you take me with you, I will take you to her. 
MATT: "I think you can tell me that." She's going to take three more attacks on him. 
LIAM: Are the rest of us-- 
MATT: That's your turn. 
LAURA: We have no idea. 
MATT: Have you done anything to react to her on your turn or not? 
SAM: React? Using a reaction? 
MATT: Meaning it's your turn. 
SAM: Oh, it's my turn? 
MATT: You weren't jumping in, so we just kind of paused at her go. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: So now her turn is, I'm going to say, ending on this conversation, because she's immediately taking the impetus on this. But you have not done anything. 
ASHLEY: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. 
LIAM: Even if someone were to peek out the window where we are-- 
ASHLEY: We still have our mental up. 
LIAM: -- we don't have sight lines on this place, right? It's too far away? 
MATT: You'd have to roll a super high perception. 
SAM: We're still mentally connected to them. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: By an infinite range? 
LAURA: Miles. 
MATT: Yeah, in the same realm. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: What are you doing? 
SAM: Then I will spend my action to tell the rest of the group: Otohan has us. Run. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: All right. You can say that quickly, that's a quick thought. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: You can say that and still take an action. 
SAM: Do we-- We can't fight. We can't fight her. (sighs) I could try to get away. 
ASHLEY: We're not going to get away. 
SAM: Just refresh my memory, when she came in front of us, landed from the sky, did she jump? 
LAURA: She just mega-leaped. 
MATT: You didn't see in that moment, but you've seen her leap massive arcs before. 
SAM: Got it. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: So a barrier would not hold her down. 
LIAM: On her murder day, she bounced all over the place. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I don't have anything that can hold her in place, and I don't have anything that can get me out of here. I could try one thing, but she also probably has Counterspell. Have we seen her use Counterspell? 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: I don't think so. We all got that psychic message? That's what just happened? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You did. 
LIAM: With a 26, after hearing that, do I have eyes on this, running to the window? 
MATT: You do not have eyes on this happening. All you know, that vision roll, you can just see what you saw before, which is the caravan, which is the direction they were going. That's all the information you have. 
LIAM: Okay, yeah. So no idea, really. 
MATT: But you saw them leave for the caravan. 
LIAM: Right. 
SAM: She has multiples up? 
MATT: She has three echoes out currently. 
LIAM: How far off is the caravan from the elder's home? 
SAM: Do those work like Jester's duplicates? 
MATT: It's about-- 
SAM: I might hit one of them if I go for her? 
MATT: -- I'd say 200 or so feet. 
LAURA: They can do damage. 
LIAM: Okay. Pretty close. 
LAURA: I don't think it's quite the same. 
TALIESIN: No, they're not duplicates. 
LAURA: No, it's like she creates a secondary person, a third person, a fourth person. 
MATT: Now, what you do recall from the previous fight with her is they can be dismissed and destroyed pretty quickly, but she can bring them back pretty quickly as well. 
MARISHA: She's got that Boba Fett jetpack thing. 
LIAM: (sighs heavily) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You got to bargain. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: It all depends on if she wants us-- 
MATT: What have you got, FCG? 
LIAM: -- to be killed or not. 
SAM: I will-- I have one spell. 
TRAVIS: Surrender. 
SAM: We can't fight. I can't get away. 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: No, we can't fight. 
TALIESIN: Can you do anything to not die? 
LIAM: Do you got Banish? 
SAM: Yeah, I have Banish. That's the only thing I could try. 
TALIESIN: What else are you going to-- 
ASHLEY: Do it. 
TALIESIN: -- fucking do? 
SAM: I will use a 6th-level Banish on her. 
TRAVIS: Big swings, big swings. 
SAM: That's all I got. 
TRAVIS: Big swings. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: You can't Banish yourself? 
MATT: That would be-- 
SAM: I was thinking about that, too. 
MATT: -- a 14. 
LAURA: Because she's legendary. 
MATT: She's going to use a legendary resistance to succeed. 
SAM: (sighs) 
LIAM: (groaning) 
ASHLEY: You can Banish yourself? 
SAM: I'm allowed to target up to three things with Banishment. 
MATT: True. 
SAM: You can't target yourself, can you? Can I target me and Fearne? 
MARISHA: You and Fearne? 
MATT: Hold on! Hold on! 
SAM: Me and Fearne also? 
TRAVIS: That is interesting! 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
LIAM: I don't see why not. 
MARISHA: Why not? 
MATT: "One creature you can see to another plane of existence." 
MARISHA: Do it. 
ASHLEY: It sends you back to the plane you came from. 
SAM: Well, we're on the same plane. 
LAURA: Oh, it's the same plane. Fuck. 
TRAVIS: It holds you there for just a minute. 
MARISHA: But it holds you for a minute. 
MATT: If it's native to the current plane, then you're just sent to a harmless demiplane. I have never considered casting it on yourself. 
TALIESIN: No! This is-- 
MATT: But the rules-- 
TRAVIS: That's like a super Blink. 
LAURA: (gasps) For a minute? You could transform into clouds while you're Banished! 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
SAM: Is that true? Well, we'll see. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Yes, why not? 
SAM: We're crossing streams. 
TALIESIN: Yes, that is absolutely true. 
SAM: So both of us. 
MARISHA: Yeah, this is exactly it. 
MATT: All right, Do you choose to fail the saving throw? 
ASHLEY: Yes! If I feel a pull from FCG, I'll just be like, fuck it, whatever you're going to do. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: I'm down. 
MATT: The minute you begin casting the spell, because it is a verbal, somatic, and material, which, by the way, the material component of this is an item distasteful to the target. 
SAM: To the target? 
MATT: Yeah, now mind you, you can also just use your holy symbol, which is, at this point, I think it would be your coin, unless you had an item on you that you think she would find distasteful. 
LIAM: Is it your dice tower? 
LAURA: Is it your fleshy tongue? 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: I mean, everyone finds-- 
TRAVIS: (tongue-heavy) I cast Banishment. 
SAM: Everyone finds my wooden feet distasteful. (laughter) 
MATT: Fair enough. 
SAM: I'll throw them at her. (laughter) 
MATT: They (smacks) hit her in the face. She pulls the blade up and is about to bring it down, and then suddenly both of you-- (vanish) 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god! 
MATT: -- are finding yourselves drift in this gray space. 
SAM: Together? 
MATT: Yeah, you both got sent to-- 
LIAM: Start cooking, baby. 
ASHLEY: Are we dead? 
LAURA: Start cooking! Start cooking! 
MARISHA: Go, go, go! 
SAM: (straining) 
MARISHA: Clouds, clouds! 
SAM and ASHLEY: (straining) 
MATT: Holy fuck. Okay. 
TALIESIN: What the fuck? 
MATT: So both of you are now floating in this ether, and you can see little stones-- 
MARISHA: This is awesome. 
MATT: -- floating by and cracking into each other. 
LAURA: Guys, should we all turn into clouds? 
MARISHA: Yes! 
MATT: So what are you doing? 
MARISHA: He told us to run. 
LAURA: He told us to run. 
MATT: He told you to run. 
MARISHA: We should at least turn into clouds, and then we can maybe go and see if we can find them and follow them. 
TALIESIN: Tough shit. I'm going to pull the fucking hole off and tie it up. We don't have time to deal. 
MARISHA: Wait, on the baddie? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yep. No fucking time. 
LIAM: The Reiloran's in there. No time. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. 
LAURA: We just cloud it up! 
TALIESIN: Nope, going. 
LAURA: Cloud it up. Are we all clouding? We have to commit. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I tell the elder-- 
LIAM: That is the method with which we kill the Willmaster. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: She shouldn't go to waste. I am going to do Hunger of the Shadow on her. 
MATT: Here's the thing, so know this, you all can talk to each other. You cannot talk them, because-- 
SAM: We're on a different plane of existence. 
MATT: Telepathy is different plane, yeah. So you're doing what? 
MARISHA: Hunger of the Shadow on the Willmaster. 
TALIESIN: Before, I-- 
MATT: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Before the hole closed? 
TALIESIN: Okay, I was-- 
LAURA: Before we go. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you're doing a thing, I'm going to run over to the elder while you're doing your shit. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: We've got to go, y'all. 
MATT: Make your attack roll with advantage, because she's bound. 
LAURA: The minute FCG said it in our head, we start misting. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I run to the elder. Sorry about this. If they ask, I'm going to tap. I give a little thunk to the head, just enough to leave a mark. Sorry, I'm sorry! Fuck! Yeah, I'm going. 
ASHLEY: Just a mark. 
MATT: You do that and he goes, "You're going to have to do it harder than that. You're going to have to knock me out." 
TALIESIN: (punches) 
MATT: (impact) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Sorry! Going! Ah, I hate that! I hate it, I hate it! 
MATT: Chu goes, "See? I knew it was going to bring the bad stuff! Then we're going to go ahead--" (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (deep exhale) That was it. 
MATT: All right, so you all start doing this. 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
SAM: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: What? 
MATT: Roll damage. 
MARISHA: They were already pretty smoked, right? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: They just came back from unconscious. They have one hit point. 
TALIESIN: They're one point. 
MARISHA: 15, 35, 35 damage. Necrotic damage. 
MATT: (slow heartbeat) 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: What? 
LAURA: What did you just do? 
MATT: You hear the creaking of branches. 
SAM: What is it? 
MATT: A shadowed memory of a dead tree crawls past your shoulders as you feel the cold but somehow welcoming presence of Delilah Briarwood fill your spirit as your claw reaches out to grasp the front of the Willmaster. You watch as the entity looks towards you, coming to consciousness just long enough to realize what's happening. For a moment, you almost pity it. But so much stronger than the pity is the hunger. (siphoning) You watch as the deep red, pinkish tones turn to a dull, ashy gray. The eyes go pale, snow blind. The face sinks. 
MARISHA: Right before she retires, I just say: Your power should have been mine and not gone to the halfling! 
MATT: With that look, her body begins to disintegrate into dust and ash. You feel that beat once more, (heartbeat) and you hear the inside of your ear and mind, (Delilah) "Very good. Very, very good, my dear. Now, onto the next." 
MARISHA: It's time to go. 
MATT: All of them are already turning into gas. 
TALIESIN: Grab the hole and go. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. You all take a minute to transform. You both transform just as the Banish spell finishes. You both (apparate) right into place where you were. Here, you can already hear the scattering sounds of different nearby figures chatting and yelling. There's already a search party scattered, and where you stand, two echoes remain locked right where you vanished. The minute you appear, they unleash on you. 
LAURA: I thought you poofed. You were not poofed? 
MATT: They're poofed. 
ASHLEY: We're poofed. 
TRAVIS: Is it one to one? 
MATT: Poof doesn't make you invulnerable. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Wait, what? Who's getting-- 
MATT: You can still get hurt while in a mist form. You just have resistance to physical damage. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Wait, who's attacking? 
LIAM: They're going to be fine. 
SAM: We are getting attacked in cloud form. 
LIAM: These two, Otohan's shadow clones. 
ASHLEY: We bamfed back in from being banished as poofers. 
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. 
LAURA: Delilah took over for a sec. 
ASHLEY: Delilah took over. 
MARISHA and LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, that's going to be a 20 and a 25. 
SAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: You can't fight back. You can't do anything. 
ASHLEY: You can't do anything. 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So you take 16 points of slashing damage reduced to eight because you're-- 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Physical damage. Actually, these are magical weapons. So no, it's full. 16. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: 16 points. 
TALIESIN: Ooh boy! 
MATT: Then you. That's going to be 12 points of slashing damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: What are you both doing? 
MARISHA: Run! 
SAM: I guess we're squid flying away from here. 
ASHLEY: Trying to get up. 
MATT: All right. As soon as you leave the attack range of both of them-- 
SAM: Oh, they get an attack of opportunity. 
ASHLEY: It's okay, that's okay. 
MATT: They can take an opportunity attack. Otohan can use her reaction to attack one of you as if she was in the echo's space. 
TALIESIN: Even if she doesn't know? I guess, yeah. 
MATT: She can sense through the echoes. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Nice bargaining, though. Thanks for looking out. 
MATT: Nice try. You, because you're the one that she's hit he most. She's going to try and get one of you down. 
SAM: Of course. 
MATT: That's going to be an 18 to hit. 
SAM: Yes, hits. 
MATT: It does hit you, okay. That's going to be 14 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: You both rocket up into the air. You have speed of 300 feet-- 
SAM: Oh! Shit! 
MATT: -- in this form. As you both shoot up in the air you see a flash of light and metal. 
LAURA: Oh fuck. 
MATT: You see Otohan leaping after you. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
LAURA: She can see them? She can see them? 
TRAVIS: Dope! 
LAURA: She just fully sees? 
TALIESIN: She knows. 
MATT: You're not invisible in this form. 
LAURA: Yeah, I know! 
ASHLEY: Should we separate? 
MATT: But here's the thing. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: You are both faster than she is in your current forms. 
LAURA: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: You watch as she tries to catch you, she just arcs below-- 
MARISHA: (relieved groan) 
MATT: -- frustratedly. 
SAM: How high did she get? 
MATT: Close to 100 feet. 
SAM: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
TALIESIN: Oh, I hate it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: She's a superhero. 
MATT: As she drops down, and you both coast up into the air, the rest of you, shooting over in the space, you can now see the chaos erupting. You can see a bunch of the lanterns lighting up around. You can see the caravan, and it takes a moment to focus on where your friends are, because they got there before you did. You both wait for the rest to arrive. But from your vantage point, indeed, with the knowledge you have, you can see Otohan standing in the middle looking up as her echoes (snuffing) all dematerialize and she just watches. What are you all doing? 
SAM: Are we all together again? 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We're all clouds. 
LAURA: What the fuck? 
SAM: We can talk to each other mentally, right? 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Where are we going? What are we doing? 
ASHLEY: That was lucky. 
TALIESIN: Head to the fucking-- 
SAM: And unlucky! 
ASHLEY: And unlucky at the same time. 
TALIESIN: Start heading to the city. We make a plan while we're on the move. 
LAURA: She's going to know. 
ASHLEY: Let's go. Let's go. 
LAURA: She's going to follow us to the city. 
SAM: She can see us. 
LIAM: Doesn't matter. Start making distance. 
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter. 
SAM: Why don't we fly off-- 
TALIESIN: We're making distance right now. 
SAM: -- in another direction and circle around? 
ASHLEY: Yes, let's go in another direction. 
TALIESIN: Let's start going that way, though. We're just going, going full speed. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, as far as we can go. 
MARISHA: Maybe we can find the rebels. They mentioned being outside the city somewhere. 
TALIESIN: We are flying. 
MARISHA: Maybe we could just circle the city once we get there. 
ASHLEY: Fluff around and see-- 
MARISHA: Fluff around and find out. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: We need to rest, so let's beeline away from here, go as far as we can-- 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
LIAM: -- and find somewhere safe to land and pass out. 
TALIESIN: Or at least somewhere slightly off the road. 
LIAM: Road? What road? 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Fuck it. 
LAURA: She's going to trail me? 
SAM: No, but you've got the thing on. 
LAURA: Then how come she said she could sense me? Is it because I pinged? 
SAM: Or maybe she was lying. 
ASHLEY: Maybe it's because she feels you, but she can't exactly find... She would've come straight to you if she could feel you. 
LAURA: That's true. 
SAM: Maybe she felt you because you did something. 
LAURA: Because I connected with-- 
SAM: Because you reached out. Because you did Sending. 
MARISHA: Also, above the table, I was interpreting that that she's like, "No, I can normally sense her, and I can't now." 
MATT: Above the table, she didn't know you were here. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Didn't know where you were. But she knew the general direction that you seemed to be traveling, which leads you to believe that something clued her that you were somewhere in this direction. 
LAURA: Because I chimed in to Predathos, yeah. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TALIESIN: Ah. 
ASHLEY: So maybe... So we just ziggy zaggy and head in another direction. 
LIAM: Serpentine. 
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: But where are we going? 
SAM: Towards the city. 
LAURA: I don't know, we've got to find another-- 
TRAVIS: Towards the city that we named to her? 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Uh-huh. 
SAM: There's only two places on this planet that we would go to. 
TRAVIS: We'll be in between A and B, and we just left A, and we're heading towards B. 
TALIESIN: When we're a little closer to B, we're going to beeline off to something else that looks safe-ish. 
MARISHA: Once again, unless we feel like we've done a pretty decent amount of recon and we should get the fuck out of here. 
LAURA: I know. We could just head back to the Bloody Bridge and go. 
SAM: We haven't accomplished our mission. 
LAURA: But we sort of have. 
TALIESIN: I think we need to make contact with the rebellion. 
MARISHA: We could look for the rebellion. 
TALIESIN: I think we need an ally on this planet. I think finding an ally on this planet is a great idea. Planetoid? 
MARISHA: Barthie said that the rebellion is doing scouting and attacks on the city so that they must be nearby, close enough, they must have hidden encampments within range. 
LIAM: We can't get all the way to the city in cloud form, right? We don't have enough hours to do it. 
MATT: No, no. I mean, you can get most-- 
LAURA: We've got four hours. 
MATT: -- of the way, probably. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We'll go off the beaten path. 
ASHLEY: Can we try to go and search for-- 
TALIESIN: See if we can find somewhere. 
ASHLEY: -- search for a place the rebels-- 
LAURA: Sleep, get as far as we can. 
LIAM: As far as we can, rocky outcrop, rest, and then start looking and then no more check-ins with Sleepy Daddy. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: And that'll keep you off the radar. 
LAURA: That's a really good game. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Sleepy Daddy. 
MATT: For the first hour of travel, now that you are heading into the open territory, somebody want to roll a d20 for me? 
LIAM: It was almost 20! It's a two. 
MATT: That's a two. An hour into your travel, the heavy, billowing familiar sight of a massive dust cloud begins to encompass what little bit of the horizon you can see here in the middle of the evening. As it begins to get close, you are uncertain the safety of maintaining this form and speed in the middle of this storm. What do you wish to do? It's approaching rapidly. 
LAURA: Go to ground or-- 
TALIESIN: Do we see anything? 
LIAM: Are we above soil, sand, dirt, or are we above mountainous region? 
MATT: You've bypassed the mountainous region in the first hour. Now it's cracked open region before you, but you don't have a lot of light to see. 
LIAM: Are there cracks in the ground that I can ascertain with my halfling eyes? That's not that great, that is a-- 
MATT: You do not have advantage because it's dark and it's night. You don't have dark vision, especially with this distance. 
LIAM: I have advantage because of my shield. 
MATT: Correct, which mean it was just a single roll. 
LIAM: Oh, straight roll? Then I'll take the-- So I have disadvantage or straight roll? 
MATT: Just a straight roll, so just reroll now. 
LIAM: Okay, that's 21. 
MATT: 21, you can make out the pathway seems to climb for a bit like a slowly rising plane and there's a shelf drop off and then it seems like it continues on for a little bit at another slow, steady incline, but that's as much as you can see before the storm's going to consume your path. 
LAURA: We can get over to the other side of the shelf. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Take shelter against it. 
TALIESIN: That's a good idea. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: Okay. You all (flutters) coast down into this cliff edge and as you dart down. It is a 40-foot, 50-foot wide cleft in the ground, but you have no idea the depth of it. Even glancing beyond your visual range, it looks like it just continues to go into darkness below. What do you want to do? 
LIAM: Can I go queefing down really fast to see how deep it goes, see if it's safe? I'm in a fast-moving cloud. 
MATT: Sure, yeah. 
LIAM: I'll do that. 
MATT: You dart down and within a matter of a few seconds, you reach the bottom 230 feet below and it looks like it just ends into a fine point. What you do notice are a handful of clusters of bones that are gathered and wedged at the bottom of this crack. Along the way, you do see there are some little clefts in the alcoves, nothing super, there's no cavern that you can see in the immediate vicinity, but there's shelves maybe 10 feet in that you could all-- 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
MATT: -- uncomfortably stand on. 
TALIESIN: How is the wind down here? 
MATT: The wind cuts off here. 
TALIESIN: So maybe we can move through this if we keep a general track. 
MATT: It is-- 
LAURA: Going-- 
TALIESIN: Not vast. 
MATT: Mostly parallel. Sorry, no, perpendicular to the path that you were taking. 
TALIESIN: That we had... 
LIAM: We would be taking a left or a right? 
TALIESIN: Well, since we're going to be moving some direction anyway. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, distance. 
TALIESIN: Let's just make distance. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: That's true. 
TALIESIN: And take our-- 
LAURA: Follow it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- to the left. 
TALIESIN: Until we find something really cozy. 
MARISHA: Always go left. 
LAURA: Always left. 
TALIESIN: Always left. 
TRAVIS: Always to the right. 
MATT: You follow it to the left. 
LIAM: Which is the devil. 
MATT: You follow to the left and you watch as it gets a little bit deeper, a little bit deeper, and then at about 350 or so feet down, begin to hear a new sound. (water gently whooshes) The faint rush of water. 
SAM: Water on the moon? 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: It's built from Exandria. 
SAM: Oh. Let's go. 
LIAM: Yeah, let's have a lookie-loo. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: You come over to this area and you can see there's one part of this massive crack that falls inward and there is a rushing underground river that's scooting by. You only see about 15 or so feet of it exposed where it's coasting past quickly. You're uncertain how wide any cavern below is, but the water surface is reaching where that crack is open. It's only about maybe a foot and a half of give, so that's all you can make out from it. What you do see in the surrounding rock that cracks out from it is spiraling and spreading outward are all these various odd-looking roots and what looks like a handful of small trees that are growing upward. Their branches continuing to split and split and split into the tiny, they look like capillary networks to the point where the branches get impossibly hairlike thin at the end. There are no leaves on them. 
TRAVIS: Take a chisel and I'll go to one of the tips of the capillaries and just-- 
MATT: You're still-- 
TALIESIN: A cloud. 
MATT: -- a cloud. 
TRAVIS: Nope, never mind. Take it back. (laughter) 
MATT: But, yeah, you can continue to look for a surrounding area. Make a perception check for me. Still just a straight roll. 
LIAM: That is a 17. 
MATT: 17? Okay, in this proximity here, you can make some, so you're not too far away, 17's not too bad. About 40 feet above this, there is one opening that's only about four feet wide and about five feet tall, but it looks like it goes deep. 
TALIESIN: (quick flutters) 
LIAM: Horizontal? 
MATT: Sorry, it's four feet wide and about five feet tall. It's an opening in the side of the cliff that goes-- 
SAM: Like a door? 
LAURA: Or like a burrow. 
MATT: A tiny little cave entrance or a little break in the rock. 
TALIESIN: Cheers to that. Check that shit out. 
SAM: Although we have no light source, so. 
MARISHA: We can make light. 
LIAM: As a cloud? 
SAM: Not as a cloud. 
MARISHA: No, we would have to de-cloud. 
SAM: As clouds, do we have darkvision? The ones of us who do have it? 
MATT: The ones of you have it will keep your vision status, I imagine. 
SAM: I'm not one of those people. 
TALIESIN: Who has darkvision? 
SAM: How are we going to stay together if we can't see each other in a dark tunnel? 
LAURA: I know. 
SAM: I guess we can-- 
LAURA: We can all cloud up. 
TALIESIN: We can feel each other. 
SAM: Can we feel? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, because we're tangible enough to be hit, I assume that we're, we have enough-- I assume. 
LIAM: We'll puddle as clouds. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: We all fly in tandem? 
MATT: If you want to. 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: We're going inside each other? 
LAURA: Yeah, all at the same time. 
LIAM: It's just that spot we did with us all in pajamas. (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's true, we could all make a little, grab each other's feet like cave divers do. 
TALIESIN: Does anybody have darkvision or anything, by the way? 
MATT: All those videos end well. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Chet has darkvision, Laudna has darkvision. 
TALIESIN: You both are. 
MARISHA: We both have darkvision. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You can point. 
SAM: Hold onto your cloud feet. (laughter) 
MATT: You can follow each other on a chain pretty closely. Who's leading this charge? You're going in? 
MARISHA: I guess Chet and I. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: So you all enter this interior and it is pretty tight and it continues to stay that about roughly five by five cavern tunnel that continues to carve inward for about 60 or so feet before it opens up into a disc-shaped entryway that's at an angle. The actual ground itself seems to be at an angle. You can make out the texture along the walls are sharp, like there's a bunch of jagged points along the edges here. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, maybe we get out of here. 
TRAVIS: Wait. 
SAM: Because it's sharp rocks? 
MARISHA: What if it's the worm? 
LAURA: Oh yeah, I think-- 
MARISHA: What if we just flew into the worm? 
SAM: Or-- 
LAURA: Like flew into the worm? 
SAM: Or it's the worm's cubby hole? 
TALIESIN: Does it look-- 
LAURA: Or is it like we're in the worm? 
LIAM: Is it obviously, well, I can't see so I'm not even going to ask. 
SAM: Yeah you can-- 
LAURA: We don't know. 
MARISHA: Well, what if we-- What do Chet and I see? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: I'll assist you. 
MARISHA: Ugh, weak sauce, 15 total. 
MATT: 15's not too bad. This isn't a massive cavern. The full disc side to side is about maybe 60 or so feet. It's a little oblong so it's about 70 on the far end and it's about 15 feet tall at its apex in the middle. It has this Frisbee-like shape to it at the side. Looking around, it looks like it's not perpetual, but there are crystalline textures in the walls. It looks like you're almost hitting the center of an oddly-shaped geode. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MARISHA: Okay, so nothing organic, nothing that looks like a petrified worm. 
MATT: You do not recognize anything organic in here at the moment. 
MARISHA: Okay, never mind. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Is there a way out? Are we just in here? Is there anything else going on? I can't see shit. 
TRAVIS: It is rather peculiar. 
TALIESIN: Somebody with eyes say something. 
SAM: There's no objects, it's just-- 
TRAVIS: It seems crystalline in the inside, but we went 230 feet down and now we're inside of a cave. 
LAURA: So if we rest here-- 
SAM: Something lives in here probably. 
TRAVIS: I don't know, I mean maybe, but-- 
LAURA: But if we sleep here, how the fuck are we getting back out? We won't be clouds. 
MARISHA: That is correct. 
TRAVIS: Unless we find a way out, we really should brave it above. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Is there another way out of here, or--? 
MARISHA: Maybe we keep moving along the crevice. 
TRAVIS: Do we see in the cavern any trail of water coming from the roof cavern? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Natural 20. 
SAM and LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: 21. 
MATT: Glancing around and doing a coast over it, there is a moisture to the chamber and it looks like there is a faint gathering pool on the lower slope. Natural 20, total of what on the natural 20? 
TRAVIS: 21. 
MATT: 21, yeah. So what you can tell is it looks like there is water seeping into this room. 
LAURA: It's 20. Give it to him, Matt. 
MATT: I gave him some solid info for being no light source in a fart. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We can trip the water back up, but I mean without a light source it's not really going to matter. 
LIAM: If we go back-- 
TRAVIS: Can we move through cracks, like super, super thin cracks? 
LAURA: Yeah, we can. 
SAM: We can find the crack, we can at least see how big it is. 
LAURA: Yeah, we move through a tiny little one, right? 
TRAVIS: Even a crack's going to have water in it. We're going to displace water. 
LAURA: Through cracks. 
LIAM: We're a mist, we're a mist. Go through an inch hole. 
TRAVIS: Can I try and break off and locate the location or the source of the water coming from the ceiling? 
MATT: If you want to transform into your physical self, you can do that. As a mist, you can't interact with anything. 
MARISHA: I mean we can always just-- 
LAURA: But we can look for cracks and try to get into a crack, right? 
MATT: I'd say with the natural 20, you can see a place where there isn't an overt crack. There's a thin, hair-thin line that's like (dripping). 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's not workable. 
MARISHA: I didn't know, maybe just keep moving. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Did you say there was a back to this Frisbee-shaped area, though? 
LIAM: Or have we dead-ended? 
MARISHA: Does it just keep going, Matt? 
LAURA: I know! I want to know what we found! 
MATT: With a natural 20-- 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: I'll continue because you are scanning the space. The end of the slope where the water pools, it looks like there is a, for the amount of water that's dripping, the surface level continues down below for a small bit of cavern that continues beneath the water surface. 
LAURA: Can we go in water as our little gassy forms? 
MATT: I do not think you can, but you can physically swim, if you want. 
LAURA: Oh, that's true, we could transform and then transform. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: How many more hours we got on these? 
MATT: Right now, after this travel, you'd be at three hours, yeah. 
LAURA: We could try. 
SAM: Two minutes to go see what this thing is. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Who can swim really well? 
TALIESIN: It's constitution, right? 
ASHLEY: I also-- 
SAM: I'm a robot with a wheel. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, it's your constitution mod to hold your breath. 
MATT: Constitution mod, it's one plus your constitution modifier, I think, for how many minutes you can hold your breath. 
SAM: Also, I don't need air. 
LAURA: Yeah, so you'd probably be great. 
MARISHA: I can hold my breath for five minutes because I don't require a lot of oxygen, you see, very slow heart rate. 
MATT: That checks out. 
LIAM: Why is that? 
MARISHA: D-D-Death. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Definitely undeath. Yes. 
ASHLEY: (like Laudna) Death. 
LIAM: Yes. 
SAM: Should we all transform for a second? 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: It should be here now, since we are in a cavern. 
LAURA: Is it sharp, round, or is it just the walls that are jagged? 
MATT: The ground itself is jagged. It's the interior of a geode, so the whole surface of the interior is crystal. 
LAURA: That's so cool, we're in a geode. 
TALIESIN: Okay, let's transform and take a look around, I guess, 
LIAM: In the inner trachea of a sandworm. 
SAM: You going to go swimming? 
MARISHA: Sure. 
LAURA: Does anybody have Light? 
MARISHA: Prestidigitation. 
LAURA: Oh, Dancing Lights, right, I forgot I have light. 
MARISHA: There you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: I'll also turn on my light eyeballs. 
LIAM: ♪ It's been a while ♪ 
MARISHA: That's right. We get light. 
MATT: Okay, so both of you transform back. 
SAM: Yeah, I think all of us. 
MATT: All of you do. Okay, so all of you return and it's a little rough stepping here because it's like stepping across a jagged field. It doesn't hurt you, but it makes it, you have to be careful as you step, but you all are there at the edge of this water surface. Who's going and in what order? 
LAURA: Dancing Light. 
LIAM: We got purple balls from you? 
LAURA: Yeah, I got purple balls. I'm going to send the purple balls underwater. 
SAM: I have Light, too, so-- 
LAURA: I know, but I'm going to send mine underwater. 
SAM: You guys might need some help out here. 
TALIESIN: I think she also wants to see if anything bites. 
LAURA: I just want to see the, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I prepared, just in case, because since we're on the moon and I didn't know all of our different terrains, I prepared Water Breathing. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: You did? 
ASHLEY: I did. 
SAM: Very smart for the moon. 
ASHLEY: Well, I knew there was going to be water here. We saw it. 
LAURA: We did see it. 
SAM: We did? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: You're so smart for-- 
ASHLEY: Well, he's been talking about it and all the different-- 
ASHLEY: Look at her paying attention, I love this. 
ASHLEY: Remember when we-- 
TALIESIN: Holy shit, you've got Water Breathing?! 
ASHLEY: Yes, I do. 
TALIESIN: Holy shit! 
ASHLEY: I mean, I think I prepared it. 
LIAM: Side note here. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Hang on. 
LAURA: Maybe. 
LIAM: We haven't rested in seven years, so I'm going to finally burn my Second Wind to get some hit points back. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LIAM: I'm still hurting. 
MATT: Got it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I got it. 
MATT: Okay, so you cast Water Breathing on the troop. 
LAURA: Whew! 
LIAM: So 20. 
TRAVIS: That Banishment was the fucking craziest out. 
MATT: That was fucking-- 
LAURA: You guys would've been dead. 
ASHLEY: We would've been dead. 
TRAVIS: Ever. 
SAM: We would've been captured. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You would've been dead. 
SAM: I would've been dead. 
ASHLEY: I had an idea. 
TRAVIS: Ever. 
ASHLEY: I had an idea. 
SAM: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: But that was better. 
TALIESIN: Save it for later. 
ASHLEY: I had an idea in case it all went to shit. She was going to explode you, basically. 
SAM: That's fine. 
ASHLEY: I was going to kill you. 
MATT: Save it for when we finish. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: That was really, really cool. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Oh god. 
MATT: You all feel the magic pierce your lungs and that warmth of perpetual air billows within your chest as you all submerge with the courtesy of your lights ahead, the pitch black space begins to take on a little bit of an aquatic shimmering shape. The order of this, you said is FCG at the front. 
SAM: Oh, sure. Yeah, yes. 
MATT: Then who else? 
LIAM: I'll go right behind, looking for shit. 
MATT: Okay. Then-- 
ASHLEY: I'll go behind. 
LAURA: Okay. I'll go behind Fearne. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Then I guess I'll go next. 
ASHLEY: I'm prepared because remember on the-- 
MATT: Chetney and Laudna. 
TRAVIS: Caboose. 
SAM: Yeah? 
MATT: Caboose. You got it. 
ASHLEY: The panel, when he was talking about all those underwater worlds. 
SAM: Oh, you're right. 
ASHLEY: I was like, that's going to come up. 
TRAVIS: Before we go in the water, just a sniff of the cave because smells on the moon. 
MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check. 
SAM: Smart. 
LIAM: So we're swimming. We're still psychically connected, correct? 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: I've attached my propellor hand. 
MATT and SAM: (bubbly whirring) 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MATT: Go-go gadget underwater propellor. Great. 
TRAVIS: ♪ ("Inspector Gadget" theme) ♪
MATT: You smell in the space here. 
MARISHA: Do your little wooden feet-- 
MATT: The surface is alien. Here, it's more familiar. 
LIAM: Like a bath toy? 
MATT: That earthy mineral-rich still water smell is very, very strong in here as well as these oddly sweet scents of plant life you don't recognize that wafts in from the occasional air from the exterior. As the wind blows past, you can hear the faint whistle of the storm from the outside. 
TRAVIS: No overt sense of decay or anything like that around? 
MATT: No decay in here, no. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
TRAVIS: In the water. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: (plunging splash) 
SAM: Skadoosh. 
MATT: (smooth splash) You all now begin to swim through, finding your way, pushing through the subterranean water caverns. 
TRAVIS: Sick. 
MATT: Leading on as we go. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Come on. That's good. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Using your lights to filter through. 
SAM: I'm going to start making sonar sounds. 
MATT: Go for it. You wind underneath-- 
SAM: (sonar blips) 
MATT: -- and then it quickly begins to come upward before the water surface meets with an open area. Maybe a foot above you there is an area with air there as well, and the current is moving slightly to the right. 
SAM: Out of my back comes a little periscope. 
TALIESIN: I feel like against the current is the way to go? 
SAM: I'm a yellow submarine. 
MARISHA: You're just-- Aw, that's so cute! 
TALIESIN: What do you think? 
ASHLEY: So we went under? 
MATT: You went under. 
LAURA: We went under and came up? 
MATT: You went under and then came up and you've breached another surface point, and there's a low ceiling, and the water is shifting to your right. 
LAURA: Does it go back underwater or are we-- I mean, is it going to force us back underwater or do we stay above? 
MATT: You don't know yet. You can follow the current this way, follow this way, or go straight. What are you doing? You meet the ceiling and you don't see walls around you yet. 
TALIESIN: I don't know if I want-- Well, I don't know. I kind of want to-- 
TRAVIS: So current would probably go down. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. Probably, yeah. 
SAM: We'll find a way out. 
MARISHA: We know there's a bunch of underwater tunnels and passageways. This could dump us into one. 
TRAVIS: Against the current would suck. 
TALIESIN: Across the current. 
LIAM: This might not matter at all, but when we enter here, if my arm is the current, are we hitting it like this? 
MATT: If your arm is the current, you're hitting it this way. 
LIAM and LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So you could either turn left to go against it-- 
LIAM: So then we can choose to go-- 
MATT: -- or right to go with it. 
LIAM: -- up or down the river. 
MATT: Or fight it across. 
LAURA: Try to go straight across. 
TALIESIN: Fight across is my call because-- 
LAURA: Maybe let's try to fight it across and see where we are. 
TALIESIN: -- going with the current leads to a waterfall. 
MATT: Okay. You continue to swim along. About, I'll say 90 or so feet along the surface way, you eventually see the ceiling come in and begin to force, it would have to force you down below. But you can see the water, the current is lapping up against the edge of the ceiling. 
TALIESIN: All right. It's not like we can't breathe under there. 
TRAVIS: So who's leading us? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's go across. 
LAURA: Oh, right. 
SAM: I guess still me. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. Go. 
SAM: (sonar blips) 
ASHLEY: (sonar blips) 
MATT: With the current or against it? 
TRAVIS: One ping only. 
MATT: Or against it, with it. 
LIAM: So going through it leads to dead end, and it's still ultimately going against-- 
MATT: Yeah, it's still pushing this way. 
LIAM: Okay, so two choices. 
SAM: Follow the current, right? 
LAURA: I think so. 
SAM: We got to go with the flow. 
ASHLEY: Wait, so there's nothing when we went forward? 
LAURA: No, we ran into a wall. 
LIAM: No, dead end. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: The Changebringer-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah! 
SAM: -- tells us to-- 
LAURA: Oh, she doesn't know. She's not here on the moon. 
SAM: Well, she-- Well, easy. She's everywhere. 
LAURA: I'm just saying. Well. 
SAM: But she presents us with paths, and it feels like we're being guided to this one, so let's go with the current. 
ASHLEY: Can I just-- 
TALIESIN: To the waterfall. All right. 
ASHLEY: -- go down a little bit and see if there's anything lower? 
MATT: Into the water? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
LAURA: I'll send a little light. 
SAM: Can you be a dolphin-- 
TRAVIS: (sea monster chomps) 
LAURA: I'm going to send a light ball down with her. 
MATT: The lights go down. Okay. 
MARISHA: I have been waiting for it. 
SAM: You can go upstream. Scout for us. 
LAURA: Conk! 
ASHLEY: Perception. Where's my perception? 19. 
MATT: 19? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Looking below, it looks like the water in this particular chamber is pretty deep below. It goes down, I mean, relatively deep. It goes about 60 or so feet before it reaches the bottom. 
TRAVIS: That's deep. 
LAURA: That's pretty deep for a river. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It's a bullet diving well. 
MATT: Yeah, so. 
TRAVIS: Divers. 
SAM: There's nothing-- 
ASHLEY: Scary. 
SAM: -- that she sees. 
MATT: Not beneath that. You can barely see where the bottom is, but you'd have to swim down there. 
ASHLEY: I come back up because I'm freaked out. It's dark. It's dark. I can't see the bottom, really. 
LAURA: Ooh, I'm going to keep the lights-- 
ASHLEY: I don't like it. 
LAURA: -- down below us, knowing now how deep the water is. That creeps me out. 
MATT: I'd say, Orym, because your passive perception's so high, technically you would hear this. 
LIAM: 31. Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah, you can-- What is it now? 
LIAM: 31. 
MATT: Jesus fucking Christ! 
SAM: Jesus! 
MARISHA: Wow. 
LIAM: Next level I think I'm at 33. 
MATT: Then yeah, what I am I doing? Yeah, you can hear the faintest sound of rushing, splashing water. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LIAM: In the direction of-- 
LAURA: That's a waterfall. It's going to pull us underwater. 
MATT: In the direction that the current's coming from. 
MARISHA: We're about to get flushed. 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: Where it's coming from. 
SAM: A waterfall dumps out there. 
LAURA: Oh, the waterfall just-- Oh, oh! That could be cool! 
SAM: So should we go that way? 
LAURA: Is there a cavern behind the waterfall? 
LIAM: Well no. 
SAM: There could be. 
LAURA: I know, now I'm just-- 
MARISHA: Always look behind the waterfall. 
SAM: You got to look behind the waterfall! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Right. So, the current's going this way. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: You hear it coming from the direction that the current's coming from. 
LIAM: So I'm hearing it crash down. So even if we went that way, we can breathe underwater, it doesn't mean we'd be able to swim up a waterfall. 
SAM: No, but we'd be able to see what it is-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: -- that's making the sound, I guess. 
LAURA: Because it's right there. We might as well just go see that sight. 
LIAM: I'm not leading the way. 
MARISHA: Go. 
LIAM: I relay. 
SAM: Hard to port! (laughs) 
LAURA: I am going to keep the Dancing Lights below us at a depth so that Orym could see if anything is coming up underneath us. 
MATT: Okay. So you go ahead and dive underneath the water. 
LIAM: Following Letters. 
MATT: As you (diving splash) once more into the depths below, swimming through here, fighting against the current. I will say, make an athletics check for me, if you don't mind. 
SAM: Everybody? 
LIAM: Everyone or me? 
MATT: If everyone's going with him. 
SAM: Yeah, we're all going. 
MATT: Yeah. It's a group athletics check since you're fighting the current. 
LAURA: Group athletics check. 
ASHLEY: Cocked. 
LIAM: I'm not very athletic. 
MARISHA: I'm very bad at that. 
ASHLEY: Cocked again. 
LIAM: That's small. 
LAURA: Athletics. 
TRAVIS: 27. 
MARISHA: Five. 
SAM: 15. 
ASHLEY: One. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: 13. 
LIAM: 12. 
SAM: Ugh. 
TALIESIN: 22. 
LAURA: We're a weak-ass group. 
MATT: Okay. You barely fucking nudge. That one almost fucked you. Barely managed to pass. It's not an extreme current. It's just a challenging one. So eventually you all-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm a goat. 
LAURA: It's like me when we went scuba diving, baby. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: You can be a-- 
ASHLEY: Hooves aren't supposed to swim. 
SAM: You can be a dolphin! 
MATT: You push against it, (splashes) breaking out. As you breach the top now, the ceiling is not even in sight. It is somehow, it is now a much further open cavern, and there is about a 15 foot wide waterfall that is (careening water) splashing down about 20 feet from where you are. You can feel the spray of it hitting. 
LIAM: It's pouring out of the ceiling. 
MATT: From what you can see, yeah. It's just-- You can't see the ceiling, though. You don't know where it's coming from. 
TALIESIN: Can we climb it? 
LIAM: You want to send one light up there? 
LAURA: Sure. 
LIAM: This is not "Breath of the Wild." We do not get to shoot up the waterfall. 
MATT: As the-- That'd be pretty great. The light drifts up, and as it does, it follows the water. Along the way you can see this natural cavern that's formed around this massive, odd liver bean shape to it as it comes around. There are structures jutting out of it that look carved, manmade. At the very top, as the orb goes up to the top, you can see what looks like a part of a partially crumbled-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- temple? 
LIAM: Oh. 
MATT: Or a building. 
LAURA: This is part of the city that got sent here. 
MARISHA: 100%. 
LAURA: Holy shit! 
ASHLEY: This is like when we were at Aeor. 
TALIESIN: We're heading the fuck up there. 
MATT: Pretty high perception on you as you glimpse that, and you've seen this before in your travels as well. This is definitely of elven make. 
ASHLEY: Oh! I love it here. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Does it seem-- 
MATT: But it's a very old-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: -- elven make. 
LIAM: Can I get a good look at the architecture and see if it means anything to me? 
MATT: I mean, it's probably about-- The lowest chunk of it's about 80 feet up. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: The one at the apex of the waterfall is roughly 150 feet up. So at this distance, you couldn't make out any detail. 
TALIESIN: Is there anywhere to stand in here or are we kind of fucked at the moment? 
MATT: I'd say you look around. There are, on the edges, some areas that aren't platforms, but you can sit out of the water for a bit and get your knees up. 
MARISHA: I can go up. 
LAURA: Take some rope? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: You take me like a Yoda backpack? 
MARISHA: I rolled a minus three on my last strength check. 
LIAM: Is that a no? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Just, I'll get you. 
LIAM: 80 feet, you said? 
LAURA: But she's going to climb up. 
LIAM: I get you. 
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Spider Climb on myself. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I will climb up. I've got the rope. 
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah, you-- There's no way you can take my hammer up there too, is there? 
MARISHA: I got an Immovable Rod. 
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind. 
MARISHA: I'm already on it. 
TALIESIN: You got your own. No, whatever the fuck. I don't know. 
MARISHA: I will, yeah, climb up the wall. 
TRAVIS: If we need two extra 50 pieces of rope, you know it's in the hole on the dead bodies. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I assume I already got it back when I turned one of them to ash. 
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, you did that. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: So yes, I'm climbing. 
MATT: Okay. So you (arachnoid skitters) up the side, walking along. It's beautiful serene in that sort of moment in time forever frozen, forever locked away. This place, you get the sense, hasn't been seen by eyes in a very long time. 
MARISHA: Fuck, that's cool. 
MATT: Amongst the bursts of crystal that emerge from areas in the cavern, you can see greenery. The first sign of any green growth here. There are unique little sections of garden, enchanted garden as part of these ruins-- 
LAURA: We live here now. 
MARISHA: I should just stay. 
MATT: -- that give off these gentle green and blue glows from these various small, smooth orbs that are attached to it. This area looks like it-- There's no sunlight. There's not a lot of air, but something about the enchantments that remain have maintained the growth in this space. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LAURA: I love it. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
MATT: But it is indeed empty. 
MARISHA: No sign of people or any type of animal life? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: Okay. 18. 
MATT: 18. As you get to the top of the waterfall and get to the temple-like structure, as you approach you can see the tall, open archway that's at an angle. It comes to this very high point, this incredibly gradual point to where it eventually ends in a off-kilter hanging. It looks like a lantern that ends in a dagger point, and it flickers, changing the light occasionally. You do see bones. The remnants of bodies against the walls, almost like they were locked in with the stone. Not scattered or open, but like fossils, humanoid. Just captured and lost to time in whatever moment they were pulled from. 
MARISHA: So I went up this wall. Is there a ledge or something to where we can walk and explore for a little bit? 
MATT: Once you get to the top of the waterfall, there is quite a bit of walkway. You can see it's broken and off-kilter, but there are smoothed large stone flooring arrangements. Looks like you are now entering a section of a building that is just locked here. 
MARISHA: I'll take out the rod, (clicks) fix the rope, and toss it down. 
MATT: (unfurling) The rope hits, and you can all climb to follow suit behind. One by one, you all clamber to the top to meet up with Laudna and take in these same sights, beautiful and sorrowful. Glancing around, this beautiful seed that has grown to the vibrant elvish culture that is known today across Exandria. Prototypical in its simplicity. As you step past the waterfall itself, you can see the rushing river that's pouring through here. You can see the areas where the floor cracked upward to guide the water, but you can walk along the edges at a slight angle, and you can see broken pillars and remnants of benches. Once again, no open bones, but in certain areas of exposed rock, you can see sections of fossilized bone and body. Dozens and dozens of people. 
TRAVIS: I want to touch it. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Now that I'm up here, does any of the architecture tell me more of the where and the what and the when? 
MATT: Roll a history check. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. (groans) Shitty roll. 14. 
SAM: That's pretty good. 
LIAM: 10 plus four. Four plus 10. 
MATT: Your guess is as good as anybody's. All you can make out is the cultural source, but nothing beyond that. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Is there any writing? Any writing on the carving? Carving, writing? 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Just design work. Simple but beautiful, elegant. 
TRAVIS: Can I go over to one of the, I guess, areas of bone and put one hand on the ground and one on the bone and use Grim Psychometry to see a picture of this place? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah, I have to roll for it. 17. 
MATT: 17. You settle in and concentrate. It's like grasping for a fleeting memory that's just beyond your mind. You see images, flashes of a blue sky that goes red. Fear, acceptance, but nothing beyond that. Just feelings and emotions. The rest of it just slips away. Too old or too alien for you to grasp. 
SAM: Mm. 
LIAM: We can take a look around for a minute, but we really shouldn't stay here too long if we don't want to get stuck. 
LAURA: I'll just stay here forever. 
MARISHA: I take out the Treshi scry ball. 
MATT: Nothing. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
TALIESIN: You know, I kind of like it here. Holy shit. 
ASHLEY: It's pretty beautiful. 
MARISHA: Matt, does it seem like we happened to hit a little bubble? Does it keep going all the way through or we're just in a pocket? 
MATT: It keeps going. You're just walking through it now. The river comes from somewhere. 
TRAVIS: Let's keep going. 
TALIESIN: I want to keep going. 
MARISHA: We can always go back into our cloud forms and zip through. 
LIAM: Yeah, we probably have two hours and 40 minutes, two and a half hours. 
TALIESIN: Waste not, want not. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Poofies? 
ASHLEY: I'm down. Poofies? 
SAM: Wait, can't we just walk further or is it a long, long way? 
MARISHA: Just figured, maximize our time. 
TALIESIN: We don't know. 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: Unless you just want to take a little casual stroll. 
SAM: I just don't know how far. We can't see very far in front of us, can we? 
TRAVIS: If we do want to interact-- 
MATT: No, without your light sources-- 
TRAVIS: -- with anything, we'll have to drop down. 
TALIESIN: Also, can we keep our light sources with us if we turn into a cloud or no? 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: It's concentration. 
MARISHA: Let's just take a walk. 
LIAM: Yeah, I don't know if distance serves us. Let's-- 
TALIESIN: Let's take a few minutes. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: We walk! 
MATT: All right. Continuing to snake along what elements of the ground you can step along safely, there are elements of dark, gray rock that jut out in places. Part of the collapse or part of the crunch, I guess you could say, of when this place was folded on itself. You can see at one point, there is this tiny little garden that's surrounded by eight little alabaster little pikes. You can see there's these gorgeous looking red berries that still succulently remain on this bush. To the right of it, you can see this delicate, faintly painted not porcelain, but very, very well crafted doll. 
LAURA: (gawks) 
MATT: It looks like it has elven features, but no nose or mouth, just these gentle eyes and long ears and golden hair that's been affixed to it that curls into a matted cluster. You can see a slightly disheveled blouse-dress attachment element that's wrapped around it. It looks like it was made for a child. 
MARISHA: How big is the doll? 
MATT: Oh, it's about maybe that big. 
LAURA: Aw. 
SAM: These people were very small. 
SAM: Oh! You're-- But-- 
TALIESIN: (scary doll sounds) 
MATT: I need you to-- No. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: You're going to take a doll? 
MARISHA: I love dolls. 
SAM: I know. 
LAURA: It looks like the perfect little haunted doll. 
TALIESIN: Dolls are designed to be loved. 
MARISHA: I know. 
ASHLEY: It's a great doll. 
MARISHA: Look at her little empty eyes and her broken nose. 
TRAVIS: (crushing) 
MARISHA: Ah! (laughter) 
LAURA: What about those berries? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. What's going on with those berries? 
LAURA: Do they look familiar? 
MATT: You can make a nature check. 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: Guidance! 
ASHLEY: Get it. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: 15. 
MATT: 15. You do not recognize these berries. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
SAM: Want me to eat one? I'm immune to poison. 
LAURA: I don't recognize these berries. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, eat one. 
SAM: I guess. 
LIAM: What would that tell us? 
SAM: I'm resistant to poison. 
TALIESIN: I am also resistant to poison. 
MARISHA: Do we still have Heroes' Feast? 
LAURA: Oh yeah, we're all resistant to poison. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Does that mean we're-- 
MATT: You're all immune to poison. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so. I kind of want to. 
SAM: Go for it. 
LAURA: Yeah, but how many are there? How many berries are there? 
MATT: In this tiny little miniature garden? Probably about 40-ish that can be picked off of it. 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
LIAM: Somebody eat one and see if you get X-ray vision. 
SAM: Fearne. 
MARISHA: Fearne just popped it. 
LAURA: Oh! Both of y'all. 
MATT: Pop it. It is delicious. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: My god. 
MATT: Succulent, moist, sweet, but not overtly so. 
ASHLEY: It's so moist. 
MATT: You heal a hit point. 
SAM: Oh, it's a Goodberry! 
MARISHA and LIAM: It's a Goodberry! 
LAURA: It's a Goodberry! 
TALIESIN: Oh my god! 
ASHLEY: It's a Goodberry! 
MATT: It is quite good. 
LAURA: We should take them! 
MARISHA: We should take them. 
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness. 
SAM: But-- 
TALIESIN: Well, we have to-- 
SAM: Isn't this like a final resting place of some sort? 
LAURA: I don't think so. 
TALIESIN: Clearly not of alive-- 
LAURA: I think it's just a garden. 
ASHLEY: They'll probably still grow. 
LIAM: It's just like picking boysenberries. 
SAM: But I mean, the whole place is frozen in time. It's from people who-- 
LIAM: I pluck five Goodberries. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but it'll grow. I'll just pluck them. 
MATT: Okay, now plucking Goodberries, of the 40 you pick, if you want to-- 
TALIESIN: I-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: -- wasn't going to take all of them. 
MATT: How many do you want to take? 
LAURA: Most of them. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Leave some. 
LAURA: Berries regrow. 
LIAM: Leave some. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: If we each took five, that's 35. 
ASHLEY: Wait, these Goodberries are in the middle of this garden? 
MATT: Well, the garden itself is like a few bushes-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: -- surrounded by this. They're clustered together. There's 40 berries that can be picked from it. 40-ish. 
TALIESIN: So how-- This garden and this doll, this garden was sitting in front of what I assume is a wall. Does it seem like it was sitting in front of a structure? Like this was in front of someone's house? 
MATT: It was sitting within a-- Hmm. 
TALIESIN: Or a courtyard? Are we inside some building? I'm trying to get a sense of it. 
MATT: It's hard to tell. 
TALIESIN: I know it's alien. 
MATT: If only because the rock of the cavern is so oppressive. It looks like-- It's interesting. It looks like parts were crushed and parts look like the rock almost merged with it. 
MARISHA: Like the mirror dimension? 
MATT: Kind of. But you can also tell in some places, the way the surrounding geode areas and the things around it-- Make an intelligence check for me. 
SAM: Who? 
MATT: Anybody that would like to. 
TRAVIS: I'm the smartest. 
SAM: I don't know, I'm pretty smart. 
ASHLEY: I will not do that. 
TALIESIN: I want to do this, too. I'm curious. I'm not an idiot. 
LAURA: ♪ I'm pretty dumb ♪ 
MARISHA: That's the most impractical thing. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Eh, no. 
SAM: 14. 
MATT: 14. 
TRAVIS: Dirty 20. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: Dirty 20, okay. 
SAM: I can't find Goodberries. 
LAURA: I can't either. 
SAM: Must be something random. 
MATT: You get the sense of the patterns here. There are areas that feel almost like they're protected, to a certain degree. That's why a lot of this plant life still seems to be alive and kept here without needing all these various means of living. There are areas beyond those boundaries where the rock looks intensely pushed together and you see signs of the faintest veins of glass, like something superheated caused elements of dust, sand, and fine stone to melt. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MARISHA: Glass that's just from where (tectonic smash) it smooshed together. 
ASHLEY: What color? Is it just like regular glass? 
MATT: It's mostly above the ceiling, not in the vicinity area. So you'd have to get closer to look. 
TALIESIN: It's called slag glass, a kind of natural glass. 
MATT: It feels that way, maybe. But are you taking berries? Are you moving on? What are you doing? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: A couple. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Can I keep her? 
LAURA: Of course you can. 
TALIESIN: As long as at some point we are, you know. Yeah, I think so. Cobalt Soul is going to find this shit eventually, anyway, if we all don't die. 
MATT: So these berries do act as the Goodberry spell. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MATT: They last for 24 hours. So they have to be eaten within 24 hours. 
TALIESIN and SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: What do they do? 
MATT: They give you one hit point each. 
TALIESIN: And they taste fucking great. 
ASHLEY: Well, I'm going to pop them. 
LIAM: If you're creating a pie, the pie expires in a day. 
TALIESIN: I think I might have-- 
MATT: It's an action to eat one berry though, so it's like you can't eat 20 in one action. 
MARISHA: To eat one berry? 
MATT: It's one hit point per action. 
LAURA: I'm just going to-- 
TALIESIN: One minute. 
LAURA: Oh, right. Are we taking a short break right now? 
MATT: If you want to. 
LAURA: Oh, well then I'm going to take those back. I didn't eat those berries. 
SAM: We can't take a short rest, that's an hour. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: But we're walking. 
TALIESIN: We're walking. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We don't want to-- This is not where we deal with our other-- 
LAURA: Not here. 
TALIESIN: Not here? No, no, not here, no. 
MATT: Continuing along the path, eventually the stone crush around this ruin begins to fully consume what's exposed. The water trickles, now the source of the water, trickles down a few little steps of a waterfall before vanishing into a massive crack in the wall where it looks like you could try and swim against the now very strong current, which has no head room on it. It's just the spout where the water itself emerges. But the cliff face above it continues to climb with a number of odd little hand holds and outcroppings. 
LAURA: Up and out, probably. 
LIAM: But you said that spigot of water does look, if someone tried to fight up through it, they could get up in there. 
MATT: You could certainly try. 
LIAM: Could you send one of your lights up there? I'm going to stick my head into the flow of water, since I can breathe in it. 
MATT: Okay. So it's going into it this way because it's pouring out of the rock and now it's water falling down and forming this river that pushes down into the waterfall. 
LIAM: I just want to see if I follow Imogen's little purple ball of light up. 
MATT: Okay, make a perception check. I'll say with disadvantage. So it would be just a straight roll for you. 
LIAM: That is a 20 for me. 
MATT: Okay. It looks like the water continues for another 40 or so feet to wherever the source of it continues to pull from. 
LIAM: I'll never make it up that. Okay. 
MARISHA: I mean, I can crawl up there and drop the rope again. 
LIAM: Up through the flow of water? 
MARISHA: Is it cut off? 
LAURA: There's a flow of water and then there's a cliff face that's going up. 
LIAM: Yeah. I wanted to see if there was anything worth pursuing up the actual mouth of water. 
MATT: Interesting point, which you would acknowledge now as you see how this flows. As far as you know, or what you've experienced or seen, there is no rainfall on Ruidus. So this water has to be sourced from somewhere. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: So it's not coming from the surface? 
LIAM: No, it's coming from-- 
LAURA: Where is it coming from? 
LIAM: -- some sort of dimensional pull or-- 
TALIESIN: Big, nice thing. 
SAM: Underwater spring. 
LIAM: Magical-- 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Maybe the same thing that's keeping the plants alive. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Underground-- 
ASHLEY: Is it coming out of the portal? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Maybe it got, a portal got pulled up here or something? 
MARISHA: It's pretty wild. If there's been a portal to Ruidus in the center of the ocean somewhere this whole time. 
TALIESIN: You know, a water-- 
SAM: Should we find it and go through it? 
LAURA: I know, it seems kind of cool. 
SAM: We have a secret backdoor to Ruidus that nobody knows. 
TALIESIN: It would probably just take us to-- 
MARISHA: It would be fucking awesome! 
TALIESIN: -- some sort of water dimension. I think that there's no giant tidal sinkhole. 
TRAVIS: I mean, if it's a water plane, that's not super-- 
MARISHA: Useful. 
SAM: Helpful, no. 
TALIESIN: It's just more water, all the way up. 
SAM: It's fresh water, right? 
TALIESIN: I think. 
MATT: Yes, it is fresh water. There's no saltiness to it. 
ASHLEY: I mean, we could breathe. We could give it a go. 
LAURA: I really want to know what it is. 
ASHLEY: Me too! 
MARISHA: So wait, you said it goes up. 
MATT: It goes into the wall at an upward angle. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: That's what he's looking into and fighting with the current to look into it. 
SAM: Oh, I see. So we'd have to swim against. 
LAURA: We'd have to swim against a hard current. 
MATT: It's like swimming into a pipe. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a hose. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh, that's not going to happen. 
ASHLEY: How wide is it? 
MATT: It's about eight or so feet wide and maybe three to four feet tall. 
LIAM: Can you turn into a salmon? 
MARISHA: Yeah, no. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can. 
MARISHA: Go upstream, bish! 
SAM: Fish. 
ASHLEY: Do we want to take a minute to do this? 
LAURA: I feel like we've been here before and we accidentally bamfed into a water plane. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We definitely put Fearne as a frog into-- 
LAURA: In another tube-- 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LAURA: -- and sent her to the Water Plane last time. Let's do it again. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I got back. 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: But this time-- 
LAURA: That was when we first started hanging out together. 
TALIESIN: This time we are completely dead and have nothing. 
LAURA: We are so much stronger now. 
LIAM: But this time she's a salmon. 
MARISHA: I mean, that was a cool fountain that we found. 
LAURA: And smarter. 
LIAM: See how it's totally different? 
TALIESIN: It was. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's totally different this time. 
LAURA: Didn't we tie a string around her legs as a frog? 
TALIESIN: We also have nothing. 
LIAM: Yeah, she swam into a jug of alchemy or something. 
LAURA: Yeah, she did. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I kind of want to turn-- Okay. 
SAM: She's looking up fish, guys. 
LAURA: You going to look up-- 
ASHLEY: I did, there was something that I wanted to do. Okay, but I don't know if I would still have the same abilities as a salmon swimming upstream. 
SAM: But what kind, what do you want to be? 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: A leaf sheep sea slug. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: With the powers of a salmon? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, like I'm a salmon, but I'm giving it flair. 
MATT: Right. 
ASHLEY: That I look like a leaf sheep slee sea slug. That's so hard to say. 
LAURA: Slee slug? 
SAM: Leaf sheep slee slee. 
MATT: A sheep, sheeb, sha-she sheep? 
ASHLEY: Leaf sheep sea slug. 
MATT: Okay, cool. 
TALIESIN: Leaf sheep sea slug. 
ASHLEY: Look how stinking cute they are. 
LAURA: Leaf. 
LIAM: (sighs) 
TALIESIN: Sheep. 
ASHLEY: But they can swim upstream. 
MARISHA: Now I got to see. 
MATT: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: I'm looking. Oh my gosh! 
TALIESIN: Aw! 
TRAVIS: Guys. Guys! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: This is so cutey-cute. 
TALIESIN: Even for my issues, it's pretty cute. 
MARISHA: Wait, let me see. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MARISHA: Oh look at him! 
LAURA: He looks like a little cow! 
ASHLEY: I know! 
MATT: That is pretty cute. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Sure. 
ASHLEY: I watch a lot of animal docs and I saw it and I was like, oh my gosh. 
LIAM: I want to turn into a cat, but have the powers of a helicopter. (laughter) 
LAURA: Travis. He's done. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You know us. You know all of us. 
MATT: Here, I'll say-- 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I mean, I can also turn into a salmon if-- 
SAM: Yeah, that's fine. 
ASHLEY: I was just giving it flair, because-- 
MATT: No, let's make it fun. 
ASHLEY: -- they're cute. I wanted it a little cooler. 
MATT: That's what it's about. 
MARISHA: It's a fey salmon. 
ASHLEY: The salmon is boring. 
LIAM: Weird salmon. 
MATT: All right, so this will be you-- 
SAM: No offense to salmon. 
MATT: -- fighting against the force of the stream. Now you're aerodynamic, I'll say, in the force of this magic, yeah. So you'll have to make a strength check-- 
ASHLEY: Leaf shape is very aerodynamic. 
MATT: -- which would be an athletics check, in this form, which I'll put it at a standard-- Given-- (laughs) What? Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, uh-huh. 
MATT: Roll with advantage since going up-- 
LIAM: Salmon could just do it. 
MATT: Yeah, go upstream. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll with advantage, and just add a plus one to the roll. 
MARISHA: I love this. 
SAM: Solid. 
MATT: Got to beat a 14. 
ASHLEY: Do I-- What am I adding to it? 
SAM: One. 
ASHLEY: I'm adding one. 
LIAM: One. 
ASHLEY: But am I also-- 
LIAM: Athletics is this? 
LAURA: You just have to beat a 14. 
ASHLEY: Athletics? Okay, so I rolled a 16 plus one is 17. 
MATT: Okay, yeah. 
ASHLEY: But my athletics is a minus two. 
MATT: Well, it's the form of your creature's athletics. 
ASHLEY: Oh yes, yes, yes. 
MATT: So you actually don't take a penalty. It's better for you in the salmon form. 
ASHLEY: It's better in salmon form. 
MATT: All right. All right. 
TALIESIN: So true. 
LIAM: Googling 5e salmon. 
MATT: So, it's a slow push. 
ASHLEY: (straining) I'm going to push so hard! 
MATT: It's a slow push but you go, and you go, and you go through the darkness. 
ASHLEY: Moving all the leaves! 
MATT: You're doing the best you can to push through. 
LAURA: Sending light up the tube. 
MATT: You progress a good solid 80 or so feet up this forceful exit before suddenly (whooshes). 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: The force is no more and you're just (floating)-- 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: She's doing it again! 
MATT: -- in water. 
TALIESIN: Again. 
LIAM: There could be-- 
MATT: A little bit of a faint light source above. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: -- a lake that's spilling down. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: Water Plane doesn't have light on top. 
ASHLEY: Let me just go-- I'm going to try to surface. 
LIAM: She's reached an underground lake or something. 
MARISHA: If this is a backdoor to Ruidus, I'm going to die. 
MATT: You (whooshing). Looking around, it's-- 
SAM: A car drives by: You're in modern day. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What the fuck is that? 
LIAM: We're still mentally connected. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, I'm through the-- I went through the hole about 80 feet and then I-- 
SAM: Can we hear her? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we're mentally connected. 
SAM: Right, if we're on the same plane. 
TRAVIS: Does she have a salmon's intelligence? 
MARISHA: Well, she keeps her mental stats. 
MATT: No, druids keep their mental stats. 
LIAM: Yeah, wizards go dumb. Druids-- 
MATT: You push up-- 
ASHLEY: Get smarter. 
MATT: -- push up, and eventually break the surface. Looking around, you are in a large lake on a cloudy, gray day in a space you don't recognize surrounded by lush, green forests with a faint bit of snow melt on them. 
SAM: Can we hear her when she's talking to us mentally? 
LAURA: Or she is on another plane now? 
ASHLEY: With snow. 
SAM: We can? 
ASHLEY: This isn't-- Oh my god. 
MATT: Wait, so, sorry, the question was? 
SAM: Can we hear her? 
LIAM: If she thinks to us, do we hear her anymore? Or has she broke into another plane? 
MATT: No. (gasping) 
LAURA: She's in another plane! 
LIAM: Hot dog! 
LAURA: She's in another plane! 
MATT: And that's where we're going to end tonight's episode. (screaming) 
ASHLEY: No! Matt! 
MARISHA: We found a backdoor, baby! 
LIAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: We found a backdoor. 
LAURA: What plane is she on, though? 
SAM: Where is she? 
LAURA: What plane is she on? Is she in the Fey Realm? 
ASHLEY: Is it Aeor? 
SAM: She's in America. (laughter) 
LIAM: In Colorado! 
ASHLEY: There's snow-capped mountains. 
TALIESIN: New York City, 1973. 
MARISHA: Keanu Reeves is there. It's Cyberpunk! 
MATT: It's beautiful. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Wow! 
TALIESIN: It's Yellowstone. 
SAM: Sal Tlay Ka Siti. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Does it look anything like a postcard that my "parents" sent me, slash Nana? The Aeor postcard or Eiselcross or whatever. 
MATT: No, it does not, actually. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. 
LIAM: It's so good that we didn't go back to the Bloody Bridge. 
TALIESIN: We broke the fourth wall! It was there and we broke it. 
MARISHA: Always look behind the waterfall! 
LAURA: Always. 
ASHLEY: Always. 
MATT: Well, nevertheless. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: We'll pick that up next time. With your now, we'll say two and half hours of-- 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: -- time on these things. 
LIAM: We don't need your goddamn Bloody Bridge anymore! 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: Wow. Oh my god. 
SAM: Are we still on the air? 
LAURA: Yeah, we are. 
TALIESIN: Yes! 
ASHLEY: What if we just keep playing for like 10 more minutes? 
LIAM: We're in Colorado. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: But thank you for joining us. 
LAURA: Ugh! 
ASHLEY: Aw, dang it! I thought that was going to work. 
MATT: I know. We'll pick it up next time. Thank you so much for joining us, we love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

Cooldown[]
LAURA: Oh my god.
LIAM: We came up from the reservoir in Silver Lake. It's torrential downpouring.
LAURA: Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Is it on Exandria? Is it another realm? Because if it was Exandria we would still hear it because she'd be in the same plane.
SAM: That's right, that's right.
ASHLEY: Yeah, you're right.
SAM: We're in a different plane.
TALIESIN: Unless the screen is fucking--
LAURA: That's true. And--
SAM: Oh, the Divine Gate.
LAURA: It only lasts for a certain amount of miles, too, so if she's past that distance, then there's no way.
SAM: That's true. So it could be Exandria, just not within range.
LIAM: And, and, and! Even if we're in, say, the Fey Realm, that's us still not having to go to our enemies' door to come here.
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: What other planes of existence do we know about?
LIAM: Albuquerque!
SAM: I guess Bells Hells don't know very many.
MARISHA: Well, to be fair, he said it was a cloudy day in a jungle and did you--
LAURA: What if it's the Shattered Teeth?
SAM: It could be the Shattered Teeth.
LAURA: The Shattered Teeth!
SAM: Because that's where this came from--
TALIESIN: That's where everything went to fuck.
MARISHA: That's immediately where my brain went because the Shattered Teeth are made from fucking ruins from--
TALIESIN: They're also all-- They're all moving around all the fucking time, because shit's weird.
ASHLEY: Are there snow-capped mountains there?
LIAM: You said there was jungle.
MATT: No, just a lush, green forest surrounding you.
LIAM: That could be cedar trees.
TALIESIN: We saw 1% of the Shattered Teeth.
ASHLEY: Did I misunderstand about the snow-capped mountains?
MATT: Snow melt of the top of the nearby peaks.
SAM: Did we see any snow when we were in the Shattered Teeth?
TALIESIN: We saw like 2% of the Shattered Teeth correctly.
ASHLEY: Yeah, could be.
TALIESIN: It's huge.
MARISHA: Also, I feel like if it was, because the Fey Realm was always dusky.
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think it is either.
MARISHA: It's always at sunset.
TALIESIN: No, I don't think it's the Fey Realm.
MARISHA: It's got to be the Shattered Teeth.
TALIESIN: Shattered Teeth is such a good pull. That's my vibe.
LAURA: We found something that Ludinus doesn't know about.
MARISHA: Hopefully.
TALIESIN: We're smarter.
SAM: Fuckin'.
TRAVIS: Unless this elven city was where Ludinus lived.
TALIESIN: Still doesn't necessarily mean he found the city on the moon because it's all buried.
MARISHA: That is an interesting point, though.
TRAVIS: I mean, before it became the moon.
TALIESIN: Yes, which means he doesn't know how to get here or he might know the name of it, but he may not know where the fuck it is.
SAM: It might not be of any use to him.
LAURA: This is what the mission was for. We found our army's back door.
SAM: We found the back door.
MARISHA: ♪ Open your back door, baby ♪ So here's going to be the tricky spot. Fearne's going to have to figure out a way to mark it.
ASHLEY: Come back.
MARISHA: Then come back, right?
LAURA: Yeah, but she's got to be able to find the portal again, like the tunnel.
ASHLEY: Well, it's right behind me.
LAURA: It's right underneath you. Obviously you know where it is.
ASHLEY: I still might totally know how to get back to it.
TRAVIS: You hope.
TALIESIN: Well, also, in theory, it's got a bit of a section, because there's water moving, so you could just follow-- I'm really assuming a lot.
LAURA: Go down until you get stuck.
SAM: We didn't attach a rope. That would've been smart.
TRAVIS and LIAM: To the salmon?
TALIESIN: It's not even a salmon. It's a leaf slug.
LAURA: It's a sea slug.
MARISHA: To be fair--
LAURA: A leaf sheep.
MARISHA: I did think about it and then I immediately went, "That's stupid."
SAM: Do we have fishing wire? We could've hooked her.
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: (screams)
LIAM: I don't know what we're going to do next time or how much time we're going to spend here, but if you were to go back up and get-- if you came back down and then took one of the rods and then Wild Shaped, you would just swim up and the Wild Shape would be within you salmon body, and then you could set it with a rope trailing behind--
ASHLEY: I can't Wild Shape again, though, unless we--
TALIESIN: Well, we have to long rest at some point, anyway.
ASHLEY: We have to oong because I can't-- this is the last time--
LIAM: We're exhausted!
TALIESIN: So maybe we should just drop at some point.
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself. I haven't been hit once.
TALIESIN: I got no options if shit goes wrong.
LIAM: We haven't had a short rest in three games.
MARISHA: I'm pretty good on my spells.
LAURA: I have (unintelligible) my major spells left.
SAM: You have how many?
LAURA: I have a 5th-level and a 6th-level left. 
SAM: I have zero spells. I'm down to 20 hit points, I've used all of my class and racial features, I've talked to my god, I've used all of my items. I have nothing else I can do.
TRAVIS: You've got some cantrips.
SAM: I got some cantrips.
TALIESIN: I can add the d6 to a couple hits. That's pretty much it. Or I can split a spell.
LIAM: You running out of faith? Wow, very cool, Matt.
LAURA: This is so exciting.
LIAM: Very cool.
MARISHA: The Immovable Rod thing isn't, because the Immovable Rod stays, so even if you just click it--
SAM: She'll find her way back.
LAURA: Oh my god! What if we wouldn't have done-- Wait! I feel like we found a totally secret path.
TRAVIS: We found the warp zone?
LAURA: Yeah, we found the warp zone! Just by the choices that were made, we found a warp zone, Matt.
ASHLEY: So did I--
LAURA: That's so exciting!
ASHLEY: I mean, I guess I'll find out next time.
MARISHA: So, so, so--
TALIESIN: Sew buttons.
SAM: I was going to say that, too.
MARISHA: Are there more-- Could we have-- Was this like we just happened to make all the right choices to find the hardest thing?
LIAM: Don't question it! He'll take it away!
MARISHA: I know, I'm sorry! "He'll take it away!"
MATT: "Take it away!"
TALIESIN: There could have been Colonel Sanders in a monitor room. We don't know. 
LIAM: Are we in Dark City?
TALIESIN: Well, I was going, I wish.
MATT: "Matrix 2"
TALIESIN: Yeah, "Matrix 2" is what I--
SAM: Ashley, earlier you were going to say what you were going to do.
LAURA: Oh, yeah, what was your secret that you were going to do? 
SAM: What were you going to do to get us out of that.
MATT: What are you doing, Sam?
SAM: I'm taking a picture of my tongue man. 
TRAVIS: With hands.
SAM: It has hands now.
MATT: No! Why?
MARISHA: He made a child.
MATT: Oh, I hate everything about this.
SAM: Look, you can-- he has hands. It's like--
MATT: No! 
TALIESIN: You can find a picture of some anime eyes on your iPad and then make a whole person.
MATT: It's like the worst Boglin ever.
LAURA: Yeah, you do need some eyes. It's kind of creepy. It's kind of Pan's Labyrinth without the eyes.
LIAM: Look at me! I'm the pope!
LAURA: You would need to put eyes on his hands.
SAM: A critter made this, by the way, named--
LIAM: Satan.
SAM: Ben.
MATT: Thank you, Ben, for the nightmare fuel. You've ruined everything. No, you're great.
LAURA: Do you want to say what your plan was?
ASHLEY: No, I was just going to be like, "I'll go with you." It's fine. I was going to try to make a deal and negotiate. I'm going to keep it, just in case.
SAM: I was trying to decide between-- I had one spell slot, so it was either Banish or just give up. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I had a feeling you were going to--
TRAVIS: That was an unexpected surprise.
ASHLEY: I had some stuff I was--
TRAVIS: Otohan said you were the one that he was talking about?
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Oh, that's the shadow--
ASHLEY: I think the Sorrowlord.
SAM: The what?
ASHLEY: Daddy.
LAURA: Daddy Sorrowlord. Her dad.
ASHLEY: Because he's her boss.
LAURA: They were talking.
SAM: Wait, does he exist anymore?
ASHLEY: He's gotten pissed at Otohan before.
SAM: He exists somewhere, yeah?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ASHLEY: He does. I was going to--
LIAM: The Fey dragon rider, right? That's what we're talking about?
MARISHA: Yeah, Daddy.
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Daddy.
ASHLEY: My dad's going to be real mad at you.
SAM: The other thing that you could've done to get us out of there--
ASHLEY: But I don't think he-- I think he wants me dead, so.
LAURA: No, he wants you there with him.
ASHLEY: For something.
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: The other thing you could've done to get us out of there, couldn't you have called that super hot devil guy to get us?
ASHLEY: Asmodeus? No, not Asmodeus. What's his name? Tevon?
MATT: What's up?
ASHLEY: Tevon Klask?
TALIESIN: I have it written down somewhere.
SAM: Tevin Campbell?
ASHLEY: Tevin Campbell!
LAURA: Her hottie devil boyfriend.
TALIESIN: Asmodeus douche bag? Hold on, Asmodeus douche bag is down here.
ASHLEY: What does Tevin Campbell sing?
SAM: Tevin Campbell was like an 80s singer.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know.
SAM: What did he sing?
ASHLEY: Yeah. This is really important.
SAM: Wasn't he know as like--
TRAVIS: That's an important red button to remember.
ASHLEY: Oh yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Asmodeus can't get here either, though. Asmodeus is also locked.
LAURA: Oh, stuck beyond the--
TALIESIN: It's a Betrayer God.
MATT: I'm reminding myself of rules and stuff. It's all good.
SAM: But he could've come to get you out of it, anyway.
ASHLEY: But can he come here?
TALIESIN: No.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't think he can.
SAM: Oh, because there's a Divine Gate.
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Everything is stuck on the other side. Your Changebringer is not with us.
SAM: That's what I was saving my spell slot, to Commune with her to see if she could hear me. 
TALIESIN: I don't think she can.
SAM: Don't you yuck my god.
TALIESIN: No, it's-- It's all the gods are kind of-- this is a problem for all of them. 
SAM: I'm going to reach out and see if she can still hear me. Next game.
LIAM: I think a lot of the gods are cool.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I still want to reach out to Teven, but I don't think he can come here.
LAURA: I'm super into the Stormlord.
LIAM: Mm-hmm. He's a good one.
SAM: He's super into you.
LAURA: I know. We're going to date.
LIAM: I think the Chained Oblivion is neat.
TALIESIN: I love the Chained Oblivion. I'm there.
SAM: Did Imogen clock Laudna fucking going deranged?
LAURA: I know! You were in the hole. Did any of us see that?
SAM: Did anyone see that?
MARISHA: I don't know. I was in the hole.
SAM: "I dunno."
MATT: As you were all--
ASHLEY and LAURA: "I don't know!"
MATT: As you were all transforming, which technically makes you incapacitated while you're transforming...
LAURA: So we didn't see her doing that.
MARISHA: Laudna has had some temptation issues anytime the cone or any type of power--
SAM: So are you a bad guy now?
LAURA: Ruh-roh.
ASHLEY: She's been doing that.
MARISHA: You guys have known this.
LIAM: She designed a dead lady tied to one of the greatest villains--
TALIESIN: Teven Klask.
LIAM: --in the history of our stories. By design.
TALIESIN: Jerk, devil of Asmodeus.
LIAM: She's dead. She's creepy.
ASHLEY: This is by design.
LIAM: She's awesome.
TRAVIS: This was a good game, guys!
MATT: It's going to be fine.
MARISHA: Good game.
MATT: It's going to be fine.
MARISHA: We're going to have to text.
MATT: That's true. Yeah. You guys talk. I'll see you next session.
