MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
THE REST: (garbled nonsense) 
LIAM: Farts, farts, farts. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: Hmm. 
MATT: Before we get into tonight's session, we do have some announcements to get through. First, our sponsor, NordVPN. 
LAURA: (cheers) 
MATT: What bit are you doing today, Sam? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Is it a horse magician? 
ASHLEY: Houdini. 
MATT: Like a leet-speak gag, stack of laptops, maybe? 
SAM: No, Matt, no. Those are hacky, lousy comedy gags. 
LAURA: Oh, wow. (laughs) 
SAM: Low-hanging fruit. Lazy material. 
LIAM: Acceptance. 
SAM: Our friends at Nord-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's the first step one. (laughs) 
SAM: Our friends at NordVPN deserve better. 
MATT: So you're actually going to just read the copy they provided? 
SAM: No, Matt, I'm going to do something even better. I'm going to give our sponsors at NordVPN something I've never done before. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Hit it. 
LAURA: Oh.

ASHLEY: Wow. (applauding) 
MATT: That was actually pretty great. 
LAURA: That was excellent. 
ASHLEY: That was good. 
LIAM: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Wow, Sam. 
MATT: What's the bit you're actually going to do for the ad? 
SAM: Oh, we're out of time for the bit. So go to nordvpn.com/criticalrole. Our viewers will get an extra subscription time with their order. Try it risk-free now with a 30-day money back guarantee. Matt, back to you. 
MATT: Fantastic. (awwing) 
ASHLEY: Hey, that was great. 
TRAVIS: Oh, look at you. Turning over a new leaf. 
MARISHA: I'm so proud of you. 
LAURA: Now I see why it took you so long with sound check. 
SAM: Thank you. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Vive la vie. Vive la vie. 
MATT: Indeed. We also have a fun announcement for Darrington Press. We have a new game. (cheering) 
MATT: "Caper Cards: Bells Hells" is now available. In this cooperative card game, you'll assemble members of Bells Hells to pull off a legendary heist. Play your crew cards, hoping to add up to the treasure you're seeking, but without going over 21 and getting caught. Use member crew abilities to turn the odds in your favor, including rules for one to four players, two difficulties, and you finish a full playthrough in about 20 minutes. 
SAM: Wow. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: This gorgeous compact game was designed by Manny Vega, with art by David Rodrigues and graphic design by Matt Paquette & Company Co. (laughter) 
MATT: ♪ Paquette Company Co. ♪ 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Staying in the-- 
TRAVIS: Sing it. 
MATT: Yeah, and it's got a bunch of really cool art, awesome bits for characters. 
SAM: Yeah, that's great. 
TRAVIS: Thanks, Darrington Press. 
LIAM: Great art, great artists. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: The Muscle. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's so good. 
MATT: The Mastermind. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
MATT: The Trickster. See, yeah, there's all sorts of fun stuff there. The Insider. Yeah, it's a fun card game. Check it out. You can find it in Critical shops and Darrington Press Guild stores now, and look for it soon in other friendly local game stores. 
TRAVIS: Can't wait. 
LAURA: (whoops) 
TRAVIS: Get the cards. 
SAM: Get the cards. 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Get the cards! 
MATT: For a quick little intro, that concludes our announcements. 
SAM: Wait, what? 
LAURA: Whoa! 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Whoa. 
MATT: Look at that. Straight to it. 
MARISHA: Whoa. 
SAM: I could've made the song twice as long. 
MATT: Too late! 
TRAVIS: No, that was all we needed. (laughs) 
LAURA: It was enough. 
TRAVIS: For sure, that was-- 
LAURA: Just the right amount. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: It was just perfect. But on that note, let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. Before we get in, Sam here wanted to say a quick-- 
SAM: Oh, I wanted to say thank you to Colm McGuinness for the lovely piano track. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. 
ASHLEY: I was wondering who did that. 
MATT: There you go. 
SAM: Yes, a little clap. 
MATT: Yay. 
SAM: I can't play piano. 
TRAVIS: He's the best. 
MATT: Last we left off: Bells Hells, in seeking answers to the strange history of Ashton and the unique ties it seems to have with some of the ancient history of Exandria, and hopefully finding some means of preparing for an eventual showdown with the enemies that walk the red moon. You head to the Shattered Teeth. You traversed the sea in a ghost ship. You went to the island of Kalutha. You trekked through the jungles and eventually found Evontra'vir, the Great Tree of Atrophy, at the bottom of a massive chasm surrounded by massive mountains. There as you slunk into the lightless expanse, you met the ancient Gau Drashari-turned-death tree that sits between the realms of life and the beyond. You asked a bit about your history in the Hishari and learned that within you lies the dormant shard of Ka'Mort, the empress primordial earth titan. 
LAURA: The shards are within him? 
MATT: Yes. (laughs) But there exists still, not too far from here, on another island in the Shattered Teeth, another remaining vestigial shard of the other Primordial Titan that was destroyed in the destruction of Domunas that created the islands of the Shattered Teeth. Upon given direction of where this was, inquiring as to possible futures and possible failures, through some visions and discussions, your time was cut short as the tree took notice of an invisible, floating, spying arcane orb. Upon shattering it, it opened a pathway to the mountaintop of which this shard is supposedly found, and sent you onto the next leg of your journey with haste. As you all stepped through, emerging from a leafless tree on the opposite end, you all find yourself standing on a cold, snow-covered mountaintop. As the peak divides into two different rising spires, the tallest one obscured by clouds above the snowfall, rather thick as it falls upon your not well-prepared forms, the cold chilling through you instantaneously, you glance about in the vicinity with your limited vision and can see that at the taller of the spires, around its base, there's an area in which the snow does not seem to set, but instead melt. You can see a bit of green, and some shadow that is casting heavy into a small, low-slung cavern entrance. So, Bells Hells, what would you like to do? 
TALIESIN: Hoof it? (laughter) 
SAM: Are we freezing cold? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself. I came prepared. Zip. 
MARISHA: Oh, your jumpsuit. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Juicy. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah, Avalor keeps you warm? 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Praise the lord. 
TRAVIS: But if we need to move fast, I guess we could get everyone's heart rate up. It's fine. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we should move fast. 
LIAM: Help me with the mind palace again. How far off from this cavern are we? 
MATT: From where you are standing, maybe about 150, 200 feet. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay, that's not that bad. 
LIAM: Okay, that's not. 
LAURA: It's not up the mountain. Is it just straight ahead, or--? 
MATT: It's a little bit of a climb up and there's an area on the side of the mountain where the snow itself is just missing. You can see the melted sleet that sinks around the outside of it. 
LAURA: Oh, so it's going to be nice and slick as we try to get up to it. 
TALIESIN: It's going to be toasty at least. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: We got rope. We got pitons. Patents. 
LAURA: Piton. 
MARISHA: Pi-dong. 
SAM: (French accent) Piton? 
TALIESIN: (French accent) Piton. 
LIAM: (French accent) Piton? 
SAM: Do we have piton? 
LIAM: (French accent) Oui, oui, oui. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Feed the birds ♪ 
MARISHA: Is it super steep? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Pitons ♪ 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: As you jog up to get a better perspective, it's fairly steep. There are outcroppings and rough spaces where it is climbable with some challenge, but the icy surroundings met with the perpetually melting perimeter around that cavern entrance might make it a bit challenging. What you do see is it isn't like an open mouth of a cave. It is a jagged opening that looks like no more than maybe three, three and a half feet wide, but it stretches about 20 or so feet from end to end at an upward angle. You just see the dark shadow within and the area around it for about 20 or 30 feet is melted. 
LIAM: A horizontal climb somewhat? 
MATT: A horizontal opening to the cavern. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's what I meant, sorry. 
MATT: It's a fairly steep climb to even get to the lowest part of it. It's about, I'd say, from the smoothest bit of solid land that you can step on, you gather it's probably a good 45, 50 feet up. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Which isn't terrible. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Not to do this plan again, because I don't want it to get old-- 
LIAM: Pâté? 
MARISHA: But we could just jump and Feather Fall again. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: But it's up. 
MARISHA: Oh, I thought we had to go down. 
MATT: No, up. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: (laughs) We could just jump down. 
ASHLEY: Fall down. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. Is this it? 
MATT: (laughs) This is it? Okay, hold on. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Better? 
MARISHA: No, that is better, actually. 
TRAVIS: Released a lot, didn't it? 
MARISHA: Just a little-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's okay. 
MARISHA: Nerves. You know. 
SAM: Do you want to send Pâté up to take a look? Or should we just go? 
LAURA: No, just do it. 
TALIESIN: It's not like we're going to hang out around here if something's weird up here. 
LIAM: No, it's cold as hell. 
SAM: Should someone who's good at climbing go up and then throw a rope down. 
LAURA: I could fly up. 
SAM: Oh, well, yeah. 
LIAM: That's the best climbing. 
SAM: Sure. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do that. I'll fly up. 
SAM: Flying is the best climbing. 
LAURA: With the immovable rod and the rope? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: Because, yeah, it hasn't been an hour. Or how long does Fly last for? 10 minutes or an hour? 
LAURA: Oh! That's a good-- 
LIAM: 10 minutes. 
LAURA: I think it's only 10 minutes. Yeah, I'd have to cast it again. 
MATT: Okay, so you'd have to cast it again. 
LAURA: I do. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I cast it again. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Do you want to carry me? 
MATT: You coast up. 
LAURA: I hold onto Orym. 
LIAM: I'm a football. 
MATT: All right, you both get to the edge a bit-- 
LAURA: Hold onto me, hold onto me, I'm not that strong. 
MATT: As you approach the outside of the-- 
LAURA: Put your little arms around my neck like a little... Thanks. 
SAM: Aw. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Now, there isn't a shelf at this cave to stand on. 
TRAVIS: Barf. 
MATT: You have to actually step into it to even get any footing. It's a pretty sheer rock wall with this crack that seems to have opened within. As you step inside, like I said, it's about four feet full height. So you're comfortably standing there, but you're having to crouch and put your hand on the ceiling as you get there. The air that surrounds this entryway is warm. 
LAURA: That's great. I'm so glad we came up. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Do I hear anything inside? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LAURA: I'll let him start perceiving while I set up the immovable rod on the rope. 
MATT: All right. The rest of you have a group athletics check to climb up. 
SAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: No problem. 
MATT: Relatively low DC, thanks to the setup. 
SAM: Athletics? 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I dropped it. 
MARISHA: Mm-mm. 
TALIESIN: How do I get advantage on that? 
LAURA: Don't do it again. 
MARISHA: I haven't done it yet. 
MATT: Not unless you spend a rage. 
TALIESIN: I was trying to remember-- 
LAURA: Can you hold onto somebody that can climb? 
SAM: You can Spider Climb. 
LAURA: Oh, you can Spider Climb. 
MARISHA: I'll probably just Spider Climb. I tend to try to say, "Oh, I'm going to just Spider Climb. Fuck this." 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm not doing that again. 
MATT: Yeah. Spend your spell slots, go for it. 
MARISHA: Exactly. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MARISHA: But, also, I got sucked into a raging river last time. 
TRAVIS: My muscles are warm from my velvety tracksuit and I rolled a 27. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: 27, all righty. 
SAM: 13. 
MATT: 13, okay. 
TALIESIN: 16. 
ASHLEY: Natural one. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm Roadrunnering on the ice with my hooves I can't get any traction. 
MATT: (laughs) Indeed, you start-- 
SAM: It's the hooves. 
ASHLEY: It's the hooves. 
MATT: As the rest of you start successfully getting up there, it's pretty much Fearne and Laudna-- 
MARISHA: It's Phil Collins deer. 
MATT: Yep. (laughter) 
MATT: ♪ ("In the Air Tonight" drum break) ♪ 
LIAM: I was waiting for that GIF in this conversation. 
MATT: Fearne, you lose full grip on your feet and end up clutching the rope as you now swing free, which knocks the rope into a strange swing as you're holding up the caboose. What did you roll? 
MARISHA: I Spider Climbed. 
MATT: Oh, you did Spider Climb? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Oh. Well then-- 
LAURA: It's just you. 
LIAM: Bye, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: I have no traction with my hooves. 
MATT: (laughs) So you hold tight and the rest of you can pull the rope up. You didn't fail as a group in this group check. 
TRAVIS: You're welcome. 
MATT: (laughs) It takes a moment, but you manage to pull Fearne up. For Fearne in particular, being the tallest member of the team-- 
ASHLEY: Help me! 
TRAVIS: Come on, Fearne. 
MATT: You have to get quite low. The majority of you, aside from the two tiny gentlemen, and maybe FCG, it's coasting right above-- 
TRAVIS: Gentlemen? 
MATT: -- where your head is as you begin to peer through with your vision. 
TRAVIS: Who you talking about, buster? 
MATT: You have to bob your head a little bit time to time, but the two of you feel pretty comfortable in there. 
LIAM: That's good. 
TRAVIS: Scoundrel, at best. 
MATT: (laughs) So the interior here is quite lightless. The air is warm. The ceiling is shallow. Who's taking point and who's looking for what? 
LAURA: I'm putting out the light orbs. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I will also cast Light. Right? We want to see. 
LAURA: Is that too much, maybe? We don't want to be too bright. 
SAM: I'll put on my tail lights. 
LAURA: That's better. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Put on your tail lights ♪ 
SAM: So anyone won't hit us. 
LAURA: Can you lower your hydraulics so you're shorter? 
SAM: Oh, that's a good idea. I am a hoopty. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I've got hydraulics. 
TRAVIS: Hydraulics? 
LAURA: Yeah, hydraulics. 
SAM: Yeah, I do a lot of-- 
LAURA: Sweet. 
SAM: ♪ Do, do, do, do, do ♪ 
TRAVIS: El Camino? 
SAM: (whirring) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Low rider ♪ 
MATT: All righty. Glancing through the interior of this subterranean space, you can see that the passage rapidly, even just seven feet in, begins to push into a very, very thin space, and then one part of it looks like it's either collapsed or intentionally damaged, and there is a very small, tight-- 
LAURA: Are you "Descent"-ing us right now? 
MATT: -- spelunking-type cavern that drops into a pretty steep decline that's about wide enough for one person at a time to slowly descend through. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: I don't-- 
ASHLEY: My nightmare. 
MARISHA: No! 
LIAM: So on one side, it's collapsed, whether natural or intentional. 
SAM: This might turn into "127 Hours." 
MATT: You can see bits of rock that have fallen and settled into it, and the other-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: I've had this nightmare. 
MATT: -- begins to funnel into this immediate, small drop. 
LAURA: We have to go down like this? Head down? 
LIAM: So this pancake gap we're in, one side's collapsed and one side goes down tightly. Can I skitter over to the collapse and carefully try to see if there's the remains of anyone who was here, or intention behind the collapse? 
MATT: You can make an investigation check. 
LIAM: Okay. That's cocked. That's not great. 10. 
MATT: 10. It's hard to pick up anything specifically. You can tell that the best you can make out is that the collapse here was localized. The rock isn't everywhere. It doesn't look like a quake shook it free. The damage appears localized to that area. 
LIAM: Any gaps in it, even teeny? 
MATT: Mm-mm. 
LIAM: No. So no recognizable passage. 
SAM: This is rock or ice? 
MATT: It is rock. There is no ice inside. The warm air, and even the rock itself as you put your hand against it, the very stone itself has a faint warmth to the touch. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: It's a drastic shift from the freezing exterior. 
SAM: Oh, because it always stays warm. 
LAURA: Is Fearne going to fit? 
MATT: Fearne can fit carefully, hopefully. 
SAM: Rude. 
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, fair enough. 
LAURA: She's got fur. 
ASHLEY: I've got fur. I've got lots of obstacles. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Chetney, didn't we get some slippy, slicky oil from the Shore Shrew? 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: We certainly did. 
SAM: Slickshimmer oil. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: What does that do? 
TALIESIN: The Shore Shrew's slickshimmer oil? 
TRAVIS: It makes you really hard to grab for a minute and it gives you 10 temporary hit points, I think. 
SAM: It gives you what for a minute? 
TRAVIS: Makes you really hard to grab onto. It makes you slick, slippery. 
ASHLEY: Slippy slippies! 
LAURA: Well, maybe let's use that if someone gets stuck. 
TRAVIS: It makes-- What? 
MARISHA: Yes, yes. 
TRAVIS: No, but it makes you slick. Slippy splashy sploosh. 
TALIESIN: He's going to be doing that all day if we don't stop this right now. 
TRAVIS: Slippy! 
LAURA: Stop it. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Slippy, slippy! 
LAURA: Stop. 
TRAVIS: Shlorp! 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Wow! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Well, I mean-- 
LAURA: Let's do it. 
ASHLEY: I could go first, and then you all could just push me. 
TALIESIN: I think we should probably send someone in, at least one person in before you, so that if there's a rope, we could pull. 
ASHLEY: Someone can pull me. I understand. 
MARISHA: How tiny can you go? 
LIAM: Yeah, one of the littles. 
MARISHA: Well, I've seen you be a capybara. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I can. 
SAM: Wait. 
ASHLEY: What am I thinking? 
SAM: Aren't there things that can-- 
LAURA: Oh! Oh my gosh! 
SAM: -- crawl and climb? 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
SAM: Mountain goats and things? 
ASHLEY: What am I thinking? What am I even thinking? 
TRAVIS: Got to be a slippery. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: You could be a snow monkey. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I can. 
TRAVIS: I got you distracted. 
LIAM: Or a bat. 
LAURA: Silly. 
SAM: A bat! 
TRAVIS: Let's be honest. Who's not distracted? 
SAM: Of course! 
ASHLEY: Okay. Let me see what I got. 
LAURA: What a silly thing for us to not remember until this moment. 
ASHLEY: I mean, really, that's my job to remember. 
LIAM: What is a druid? 
ASHLEY: But thank you so much for also taking the blame. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Fearne being stuck like Winnie the Pooh is desirable. 
LAURA: I know, it did sound like fun. 
ASHLEY: I know, it would be kind of funny. All right, I'll turn into a little-- 
TRAVIS: Gopher. 
ASHLEY: -- a little bat. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: A snow bat. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, a little snow bat. 
MATT: (poof of transformation) 
MARISHA: A burrowing snow bat. 
LAURA: Aw, cute! 
SAM: With a gun. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Riding a monkey with a gun. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Because bats, can they see very well? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think. 
SAM: They can't see at all, actually. 
MATT: With echolocation, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, but she can hear. 
ASHLEY: Let me pull up-- 
SAM: Yes. 
TRAVIS: (bat clicking) 
MATT: So there you are, squeaking in your great snow-fleshed exterior's glory. (wings flitting) 
LIAM: So little. 
LAURA: So cute! 
TALIESIN: It's a good look. 
ASHLEY: (flapping awkwardly) I can't do those sounds. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (slapping awkwardly) 
MATT: There you go, yeah! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah! 
LIAM: I will edge down just ahead of the group so I can be on alert. 
TRAVIS: Edge. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: We've got two sources of light, so we're getting shadowy, bending light in here as we go? 
LAURA: I'll send one of the orbs down with you as far as I can. 
MARISHA: So who's the most likely to get stuck? Ashton, FCG? 
TALIESIN: I mean, maybe. 
SAM: I'm okay, I think. 
LIAM: You're on a wheel. 
LAURA: I feel like FCG, because everybody else can suck in. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, but they got a grapple hook. 
SAM: I do have a grapple hook. 
TALIESIN: So that's an option. 
SAM: But if I do get stuck-- 
LAURA: We'll have to dig you out. 
SAM: Yeah, my body doesn't really move. 
LIAM: This is the opposite of a flat surface for you to roll on. 
MARISHA: So maybe the two of you should go in tandem with Chetney in case we need to lube you up. 
TRAVIS: We also have the hole. 
SAM: Okay. What? 
TRAVIS: Also have the hole. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, throw him in the hole? 
LAURA: Is there a surface though, to put him in the hole? 
LIAM: No, not really. It's too jagged in here. 
ASHLEY: Shall I go looksies? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Go looksies. 
ASHLEY: I don't know-- 
TRAVIS: Are you already a bat? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't know how I would even tell that to you guys. 
SAM: Go looksies! 
LAURA: If you just went. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Technically, telepathy would-- 
ASHLEY: I'm going to just go down the hole. 
LAURA: Oh, we can still talk mentally. 
MATT: Yeah, telepathy, you guys can still discuss. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right. Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. God, we remember everything right now. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes. I'm going to go down the hole. 
MATT: Okay. (fluttering) 
LAURA: (laughs) Go. 
TALIESIN: That's better. 
MATT: You skitter, flapping from edge to edge. It does get pretty tight. 
TRAVIS: It's not a competition. 
MATT: You are uncertain if, in your normal form, it would have been as easy. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: But as you begin to clamber down this crooked chimney of a cavern that begins to become pretty straight down at a certain point, where you're having to-- You, actually, can just flutter down, but you can see people having to use the pressure to get down and eventually, at some points, have to push themselves through. 
LAURA: Do we go backwards or do we go forwards? I'm confused. 
MATT: That's up to you. 
LAURA: (sneers) 
LIAM: Some people go this way. 
MATT: But as you land, the rocks are warm. You can feel that on your little bat feet as you land and clutch for a second, going down further. 30 feet. 60 feet. At some points, it pinches in pretty close where you're not even certain if some of your teammates would be able to get through, necessarily. At about 120 feet, it comes to a stop. The cavern just stops. 
LIAM: (grunts) 
TALIESIN: That could've been-- 
LAURA: Are you going down? 
LIAM: I am. Well yeah, but she zoomed past me. 
ASHLEY: Am I able-- 
LAURA: We can still talk. 
ASHLEY: We can still talk, okay. All right, I'm down here. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I came all the way down. There's many, many, many tight spots. I don't know if we're all going to fit. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: It's going to take a little bit. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Maybe some slippy slippies. But it stops. 
LAURA: What do you mean it stops? 
ASHLEY: I'm just hanging out here at the bottom. 
LAURA: There's no doors? There's no cave entrances? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to, with the bat, I can use echolocation. 
SAM: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, keen hearing, and I have advantage on perception checks. 
MATT: Yeah, so roll a perception check with advantage using the bat's-- Actually, no, using your wisdom. 
ASHLEY: Using mine? Okay. 
MATT: Since you are a druid. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm not-- This is-- I rolled one with that one twice tonight, so I'm not going to do that again. Oh, okay. 25. 
MATT: 25. Where it comes to an end, you realize the rock, the texture of it continues, and then where it comes to a complete stop is actually a smooth stone that has blocked the passage there. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. There's a smooth stone. 
MATT: Similar blackened color as the rock around here. Similar stone color, just more of a smoother texture, but it's definitely blocking the passage. 
LIAM: I think by now, a glowing orb has come down with me. 
MATT: Indeed. 
LIAM: I find you flitting about that stone. What does it look like? Is it semi-buried, or does it look like a cork placed in a hole? 
MATT: It looks more like it's something that had fallen and wedged in there. 
TRAVIS: Like a boulder from "Indiana Jones." 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: (boulder rolls and wedges) 
LIAM: It's in a tiny hole, blocking the hole. Does it give? I'll try to pull at it with my fingers. 
MATT: Okay, make a strength check. 
SAM: "127 Hours"! 
LIAM: Oh, that'll go good. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to land on his shoulder. 
LIAM: A strength check, right? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: 16. 
MATT: 16. You reach for it and begin to pull, and as you pull, one of your fingers scrapes it, and you watch, some of the darkened color pulls away, like a soot layer pulls away, and there is a bit of a brighter color beneath right as it comes free, and you pull back and wedge yourself into the cavern, holding it to your chest. As you pull it up, two things happen. One, you hear the clattering of something falling below, and you look down at the charred skull that currently is looking back up at you. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: What? Wait, what? 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: So it wasn't a rock. 
LIAM: It was like somebody-- 
SAM: It was a man! 
LAURA: -- was going backwards, and their head got stuck. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
LAURA: Matthew! That's awful! 
MARISHA: Don't go spelunking! 
ASHLEY: (shudders) 
LIAM: Oh, hey. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's that small. 
LIAM: Let's get you and all of us out of here, buddy. 
MARISHA: I hate this. 
LIAM: How big's the hole now? 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's horrifying. 
LIAM: Can a halfling fit through it? 
TRAVIS: It's one of the worst things. 
MATT: A halfling can likely fit through there. 
TRAVIS: Do some stretch. 
MATT: Most of you could probably fit through there-- 
TRAVIS: Enjoy the space. 
ASHLEY: I feel like I can't get a full breath of air. 
MATT: -- with some challenge. Which we'll have to do some rolls to do so. The head, as you look at the skull, too, the features look a little more thick. You can see the bone itself is a hardy bone. The jaw itself is a little wide, with tusks beneath. It looks to have some orcish blood to it. 
LIAM: Larger than my skull. Yeah, okay. Okay. All right, so I hold it in one hand like a bowling ball. Fearne, Fearnie. Can you let Imogen know for everyone to come down? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: I'm going to pop down through this hole and have a look around. I'm going to start to slide down with the skull. 
LAURA: Does the cavern keep going, though? 
MATT: The cavern keeps going. 
LAURA: I say in, Fearne's head: Does the cavern keep going, though? 
ASHLEY: Well, yes. So what just happened was Orym picked up something that was blocking the hole, and it was a skull head. 
LAURA: Great. 
ASHLEY: So, did I tell you I don't like small, confined spaces? Because this is-- 
LAURA: You're a bat. You're a bat. Remember, you're a bat. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm okay. I think some of you could fit. Maybe Chet, probably Laudna. 
LAURA: What about FCG? 
SAM: Are you guys talking about me? 
LAURA: Well, yeah, somebody's skull got stuck, and Orym pried it out, and apparently a head got stuck and the rest of the body fell. 
MARISHA: Not Orym's head. 
LAURA: Not Orym's head, no. 
MARISHA: Not Fearne's. 
LAURA: He found a skull-- 
MARISHA: Oh, he found a skull. 
LAURA: -- that was closing up the cavern. That means it's this small. 
SAM: Why don't we just get down there? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
SAM: That's going to affect all of us, not just me. Why don't we just get down there, and we can solve this together as a team? 
ASHLEY: Do I feel like they could fit, with some-- 
LAURA: How would your metal body fit? 
MATT: Make an intelligence check for me. 
SAM: I've got magic. 
LIAM: Does it look like it could be widened-- 
LAURA: Can you make yourself little? 
LIAM: -- if we chiseled at it with a blade? 
SAM: No, but I can shape stone. 
MATT: Possibly, if you have the right material and the rock happens to be pliable. But you're uncertain what-- 
LAURA: I asked about that earlier and you didn't speak up. 
SAM: You did? 
MATT: -- material this rock is made from. 
SAM: I'm sorry, I can shape stone. 
LAURA: Got it. 
LIAM: Past that hole, it was blocked. Is it just more of the same down and down and down? 
MATT: Correct, but it looks like it's still moving. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: It's-- 
SAM: Sorry. 
LAURA: It's okay. 
MATT: -- almost corkscrewing at a point where you only can see a few feet. 
SAM: I'm trying to listen and talk. 
MATT: Just glancing down with what that light orb is currently presenting, you can see three of the bones that have fallen, and one of them shattered. You can see a few shiny points that reflect off the light on some of these small ledges that point out. That's all you can see. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: What are these? 
ASHLEY: All right. 17. 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: 17. 
MARISHA: They are. 
SAM: How do you do it? 
MARISHA: You know. It's a new era. It's weird. 
MATT: You think most everyone could get down there, if they're flexible. FCG might be a challenge, given the broader and more-- 
SAM: I've been working out! 
ASHLEY: Well, I know. 
MATT: -- non-flexible torso. But-- 
MARISHA: You're just a bit barrel-chested, literally. 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay, I relay that to Imogen. 
SAM: I am made out of a metal barrel. 
LAURA: I mean, if we look at this, his head is bigger than anything else on his body, though. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Clearly that was the problem with the last person, too. 
ASHLEY: I feel like everybody might be able to make it down. FCG is a little bit tricky. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
MARISHA: Why are your teeth still on the table? 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh, gross! 
ASHLEY: You should put them on the-- 
SAM: Should I put them back in? 
LAURA: Yeah, put them in. (laughter) 
LAURA: Just wear them the rest of the game. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It's so weird. 
MATT: I hate it so much. 
LIAM: It's the same picture. (laughter) 
MATT: Don't put them back! 
TALIESIN: Don't but them back. 
LAURA: No! 
TALIESIN: Make them go away. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Can I wear them? 
ASHLEY: Teef! 
LAURA: Ew. 
TALIESIN: Banish it. 
MATT: So the rest of you are trying to trek down, one after the next? 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Banish it. 
MATT: I'm trying to get a feel here of the marching order. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: I'll go last, I'll go last. 
LAURA: That's what we're trying to do. 
SAM: That way if I get stuck, I'm not holding up anybody. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm down already. 
LAURA: What if other people get stuck, though, and you're behind? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you should be first. 
LAURA: You should be the first one. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: So that it makes it easier for anybody else to go through. 
TRAVIS: So we know whether to kill you-- 
SAM: That makes a lot of sense. 
TRAVIS: -- and disassemble you first. 
ASHLEY: Take you down. 
SAM: All right, I'm going first. 
MATT: All right, so FCG is coming in after Orym. 
LAURA: I will go after FCG, so if I can use some sort of magicky magic-- 
TALIESIN: And then I'll go after you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I just watched a documentary about this. 
LIAM: Matthew, while they're descending, can Orym try to inspect whatever those shines were? 
MARISHA: Chet and I will be in back. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you two aren't going to be a problem. 
MATT: What's that? 
LIAM: While they're descending, can Orym inspect what the shinies were? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay, well-- 
LIAM: Is it a mineral wall, or are we talking on the bone? 
MATT: To descend past this point-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Each person's going to have to make an individual check. Even with your size, it'll just be a much lower DC for you. So as you descend from this point, make an athletics or acrobatics check for me. 
LIAM: 18. 
MATT: 18? It switchbacks a couple moments to an odd ledge point, but you're a nimble halfling, and so you crawl down, find the right path, swing your legs under, and then catch it and you look at where some of these shiny points, where they were catching the light. It looks like a number of silver and gold coins. 
SAM: Ooh, wishing well. 
MATT: That have melted across the rock. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we keep skipping the charred part of the skull. 
TALIESIN: Mm-mm. 
ASHLEY: Forgot about that. 
LAURA: Yeah, I think there's a (flames whooshing) and it was covered with soot. 
ASHLEY and SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Maybe he was clogging that hole. 
MARISHA: Like a volcanic vent. 
TRAVIS: Like a fire chute. 
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, it's a volcano. We're heading into a volcano. 
SAM: Some sort of fire geyser. 
TALIESIN: Or a big fire thing in there. 
LIAM: I'm going to touch one lightly to see if it is super hot. 
LAURA: We're so smart. 
ASHLEY: Let's all get into-- 
LIAM: Is it super hot? 
ASHLEY: -- this blowhole. 
MATT: It's as warm as the rest of the rock. It's not super hot. 
LIAM: But glued to the rock. 
MATT: From above, it looks like a coin. As you get there, it's full on Salvador Dalí-ed across the rock. 
LIAM: Also, what was that word you said? Letchpoint? What's a letchpoint? 
TALIESIN: That we've definitely woken up by dropping. 
LIAM: You said it as I was moving. 
MATT: The ledge point. 
LAURA: Ledge! 
LIAM: Ledge point, got it. 
TRAVIS: Then while he's down there, can I give a (sniffs) because I haven't used the schnoz since we've been in here? 
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check for me. 
TRAVIS: Just in case there's like, I don't know, horrible sulfur stuff. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LIAM: (fart sound) 
TRAVIS: 18. 
MATT: 18. There's no sulfurous smell here. You've been around various places that have geothermal volcanic activity, and you're picking up the heat, the temperature, and some facets of smoke and burning and carbon, things that have burned. 
TRAVIS: Flesh. 
MATT: But you don't pick up sulfurous scents. You don't pick up the things that are usually associated with natural volcanic activity. 
TRAVIS: Or fey, fiend, or undead, right? 
MATT: You don't pick up any fey, fiend, or undead, either. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You're fine. (laughter) 
SAM: Before we go down, I do have some ratchets and some screwdrivers. You could take off my wheel and my arms and disassemble me slightly so that I'd be easier to push through-- 
LIAM: Disassemble. 
LAURA: You go down, and if it happens then I'll try to unscrew you. 
ASHLEY: Could you do a-- 
TRAVIS: I won't try. I'll do it, lickity-split! I've been looking at you in detail for months now. (laughter) I've been thinking about this in my sleep! I'm going to reassemble you all fucked up. It'll be great. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You know, in some contexts that would be really disturbing. 
TRAVIS: Right? 
SAM: In all contexts. 
MARISHA: I never thought about Mr. Potato Head-ing you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. "Island of Dr. Moreau" situation. 
LIAM: Travis has been doing that to all of us for years. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I have. 
SAM: I think it'll be easier to disassemble me now before I get wedged in a thing. 
TRAVIS: Puts the lotion in the basket. 
LAURA: What would we take off, just your wheel? 
SAM: My arm. 
LAURA: No, you need your arm! 
SAM: Both my arms. 
LAURA: You need to pull yourself with your arm. 
SAM: My wheel. 
LAURA: How else will you get through? 
SAM: Well, I'll just be a thing that you're getting through. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we just drag him. 
SAM: You can even take off my head. 
LAURA: I don't know if we can-- 
ASHLEY: Who has the shimmer-- 
LIAM: I don't know that we-- Oh, I'm not there. 
TRAVIS: Consent is all I need, okay? 
LAURA: No, we're not taking off your head. 
TRAVIS: I got a whole belt full, a harness full of tools. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: But-- 
LAURA: I don't think it's your arms and your wheel that's going to be the issue. 
MARISHA: You can do the stone-- 
SAM: You think it's my dick? 
LAURA: It's your giant dick! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Your giant dick! (laughter) 
MARISHA: You were going to Stone Shape-- 
SAM: Yes, I can Stone Shape. I'll do that. 
MARISHA: You need your hands to do that. 
SAM: I'll do that. It takes spell slots and stuff, so you know. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: We might fight something down there! 
LAURA: We might. 
SAM: I need to be able to heal you, like I always do. (laughter) 
LIAM: What if we-- 
SAM: All right, let's go! Let's go! 
TRAVIS: Do it. You're up. 
MATT: So you're just skittering down, not taking things apart? 
SAM: I guess so. 
MATT: All right. As you reach the point where you had noticed where it begins to get extremely tight and the rest of the trek is going to be hovering around certain choke points of a similar tightness, I need you to roll an athletics or acrobatics check, your choice. 
SAM: I will say athletics. That is actually cocked. (laughter) 
SAM: 17. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say. 
MATT: 17! 
TALIESIN: There's the word "Guidance" is also available here. 
SAM: Oh shit! (laughter) 
SAM: We're remembering all kinds of things! (laughter) 
MATT: Hey! 
TRAVIS: We're fucked down here, aren't we? 
MATT: Oh yeah! 
TRAVIS: This is where it goes-- (laughter) 
MATT: Oh yeah. I'm getting ready to finish the episode early. 
TRAVIS: (screams) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Wheel's first or head first? 
SAM: (exhales) Boy! Scary either way! I'll go head-- No, what if I get wedged? I'm going head first! 
TRAVIS: Like the birth canal! 
SAM: Head first! 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: This is making me sweat. 
MATT: Okay. As you pull yourself down, it gets to the point where only one arm can fit up front and you're pulling yourself in an inverted position further down, and you get wedged and stuck for a second. The metal, you hear squeak as it gets caught into the rock. You concentrate for a second, think of the Changebringer, the Bringer of Paths. You know this is where you're supposed to go, and with one pull of strength, the rock that's holding you (snap) snaps off at the shoulder and (rock skittering) rattles down and you come free and begin to lower yourself further down. 
LIAM: Ow! 
SAM: Sorry! 
MATT: You do manage to get through a few more of those choke points until eventually, you find out where Orym is, partway down, and you're both now-- 
SAM: Hey! 
LIAM: Tip of the spear! 
MATT: Are you continuing down or are you waiting for the rest of your people to catch up? 
LIAM: I'll wait for them to catch up. I don't want to go so far ahead that I'm fucked. 
MATT: So you're both, or the three of you are now holding up ahead a bit. Imogen. 
LAURA: Yeah? 
MATT: Head or feet first? 
LAURA: (nervous groan) 
MARISHA: How much of an incline is it, or decline? 
MATT: It's nearly straight down at times. It's switching around, like I said. It's like a crooked chimney and you're having to use the platforms to pull through and to stop. 
LAURA: I'm going feet first. I'm going to go feet first. 
MATT: Feet first? All right, make an acrobatics or athletics check. 
TRAVIS: Just like the person that died. 
LAURA: Nobody up here can Guide me? Go, everybody-- 
ASHLEY: Well, can I-- 
LAURA: Nope. 
TRAVIS: I can! 
LAURA: You can't Guide when you're an animal. 
ASHLEY: I can't, right? 
MATT: No. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You're also far. 
ASHLEY: Well, I'm going to come up and flutter by you for moral support. 
MATT: Yeah, as you're about to descend, (fluttering) 
LAURA: Okay! Everything's fine! Okay, Fearne, thank you. (laughter) 
LAURA: I don't know which dice to use. 
TRAVIS: Just staying real close! It's just like (flutters) 
ASHLEY: This is not helping at all. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You're actually making things a lot worse. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Bats are so erratic. 
ASHLEY: (little yell) 
LAURA: What am I rolling? 
MATT: Athletics or acrobatics, your choice. 
TRAVIS: Dice. 
LAURA: Six. (laughs) 
MATT: A six? So as you descend, you aren't able to look where you're going, you're feeling-- 
LAURA: We should've used a rope. 
MATT: You're feeling it with your feet and you get to the switchback where FCG previously got stuck and manage to move past without issue, and then as you begin to descend further, your left leg won't budge and you realize you've wedged your foot between two rocks. You try and pull and it hurts a little bit and you're afraid that if you pull too hard, you might break your ankle. You're not entirely certain in this one moment what to do. You're just stuck. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
ASHLEY: This is a horror episode. 
SAM: Yep. 
LAURA: They can't back up. 
SAM: This is those TikToks. 
MATT: This is my nightmare that I'm inflicting on all of you. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you put it on us in a shared-- 
SAM: How high up is she from us? Like, can we see this happening, or-- 
MATT: You can see her feet dangling a little ways up. I mean, you hear the stopped movement and you could climb a little bit to look over to where she is. 
LAURA: My ankles! I'm stuck, Fearne! 
ASHLEY: Can I try-- 
SAM: But we can't reach. 
TRAVIS: I don't know why you would even-- 
MATT: You can-- 
LAURA: No, because your head first. So what's facing me? 
SAM: But now I'm in a-- 
MATT: No, you're still, you both just stopped. 
SAM: Oh no! (laughter) 
LAURA: That's okay. We're descending. 
MARISHA: You're stopped, too? 
LIAM: He's still crawling head first down. 
SAM: I thought that this emptied out into some sort of-- 
MATT: No, you're all still-- 
SAM: -- voluminous area. 
MATT: You're still climbing. You're just waiting for the rest to catch up. 
SAM: Oh god, this is horrible! 
LIAM: So you're pulling yourself with a robotic hand and using a wheel to resist and roll against the back. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay, I've got an idea. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Hmm. 
LIAM: It's like all those scenes of R2-D2 crawling through caverns. (laughter) 
LAURA: Okay, wait. 
MARISHA: We went down a weird rabbit hole in the pandemic of spelunking gone wrong videos. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. 
SAM: I've seen them, too. 
TRAVIS: They're horrible! 
MARISHA: It's awful! 
ASHLEY: I hate them, but I have to watch them. 
MARISHA: I know! 
ASHLEY: Then I have a panic attack. 
LAURA: Can I try? Can I try? 
ASHLEY: And I watch more. 
SAM: He was caving with his brother. 
MATT: As if I needed more reasons to never ever do anything like that ever. 
ASHLEY: Yes! Yes! 
TRAVIS: You couldn't pay me! 
MATT: Sorry. Imogen. 
ASHLEY: But I kind of want to a little bit. 
LAURA: Focusing my Shocking Grasp, I'm going to try to focus my energy down to my foot, to my ankle, and try to (sizzling) and create a little bit of electricity around that to break up the rock where my foot is stuck. 
MATT: Certainly! As you concentrate and feel the energy pulse into your ankle and the arcane electric charge (whooshes) unleashes, it dissipates into the stone. Electricity is pretty easily grounded into rock, unfortunately. 
ASHLEY: Okay, can I-- 
LAURA: Well-- 
TRAVIS: Well, we can see your head, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, can we-- 
MATT: You can definitely see her head, if you start climbing down. 
MARISHA: Can I skip, unless were you going to do something? 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
MATT: Are you guys going one at a time, or are you all now clambering? 
MARISHA: Oh, I thought we were going single file. 
TRAVIS: Oh, we were going one at a time. We're probably laughing at this point. 
MARISHA: I have a rock chisel, if you think you can deliver it down to her. 
TALIESIN: But you still have-- 
MARISHA: I still have Spider Climb as well. 
LAURA: Would I be able to reach down? Would I be able to reach down to my ankle? Or I'm stuck. I'm wedged. You can't move your body. 
MATT: If you want to make-- Go ahead and make a dexterity check to see if you can manage to move one arm down past. 
LAURA: Oh, lord in heaven! 
TRAVIS: Maybe don't-- You could try coming back out before you-- 
LAURA: My ankle is stuck! I can't move my foot! 
TRAVIS: Not if you break it. 
LIAM: This is the worst! 
LAURA: Dexterity check? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Slice it off. 
LAURA: 10. 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: 10? Okay. 
LIAM: Chew it off. 
MATT: You just barely get your hand past. At one point the elbow hits the rock and you're not sure if that's going to get wedged either before you manage to breathe in and exhale, and the hand slips down and you can just barely reach down to where your ankle is. 
LAURA: Okay. Can I feel what it's stuck in? 
MATT: Yeah, there is a portion where there's a sliver in the rock or a small gap that you stepped into and then wedged your foot in there. You thought you had weight as a platform, but it got stuck between these two flatter bits of stone. 
LAURA: Can I work the laces on my boots and try to take my boot off so I can pull it out of the boot? 
MATT: Yeah. So you quiet-- It takes you a good solid minute or so, but you undo the laces and then (sucks in) pull your foot free. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: So she's free? She's free now? 
MATT: Your ankle's now free. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: But you lost a shoe. 
LAURA: Well, on my way down as I try to shimmy past, I'm going to try to yank my boot. 
TRAVIS: Keep going. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. You eventually-- 
LAURA: And keep going. 
MATT: -- shimmy down another 15 or so feet before the bottoms of your feet touch something smooth and round that (squeaks) rolls for a moment, and you realize-- 
SAM: That's me! You're on me! 
LAURA: Oh, that's your wheel! Hi! 
SAM: (revving sounds) 
LAURA: I should have gone the other direction. This sucks, FCG! 
SAM: (laughs) Yeah, it sure does. Any idea how long the others are going to take? Because this is uncomfortable! 
LAURA: Uh-uh. We should keep moving though because I do not like being right here. 
SAM: No, we can't. We're waiting. 
LAURA: Especially because I'm like this right now. (groans) 
MATT: So are you still waiting in your spots? 
LAURA: Well, no. Move down! 
MATT: Or are you continuing down? 
LIAM: I will always stay 15 or 20 feet further down and listening, listening for anything. 
MATT: Okay. Your passive perception tells you that there isn't any noise at all, except for the occasional slipping stone and your friends moving up there. If you want to listen to anything in the vicinity directly, you can make a perception check for me. 
LIAM: I mean, I'm straining to hear anything. 
TRAVIS: Not with you. 
LAURA: No? 
SAM: Who should not go with? 
TRAVIS: All of us. 
LIAM: Besides natural phenomenon. 
LAURA: We should get to the bottom. 
TRAVIS: If we have to get out of there-- 
LIAM: 21. 
TRAVIS: That's the biggest pinch point. 
MATT: 21? 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I hope so. 
MATT: Nothing. 
LAURA: We should continue. Maybe we can get to the bottom before everyone else. And then Fearne, you'd be able to go back up and get them. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we should definitely continue. 
SAM: All right, we'll keep going. The three of us will keep-- 
MATT: Okay, so the three of you continue to descend. 
MARISHA: I can still send a message to you. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: If need be. I'll check in. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But the rest of you're staying up? 
TALIESIN: Well, yeah, we're giving it a second so that the tunnel clears. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That's how they die. 
MARISHA: Don't clog the water slide. 
MATT: So the three of you, I need one more athletics or acrobatics check from each of you. 
SAM: I will Guide myself. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Actually-- 
LIAM: Fearne doesn't need that, though. Oh, Fearne's going up? 
ASHLEY: That's another YouTube rabbit hole. 
LIAM: Are you-- 
MATT: Fearne is above you all because-- (laughter) 
SAM: Imogen, are you-- 
TRAVIS: They build those hatches-- 
SAM: You're bad at this. 
LAURA: I'm real bad at athletics and acrobatics. 
SAM: Well, me too, but I care about you. So through my wheel, I will Guide her. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: My foot. My foot touching your wheel. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: It's touch, right? 
LAURA: No, my foot is touching his wheel. 
MATT: Your one foot begins to glow with a warmth that is warmer than the surrounding rock. 
LAURA: Oh! What are you doing? 
SAM: I just farted on your foot. 
LAURA: Great! (laughter) 
MATT: All righty. So add a d4 to your roll. 
LIAM: 19. 
MATT: 19? 
LAURA: What are we rolling? We're rolling. 
MATT: Athletics or acrobatics. Your choice. 
LIAM: Oop! 
TALIESIN: Plus a d4. 
LAURA: Awesome! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Was that good? 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh! 
TRAVIS: That was nerd joy. 
ASHLEY: Oh! Good, good! 
TRAVIS: Double nerd joy. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, Imogen? 
LAURA: That is a 23! 
MATT: Dang! 
ASHLEY: What did you get? Did you roll really bad? 
SAM: She's going straight into me because I got an eight. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, so first, we go to Orym. 
TRAVIS: We put the metal guy down there. (laughter) 
SAM: That was a bad idea. 
MATT: You continue. It doesn't seem to get much tighter overall than it has been, just occasionally when it changes direction or begins to curve, it creates another pinch point that becomes a little challenging, but you snake through for another 50, 60 feet down-- 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: Before it eventually begins to widen up a bit. But you lose light because the orbs aren't able to follow you because Imogen, at the moment, isn't-- 
LAURA: It's within 120 feet of me, though. 
MATT: Right, but you still have to see where it's going and you're looking upward. 
LAURA: God! 
LIAM: So I'll hold and continue to listen. 
SAM: I'm pointing down and I've got lights on, shining down a little bit. 
MATT: Okay. But you do not manage to get very far. 
SAM: No, I do not. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I have blindsight for 60 feet. 
MATT: You do, but you flew up out of the cavern to get to Imogen. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
SAM: We're clogging the hole. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You're smart. 
MATT: No worries. You get about 15 feet down before (squeaks) you get wedged once more. As you're starting to panic, suddenly-- 
LAURA: FCG, why aren't you going? 
MATT: She kicks you-- 
SAM: (grunts) 
LAURA: Where's it going? 
MATT: Between your 23, which is pretty dang good, and your eight, you kick him the rest of the way through and you (thudding) 
SAM: (wails) 
MATT: Like a blockage upset. Orym, as you're looking down, all of a sudden light begins to filter in from behind you. 
LIAM: Oh, I hear this coming. 
MATT: As you hear the absolute-- 
SAM: (wails) 
MATT: -- metal on rock chaos. (laughter) 
LIAM: (ping-ponging metallic clinks) 
SAM: Pachinko. 
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
LIAM: I will-- No, I'll just take it. It's an eight. I rolled real low. 
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no! 
MATT: I want you to make strength saving throw. 
LIAM: I wanted this to happen. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Saving throw? 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: I want this to happen. 
SAM: Four. 
LAURA: Oh no! (laughter) 
LIAM: I have a feature. I could reroll, I could add to this, but this is better. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: As you sit there waiting, you hear the shout of FCG get louder, the impacts of stone and falling metal squeaking, and there's just not enough time. (laughter) 
MATT: You just sigh-- 
TRAVIS: There's just not enough time! 
MATT: -- in the quiet. (tumbling impact) 
SAM: (wails) 
MATT: As, like a bullet out of a gun, FCG smacks into the back of you and both of you go rocketing out into a small, cylindrical chamber and fall about 20 or so feet. 
SAM: Oh no! 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: You both take five points of bludgeoning damage as you-- (forceful impacts) FCG lands on top of you, Orym. 
LIAM: (groans) 
SAM: I'm sorry! 
LIAM: (grunts) 
SAM: I'm sorry! 
LIAM: Lift your wheel from my gooch! (laughter) 
SAM: I'll spin it. (wheel whirring) 
LIAM: Ow! Oh! (laughter) 
SAM: To try to get some leverage up. 
TRAVIS: People pay for that kind of cleavage. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's true. (laughter) 
MATT: And you do. It's about a 20-, 25-foot cylinder. It's on an angle. 
LIAM: Somebody give me Guidance. (laughter) 
MATT: It's about eight to 10 feet in width from all sides. It does seem to come to an end as well, and it is significantly warmer than the earlier up chambers. The air itself and the rock as you touch it, getting yourself there, it is, I'd say, getting hot to the touch. 
SAM: No egresses or no doors? No tunnels, no pathways? 
LIAM: No exits, other exits from-- 
MATT: At a quick glance, no. 
LIAM: No. 
MATT: It's just a chamber. You finally begin to climb down to the point where all of a sudden your feet find no stone. 
LAURA: Ah! Hey! What's going on? 
SAM: It's okay, you can just drop. We'll catch you. 
LIAM: Well, okay. It's a drop. 
LAURA: How far is it?! 
LIAM: It's like 15 feet, maybe 12. 
SAM: Maybe 20. 
LAURA: I feel like that was not what I-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: We'll catch you! We'll catch you! We're down here. We'll lace our fingers together and catch you. 
MARISHA: Basket catch! 
LAURA: (groans) 
MARISHA: Cheerleader shit. 
LIAM: Listen to me. 
LAURA: I might have to use another spell. How long have we been climbing? 
MATT: You've been climbing for all this conversation, probably a good 25, 30 minutes. 
LAURA: Fuck! All right. 
MATT: It's a slow climb to go through spaces like this, especially if you're not familiar with it. 
LIAM: At least we're not cold anymore! 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, that's-- I'm very hot! My armpits are sweaty. (whimpers) I'm going to just drop. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: ♪ ("Lose Yourself" bass line) ♪ 
MATT: You drop. One of you roll an athletics check. You have advantage because they're helping. 
TRAVIS: So blasé. 
MATT: Yep. 
LIAM: Okay, I'll do that. You said advantage? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: All right. I'm okay at that. Yep. Good. 22. 
MATT: 22. Both of you, together, (thump) catch Imogen without issue, and you're now standing in the same lit chamber. The rest of the light orbs-- 
LAURA: Thanks, you two! 
LIAM: Lift with the knees. 
MATT: -- descend and light up the chamber around now as well. You now-- 
LAURA: Put my boot back on. 
MATT: -- flutter down. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. So there's a little chamber. That's good. 
SAM: Bat's good. 
LAURA: Do we see an opening in this chamber? 
MATT: No, but you do look on the ground. What you thought was just rough, loose rock, and there is a lot of loose rock that's fallen and tumbled through here-- 
TALIESIN: Bigger skull. 
MATT: There are more bones. 
LAURA: Oh! Lots of bones. 
MATT: There are more skulls. There is a bunch of incinerated materials and tools and what look to have been the remains that tumbled down, as well as other bits of gold, iron, and other metals that have melted and formed over the nearby stone. 
SAM: But where's the fire coming from if there's no vents or holes or tunnels? 
LAURA: There's no hole in here. 
LIAM: How hot is the walls of this cavern we're in now? 
MATT: It's like a hot bath, where it's not to the point where it's hurting you or deeply uncomfortable, but noticeably that's warm to hot. 
LAURA: I'll start pushing-- 
LIAM: Sifting through the dead? 
LAURA: Yeah, the bones out of the way to try to clear out the floor and see if I can see an opening on the ground or anything. 
LIAM: I'll help you out. 
MATT: Okay. The bones and pieces sit out. You can see fragile short swords and other types of materials that have been slightly bowed with some sort of heat or material snap as they break against other bits of rock. What looks like parts of leather armor just turned to ash as they get blown to the side. Everything here looks like it was charred into place to a certain degree, or to the edges, and then upon any sort of an impact tends to crumble or show severe lack of strength behind its structure. 
ASHLEY: Is the char on the top of stuff? 
LAURA: I know! That's what I was just about to ask! 
ASHLEY: Or the underside of the bones and things? 
MATT: All over. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Just all over. 
TRAVIS: Char everywhere. Like a layer of soot? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Flashes of intense heat. 
ASHLEY: Could I try another keen hearing perception of trying to see if there's-- 
MARISHA: Some place is going to rumble. 
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Any tracks? 
LAURA: Tracks. 
ASHLEY: Good grief! Another one! 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MATT: 19 is better. 
LAURA: (laughs) 19 is better. 
MATT: Listening around, with a 19, you don't hear anything but you do feel an occasional vibration through the air from the rock. A very, very faint-- (soft plunk) You're not quite sure what it is, but there's the faintest odd arrhythmic vibration that occasionally emits from the rock base and the surrounding the bottom portion of the cylindrical chamber. 
ASHLEY: I'll let Imogen know. 
TRAVIS: Does it make the air move at all or is it vibration? 
MATT: I mean, you're feeling the vibration of the air from the rock. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Did we fall past any gaps or anything when we plummeted through that are higher up? 
MATT: You didn't see any, no. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: We looked at the floor, there's nothing hidden, right? 
LAURA: We searched the whole floor. 
MATT: You can make an investigation check, if you want to-- 
SAM: Please do. 
LIAM: Tracing hand all full circle around the chamber. 
LAURA: Can you Guide me? 
SAM: I can Guide you? 
LAURA: Or you look yourself, if anybody has a better investigation. 
SAM: I will Guide you. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 
SAM: Oh, great! 
LIAM: Good. 
LAURA: 24. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: 24. A few things you pick up. 
SAM: Jack Bauer. 
MATT: One, as you move things out of the way, that layer of soot and dust, the stone that makes up the bottom of this chamber is darker in color than a lot of the surrounding stone. This is more porous. Everything else around here looks like it's some sort of a heavy granite. This is like a black volcanic rock. It looks newer than the surrounding stone that is making up the bottom of this chamber. It's more jagged and the nooks and crannies of its porous top, that's where you see a lot of the broken bones and the materials and tools and stuff and some more of these bits of coins that have fused together and melted into a chunk of gold with a hint of ancient print across it. There is one single brass inscribed ring that seems to have resisted the heat, however, that sits upon a blackened, charred finger bone. 
ASHLEY: One ring to rule them all. 
LAURA: Pull that out. It's got to be magic. It couldn't get destroyed. 
SAM: I don't have-- I can't Identify. 
LIAM: Just save it. 
SAM: Oh, just save it? Okay. 
LAURA: Hold onto it. 
SAM: Sure. I mean, I can just look at it and see if I notice anything about it. 
MATT: Make an arcana check. 
MARISHA: It's got to be fire resistant. 
LAURA: I know, that's what I think. 
MARISHA: Put it on! 
SAM: Mm, 10. 
LIAM: Didn't do a lot of good for its wearer. 
MATT: 10. It's pretty. It looks like it's handled the surroundings better than some of the other materials. That's about as much as you can pick up. 
LAURA: I'm going to put it on my finger so I don't lose it right now. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: And attune to it? 
TRAVIS: Is there a handsome green body down in the corner? 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: (Fjord, raspy) Use it better than I did! (laughter) 
SAM: Just use it. Oh, wait, I have Detect Magic! 
TRAVIS: Just use it. 
SAM: I'll cast a 1st-level Detect Magic. 
LIAM: It's magic. 
LAURA: It's magic. 
MATT: Okay! 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: The ring does indeed give a modest magical aura to it. 
SAM: Anything else in the room? Chamber? 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Nothing in the chamber, but you sense this faint aura of magic that's faintly muted along the ground. 
SAM: This is magic! 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: I figured it out. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Great. 
SAM: And there's magic on the floor. 
LIAM: What do you mean? 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: I don't know, it just seems magic. The floor seems magic. I feel like there's something down there that maybe we can uncover if we either dig, or I do have a spell I could sort of shape it. 
LAURA: Try open up the ground? 
SAM: Yeah. Open up the ground. 
LAURA: What if it's a lot of lava under there and the minute you open up the ground it fills up the chamber and then we all die? 
SAM: Yeah. Yep. That is a thing. But this is porous rock. So if there were lava down there pressing on it with a lot of pressure, it would be through already! 
LAURA: Wasn't the bottom granite? 
SAM: I thought he said it was porous-- 
LAURA: But I thought the bottom was granite and around us was porous. 
MATT: Around you, most of this tunnel is granite and then the bottom becomes-- 
LAURA: Oh, the bottom becomes porous. 
MATT: -- darker, black, porous volcanic rock. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: What happens if I sort of chisel at it a little bit with Seedling? 
SAM: Poke with stick? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: I mean, the very, very edges of it flake a little bit, yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. So yeah, if we poke a hole in it, it's just lava that'll come out. 
TRAVIS: You don't know. 
SAM: It could, or it could be another chasm. 
LAURA: Okay. Yeah, try it. (laughs nervously) 
SAM: If lava starts coming, you can fly out of here. 
LAURA: Yeah. If lava starts-- 
ASHLEY: (queasy groaning) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: That is going to suck. 
LIAM: Yep, that's end of it. 
SAM: Well, I can Teleport! I've got Teleport! 
LAURA: Yeah! Yeah. 
SAM: So in an emergency-- 
LAURA: Then we'll just Teleport on out. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: All of us. 
SAM: Yeah. Right? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: Maybe you should tell everybody upstairs. 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: How long does it take to Teleport? (laughs) 
MATT: It's an action. 
LAURA: Are you down here with us, Fearne? 
SAM: It's an action. Great! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: See? We're fine! 
LIAM: Letters, you're talking about stone? 
SAM: Yeah, I can do Stone Shape. It's not a lot, but I can make five-- I can make a five-foot long column of hole. 
LIAM: Yeah, a small hole might be better. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) About this long? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: Okay. Rather than big, so if anything does come up then at least we're dealing with a little leak rather than a large one. 
SAM: Yeah. Narrow and long. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I can't do that anymore. 
LIAM: That's what they say about you. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: I can't communicate with anyone up there. 
SAM: Why? 
LAURA: Because I have a mental connection with Fearne. 
SAM: I have the Message spell. 
LAURA: Great. You should use that. 
SAM: That I never use. Okay. 
LIAM: (Morse code beeps) 
SAM: Are they 120 feet up? 120 feet above? Well, I guess I'll find out. I'll point and I'll say: Hey, Laudna. We're going to maybe open up a hole with lava in it. 
MATT: I'm going to say, because they're right on the cusp, roll a d20. On 11 or higher, they're within range. 
SAM: 16. 
LAURA: Woo! 
MATT: 16? Then yeah. 
TRAVIS: Jeez, the drop. 
MARISHA: You're going to do what now? 
MATT: (creepy whispers) Going to do what? 
SAM: We're going to open up a hole and lava might shoot out. We don't know, but just get ready. 
MARISHA: I imagine the last thing FCG hears is me turning to Ashton and Chetney, going: They're about to open up a fucking hole filled with la-- Then it cuts off. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: So glad we didn't go down. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that checks out. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to perch on Orym's shoulder and my wings and little hands at the ends of my wings, I'm going to hold on to his hair like a kid-- 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: -- when they're on the shoulders, not paying attention. 
LAURA: Oh, like little bats? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah. 
LAURA: Little bat hands? That's so cute! 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
LIAM: Yep. Hope we don't die. 
SAM: Okay. I will cast Stone Shape. 
LAURA: I hold Orym's hand. 
SAM: Your Pompeii cast is going to have a little bat on your head. (laughter) 
SAM: It can be up to five feet in any dimension. So yeah, a long cylindrical hole, but not big enough-- Just this wide, right? 
LAURA: Just a grate, a small tube. 
LIAM: Oh, that's so wide. 
SAM: This wide? 
LAURA: Yeah, just a little skinny one. 
LIAM: Yes. Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: That goes longer, right? A skinny one will go deeper? (laughs) 
SAM: It's five feet max. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: Okay. So are you putting it straight down, at an angle, to the wall? What are you doing? 
SAM: Can I actually make it-- It's going to go straight down, and can I actually start it wider and get it-- 
LAURA: Yeah, make it a cone. 
MARISHA: I'm trying to hide my eyes. 
SAM: Get it like a cone. 
TRAVIS: A little taper. 
MARISHA: That's what I'm doing. 
MATT: Yeah! 
SAM: A taper. 
MATT: I'll allow that. So you taper it almost like a five-foot wide funnel? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: That tapers down to a smaller thing. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Sure. As you concentrate, you focus on the surrounding-- 
LAURA: I back up. 
LIAM: Battle stance. 
MATT: -- earth and stone work of this mountain. You beseech the Changebringer to find and make a path where none could be found. As you finish your silent brief prayer, the rest of you hear the stone crack and shift, like a sudden collapse happens within the chamber. You watch as a whole chunk of massive volcanic rock just crumbles away into nothing, like it's falling into a sinking sand pit, but it's disappearing into shadow. As that fills up, about half of the chamber now is this funnel and you actually have to back away from it as it rapidly descends. Then about four feet down, it opens. 
SAM: (gasps) 
MATT: A glow of orangeish light opens and fills the chamber. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
LIAM: Shit. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Wait. 
SAM: Just light? 
LAURA: Light fills the chamber? 
SAM: Yeah, from the glowing lava under us. 
LIAM: From the dirt clap? 
TRAVIS: Definitely gold. 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: We begin-- 
TALIESIN: It's a lava lamp. 
LAURA: Do we see lava under? 
MATT: The air within the chamber gets immediately hotter. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
LAURA: Why-- We're so dumb. 
SAM: This is going to be fine! 
MATT: And that's it. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Okay. If we peek, do we see lava flowing? 
TRAVIS: The tone of the parent. That's like-- 
ASHLEY: How wide is the bottom of the hole? 
TRAVIS: You're doing it to yourself. 
SAM: Well, four feet. So it started five feet wide-- 
TRAVIS: You can jump on the couch if you want to. 
SAM: -- and we got four feet down. I can't do the math. Probably about a foot wide, right? 
MATT: About a foot wide, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Could I fit through it? 
MATT: You can fit through. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: We'll look, wait! Don't just fly down into lava! Look and see how far down-- Is there lava right under the hole? 
TRAVIS: You just incinerate. 
ASHLEY: (uncertain groan) 
LAURA: Can we look? 
MATT: Yeah, you can. You get down and get yourself comfortable to glance downward, and as you do, the bright sight of a pool of orange, yellow, red molten rock sits like a small lake, maybe about 20, 25 feet across in places, that sits in the middle of this large, almost pumpkin shaped empty chamber. 
LAURA: Oh. Okay. 
MATT: It is directly beneath you. 
LIAM: We were all seeing this? We were able to lean out? 
MATT: Yeah. You lean out and you can see, and as you get towards the edge and look within where the end of the rock opens up. 
SAM: Can we gauge how far the hole opening is from the actual lava? 
MATT: It's about a 40-foot drop. 
SAM: Oh, okay! So we're okay. We're okay! 
LAURA: That's great. I can cast Fly on us and we can fly-- 
SAM: ("southern") Flah. 
LAURA: Shut up. Then we can go down. 
SAM: I'll have to cast Stone Shape again to make the whole little wider for us. 
LAURA: To make it wider, yeah. 
LIAM: Is our view limited, or can we see in this chamber, is the entire floor lava or is there any-- 
SAM: The floor is lava. 
LIAM: The floor is lava. (laughter) 
LIAM: Or is there any purchase for foot? 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
ASHLEY: That would be fun to do that. 
LAURA: It's going to be so hot down there. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: That would be so fun. 
ASHLEY: I watched the new season. It was really good. 
LIAM: Rerolling a one. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, it's a really good show. 
LIAM: That's way better. 27. 
MATT: 27. 
MARISHA: Hey, "Floor is Lava," call us. 
MATT: I know, right? (laughter) 
SAM: Oh shit! That would be a great episode! 
MARISHA: Of us doing it together? 
MATT: I'm all about that. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That got us through the pandemic. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It did. 
MATT: As you glance over-- You grab the edge of it and you peer in to get a good look of the chamber below, one thing you do notice is the rock edge of the Stone Shape, as you lean in, one part flakes off. 
SAM: Whoa! 
LIAM: Hey! 
MATT: You catch yourself with the other hand and you realize the ceiling, and where you've created the cone, it's somewhat brittle around the edge. 
LAURA and SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
MATT: Means it could be broken to create a wider opening. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: Also, to take care in doing so. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: But as you catch yourself and continue to look around, the lake that's here, it's more of a pond. It is about 25, 30 feet across and it is mostly a circular lake with molten rock. You can see it cools towards the edges, and then there's dark rock-- 
LIAM: Cool. Cool, cool, cool. 
MATT: -- with occasional little veins of heated stone and bits of occasional bubbling, thrown magma. The rest of the chamber beyond that is just a wide, heavy circular chamber that surrounds it, like it's an air bubble within the stone that surrounds this small lake. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You also see little orange glowing creatures that are darting through and looking up at you. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: You see these small-- 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
LIAM: Yeah, what the fuck. 
MATT: -- impish-like humanoid thin beings with little wings and elongated heads with a pointy chin. These little burning coals for eyes that are hiding behind rocks and looking up at you. About a dozen or so. 
LIAM: So we've clearly been spotted. 
LAURA: How far away are they? 
MATT: From where you are, it's 40 feet down and they're scattered to the edges. 
LAURA: Okay, so it's-- 
MATT: So about 60 or so feet from the top. They seem curious or spooked, you're uncertain, but they're definitely trying to stay out of sight while not doing a very good job, and looking upward. The center of this lava pool that you're sitting at, there is about, at the very, very core of it, a perpetual roil. (bubbling liquid) 
TRAVIS: Water feature. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Occasionally it spits a small chunk of magma that arcs up close to the top and then lands back down or spatters outside of the lake and hits and glows for a second as it slowly cools. 
LIAM: Orym backs up. I really think we need to decide what we're doing here. Are we waiting for the others to come down? There's things down there and not a lot of place to stand. 
SAM: But there is a place to stand and we could fly down there and-- 
LAURA: We could fly down. How about send another Message up to them and let them know we're going to go through a tiny hole into a lake of lava now. 
SAM: Good news! Lava didn't kill us. It's down below us. We're going to fly down and land near it. 
MARISHA: Wait, what? Are you absolutely insane? Why don't you wait 'til we get there? 
ALL: (echoing whispers) 
SAM: She said we should wait for them. Well, she's mad. She's mad. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: I think we should wait for them. 
LAURA: Okay. Well, come on down, then. 
SAM: Okay. All right. (laughter) 
SAM: Come on down. 
LAURA: She's got Feather Fall. 
MARISHA: I imagine you once again hear me talking to Ashton and Chetney, going: You would not believe what they are doing! 
TALIESIN: No, but if we jump at an angle. 
LAURA: Yeah, but if all of us get into this chamber, we've already weakened the ground, it might just collapse. The most of people I can make fly is three. 
SAM: I could, in addition to using Stone Shape to widen the hole, I could make a Stone Shape that is a water slide (laughs) so we shoot out that way as we go. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. At an angle? 
SAM: You know? At an angle. 
LAURA: So that we could Feather Fall-- 
SAM: (whoosh) 
LAURA: -- down to the ground. 
LIAM: What could go wrong? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That sounds like-- 
TALIESIN: Foolproof. 
ASHLEY: -- the best idea. 
LAURA: You're really smart. Your mathematics won't fail us. 
TRAVIS: That's playground logic. I can take this slide and jump the monkey bars. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: I've worked it out. (laughter) 
SAM: Honey, how'd you get that bloody lip? (laughter) 
MATT: All right. So what's the plan? 
TALIESIN: I'll head down. 
LAURA: They're coming down. 
MATT: All right, so. 
MARISHA: We're going to go down. 
MATT: The rest of the crew-- 
SAM: We have a stone man with us, we'll be fine! 
MATT: -- I need you to roll two separate checks. The first one, roll an athletics or acrobatics, each of you. 
MARISHA: I still have Spider Climb, so can I use that? I'm going to go head first to contort and Spider Climb along the ceiling around. 
MATT: Correct, yeah. Still roll, but you have a much lower DC based on both your-- The two of you have smaller forms. Hers just thin and spindly, yours just being tiny gnome boy. 
TRAVIS: But svelte. 
MATT: But svelte. Yeah. No, don't get me wrong, I'm not misrepresenting your-- 
TRAVIS: Thank you. (washboards abs) 
MATT: -- tightness. 
MARISHA: Oh, boy. 
ASHLEY: (washboards abs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (washboards abs) (blows raspberry) (abs deflate) 
MARISHA: Why does this keep happening to me? 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: Say it. 
MARISHA: I rolled a two. 
ASHLEY: No! 
TRAVIS: Oh, but your-- But your amazing athletics is a-- 
MARISHA: Well, I'm doing acrobatics, so four. 
MATT: Four, got it. 
TALIESIN: I'm debating trying to shove my way down and actually rage a little bit of this to see if I can widen the hole as I'm going down. 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. 
MATT: Up to you. 
TALIESIN: Fuck it. 
MARISHA: Well, I think I was going first. Right? 
TALIESIN: Actually, I thought I was going first. 
LAURA: No, she already-- 
MARISHA: You're going first? 
TALIESIN: You already went, though. 
TRAVIS: Boulder, Parchment, Shears or Rollies. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: All right. Ashton goes first. 
MARISHA: Ashton goes first. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: You bastard. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
LAURA: You're like: How do I fail this? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll burn a rage trying to see if I can actually force my way through anything. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, Ashton won! 
MARISHA: (fawning) Oh no! 
MATT: So roll athletics with advantage. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm also so curious to see what-- 
TRAVIS: Raging in a jackknife? 
TALIESIN: My rage is not-- It's more of an internal smolder. Just a lot of swearing. Nat 20. 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
MATT: For a total of? 
TALIESIN: 28. 
MATT: 28. Okay. 
TALIESIN: With space, I might add, so I also have the wormhole shit. 
MATT: Being both a strong figure and of earthen blood, of titan blood specifically, the stone and you seem to have an unspoken arrangement as each impasse you would come to, you just-- Well, are you headfirst or leg first? 
TALIESIN: Headfirst. 
MATT: Headfirst, you pull the rock free and it snaps and leaves a larger opening. At another point you pull another piece forward and one rock's right in front of your head and you headbutt it and it smashes off. You are like a mole digging through the ground as you begin to, hand over hand, carve this into a wider space, which I will say with a natural 20 will allow you to roll with advantage on your roll since you didn't go first. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: If you had gone first, it would've been a different scenario. 
MARISHA: It'll take it. 
MATT: Because he's specifically widening the hole, I'll allow it. 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. 10! 
MATT: Okay, that's better than four. 
MARISHA: It is. It's still not great, but better. 
MATT: But you had a much lower DC because you're so thin and because you had Spider Climb on. So it gets a bit precarious a few times, but Ashton is definitely carving the path forward. 
TALIESIN: With gravel coming out of the portal hole in my head as I'm going down. 
MARISHA: I occasionally will dislocate my arm to contort. 
TALIESIN: One assumed. 
TRAVIS: I'm heading back up. I'm not following these idiots. 
MATT: You're not following them? 
TRAVIS: Nope, I'm going back up to the surface. See y'all later. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Bye. (laughter) 
LAURA: Really? 
TRAVIS: No, I rolled a 14. 
LAURA: Oh. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. At a couple moments-- 
TRAVIS: I really want to, though. Seems so stupid. (laughs) 
MATT: At a couple moments, you watch as Laudna dislodges bones from sockets to fit through some areas, but then forgets to put them back in and you catch up and have to help pop them back into space. 
TRAVIS: You left this. 
MARISHA: This is my hip. 
TRAVIS: That's a hip? 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Thought it was your ankle. 
LIAM: Letters and Laudna can both disassemble themselves. 
TALIESIN: Different toolkit. 
MATT: For the remainder of this journey, which has become slightly easier thanks to Ashton's burrowing, which is practically what it is, I need one more check from all three of you. 
TALIESIN: Do I still have the rage or have I dropped the rage? 
MATT: You've dropped the rage. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: But the DC's lower. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: 22! 
MATT: 22. 
MARISHA: Nine. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 27. 
MATT: 27. Okay. So the DC was lowered and this-- Laudna sandwiched between the two of you heading down here becomes this perpetual choke point beyond the natural rock choke point. 
TRAVIS: Move. Hurry up. Hurry up! 
MARISHA: Be patient! 
TRAVIS: If I push too hard on your skull, I feel like it's going to give. 
MATT: But eventually, you do emerge towards the top of the chamber where the others are and begin to climb down to meet them. You're all pretty jam packed. This is a tight chamber and you can see the orange glow that spills out from the opening in the bottom of this slightly angled cylindrical room. 
TRAVIS: Why are we down here? Have you gotten eyes on something? 
LAURA: We have a hole in the ground that we can go through and there's a lake of lava underneath us. 
SAM: There's doompa-loompas down there. 
TRAVIS: That's what we came down for? Doompa-loompas? And a lake of magma? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MARISHA: What's a doompa-loompa? 
SAM: It's an evil oompa-loompa. 
LAURA: It's like little orange fire people. 
TRAVIS: Are you sure the shard is down here? 
LAURA: Uh-uh. 
TRAVIS: We're not just going into a lava bed? 
LAURA: Can't you locate things? 
SAM: If I prepared it today, let's find out. Objects or creatures? 
LAURA: Objects. Can you locate a shard of-- 
SAM: If I'm familiar with it? Let's see here, did I prepare Locate-- 
TRAVIS: A shard nigh. 
SAM: What? Hmm? 
LAURA: Huh? Hmm? My foot got stuck. 
MARISHA: I had to crack every joint to get through. It was not great. 
SAM: Oh, also I could have done that thing where we can all talk to each other. 
LAURA: I know, I could've done that, too. I realized it when I was here and I was like, "Well, too late now." 
LIAM: This was the time. 
MARISHA: Has anyone tried to talk to the doompa-loompas? 
LAURA: Not yet. 
SAM: But Fearne could fly down there and become a not bat. 
LAURA: And talk to them. She could become a doompa-loompa. 
SAM: She could! 
TRAVIS: How large are those things? 
LAURA: Once you see it. 
TRAVIS: That are flying? 
MATT: They're maybe a foot and a half, two feet tall? 
LAURA: I don't think they'd be out and about. 
MATT: They're very thin and like-- 
SAM: They could be living lava elemental something? 
MARISHA: Pâté speaks Infernal. 
SAM: Pâté! 
TRAVIS: Small beasts? 
MATT: They'd be small. 
TRAVIS: But not beasts. 
MATT: You don't know 
TRAVIS: Fair. 
MARISHA: He'd last for about three seconds before he poofs. 
ASHLEY: Should I go down there, Imogen? 
LAURA: Yeah, fly on down. See what happens. 
TRAVIS: Just try and stay above the landing area. because if they attack you and you get hurt, you're going to fall. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. If they shoot stuff up. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: As soon as you get in, go to the edge so you're not above the lake. 
ASHLEY: All right. All right. 
TALIESIN: Squeak, squeak. 
LAURA: We'll open up the hole more. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Squeak, squeaks, motherfucker ♪ ♪ Squeak, squeak ♪ 
MATT: So you descend? 
MARISHA: ♪ Oh squeak, squeak, squeak ♪ 
ASHLEY: Just really slowly. 
MARISHA: ♪ Goddamn ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Damn ♪ 
MATT: Lowering within, it is very hot in this chamber. Especially your snow bat form is not made for this high temperature. It's not to the point where you're taking damage, but you are very uncomfortable. But you flutter off to the side and you can see the handful of creatures on this side of the chamber crouch lower. 
ASHLEY: I'll get on a rock and hang upside down and look. 
MATT: You're hanging atop the chamber. They just look at you. You can hear them talking, but the sound of them talking sounds less like language and more like someone grinding two stones together with a hint of a flint catching on a match. It's this like (searing) 
SAM: That's awesome. 
ASHLEY: Do I recognize it or it's their own little language? 
MATT: Well, let's see. What languages do you speak? 
ASHLEY: Common, Deep Speech, Druidic, Infernal, Sylvan, and Thieves' Cant. 
MATT: You do not know what they're saying. 
ASHLEY: Damn it. Okay, I'm down here. 
TALIESIN: We can't hear this, can we? 
MATT: No, you're not within the chamber. 
ASHLEY: I'm down here. They're just looking at me right now, but I think they're talking to each other. 
LAURA: They don't look like they're about to attack you or anything? 
SAM: Come back up here! I can cast Tongues on you! 
LAURA: FCG is saying to come back up. 
ASHLEY: Okay. (fluttering) I'll just land on you. I'll touch you and I'll cast Tongues on you. Now you can speak their language! 
LAURA: But she can't speak, she's a bat! 
SAM: But you can un-bat! She can un-bat! 
LAURA: Then she'll be stuck down there! What if they attack her? 
SAM: She can turn into a bat again, right? 
LIAM: That's called re-batting. 
ASHLEY: I can't Wild Shape again. I could Polymorph myself, I guess, if I needed to get back up. Imogen-- 
TRAVIS: This is the big question. You got options. 
MARISHA: Can't you use two Wild Shapes at this point? 
ASHLEY: I used one already today. 
SAM: She's going to be so good at talking to them, it's not going to matter! 
TALIESIN: This is now how we die. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You could always take a short rest in the middle of the cavern, if you'd like. 
LAURA: We could widen up the hole and fly down and fly above them and talk to them? All of us could fly in. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's just go. 
SAM: All of us could fly? 
TRAVIS: They're not attacking. 
SAM: Is that possible? 
LAURA: I can cast Fly on three people. 
LIAM: Laudna can climb the walls. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
LAURA: Yeah. So Ashton can carry Chet, I can carry Orym, and you can fly on your own. 
SAM: I can? 
LAURA: If I cast it on you. 
SAM: Oh, oh, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: They seem to be pretty friendly because they're not doing anything to me. 
LAURA: All right. Then widen the hole. 
SAM: I'll widen the hole. Am I going to do Tongues on her or we're all going to go talk? 
ASHLEY: I would go cast Tongues on someone. 
SAM: Someone still needs Tongues! 
LIAM: Ashton might be able to widen the hole and not spend any of-- 
LAURA: Yeah, true. Ashton can widen the hole. Okay, so somebody who's good at talking to people. 
SAM: I mean, I love talking to Fearne. She's great. 
TALIESIN: Also, we don't know what they're speaking, so maybe somebody already speaks it. So we might be fine. 
MARISHA: Just be careful when you're widening-- 
LAURA: Cast it on her. Cast it on her. 
TALIESIN: If we wait long enough, we can also throw Chetney's dead body down there. 
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, it's so hot! Are we doing anything? 
SAM: Oh, it is hot. It is hot. 
TRAVIS: For fuck's sake. 
ASHLEY: It's even hotter in here. 
LAURA: The longer we stay, the greater chance we have that this thing's going to explode on us. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Let's go. 
LIAM: High temperatures affect the elderly first. 
TRAVIS: It's true! ♪ Think of me! ♪ 
LAURA: Okay. Right as Ashton-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ Think of me fondly ♪ 
LAURA: -- hits it, I'm going to wait 'til he makes contact and then I'm going to cast Fly. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it a good-- 
LAURA: Just climb onto me, Orym, before I cast Fly so you're up. 
LIAM: Okay, yeah. Backpack. 
TALIESIN: On the count of three. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll strength check for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm in charge. 
TALIESIN: Good old fashioned strength check! 
ASHLEY: That's fine. 
TALIESIN: Nope. That didn't work. That was a natural one. 
TRAVIS: Aren't you raging? 
MATT: That was a natural one? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: It does work. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
MATT: You (loud thud) and as you hit the stone, the entire floor of the cylinder falls out from under all of you. 
TRAVIS: Oh god! Literally the worst thing! 
MARISHA: I was on the wall! 
MATT: Right, so you hold onto the wall. 
LAURA: I had said the minute he made contact, I was casting. 
MATT: Thank goodness you did, as rapidly the entire floor of this chamber (rumble) falls from under all of you. As you yell for a second, you catch yourself floating in the air in the middle of this chamber. You all drop about five feet. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: It's time! This is it! 
LIAM: Where were you when that happened? 
TALIESIN: On me. 
LIAM: On you when you were hammering? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, because we were going to do it right when it cracked. 
LIAM: Okay, good. 
MATT: Yeah, so he was holding onto him. 
TRAVIS: Princess Leia on your leg. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: You all float, now in the middle of this chamber, above this 30-foot pool of molten roiling rock with this centerpiece (thick boiling). 
MARISHA: I skitter in. Hugging the walls. 
TALIESIN: Does there seem to be a good place for everyone to-- 
LIAM: It's definitely not-- 
LAURA: I'm going to not be over the lake. 
LIAM: Not hover over the center. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, is there a place that looks like there's good footing for a bunch of us? 
MATT: Oh, yeah. Just beyond that pool, there is a heavy ring around it of rock, of cooled rock that is not molten. 
TALIESIN: All right, heading to whatever is the most strategically advantageous chunk of that. 
LAURA: As we're looking around, do we see, is there an opening in the chamber anywhere? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: It's made of babies. (laughter) 
MARISHA: What sick fuck is this? 
LAURA: 17. 
TALIESIN: Hey. 
MATT: 17. Best you can see, none. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: It is an entirely closed-off little chamber. 
TRAVIS: If we fucking came down here for no reason. 
MARISHA: Wait, I thought you said there were little splintering tunnels. 
LAURA: We have to go through the lava. 
TRAVIS: I'm ready. 
MATT: Mm-mm. Not in here, no. It's an open pumpkin-shaped bubble that surrounds this pool of lava. 
LAURA: Well, maybe these little creatures will know where the shard is. 
TRAVIS: I take out one of the little failed Chetneys. Not one of eight, not one of the collector's additions. They were damaged in creation. I'll (pings) into the middle of it. 
MATT: Into the middle? 
TRAVIS: Yep. (searing flame) 
TRAVIS: It's lava. 
LAURA: Thank you, Chet. 
TALIESIN: Wow. That's good to know. 
TRAVIS: Scientific process. Most don't understand it. 
ASHLEY: Did we land yet? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: How are they behaving now that we're in here with them? 
MATT: As you've landed, they've all hidden even further and are peeking around bits of stone. 
ASHLEY: They're scared. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it a go. 
LAURA: Give what a go? Don't talk to them! 
TALIESIN: Why not? 
LAURA: Because you suck at talking! Don't be the first person to start talking! 
MARISHA: She's got a point, Ashton. 
ASHLEY: He did put Tongues on me, but maybe you could-- Do you want to put it on him instead? 
TALIESIN: Oh, god no. 
LAURA: Just talk! Just say we're looking for the shard! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: I guess you cast Tongues on her? 
SAM: I did. 
MATT: You've transformed back? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Does it hold over? 
LAURA: Sorry, Ashton. You're a wonderful person with so many good qualities! 
TALIESIN: Oh, don't just fucking start. Just don't fucking start. 
SAM: I can cast Tongues on more than one person. If you guys both-- 
TALIESIN: I don't want anyone to know what I'm thinking, what I'm saying, or otherwise. I barely want to know what they're thinking. 
LIAM: Let's dip a toe in the lava, okay? Just let Fearne start talking. 
TALIESIN: Too soon. Too soon. Too soon. 
ASHLEY: I'll try to walk up and get a little closer. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: In a safe spot. 
SAM: ♪ Just a little closer ♪ 
ASHLEY: Hello? Hello? Excuse me. 
MATT: Three of them lean out and look at each other. (quiet muttering) You hear them being like, "I can hear her!" "Oh, that's new!" "I know!" 
ASHLEY: I can hear you, too. This is weird. 
MATT: The three of them step out a bit and you can see them closer up. They look like tiny, thin, Jack Skellington elves made of red stone with molten eyes and little flames flicker off their body. 
LAURA: They're so cute! 
ASHLEY: I love them! 
MATT: They have these little fiery wings that are folded up, but as they step out towards you, they hop a little bit and the wings (whooshing) and they can just hop. The three of them get really close to you and look up at you. 
ASHLEY: You are darling! This is so weird. I'm speaking their language. I'm speaking their language? 
SAM: You are, you are. 
ASHLEY: I'm speaking their language. 
SAM: You sound crazy. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Is it Primordial or no? 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: Okay, cool. 
TRAVIS: Is it Magma? 
MATT: What languages do you understand? 
TALIESIN: Common, Marquesian, and Primordial. That's my triple. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: It's Thieves' Cant, isn't it? 
ASHLEY: I have Thieves' Cant. Hi. So we are trying to get to a-- Am I going to go right into this? Hold on two seconds. 
SAM: Small talk first? 
ASHLEY: Small talk? 
MATT: You can see the-- 
ASHLEY: How's your day? How's it going? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: There's lava in the room with us. I think you could skip the small talk. (laughs) 
MARISHA: How's your day? 
MATT: "Okay." 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "Pretty uneventful." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You watch as another large clump of rock flies out of the central burbling fountain and (sizzling) hits the ground and expands. As it cools, it cracks open. You watch as another one of those creatures-- 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: -- emerges out of it. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: They're born from the-- 
LIAM: Where did that fire from? From the middle? 
MATT: From the middle of it, yeah. 
LIAM: From the middle, okay. 
LAURA: It creates-- 
SAM: It's making new ones. 
LIAM: Or it's coming from another place. 
ASHLEY: This kind of reminds me of something. 
LAURA: Another dimension? 
SAM: Oh, it's like a mini portal or something. 
ASHLEY: Orym. 
LIAM: Hmm? 
ASHLEY: Remember when we went to that one place and there was a lot of fire, and then we stuck our hands in and then Mister came out? 
LIAM: Yeah, that was Emon. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: I thought that was something only you could do. I don't know if you should do it now. 
ASHLEY: That wasn't lava. 
LAURA: Are you immune to fire or something? 
LIAM: Because I want you to have hands. 
ASHLEY: No, not at all. I'll probably die like that. 
MATT: About 16 more of these creatures begin to emerge from little alcoves and folds in the surrounding darkened rock of the chamber walls. They all come out-- 
TALIESIN: Let's establish the relationship. 
MATT: -- curiously but slowly. 
TALIESIN: Are we cool? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. 
MATT: You watch as one of them-- 
ASHLEY: I believe so. 
MATT: -- steps forward, and then its color darkens and it crumples into stone. The others don't really notice or make any mind of it. 
MARISHA: Wait, one of them just kicked the bucket? 
SAM: Died? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Is that because it got far away from the pool? 
TALIESIN: Maybe they just age. 
MARISHA: They just have three-hour lifespans. 
LAURA: Aw, a short little lifespan? 
SAM: Oh, like house flies or something? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: That's so sad. 
TRAVIS: (sarcastically) Oh no. 
TALIESIN: May fly. 
ASHLEY: We're not here to hurt you or anything. I have a question. Is there a way out of here? 
MATT: The three that are looking at you look up towards the hole that you made in the ceiling and go, "Probably." 
ASHLEY: Is there possibly another way? Like the lava shoots up and then we can go in, or? Is there another way? 
MATT: "I don't know. We've just always been here. The elder. The elder might know." 
ASHLEY: Who's the elder? Before you go get-- 
MATT: They all point over. 
ASHLEY: Before you go get the elder, who's the elder? 
TRAVIS: The dude's like two hours old. 
MATT: They point over in the direction of the one that just crumpled. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: They go, "Oh." (laughter) 
MATT: "You're the new elder." They point to one of the three who's next to him and goes, "I'm the new elder!" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. 
MATT: All the other ones go-- (applause) 
LIAM: That means he's two and a half hours old. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
ASHLEY: Have you heard of something called the shard of Ka'Mort? No? I shouldn't have said this? 
SAM: No, you should have said it, but-- 
LAURA: No, it's good! 
MATT: They look at each other confused. 
TALIESIN: That's the wrong shard for this place. 
MARISHA: It's the wrong shard. 
ASHLEY: That's the wrong shard. Wrong shard. Sorry. 
LAURA: Oh, it is? 
ASHLEY: That's not what I mean. 
LAURA: The shard. 
ASHLEY: That's what's in you. 
SAM: Oh. We need the shard of-- 
ASHLEY: My bad. Hang on. 
TRAVIS: Rau'shan. 
MARISHA: Rau'shan. 
SAM: Rau'shan. 
ASHLEY: The shard of Rau'shan. I'm very sorry I said it wrong. 
MATT: When you say the name Rau'shan, all of their eyes light up and their small, crooked, rocky grins widen. All the other ones that were slowly scattering, that were looking at the rest of you, all of them shift over and look in the direction of Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Rau'shan? 
MATT: "The creator." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Right. Do you know where the shard is? You do? 
MATT: "Tales are told of those who have come before. It births us. Look." They point to the very center of the lava where that (thick bubbling) roiling fountain is. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I had a feeling. 
ASHLEY: I do, too. So the shard is in there? 
MATT: "(unknowing grunt)" 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: "It's where we came from." 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: I wonder if we take the shard, does that mean that they-- 
ASHLEY: Will they die? 
SAM: Are we taking the shard or just communing with it or something? 
LAURA: I think we take the shard. The other shard got put into Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to stick out my finger to one of them and say: Would you mind touching my finger? 
LAURA: (mouth fart) 
MATT: It touches your finger. It's like touching a hot stove, but you are familiar with heat. While the pain hits, it doesn't cause you to recoil heavily. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Being a wildfire druid. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TRAVIS: Into the hot stuff. 
LAURA: Okay. I could try-- 
ASHLEY: What should I ask? What should I ask? 
SAM: I don't know. Oh, I guess you could ask, does the lava ever stop for a while, or does it calm down? 
ASHLEY: Oh, good idea. 
MARISHA: Or does it explode? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Do they remember anything before they are here? 
TALIESIN: That would be a big one. 
LIAM: Are they coming from somewhere else? 
MARISHA: Yeah, another dimension? 
ASHLEY: Okay. Where do you come from? Do you come from somewhere else, like another dimension type of a situation? 
MATT: They all look at each other and the new elder goes, "We are born from the spark." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Do you remember before all of this, what was here? 
LAURA: Are we going to kill them if we take it? 
MATT: "No." 
ASHLEY: No. 
MARISHA: Maybe whoever takes it can just-- 
ASHLEY: What happens to the lava? Does it explode sometimes? Make a big boom? 
MATT: "Tales have been passed down of times where it went very boom." 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Tales. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Does it ever calm down? 
MARISHA: Tales from eight hours ago. 
ASHLEY: Does it ever calm down? 
LIAM: Ancient history. 
ASHLEY: Relax, you know? 
MATT: "After the boom." 
ASHLEY: After the boom. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Great. 
TRAVIS: How do you get in the lava? 
ASHLEY: How often does it boom? 
LIAM: You don't. 
MATT: "The tales have been passed down-- 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: "-- from ancient times." 
ASHLEY: Well, when-- 
TALIESIN: A month or so. 
MARISHA: Yeah, a week. 
ASHLEY: When you were born, do you know how much time passes from when you turn into-- 
MATT: "What is time?" 
LAURA: Time. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
TALIESIN: There's no-- 
MATT: "Do you know time?" "I don't know time. Do you know time?" 
SAM: Were they born-- 
ASHLEY: It's a strange thing anyway. 
SAM: -- before we made the hole in the rock? 
TALIESIN: No one? Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, yes. 
SAM: Or after? 
SAM: Has it been 10 minutes since they been born? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's what I was trying to get at. 
TRAVIS: We got to get the fuck out of here. 
MARISHA: It's going to go boom. 
ASHLEY: Were you here when-- How do I ask this? Were you here before we came through the hole? 
MATT: "Yes." 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: "You are new arrivals." 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But were you here a very long time before we came? 
MATT: "I am the elder." 
ASHLEY: You're the elder. Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Have they seen anyone else like us? 
ASHLEY: Are we the first-- Have you seen anyone else that's come down here that looks like us? 
MATT: "I have not, but the elder before me saw others that came before." 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: If I pick up the elder and put him back in the lava, will he come back? 
MATT: "I don't know." 
TALIESIN: Money's on no. 
MARISHA: Can we Speak with Dead with the coals? 
ASHLEY: With the coals? 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: "Others have come and they angered the spark." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "And then fire." All the others go, "Fire." 
LAURA: Then it exploded. 
SAM: How do we get the spark? 
SAM: I want to get in the park. 
TRAVIS: How do you go into a lava pit? 
SAM: Well, I mean, we do have a stone man with us. 
LAURA: We have a stone man that could melt. 
MARISHA: You have reached into fire before to pull out Mister. 
ASHLEY: Well, I have, but I don't think it's the same thing. 
TRAVIS: You think you could go into liquid rock, Ashton? 
LAURA: My Telekinesis is pretty strong. I feel like I could maybe use it to hold it back. 
SAM: I've got some Stone Shape. I also have- 
MARISHA: I've got some ice. 
SAM: We've got Blink. 
LIAM: Ice. 
SAM: I mean, not Blink, sorry. Misty Step. 
LAURA: Misty Step. 
TRAVIS: This is so bad. 
ASHLEY: Could we use the hole as protection or something with the boom? 
MARISHA: Oh, will you ask him-- 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, because-- Yeah. 
MARISHA: Does it vibrate? What happens right before a boom? 
ASHLEY: Okay. How do you know when a boom is going to happen? Does it fill the whole chamber or is it straight up and down and then it goes away? 
MATT: "It has filled the chamber, everything with fire." 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: "They call it the fire of which we are born." 
SAM: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: Everybody needs to get out of here, except only people that have any chance of doing something. I am already climbing out. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Here's the question. We're going to need a way out of here. 
SAM: Of course. 
TALIESIN: Do we have a plan on how do we get out? 
SAM: We have Teleport. 
TRAVIS: The hole in the roof. 
LAURA: We have the teleportation-- 
LIAM: But it's the top of a chamber that's like this. 
TALIESIN: I'm about to do some shit. 
TRAVIS: Oh god. 
LAURA: We have the staff of teleportation. 
TALIESIN: Okay. How long does that take? 
LAURA: It's instantaneous. 
SAM: An action. 
TALIESIN: Okay, it's all of us? 
LAURA: But here's the thing. Didn't you just use it? Have you used it? 
SAM: Today, I have not. 
LAURA: No, you used it to do another spell. 
SAM: That was yesterday. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: I checked and I have eight charges. 
LAURA: Okay, you have enough? 
SAM: Full charges. I'm ready to rock. 
TALIESIN: So can you tell them that I'm going to go over towards the-- 
LAURA: Are you going to try to touch the lava? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. Let's see what happens. 
ASHLEY: All right. Is there a warning that happens before it goes boom? Have you heard any tales? 
SAM: Do you have ice stuff? 
TRAVIS: There's never a warning before it goes boom. 
MATT: They all look at the elder and the elder goes, "Probably a rumble?" 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Yeah, a rumble. 
ASHLEY: That makes sense. 
SAM: Okay. Laudna has some ice stuff. 
TRAVIS: But if it's too much ice-- 
TALIESIN: Whatever you're going to do, I'm getting ready to do it now. 
TRAVIS: -- and it starts to boil and steam. 
LIAM: Are we sure there's no other path out of here? 
SAM: She needs to make a little rock for a second, just to get us down in there. 
MATT: You can make an investigation check. 
SAM: Or to get him down in there. 
LAURA: I can try to part it. 
MATT: To do an in-depth check for a pattern, it'll take you a good 15 minutes to go around. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Her flight spell will end in that time. 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: I could try to grab the shard with my-- 
MARISHA: No one has-- 
MATT: Which has about five more minutes on it, by the way. 
MARISHA: -- any type of protective spell? 
LAURA: I could try to-- 
TRAVIS: Ashton, what are you thinking? 
LAURA: The thing is, it'll explode. I think if we fuck with it, it's going to just (explodes). 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: While they're talking, I'm starting to find-- 
SAM: We just need to touch it. 
TALIESIN: -- the closest-- 
LAURA: Do we? 
TALIESIN: -- straight walk into where it is. 
TRAVIS: Straight into the lava? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, closest to that bubbling point. 
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
TRAVIS: Hey, he's going. 
SAM: Before you go, before you go, can we review the legend we were told? 
TALIESIN: Get your shit together. 
SAM: It was something about there's two shards, there's two people, there's a gatekeeper and a key master. 
LIAM: Right, one shard-- 
MARISHA: The emperor and the empress. 
LIAM: Ka'Mort's shard is already in Ashton. Then there's Rau'shan's that is here, we think, and we were warned that if the same vessel holds both, it could break the vessel. Could. 
LAURA: Yeah, so-- 
SAM: Could. What is the upside to this shard? 
LIAM: Mighty Morphin Power Ranger powers. 
LAURA: You become like a vessel of fire, basically. 
SAM: So possibly immune to the things that could kill us in this room. 
LAURA: Right. 
MARISHA: He also said that the shard in Ashton is dormant. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: So what I'm saying is maybe we don't have to take the shard. Maybe the shards just have to touch, complete a yin yang thing, and then it's activated. 
TALIESIN: Anybody got anything that's going to help? I'm going to go in there and I'm going to find this thing. 
TRAVIS: Go, man. Go, man, go! 
SAM: We got to make you a path. We got to freeze a path for you. You can't just go in. 
TALIESIN: Figure out what you need to do. 
LAURA: You're just going to walk into the lava? 
MATT: You still have Fly on him, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Five more minutes. 
LAURA: Fly lasts for 10 minutes. 
MATT: Yeah, so you've got five more minutes. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to cast Guidance on you. 
TALIESIN: Guidance I'll take. 
ASHLEY: This is my friend. He's great. He's just going to check some stuff out. 
LAURA: As you fly close to it-- 
MATT: They look towards you, and they all speak in Terran, which you don't understand, I don't think. It sounds like gargling quarry rock. They all speak to you at this like they expect you to know. 
LAURA, TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: (chanting) Rock, rock, rock, rock! 
SAM: I'm going to Sympathetically Bind to you. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: So that I-- 
ASHLEY: I died in this episode. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: As a bonus-- 
MATT: Who else do you bind to with that? 
SAM: Oh, I guess I can do three people, right? Three people? Three people. I'll do Ashton, I'll do Imogen since it seems like she's going to be doing stuff that will help us. 
TALIESIN: ♪ It's going to be crazy ♪ 
SAM: And I'll do Laudna, since you're going to do some ice stuff. 
MARISHA: Sure. 
SAM: I think as a bonus action, I can give him four extra hit points. 
LIAM: Yep. 
SAM: (laughs weakly) 
LIAM: That'll do it. 
SAM: If you wait a second, I could also cast Enhance Ability on you. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: I will use, I think, Bear's Endurance? 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
SAM: Gaining you another 2d6 extra temporary hit points, although those don't stack, so the first four I gave him are going to go away. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Do we know if the slickshimmer oil is flammable? (laughs) 
MARISHA: Mm. 
SAM: Okay, you have seven extra hit points now. 
MATT: You can make an intelligence check to try and gather through scent. 
SAM: And you have advantage on constitution checks. 
MARISHA: Oy. 
TRAVIS: Seven. 
TALIESIN: Advantage on con. 
MATT: Could be. 
LIAM: Seems like a spell barrier. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Not a reality barrier. But that's Otiluke's. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Anything else? 
MARISHA: All right, let's see what we can do. 
TALIESIN: If you're going to do cool, I would say do cool-- 
LAURA: Oh wait! Wait, wait! 
TALIESIN: -- right into the center of that shit. 
LAURA: If I do Telekinesis, it's going to drop Fly. 
TALIESIN: Then don't do Telekinesis. 
LAURA: Flying is better? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go in and I'm going to do what I'm going to do. 
SAM: She's going to do some ice for you. She's going to do some ice for you. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to do a Ray of Frost into the center of this thing to try and cool it off. I don't know-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: If you just "Terminator 2" this thing, I'm going to fucking laugh. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: You shoot your Ray of Frost, which is a cantrip, right? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah. Ray of Frost into the center and you see the extremely bright orangeish yellow center of the roiling, it darkens where the ray hits and you watch as the immediately cooled stone cracks and breaks and is folded back into the surrounding roiling molten rock. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it ain't freezing shit. 
LIAM: Yeah. It's lava. It's fucking lava. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Ashton, you're a wonderful person. 
TALIESIN: Fuck you too. 
SAM: Are you saying goodbye? 
MARISHA: It's been-- 
TALIESIN: I'm going. 
MARISHA: -- nice knowing-- Bye! 
TRAVIS: Are you death-flagging him? 
MARISHA: Yeah, a little bit. 
MATT: Just flying towards it? 
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to try and delve down, unless there's anything else to do. 
LAURA: Dive into the lava?! 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes. 
LAURA: Ashton! 
TRAVIS: It doesn't kill you instantly. It just makes damage. Let him rock it. 
LIAM: How about a-- 
ASHLEY: Fire Shield, which I know is for self, is that something that I can cast on somebody else? 
MATT: Does it say self as the-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately no. 
TALIESIN: Unless you want to do it. 
SAM: Ashton. Here's that $5 I owed you. 
TALIESIN: Right on. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Give him the ring. Give him the ring, it survived! 
SAM: Oh, the ring! The ring! 
LAURA: Okay, here. I don't know, put it on. But you should attune to it. It's not going to do anything unless you attune. 
TALIESIN: Short rest and fucking-- 
TRAVIS: Maybe it doesn't need attunement. 
SAM: He's just going. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) I'm going to try it. The worst thing that happens, I can fly out. 
LIAM: The worst thing that happens is you evaporate. 
ASHLEY: Well, I'm going to get close and I can always reach-- 
SAM: But that ring will help him. We should take a short rest. 
LAURA: We don't know if that ring will help. 
LIAM: Fly will be gone-- 
LAURA: Most magical items don't get ruined in fire. 
LIAM: -- in three and a half minutes. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Get in there. 
SAM: Okay, you're right. You're right. 
LAURA: It could be anything. 
MATT: So-- 
TALIESIN: I'm going to breathe deep. I'm going to try and concentrate. 
LIAM: Oh my god. 
SAM: This is great. 
TRAVIS: It doesn't kill you instantly. 
TRAVIS: We'll know if it's wrong. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, well, you'll know quick. 
TRAVIS: (heavy exhale) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Is that what happens in the real world? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
SAM: You can dive into lava in the real world. 
TALIESIN: I'm made of rock. 
LAURA: Loses limbs. 
TRAVIS: I wouldn't dive. I'd gingerly enter, but-- 
LIAM and SAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Pick which toes you don't need. 
MATT: You step into the lava pool? 
LAURA: No, you fly. 
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to fly and I'm not going to walk, I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: Wait, are you diving or are you going feet first? 
LIAM: No. 
TALIESIN: I'm going feet first I'm not crazy. 
TRAVIS: Let him make his choice. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. 
LIAM: I don't know, you guys. 
MATT: Okay, sorry. So let me figure it out. 
TRAVIS: You can yank him out. 
MATT: So you're flying towards it and then diving into the lake at what point? 
TALIESIN: Here's the bubble. 
MATT: Right, it's about 15 or so feet from the edge. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm about 10 feet. I'm going to just try, so I don't have to walk across all of that. I'm going to try and see what happens if I go in that direction. 
MARISHA: We didn't workshop anything else. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. What else is there? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, how unbearable does it hit? 
MATT: Well, you lift up off the edge of the pool and you glide about five, 10 feet towards the center You can see it bubbling and the pieces flying off. Another one is made on the side as another one crumbles. The elder you were speaking to-- 
TRAVIS: No! 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Crumbles on the spot. 
TRAVIS: Phil! 
MATT: Orym, you notice as Ashton begins to glide towards it, the roiling calms slightly. The (thick bubbling) begins to lessen the intensity of the core. 
TALIESIN: I fly down into it. I rage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (hyperventilating) 
MATT: You (skid landing). 
TALIESIN: Yell fucking bloody murder and I rage. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: J-E-L-L-O. 
TALIESIN: The rainbow sparks start going full fucking force. 
TRAVIS: Wow! I'm sure it's going to be fine. This is how you do it. 
ASHLEY: He has a lot of dice. 
LIAM: The rest of the Bells are just like-- 
MATT: Hold on. 
TALIESIN: If shit goes wrong, motherfuckers pull. 
ASHLEY: Oh, we'll get you. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I'll be right there. 
MARISHA: I don't think I'm prepared for that. (laughs) 
LIAM: We'll fish out the crumbs. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to get close. 
SAM: Oh shit, I should have-- 
ASHLEY: I'm going to get close just in case. 
MATT: You take-- 
SAM: It's too late. (laughs) 
MARISHA: What, like put a rope around him? 
TRAVIS: Oh no, he's rolled a bunch. 
LIAM: Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba. 
MATT: You watch him vanish into the lake of molten rock. 
TALIESIN: Apparently, that went all right. 
MATT: You take 34 points of fire damage as your entire body is rocked with searing pain. 
LIAM: It's the first six seconds. 
TALIESIN: Reduced to seven, reduced by seven. because I'm wearing a ring. 
MATT: That's true. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: So 35 minus seven. 
MATT: 34. 
TALIESIN: Actually minus 14, because I have another seven temporary. 
TRAVIS: Oh, from the-- 
MATT: That's true, yeah. 
TALIESIN: So that's-- 
MATT: So that's 20. 20 points of fire damage you take. 
TALIESIN: So I take 20 points of fire damage. I'm grasping for it. 
MATT: All right, you dive into where that center part is. You can't see anything. It's just white hot pain and white hot light-- 
SAM: (laughs) Jesus. 
MATT: -- as you are pushing through the heart of fire. This is everything that will melt you into nothing and you are forcing yourself to its core. You reach out in front of you and you-- Make an investigation check. 
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sakes. 
SAM: He's looking for clues! 
TRAVIS: Just give it a good swipe. 
MATT: With advantage. 
TRAVIS: Just bobbing for apples. 
MATT: This isn't a high DC, since you're right there. You have no sight. 
TALIESIN: Did someone throw in some or no? 
ASHLEY: I did, I did. I Guided you. 
TALIESIN: Yep. That's fair, that's fair. Thank you for that, I was like, there was Guidance, right? Oh yeah! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: 22. 
MATT: 22, okay. You needed a 12. 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
MATT: In the middle of the space, you reach out and your hands grasp as you push through, and it's like pushing through water. It's like pushing through this extremely thick sludge that is burning every single surface on your body. As you reach out and try and grasp, it's just nothing, and then you catch something that is solid and stuck. It is pointy, it is stone, and it burns as hot as the lake around you. What do you do? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab and I'm going to Fly, and I'm going to pull it straight the fuck back out as hard as I goddamn can. 
MATT: Okay, make a strength check for me. 
LIAM: Come on, beast. Let's go, beast! 
TALIESIN: It's not my best, but 12. 
MATT: 12. You pull and it does not budge. Do you stay there? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: You take 40 points of fire damage, 
TALIESIN: Reduced by nine to 31. 
MATT: To 31. 
SAM: We can't see him, right? 
MATT: No. 
SAM: Damn it. 
MATT: He just disappeared-- 
ASHLEY: I hate this, okay. 
MATT: -- into the lake. 
LAURA: Ashton, are you alive? 
TALIESIN: You hear a lot of fucking screaming-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: -- and fucking yelling. 
TRAVIS: Fire-- 
MATT: Endless cursing stirring in his mind. 
SAM: Is he within 30 feet of me? 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: He is? 
MATT: You don't see him. 
SAM: I don't see them, though, but as a reaction, when a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage from an attack, I can halve it, but-- 
MATT: You'd have to see them to do it. 
SAM: It doesn't say that I have to see them, but I would have to know when they take damage. 
ASHLEY: I have an idea. It's kind of dumb idea. 
TALIESIN: Do it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to cast Fire Shield on myself. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to make a chill shield, so I'm resistant to fire damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: How about this? Since I'm binded to him, can you at least let me give him a Bonded Blessing? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: I'll allow that. 
SAM: So you get a d6 on your next roll. 
MATT: You can sense he's in pain because of your connection. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: You just don't have a means of taking it on yourself in the moment. 
SAM: Got it. 
LAURA: Are you touching the ground, Ashton, or is your-- no, it's just liquid all around him? 
TALIESIN: Yep, yep. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: See if there's anything else I can do. 
MATT: Fearne, what do you do? So you cast fire shield on yourself, the cooling shield, What you doing? 
TRAVIS: He dove all the way down. 
ASHLEY: Yes, okay. 
TRAVIS: He's got that ring of temporal salvation. 
TALIESIN: Got one more. 
ASHLEY: This is so dumb. I'm going to jump in. 
LAURA: Oh, now two, two of you! 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: What? 
MATT: So as you're all focusing, you watch as Fearne goes running and then leaps in the middle of the air. This strange sphere of flames-- 
ASHLEY: I have a feeling, I have a feeling. 
MATT: -- emerge around her like a dull blue flame, encircles her form as she (splashing) into the pool itself. You take-- 
ASHLEY: Is this it? 
SAM: Anybody else want to go in? 
MATT: That's a really bad roll. You're very lucky. 
MARISHA: They're becoming the emperor and the empress! (laughter) 
MATT: It's 24 points of fire damage reduced to 12. You take 12 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Damn! 
ASHLEY: That's why I did this. Okay. 
MATT: You (splashing) right behind where that center is. As you're there, by the way, the rest of you, you can watch as that roiling has now come to just the faintest cylindric-- like a small flame pillar. It's burning in the center, this white hot flame is just (fire flickering) As you vanish into it, (splashing) and you plunge into it, the pain rocks through you, but you are also a being of fire. This is the Druidic nature of your study. Your connection with the elements has always been through flame. The consumption of life to make room for more life; that is what wildfires are. That's what the purpose of fire naturally is is to destroy what can make room for what's new. Holding onto that, the pain doesn't stop you and you feel you impact the back of what you assume to be Ashton's shoulders. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. I'm going to try to feel around to see if I feel anything. 
MATT: You follow his arms because you know where he is. You also feel this pointed hard object. It is burning your fingers as is the rest of the lake around you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: How much time has passed? 
MATT: This is, right now, two rounds since he went in. 
TALIESIN: 12 seconds. 
MATT: One round since you jumped in. You spent your action to cast your spell as you went in, so that's where your round ends. 
ASHLEY: Okay, do I have-- 
MATT: Your bonus action still 
ASHLEY: -- cunning action, because I have it, oh. 
MATT: You do have cunning action, yeah. 
ASHLEY: So I can do it. Can I do something else? 
TALIESIN: Oh, I still have that. I also still have that-- 
MATT: You do have Use Object as a cunning action. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Ah. 
ASHLEY: Can I use Telekinesis-- 
SAM: You have an extra d6 on your next roll. 
ASHLEY: -- with my ring to try to pull it out? 
TALIESIN: You also cast-- 
ASHLEY: Or is that-- 
MATT: You can. 
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying. 
MATT: Well, Telekinesis requires you to see what you're casting towards. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But you do, you're feeling it which means you know where it is. So I'll allow it, but you still have to roll. So you have to roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier to it. 
TALIESIN: It's not been eight hours. I think Spare the Dying is still up. 
SAM: I'm also going to-- and in the next round, I'm going to give you some more hit points. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MATT: 19, as you concentrate, the telekinetic force that you bring through this object billows through your arms. It's less about you using your mind to control it more than using the force of your spirit now to try and will this thing to shift. As you grasp it, you feel it dislodge slightly and pull upward. It becomes a little less locked into its position in space and time and seems to have slightly loosened. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to leave it in Ashton's hands and I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: Stay out-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, because I'm not very strong, so I think you should yank it out, because I don't think I can-- 
TRAVIS: You're moving it! 
MATT: You feel, too, as she reaches it with her hand it shifts slightly. 
TRAVIS: You're directly budging it. 
MATT: Anybody else doing anything before we get back to Ashton? 
TRAVIS: Climbing up the walls. 
SAM: I want to, but I think I've done something this round. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: So, next time. 
LAURA: I want to help, but if I do it'll drop the Fly and then they won't be able to, Ashton won't be able to get out so I have to keep-- 
SAM: I can give him some hit points next round. 
MARISHA: I don't know what I would be able to do. 
TRAVIS: I'm like-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: All right, last fucking pull. 
MATT: Top of your turn, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: If it doesn't happen, I'm booking. 
MATT: All getting fucking lucky. 
ASHLEY: Am I able to assist sort of-- 
MATT: Ooh, that's a good-- 
ASHLEY: -- with the Telekinesis? 
TALIESIN: Yeah! That's good. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: I think you would. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: The DC of the pull is lowering because of your Telekinesis last round. It didn't actually pull it free, but has lessened the amount. So that is going to be-- You take 32 points of fire damage. 
SAM: Reduced. 
TALIESIN: Reduced to 22 points of fire damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
SAM: Are you still alive? 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
TRAVIS: Barbarian. But still. 
ASHLEY: Never mind. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Choice. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: I thought, dang it, I thought when I was close-- that's another thing, I thought when I was close to him he would also be resistant. 
MATT: No worries. 
ASHLEY: Dang it, well. 
MATT: It's okay, it's okay. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. 
MATT: But you're keeping yourself and you helped to dislodge it slightly, which means the DC is lowered for your roll. Go ahead and roll another strength check. 
LIAM: Come on. 
TALIESIN: Come on. Ah, yep, yep. That's natural 20 for 28. 
MATT: The DC lowered from 25 to 20 because of your help. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: In that moment of both of you clutching this together, you feel it dislodge and feeling Fearne's presence, the words of Evontra'vir come through your mind, of following a fated path, of knowing you were meant to be there. In this moment, you know you were meant to be here. You were both meant to be here. You pull it up, and it becomes free and dislodged. You feel the heat vanish from your hands as you pull it above the surface of the lava. What do you do? 
TALIESIN: Are you holding on? 
ASHLEY: I'm getting the fuck out. 
TALIESIN: We're flying straight out and back to everybody else. Not even really caring, just yeah. 
MATT: The rest of you, for a good solid 12 seconds of silence you watched Ashton vanish and be gone. You sense him hurting and you're the only one really with an idea that he's still there. The rest of you look on in horror, desperately trying to think of something to do, as Fearne suddenly leaps in after and also vanishes. The longest six seconds of your life as you try and, in your mind, come up with something to do. The roiling has come to the stop and that one single flame burns out. (bursting) The hands of Ashton emerge-- 
LAURA: This is, whoa-- 
MATT: -- clutching this crystal. Then immediately both of them (bursting), fire out of the center of this lake of molten rock. You watch as lava just-- 
TRAVIS: Watch out for the-- 
MATT: -- spills off of the sides, and you all duck back out of the way. 
ASHLEY: Splash zone! (laughter) 
MATT: As they both rise up-- 
LIAM: She's holding onto you, right? 
MATT: -- and you see Fearne still covered in her shield of arcane flame as the rest of the fire and melted stone drips off of it. Ashton rises up into the air with her clutching on. His entire body orange. 
SAM: Oof. 
LAURA: Sick. 
MATT: As the stone skin of his body is heated to the point that it matches the majority of the lake he just emerged from. 
LIAM: Fuck me running. 
LAURA: Fucking cool, fucking cool. 
TRAVIS: Freeze him, harden that shit. 
MARISHA: He just shatters. 
MATT: As they both-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- glide-- 
TALIESIN: Careen, yeah. 
MATT: -- back over and land on the shore, as all of the various little rock, impish creatures emerge to look over excitedly. One by one, they darken and crumple. 
LAURA: I didn't know that was going to happen. 
SAM: As soon as I see them, I'm going to use my Sympathetic Binding feature called Scatter Vigor. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: I'm assuming that he's a close friend. Maybe I'm just, I'm just going to guess that he's a close friend. 
TALIESIN: I'd like to think so. 
MATT: You are of close friend status. 
SAM: So I will take 3d8 necrotic damage to myself, 10, 15, and you gain 15 points. 
TRAVIS: Help, FCG's going to kill everybody. 
SAM: Yes, right, yes. Hit points equal to the damage, plus twice your wisdom modifier, which is three. So 15, 21 points to you. 
TALIESIN: So six more? 
SAM: Yeah, six more. 
LIAM: Ashton and Fearne are the new elders. 
TALIESIN: Hey. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm an elder now. 
TALIESIN: Hi. 
ASHLEY: Hey. 
TALIESIN: You didn't have to go down there. 
ASHLEY: Well, what I thought was going to happen actually didn't really do anything that I thought it was going to do, so that was my bad. 
TALIESIN: No, no, you-- 
ASHLEY: I thought my shield was going to cover both of us. 
TALIESIN: It's okay. There was-- You-- Thank you for going down there. That was, oh yeah. That was not going super great. I wouldn't touch-- 
TRAVIS: Did you touch him?! 
LAURA: I just wanted to see, ow. 
TRAVIS: Did you touch?! 
TALIESIN: Go ahead, try it. 
LAURA: No, it hurt, ow. 
TALIESIN: I dare you, I dare you. 
LAURA: I got close enough. 
TALIESIN: Do it, do it! 
LAURA: I don't need to anymore! 
TRAVIS: I run up and do it. (sizzles) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Hibachi grill. 
LIAM: You have no fingerprints anymore. 
MARISHA: Hibachi grill! 
MATT: It's slightly joyful that after a life of being hurt from people touching you, to have somebody touch you and get hurt, though not because the individual in mind, just the-- 
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no, I'm with you. 
MATT: Just the scenario. 
TALIESIN: I'm utterly with you. (laughter) 
LAURA: Ashton, you're really hot. 
TALIESIN: Context not necessary. (laughter) 
LIAM: He's so hot. 
ASHLEY: We got it. 
TALIESIN: We got it. 
ASHLEY: You're still, you didn't burst apart or anything like that. 
TALIESIN: I hope not. 
TRAVIS: Is the glow fading at all, or steady? 
MATT: Oh, his glow? His glow is slowly fading as his body cools and returns to it. 
LAURA: What about the gold that had been going through, isn't all the same as it was, or is it? 
MATT: All the gold is still present. If anything, the cracks in his body that they fill seem to be almost shored up slightly. The damage that was sustained once has, in some ways, healed gently. 
LAURA: Sick. 
MATT: The lines remain, the glimmer remains, but more whole. 
TRAVIS: How's that shitty attitude? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Red fucking hot. (laughter) 
LIAM: Are they naked? 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Some of the clothing is probably pretty, I would like to think I would've thrown the jacket off, but probably nothing else. 
SAM: You didn't say it, so it didn't happen. 
TALIESIN: That's okay, that's what Mending's for, 
MATT: I'll allow you, if you wanted to have the foresight, to throw elements of your outfit off beforehand. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Did you skinny dip? 
MARISHA: We just finished the art, please. 
TALIESIN: Not quite, but I probably got rid of all the expensive shit. 
SAM: Is all of your fur gone? 
MATT: So you probably threw the jacket off before you leapt in, but your pants are gone. 
TALIESIN: Pants are fucked, I need new pants. I'll fix the pants. 
MATT: It is full orange Dr. Manhattan over here. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm just-- 
LIAM: Yep. 
ASHLEY: -- skin with hoofs. 
TRAVIS: What does the shard look like in his hands? 
SAM: Dr. Evil's cat. 
MATT: So looking at it, it's-- 
LIAM: Oak shard. 
MATT: It's a cluster about that large that sits in his grasp, both of your grasp, technically, because you're both still holding onto each other's hands in the process. It is this bright orange, white crystal that has all these different prongs that shoot off in different directions. It is still burning in your grasp. You take two points of fire damage. 
SAM: How are we going to hold it? 
LAURA: You just swallow it. 
LIAM: Yeah, you swallow it, that's what we do on this show. 
TALIESIN: How big is it? 
MATT: It's about this big. 
LAURA: Or shove it into your chest. 
TRAVIS: Fjord with the crystal. 
LAURA: Push it into your body. Maybe you sit on it. 
SAM: Oh, he's got rock in this head, he could shove it into this part of his head. 
MARISHA: I think it should go to Fearne. 
TALIESIN: It might. 
SAM: Wait, what? 
MARISHA: I don't-- 
LAURA: You guys look like an emperor and an empress flying above that lava pool. 
MARISHA: Ashton-- 
MATT: You take another five points of fire damage. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: Just holding it continues to burn your hands. 
MARISHA: Evontra'vir said it could kill you if you tried to take both shards. 
LAURA: -- to share the burden. 
ASHLEY: But I thought it would kill him if he tried to-- 
LIAM: Yeah, Evontra'vir also said-- 
TALIESIN: What do I see in it? 
LIAM: -- they were leading Ashton to it. 
MATT: You look into the crystal surface and then past it. As much as it is a stagnant exterior, the light shifts within it, the flames that you see roiling deep within. It's almost looking like a window into the tiniest, most dangerous inferno that continues to burn like a cyclone of fiery destruction. You don't know if it's the memory of one, the containment of one. You take another four points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: I'm, out of just curiosity, I'm going to tap it to my head. Another four points? 
MATT: Another four points. 
SAM: I'll give you a little Cure Wounds action. 
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I'll let you know. 
SAM: Oh, okay. Well then, I'll hold. 
TALIESIN: Just see what happens if I try and see if I can think through the glass. Don't know. Probably nothing. 
MATT: You sense-- There is something deep within this crystal that you're drawn to and you feel as you tap it against your glass, there's this churning, like an earthquake's foreshock that sits in the center of your gut. Like the anticipation before a jump that is consistent. There is an essence in this that you feel is waiting to be unlocked, and you feel like it has the key to both it and you. 
TALIESIN: What do you think? 
ASHLEY: I mean, I have no idea. 
MATT: Take another three points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: You're still taking damage? 
TALIESIN: Yep. I'm not putting it down yet. 
LAURA: Did you take damage from it when you were holding onto it? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
LAURA: Why don't you try and hold it for a second? 
ASHLEY: Well, here, I can hold it for a second, unless you want to keep holding on to it. 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. You take it? You take seven points of fire damage reduced to three because you're still-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. Here, take it back. I don't want it. 
MATT: It is a concentration-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) It is a concentration spell, which is a point to recall as well. So roll a constitution saving throw. 
LAURA: You're fine. 
ASHLEY: 22. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's the shard. 
LAURA: Do you want to try to touch it? 
TALIESIN: How's the temperature in here? 
MATT: It's the same general heat that was here. 
LAURA: You didn't take that today? 
SAM: It's either the staff or the eye. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: I see. 
TALIESIN: It's about this big? 
MATT: It's about this big, yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the hammer. Just put it on the ground. 
SAM: You're going to break it? 
TALIESIN: That's what I normally do when I find something. 
SAM: Wait, do you want to hand it to Fearne and see if-- 
ASHLEY: No, I held it, but it burned me so I gave it back to him. 
SAM: Yeah, but you didn't swallow it. 
ASHLEY: I don't want it. 
TALIESIN: I'm not going to-- 
SAM: Did you swallow it? 
TALIESIN: I'm just going to see what happens if I press. 
MARISHA: Put your head in it. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if it's going to-- 
MARISHA: Like he did. 
TALIESIN: -- what it does to the glass of the hammer. I'm just seeing if there's a-- Is it hot enough to burn the hammer or not? 
MATT: Okay. You place the glass head of your hammer across the top most points of the crystal. As you rest it and press it ever so faintly there, you do feel your hammer begin to heat up. It doesn't seem to get to the point where it would hurt you, but the glass does begin to heat. Yeah. You pick it up? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: You take three points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: I know you don't believe, Ashton, but do you want me to ask my goddess about this? What we're supposed to do with it? 
TALIESIN: You can. 
LAURA: Do you want me to just hold it in the air in front of you, so you don't have to keep touching it? 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: It just drifts there, and you all get a nice solid look as it slowly spins in space. It's a beautiful piece of raw historical power. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: The essence of one of the things responsible for shaping this world. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: You can see the fear and beauty of destruction reflecting in the smooth facets of this relic. 
LAURA: Does it feel alive at all? 
MATT: It feels like there is a life essence to it, yeah. It's hard to ignore that. 
MARISHA: Question. Now that we have gone into this volcano, crawled down this chasm, and are now in this pumpkin shaped chasm or bubble, does it feel like we are in the belly of a titan? Does it almost feel anatomical? 
MATT: Make an intelligence check. 
LAURA: Are we in the womb? 
MARISHA: Yeah. This die always fucks me. 
TRAVIS: It's just a kidney stone. 
LAURA: (laughs) Just a kidney stone. 
MATT: Actually, make a history check. 
MARISHA: A history check? 
MATT: If that's better. You can choose intelligence or history. I mean, I think they're both-- 
MARISHA: They're both the same, right? 
MATT: The same, if not better. Yeah. 
LAURA: What is the lava doing, the pool of lava doing now that the shard is out of it? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
ASHLEY: That's an interesting idea. 
MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm rolling like dog shit today. 
SAM: Guidance. No, I can't-- 
MARISHA: You can't do that. 
LAURA: 10. 
MARISHA: It doesn't matter, it's bad. 
MATT: 10? 
LAURA: I see the lava. 
MATT: It's not bubbling. Any violence to it has ended. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: The temperature has, it's only been a short time so you haven't noticed any difference. You're not sure if the pool will cool or if it's going to remain where it is. You don't know an immediate-- You don't notice an immediate change. 
LAURA: Okay. Nothing? 
MARISHA: It's a five. 
MATT: You got no idea. 
LAURA: Chet, don't you have an ability to look at things and know things about them? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm not touching that fucking thing. 
SAM: You can look at it! 
LAURA: Do you have to touch it? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got to touch it! I'm tactile, baby. I got to get my hands on it. 
LAURA: Just one little-- Ashton was holding onto it. 
ASHLEY: It's not terrible. 
LAURA: You could probably just touch it for a second. 
TALIESIN: I thought you'd be tough enough to handle it. 
TRAVIS: It was sitting in lava! I get a-- 
LAURA: I'm going to float it right in front of Chet's face. 
TRAVIS: -- senior citizens' discount. 
LAURA: It's fine, Chet, look. 
SAM: Are you scared? 
LAURA: Look. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
LAURA: Just touch it for a second. 
TALIESIN: Don't be a baby. 
TRAVIS: It was birthing little fire mosquit-- (screams) 
LAURA: I'm going to push it into his hands. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Grim Psychometry. (laughter) 
MATT: You're lucky. You take two points of fire damage. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) (wails dramatically) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Make a history check for me. 
TRAVIS: (wails dramatically) 
MARISHA: Do better than me. Do better than me. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (silly wail) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't-- 
TRAVIS: 21. 
MATT: 21. As you're clutching it, it's such a small shard, but the power within it is nearly overwhelming. There is such a powerful essence locked within this crystal. Yet it's just a small piece of the entity it once belonged to, an entity that you, for a moment, feel yourself chained, trapped, kept away, vengeful, furious, and then freedom, the promise of escape. You, you and a partner to bring this world low once more for those who fought. Then light, light that is a different fire than your own. It is blue, then white, and it breaks you apart. You see a mountain reformed and destroyed. You see this light engulf you in the brief glimpse you have of the emperor as you reach for each other and you're sundered into a million pieces. This one piece flies through the sky at an impossible speed before it (intense crash) punches into a mountain. 
LAURA: Awesome. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LAURA: It's pretty-- 
TRAVIS: (gasping breath) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (deep voice) I am Rau'shan. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I relay all of that back. 
MARISHA: That's so sad. 
LAURA: That is sad. 
ASHLEY: Where's your other shard? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
MARISHA: He said it was in you. 
LAURA: What, is it sticking out of your belly button or something? 
TALIESIN: There's nothing sticking out of my belly button. 
LIAM: We can see that. 
TALIESIN: Yes. Very clearly at the moment. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right, you're naked. 
SAM: It's not the glass thing in your head. 
LAURA: Spin around, let me see. 
SAM: That's something else. 
LIAM: Whoa, watch that thing. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: What if you put it-- 
LIAM: I have. 
ASHLEY: I don't know, close to your chest or something? 
TALIESIN: Let's give it a roll. (sighs) I may need you for this. We'll find out. 
LAURA: Float it close to you. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab it. I'm going to press it to my chest. I'm going to, actually, out of curiosity, I'm going to attempt to rage just to see if I can open up the brain and make something, I don't know, something in the weird happen. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Recognize something. 
MATT: Take nine points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: You okay there? You need some Cure Wounds? 
TALIESIN: I'm good. Just because it's always fun burning these rages, I will admit. All right! That's fun. Yeah, so. The red blue shifts, I start to move very quickly and practically vibrating as I hold this thing. 
MATT: As it vibrates in your grasp, you can feel the heat and the powerful essence that sits within it. You still feel that connection to that twin essence within you, both waiting to be awakened. The one you clutch looking for its vessel. 
TALIESIN: I don't think it's for me. I think it's for me, but it's-- I don't know. 
SAM: Who do we know who-- 
TALIESIN: Fearne. 
SAM: -- is fiery? 
LAURA: Who do we know who's fiery? Don't act ignorant, FCG. Look at this goddess of a creature right now. 
SAM: I mean-- 
TALIESIN: Literal. 
ASHLEY: Just take it in. 
TRAVIS: With that face. 
ASHLEY: Take it in. 
SAM: I never viewed her that way before, but I can see that she has symmetrical features and some would consider her attractive. 
MARISHA: She has a flaming monkey that shoots flaming shit. 
SAM: I know, but she was burned by it, too. 
TRAVIS: Do we need to check in with-- 
ASHLEY: I am much more than my symmetry. 
TRAVIS: -- Nana Morri? Should we get permission? Did you get a waiver for this? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MARISHA: She doesn't need permission. 
TRAVIS: I don't want to piss off Nana Morri. Are you crazy? Did you see those bushes? 
LAURA: I'm just holding it. 
MARISHA: She's an independent woman. 
LAURA: You don't have to hold it. I don't want you to take damage. It's just floating in front of you. 
SAM: Well, you're going to have to hold it if you're going to-- 
TALIESIN: I think you should let her hold it. 
SAM: -- bond with it. 
LAURA: Well sure, but I'm just saying. 
ASHLEY: If it's dormant, how do you wake them up? If yours is dormant-- 
LAURA: How do you put it-- 
TALIESIN: Talk to it. 
SAM: Shake it like a baby. 
LAURA: That's not-- You don't do that to babies. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
ASHLEY: Wake up! 
MATT: Anyone here trained in arcana? 
LIAM: That's not what you do to babies. 
ASHLEY: Say again? 
MATT: Anyone here trained in arcana? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Proficient in arcana? 
MARISHA: Me. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll an arcana check. 
MARISHA: (sighs) I've been rolling so bad. 
LIAM: But this is where you turn it around. 
LAURA: Guide her, Guide her. 
TALIESIN: This is the one where you get Guidance from fucking FCG. 
SAM: I don't know that she's thinking about something. 
TRAVIS: You're going to fuck it up. 
SAM: Guidance only works if someone asks for it. 
MARISHA: Shut up! Shut up! I am, though. 
TRAVIS: Low numbers in your future. 
SAM: I use Guidance-- 
TRAVIS: Clouds roll in. 
ASHLEY: Guidance, Laudna. 
SAM: -- when it makes sense. 
MARISHA: I'm getting Guided! 
TRAVIS: Dark shadows-- 
MARISHA: Ooh, I'll do this one. 
TRAVIS: -- over your dice. 
MARISHA: I'll do this one. Go away! 
SAM: I use Guidance when it makes sense. 
MARISHA: Go away. 
LAURA: It does make sense. 
TRAVIS: You can't do it. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
SAM: She didn't ask for help. 
TRAVIS: You won't roll high. 
LAURA: You got to be intuitive. 
TALIESIN: She's not in a thinking space. 
MARISHA: Stop, don't look. You're going to curse it. 
TALIESIN: Everything scrinches. 
MARISHA: Oh! It's okay. It's okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I need Travis doubting me all the time. 
TALIESIN: That's not hard. (laughter) 
LIAM: And you get it! 
MARISHA: Okay. 21 total. 
MATT: 21. A powerful essence is locked within this particular artifact. There's another relic that you uncovered that had been used in the past to transfer the essences-- 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, we're fucking dumb. 
TALIESIN: Holy shit. 
MATT: -- of certain things into the wearer. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: We just don't have it back yet. 
ASHLEY: Der. 
MARISHA: We've got to go get it. 
LAURA: We got to hold onto it. Duh. 
MARISHA: That's right. 
SAM: Does it look the same size and shape? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a big funnel. 
LAURA: It funnels the fucking-- (arcane sucking) Okay. 
MARISHA: So yes, I-- We got to go to Imahara Joe. 
TALIESIN: No shit. 
MARISHA: We were going to bring it with us, remember? Because we thought maybe if we found some titan stuff we could siphon it. 
LAURA and MARISHA: But then it wasn't ready. 
SAM: That was weeks ago. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Before we teleport, can anyone cast some Mending on my pants? 
MARISHA: I'll cast Mending on-- 
TALIESIN: I really appreciate it. 
MARISHA: Oh wait, do I have Mending? 
TALIESIN: Don't you? 
ASHLEY: Now you have cutoffs? 
LAURA: Yeah, you have Mending. 
LIAM: You've talked about it. 
MARISHA: I'm sure I have Mending, I just don't-- 
LAURA: You used it so many times. 
TRAVIS: No, no, you don't have it. Cheeks out. 
MARISHA: I Mend his pants. 
TALIESIN: Mend everything but the cheeks. We're fine. 
SAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Orym. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Rock cockin'. 
MATT: You notice a faint flash of light on the other side of the chamber. 
MARISHA: Wait, what? 
TALIESIN: We've got to fucking run now. Oh, yeah. 
LIAM: Well. 
SAM: Or it could just be-- 
MATT: You don't notice it yet. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, shit. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Could be someone Scrying on us. 
MATT: You glance over and you see, in the light of the lava, five figures. (soft thunks) 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
SAM: "10,000 Days." 
MATT: The ones up front, you can see them wearing familiar raiments of the Ruby Vanguard, shield at the ready. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
LIAM: They're fucking watching us still? 
MATT: Behind them, you see what looks to be a Reiloran, like the one that she had summoned in simple robes, step forward and they're all taking in the surroundings. You see a much larger Reiloran, muscular, close to eight feet tall, looks like it's clutching some sort of a jagged bone cestus across the knuckles as it also takes in its surroundings. And stepping through the middle of them, you see a familiar, older elven man with long silver hair. The rest of you hear, just as you take in this fearful display, "Well now. You certainly have been busy, haven't you? I suppose the sting of failure is a magnificent motivator." 
LAURA: Telekinesis, I'm going to throw the lava, that they're above, at them. 
MATT: And we'll come back from the break at that moment. (shouting) 
ASHLEY: Woo. 
TALIESIN: Get the fuck out of here. 
TRAVIS: Like a kid in a wave of the pool, (wave whooshing) 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Hell yeah. All right. We'll return at that moment here in just a few minutes. 
LIAM: (like Ludinus) No, I haven't finished my speech.

Break[]
(mysterious music) (gentle music) The Midnight Queen is dead. As the bell tolls for Her Majesty, her succession looms in uncertainty, for with her dying breath, the queen invoked an ancient and deadly contest, compelling the Princesses of Twelvefold to meet in secret and battle one another, until the stroke of midnight reveals the victor, the new Midnight Queen. (fire roars) Erdene, the Gilded Champion; Dr. Lux, the Scholar Supreme; Rosaline, the Oneiromancer; Freya, Blood of the Tower; Hephesta, the Light Breaker; and then there's me, Boss No, the fairest of them all. Who will survive? (horse whinnies) Who will you choose? (dice rattling) Who will be Queen by Midnight? (gentle music) 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Could anything be more perfect? Style should never be a dump stat darling. It's so cute. I can't handle it. I mean, seriously. Look, at this thing. Ooo, so comfy cozy. I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. It's the little things in life. Ooo, so moody. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
Welcome to the world of Critical Role. The global tabletop role playing phenomenon led by eight veteran voice actors will be performing live in London in front of a sold out audience. How do you want to do this? Witness the magic as the beloved characters from Critical Role's second campaign, The Mighty Nein, must band together to aid a world on the brink of chaos. Don't miss a minute of the heart pounding action. The Mighty Nein Reunion: Echoes of the Solstice in select theaters for one night only on October 26th. Tickets on sale now. (adventurous music) 
TALIESIN: Festering within the heart of Newfaire, the sour taste of vengeance lingers on the palate as we suffer another loss. This is the price we pay as investigators. The temptation to harness the power within our collection of tools and artifacts is strong. But to serve Candela, one must acknowledge the danger in such hubris, and that underestimating such power leads only to destruction. It is always and forever our duty to stifle any remnant of bleed that seeps into our realm. The Circle of Needle & Thread, Assignment #538: Flesh and Blood.

Narrator 2: Where were we? Narrator 1 & 3: Utterly doomed Midst. Narrator 2: Oh, yes, that's right - Narrator 1: We're back! Narrator 2: - Utterly doomed Midst - Narrator 1: Yeah, it's still pretty doomed! Narrator 2: - At pretty much the moment where we last saw it. Well, that's not quite true. Narrator 1: It's a few hours later. Narrator 2: Stationary Hill is not looking so hot at the moment. Narrator 1: Garbage everywhere, flyers for the big sale of Midst strew upon the streets, doors open, broken boxes, crates, carts... Narrator 2: Abacuses, Welcome-to-the-Trust pamphlets. Narrator 1: It would be a nice place if it weren't for the colossally vast, quietly howling and increasingly close vast, terrifying, reality-gnawing tsunami of black fog ocean inbound rapidly. Narrator 3: Oh. that! Narrator 2: Oh, yeah. Narrator 1: It is a spectacularly terrifying scene. Listening to this, it may not seem particularly terrifying. But with the power of your imagination, you too can become very upset. Narrator 2: With our help.

Part II[]
MATT: Welcome back. So I guess we should probably set the scene here, seeing as how-- 
SAM: Oh shit! 
TRAVIS: Just straight into it? You're going to just drop the map on us? 
SAM: This combat is brought to you by WizKids Minis. Uk'otoa painted-- 
TRAVIS: (echoing whisper) Uk'otoa. 
SAM: -- and unpainted miniature available now. Join forces with the Mighty Nein to take on the terrifying Uk'otoa. Order this behemoth today. 
ASHLEY: Wow. That looks so cool. 
SAM: Expand your collection of CR miniatures at WizKids.io/CRminis-- (exclaiming) 
SAM: -- and your local game store. 
TRAVIS: A little of that map looks like me after-- 
LAURA: So this is way bigger than I pictured it being. 
TRAVIS: -- pad thai. 
LIAM: This is about what I was thinking. 
LAURA: I thought they were going to be right on. 
LIAM: There's more land than I thought. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: So there's about 15, 20 feet along the edges. 
LAURA: Got it, got it, got it. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So, let's say for ease of this, you all were over on this edge here. 
SAM: Wow. 
LAURA: Just huddled up in a perfect-- 
ASHLEY: Just all right together. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: I mean, you were all kind of, right? 
TRAVIS: We were. Of course! 
LAURA: Yeah, we were. 
LIAM: Yeah, sure. We were talking to each other. We were watching-- 
MATT: We'll say this is the-- 
LIAM: -- half naked man-- 
MATT: This is the spark. 
MARISHA: No, this is good. 
LIAM: -- handle a crystal. 
LAURA: You're really caught up on the naked part. 
LIAM: You bet! It's going to keep rolling. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You guys can tell me where you want to arrange yourselves in this area, but it's going to be in this area, so. 
SAM: Hoo boy. 
LAURA: Looks good. 
SAM: What spells did I prepare today? 
MARISHA: I'm still clinging to the wall, so I'll be towards the back. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah. That's great. 
MATT: Anybody want to change or adjust this at all? 
TRAVIS: I would be back behind Fearne against the wall because I tried to climb up, too, but not very successful. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right, you were climbing. 
MATT: That's true. Yeah. So you'd be about there. 
LIAM: I think I would've done this in the interim. 
MATT: Okay, cool. 
LIAM: Are they straight over there? 
TRAVIS: Where are they? Where-- 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: They came out of the lava? 
LAURA: No, they-- 
TRAVIS: No. 
ASHLEY: They just bamfed in. 
LAURA: They bamfed in. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: They were watching us. They knew where to go. 
LAURA: My circlet is supposed to keep people from being able to perceive me! 
TRAVIS: Who are you-- Tell us who they are when you're putting them down! 
MATT: These are the two guards here. Actually, this one would be back further this way. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ruby Vanguard. 
LIAM: That's Ludi Toots in the front with the staff. 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: The Rooty Toots? 
LIAM: Ludi Toots. 
MATT: This would be about there. 
TRAVIS: Ludi. Luda! 
MATT: Guard there. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Ludacris going first ♪ 
ASHLEY: Luda! 
MATT: The Reiloran would probably be about there. Then the larger one that you saw-- 
LAURA: That looks so cool. Oh my god! 
LIAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: That is so much bigger-- 
TRAVIS: Is that the Reiloran? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- than I thought. 
ASHLEY: Is that her size Reiloran? 
LIAM: That's a Reil-orc-a. 
LAURA: No, mine is the other one. 
LIAM: Holy cripes. 
LAURA: Right? 
ASHLEY: We need to get you the other one. 
LAURA: I need to get a big one. 
TRAVIS: What? 
ASHLEY: Big 'un. 
TRAVIS: What in the aardvark fuck is that? 
LAURA: We're going to die! 
SAM: We are going to live, goddamn it. 
MATT: You went ahead and first you began with Telekinesis to scatter it across the ground, which spreads a spray out this way. All of them have to make a dexterity saving throw. 
LIAM: Ki-ya! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Your spell DC is? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah that one. 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: 18? Success for Ludinus. 
SAM: "How do you want to do this?" 
MATT: Fail. 
LAURA: Ludinus is dextrous? 
MATT: Fail. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: Success, and success! Okay. So roll, I'll say 3d10 fire damage. 
SAM: Oh, that's pretty good! That's a generous Mercer. 
TRAVIS: We're going to pay for this. 
MATT: I mean, it's a chunk of lava that's thrust out of it. 
TRAVIS: I don't like it. I don't like it. 
MATT: Being fully immersed is 8d10, so. 
LAURA: Oh, cool, cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Eight. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Can you roll better, please? 
LAURA: Yeah, I would like that. 
SAM: Get them all out now. It's okay. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Get 'em out, get 'em out ♪ 
MATT: As they all spray, you can see Ludinus ducks down slightly and just looks up, shrugs off. You see he has this white gem set in the middle of his forehead as he glances over in your direction. "Tricksy." 
SAM: Is that white gem new? 
MATT: Yeah, you've never seen that before. I need everyone to roll initiative. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
SAM: No! 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
SAM: Are you the only two who have ever seen Ludinus? Did we all see him? 
MARISHA: We saw him when he was making a speech. 
LAURA: When he gave his big end of the world-- 
MATT: You've also seen images of him throughout the city. 
SAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: I'm over it. (chuckling) 
TRAVIS: Is that a one for Luda? 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: Do I still have advantage on constitution or has that gone away? 
SAM: Let me see how long that lasts. 
MATT: All right, so! 
SAM: An hour or until I stop concentrating on it. 
TALIESIN: Oh! So yeah, drop it whenever. That's fine. 
MATT: 25 to 20? 
LAURA: 20. 
TALIESIN: 22. 
MATT: 22? All right, sweet. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. You wanted to go first, remember? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, obviously. I really wanted to go forward first. 
TRAVIS: Hundo. Hundo. 
MATT: All right. 20 to 15? 
LIAM: 19. 
SAM: Ooh, boy. To Teleport away we have to stay together, but if we stay together, we're fucked! 
LIAM: We're sitting ducks. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: When is your initiative? 
MATT: Oh, sorry. 
SAM: 13? I rolled a 13. 
MARISHA: We can all hold our actions. 
MATT: 15 to 10? 
TRAVIS and SAM: 13. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Dex? 
SAM: Rollies. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Dex or Rollies. 
TRAVIS: 10. 
SAM: Eight. That's about right. 
MATT: All right. So you and Chet. 
LIAM: I think it's Ash, then you, then me, and then-- 
LAURA: And then FCG, and then-- 
TRAVIS: Ashton, Imogen, Orym, Chet. 
MATT: All right, and then? 
MARISHA: Nine. 
MATT: Nine. 
SAM: How about you? 
ASHLEY: 12, I'm so sorry. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: My bad, my bad. 
MATT: What's your dexterity? 
ASHLEY: My dexterity is 14. 
MATT: 14. Okay. All righty. Ashton, you are up first. 
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. 
TRAVIS: FCG, Fearne, Laudna, right? Yeah. 
SAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: We just have to be within 10 feet of you? So we all have to huddle around you? 
SAM: At the end of your turn. 
TALIESIN: Where are you? 
SAM: Or at the turn where I cast-- 
TRAVIS: FCG is right in the middle. He's right next to in between you and the spider. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to-- I suppose I'm going to, yep. One rage after this left. Let's see how it goes. I'm going to rage. And-- Okay, not the best thing, but we'll make it work. Yeah, I'm going to-- Oh, I can do a really fun thing with this. I'm going to rage and the black and white begins to hit and I suddenly start to sink a little bit down into the ground as if I'm getting a little heavy. I'm going to-- 
MATT: You watch small pebbles and stones around Ashton begin to shake and move towards him. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go stand right in front of FCG. 
TRAVIS: You're going to stand right in front of FCG? 
TALIESIN: Where are you? 
MATT: Right there, and there's FCG right there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm going to go, I'm going to walk over and stand-- 
MATT: Right there? 
TALIESIN: Just to be a shield. 
SAM: You're already low on health! But thank you. I appreciate it. 
MATT: This is the spark here, by the way. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 
LAURA: That's the spark? 
MATT: That's the spark. 
LAURA: Oh, we haven't-- We don't have it-- 
MATT: No one's holding it at the moment. 
TRAVIS: I thought you had it telekinetic-- 
SAM: Maybe he won't want to hurt the spark! Maybe he won't want to damage it. 
LAURA: Somebody needs to grab it. 
SAM: So we should stay near it. 
LAURA: So he doesn't take it. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Ashton? 
MARISHA: Wait, someone has it, right? 
LAURA: No, it's just floating in the middle of us. 
ASHLEY: Aren't you holding it? 
MATT: Well, not in the moment. You used Telekinesis to thrust in them. 
MARISHA: Where is it? 
MATT: And you lost concentration on your-- 
SAM: Just dropped on the floor. 
LAURA: Oh, my Mage Hand? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Fuck a duck. 
SAM: Oh god, he could just grab it. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: But Mage Hand lasts for a minute, you're right. So actually if you're maintaining it, so you have-- We'll say for now you have about six rounds before it goes away. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: But regardless, if a Mage Hand is holding it, he could grab it. 
LAURA: He could fully grab it! 
SAM: With a better Mage Hand. 
LAURA: Yeah, somebody grab it. I have a really good Mage Hand, okay? 
SAM: Is yours a lefty or a righty? 
LAURA: It's an ambidextry. 
TALIESIN: You're coming up in a little while. All right, I'll do it. I'm going grab the fucker and put it behind me. I'm going to grab the fucking fire. The spark. 
LAURA: Spark. 
MATT: Okay! So you grab it and you set it to your side. 
TALIESIN: Set it to my side and-- 
MATT: It's starting to burn your hands. The top of your next round while you're holding it, you'll take fire damage. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: All right, so we'll note this as just in your grasp. Finishing Ashton's go, that brings us to Imogen, with Orym on deck. 
LAURA: Okay. My Telekinesis is still up. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. Just say that's your concentration. 
TALIESIN: I can also-- 
LAURA: These guys look like they're fire resistant. I don't know. 
TRAVIS: If you take damage, does it make you drop invisibility, or only if you take an action or cast a spell? 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Only if you're concentrating on it and you have to roll to see if you maintain concentration. 
LAURA: A strength save? Is this a strength save? 
LIAM: They might not be. 
LAURA: Okay! I'm going to look and quickly judge which one of these guys looks like they'd be the weakest physically, and I'm going to grab the floaty skinny Reiloran. 
MATT: Okay. So the one over here with the ropes? 
LAURA: I'm going to try to grab him with Telekinesis. 
MATT: Okay. All right. So you make an ability check with your spellcast versus his strength check. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy, we're getting into it. Cross the lava pond. 
LAURA: That's a 12. 
MATT: (laughs) 10. 
LAURA: Oh my god! Okay, I'm going to pull him forward into the lava. 
MATT: Into the lava? How far in? How many feet? 
LAURA: Just to where his whole body's in. Yeah. Right there. 
TRAVIS: The further away, the more he has to travel to get out. 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. Okay, five more feet in he can move. But now he's going to be closer to us. But that's fine. 
MATT: You see its dark, shark-like eyes go wide and suddenly its arms, it'll-- The slight arc (thick splash) into it. Go ahead and roll 8d10 for me. 
TRAVIS: Ooh hoo hoo! 8d10, my man said! 
MARISHA: Did she just pull him into the thing? 
TRAVIS: Into the lava. 8d10. 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
MATT: He is restrained. 
TRAVIS: 80 or give me death. 
MATT: Which means his movement is zero. 
LAURA: Whoa! 28 plus-- 
TRAVIS: His movement is zero because? 
MATT: He's restrained because she has him held in the lava with Telekinesis. 
MARISHA: It's right on the cusp. It's so weird. 
LAURA: 50 points. 
MATT: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: 50, five zero points? 
MATT: Oh no! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: You could see him in there still trying to scramble. You have no visual perspective to even see how hurt he is or not. Alive, but definitely is currently being held submerged in the middle of the lava there. 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
TALIESIN: I'm also about to take damage again, so. 
LAURA: Okay! I'm also going to, since I didn't cast the spell on this turn, that means I'm going to quicken another spell and cast it as a bonus action. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: So I'm going to cast-- I feel like are all these Reilorans going to be psychic people? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I am going to Mind Whip the big-- 
MATT: The big one? 
LAURA: The big 'un. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: So that's a 3rd-level. 
MATT: 3rd-level spell? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, what's the intelligence saving throw? 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: Gotcha. That is intelligence you said, right? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. Natural 17 for a 19. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So it makes the save, but still takes damage. 
LAURA: Okay, on a failed save the target takes-- On a successful save, half damage and suffers none of the spell effects. 
TRAVIS: Whew! 
LAURA: That is 3d6 halved. 
TALIESIN: You also can move. 
LAURA: So that's low. That's seven points. 
MATT: Seven points. Gotcha. So the large one, as it holds its two massive, and you see it has these iron bands around its knuckles that wrap into these big gauntlet bracers, and there's jagged, dark brown bones that are built into it that come out. It slams them together and it's about to take a step as it reaches up and its hands grab its head for a second as it looks over in your direction. Its eyes narrow. 
LAURA: Ah. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. Oh boy. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: I'm going to back up. I'm going to stay within 10 feet of FCG, but get as far away from them as-- 
MATT: Up there? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Maybe still within 10 feet. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. That's going to bring us to Orym. 
LIAM: Okay, Orym is going to tamp down his nerves, which are on high alert, and I'm going to step five, 10, 15 right there. I'm going to-- 
MATT: The heat is intense. 
MARISHA: Are you going to move back, though? 
SAM: He's probably going to move back. 
LIAM: Going to cut the air and slice at the Reiloran with Seedling. 
MATT: Okay. Go for it. 
LIAM: So first attack is a natural one, which I'll reroll. 
LAURA: Is he fully submerged, or is he sticking out, is his head sticking out? 
MATT: I mean, he's, for the most part, submerged. You can see just a little bit. So he does have three quarters cover, technically. 
LIAM: Okay. 24 to hit. 
MATT: 24 still hits! Even with the plus five AC bonus, yes. (laughs) 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: And he's restrained, so you technically have advantage on the roll too, so. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: Because Telekinesis is holding him in place. 
LIAM: See if I get that 20. I did not, but it is higher. 
MATT: Yeah. Definitely hits. 
LIAM: It is a 29. So that is nine points of damage. Second sword swipe. 
MATT: Well, the first swipe as you fire the first beam, it cuts into it and you watch as the upper half of the Reiloran's torso begins to emerge separately from the legs and both are just burning, incinerated. 
LIAM: That just finished it. 
MATT: Done. 
SAM: Oh, he's done. He's gone. Okay! 
TRAVIS: You did 50 points-- 
SAM: We're going to win! 
TRAVIS: Imogen did 50 of points of damage. 
TALIESIN: We're going to-- no. 
SAM: We're going to win! 
LIAM: Okay, so that evaporated, then I thrust Seedling out and send a Grasping Vine to the soldier on that side. 
MATT: What's the range on Seedling? 
LIAM: 30. 
MATT: 30? Okay. 
LIAM: That's why I went to the very edge. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. Dexterity save? 
LIAM: Yeah. 14. 
MATT: That is going to be a 10. 
LIAM: 10. Drag him in. Dead center. 
MATT: (thuds) (searing) Go ahead and roll 8d10. 
LIAM: 8d10. 10 and all these 10s, too. 
TALIESIN: We got to-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: This is not going to help us run. 
LIAM: 10, 14, 23, 27. That's four of them. 27, 30, 39, 46. 46. 51. That was eight. 
LAURA: 51! 
SAM: Damn. 
LIAM: That was eight. 
LAURA: No, it's only eight. 
MATT: 8d10. 
LIAM: 8d10. Oh, well, there we go! 
MATT: Yep. You pull him in and hear his final screams as he burns, and then-- (smoldering) 
LIAM: (exhaling heavily) Well, I can't get over there. So my next move that was five, 10, 15 is to go five, 10-- 
LAURA: Get back to FCG, get within 10 feet of FCG. 
LIAM: I can get there. 
MARISHA: That's within 10 feet, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. That's it because I can't use the rest of my sword slashes, I'm all done. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's 10 feet. 
MATT: That finishes your turn. As this is happening, and (splashing), two of the arrivals immediately burn in this lava pit, Ludinus is like, "This is an extremely rude way to deal with an extended olive branch!" 
TRAVIS: Oh! Is that what-- Okay! I don't see a branch. 
MATT: Then for his turn, he glances across the way. "Oh, you've been prying, haven't you?" 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: He looks at your staff. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, it's his staff! 
LAURA: Uh-oh! 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, we have his staff! 
MATT: He goes-- "Well. This won't do." I need you to make a strength ability check for me. 
SAM: Ability check? 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: Not saving throw? 
TRAVIS: (unhinged) Why?! Matthew! 
ASHLEY: Strength? 
MATT: Just roll a strength check. 
TRAVIS: But tell us why! 
ASHLEY: My strength is very, very bad. Come on. 
TRAVIS: Not this time. 
LAURA: Natural 20. Natural 20, natural 20. 
MARISHA: Come on. Come on! 
SAM: (laughs) That's a good face, right? That's a happy face. 
LAURA: That's a happy-- It was such a good-- 
MARISHA: It's a low DC. 
LAURA: Oh, you can't tell what it is. Do you need to roll again? 
ASHLEY: I got, it's a seven. 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) Nice try, Laura. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Thanks. 
MARISHA: (nervous mumbling) 
LIAM: Extremely nervous. 
MATT: Standing across the way, looks from the staff over to you, with a quick glance towards you then back to her. You watch as his extended hand draws a symbol in the air and he unleashes it. You feel your body tense up, and he lifts you into the air, moving you 30 feet with his own Telekinesis. 
SAM: Oh no, over the lava? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Of course over the lava. 
LIAM: This motherfucker is 10 to 15 times older than Trent was. 
MATT: And is just holding you in the air right there. That's going to be his action. 
ASHLEY: My, my. Okay. 
MARISHA: Fuck. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: This is a hostage situation now. 
MARISHA: That was so shit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Sure is. 
SAM: I don't think we can attack anymore. 
MATT: And is going to just take a few steps back. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Damn it. 
LIAM: Goddamn it. I could have pulled-- 
TRAVIS: You should just go closer to admire your work. 
MATT: (laughs) Nah. 
SAM: All right, I could save us all because he stepped away. Except Fearne would be dead. 
LAURA: Let's not let her die. 
LIAM: Not an option. 
SAM: I'm just throwing it out there. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: She's had a good life. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I've had a good run. It's been a good run. 
LAURA: Maybe hold-- 
TRAVIS: Let's be honest. She's been a little questionable the entire time. (laughter) 
LAURA: Maybe you could hold yours. 
MARISHA: Hold your action and as soon as-- 
LAURA: Until one of us can try to pull her. 
MARISHA: -- we get her back. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: As he steps back into the front of the chamber, "If you've been digging through history, good. The more you dig, the more truths you learn. The more you learn, the more you see how right we are." That's going to finish his turn. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
SAM: (exhales sharply) 
MATT: That brings us to the Reiloran juggernaut's turn. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
SAM: The Reiloran juggernaut. 
LAURA: Juggernaut. 
SAM: Amazing. 
MATT: It's going to go ahead and-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, so Ludinus is after-- 
TALIESIN: Are you holding your turn then, or--? 
SAM: Me? 
TALIESIN: Are you-- 
SAM: Are we talking to this guy now? 
TALIESIN: I mean, we kind of-- We're kind of-- 
SAM: We're not going to win. 
TALIESIN: Which is why we were going to talk. Although healing would not be-- 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
LAURA: They can run really far. 
MATT: 40... 
LAURA: They can run really far! 
TRAVIS: Did you do double his-- 
MATT: It moved and dashed, and just got low and went-- (heavy stomping) You see them running around the lava pool, just-- (heavy stomping) 
LAURA: Ah! 
MATT: -- getting really close and just charging right for your troop. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
LIAM: Ooh! 
MATT: As a bonus action, it is going to use Telekinetic Shove. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: And is going to-- 
TALIESIN: 'Sup? 
MATT: I need-- 
TALIESIN: What's up? 
MATT: I need you to make a strength saving throw for me. 
LIAM: Strength save, yep, yep, yep. Just getting some hummana-ha. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: I have to save all my Counterspells, but-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Fuck! 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
LIAM: Hold. 
LAURA: Is this one of the things you get to reroll? 
LIAM: No, I don't reroll. There's nothing I could add to this that would improve it enough to save my ass, so that's a fail. 
MATT: Okay. As it's running. there's a slight shine in its eyes and you watch it move its head like this, like it's pulling back on a fishing reel. As it does, it's like the wind on your back pushes you forward and it pulls you five feet into melee with it as it lands in its place. 
SAM: Oh, okay. That's way better than what I thought was going to happen. 
TRAVIS: Well, now he can't leave without getting hit, though. 
MATT: That's going to finish his go. Chetney, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's my turn, sure. So I'll use 10 or 15 feet of my movement to sidle up behind FCG, who's holding the spark behind his back, right? Or does Ashton? 
SAM: I am not. 
MATT: FCG has the staff. Ashton has the spark at his back. 
TRAVIS: Behind Ashton, sorry. One less square of movement, so just 10 feet to get behind Ashton. I'm going to whisper behind you: Give it to me. I will-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, dropping. 
TRAVIS: -- let it burn my hands and I will slip it into the bag of holding. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I will use my action to turn invisible. 
MATT: Okay. All right. So you turn invisible. We'll say-- 
SAM: Is it going to burn everything in our bag of holding? Who cares? Is it going to burn the bag? 
TRAVIS: It just floats in a dimension. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It's just in a dimension. 
LAURA: In a little bubble. 
TALIESIN: It's in a pocket dimension. It's fine. 
TRAVIS: Then I will use the rest of my movement to go as far as I can in between the juggernaut and Imogen. Trying to get on the opposite side of him from the lava. I have 45 feet total. I only used 10, so 35 feet. 
MATT: So between Imogen and him is about right there. 
TRAVIS: I have 35 more feet, so if I can go-- Yeah, more towards your right hand a little bit. Yeah, perfect. That's great. 
MATT: Right there? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: Maybe one square more. 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Bonus action, action, movement. That's it. 
MATT: Okay. Finishing your go, Chetney. FCG, you are up. 
SAM: I don't know where he went. 
TRAVIS: Wait, is that my bonus action? 
SAM: I don't know where he went. 
MARISHA: Who? 
SAM: Chetney. 
LAURA: Yeah, he just disappeared. 
TRAVIS: Wait, bonus action? Did I use a bonus action? 
SAM: Probably did. 
MATT: No, you-- 
LAURA: Turn invisible? 
SAM: Probably to take it into the bag. 
TRAVIS: No, that was my action. Oh, to put it in the bag. That's right. 
MATT: Yeah, I'll say that's enough actions for your turn. 
TRAVIS: Fair. 
SAM: I don't know what to do then. 
TALIESIN: Bye. 
LAURA: Well, we can't bamf out without Fearne, anyway. 
SAM: Well yeah. So I can't hold that action. 
LAURA: I mean, you could until-- 
SAM: I could, but-- 
TALIESIN: I could definitely use-- 
SAM: I know you could. I know you could. 
TALIESIN: Because I'm about to get into it with this fuck. 
SAM: Okay. I'll just hit a 3rd-level Cure Wounds on Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I'll take that. Thank you. 
SAM: Unless you want me to attack Ludinus to burn some legendary reactions, legendary resistances? 
LAURA: Maybe. 
LIAM: Are we worried about hitting him, him dropping his spell by accident? 
LAURA: No. 
MARISHA: I mean, even if-- 
SAM: She can fly, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah, or we can Feather Fall as a reaction. 
TALIESIN: Right. 
LIAM: Into lava. 
LAURA: As a reaction. Well. But it's slow enough. 
MARISHA: She would have a little bit more time to think about it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going to say. 
LAURA: Yeah, I've still got Telekinesis up, so I could pull her back. 
TALIESIN: Until we have her. It's not like we're going to be defeating him until we have her and we can get the fuck out. 
TRAVIS: What did you do? 
SAM: I will heal Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
SAM: Come on. Okay. 14 plus three is 17 points of healing. 
TALIESIN: I will take that 17. 
SAM: And then-- 
TALIESIN: Better. 
SAM: Bonus action. I'm bound to some folks. Who's up next? 
MARISHA: Me. 
SAM: Fearne's up next. 
LAURA: Fearne. 
MARISHA: Yeah, Fearne or me. Better help Fearne. 
SAM: I can give people-- Whew. I will give Fearne a Bonded Blessing. She's not going to be able to do anything. She's being held. We don't know what's happening to her, right? She's just floating there. Does she seem incapacitated? 
LAURA: She's floating. 
SAM: Can she still move? Is she flailing? 
MATT: No, she is restrained. She is just floating at an angle in the air and you're just looking down at the pool of lava below you. 
SAM: Jesus. Who do I help? Who do I help? Who needs my help right now? Your spells are save-y type spells. I'm going to give it to Fearne. Fearne, you get a d6. I'm going to give her a Bonded Blessing. I will move to my left by five feet. Just, yeah. 
MATT: You got it. All right. Finishing FCG's turn. Fearne, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So-- I mean, I can try to break out of it? Can I do that or can I cast anything? 
MARISHA: I could put a giant fucking thing of Darkness in the middle of the lava. 
SAM: Oh, I should've given it to you! 
MARISHA: Why? 
SAM: Because you could've added a d6 to give her-- 
MATT: You are restrained in the grip. 
SAM: -- roll. I'll do it to you on the next round. 
MARISHA: It's okay. 
MATT: I'll say you can attempt to use your action to try and break free. There's not really anything. 
LAURA: I know, it doesn't say! 
MATT: No, I don't think you can break free of Telekinesis. It's not a physical restraint. It's a magical restraint. 
LAURA: On the next turn he has to keep using his action to hold it. 
MATT: He has to keep using it to maintain it, yeah. So, you can't break free as far as you know. 
MARISHA: Is that okay? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Right. 
SAM: You can still talk to them. 
LAURA: But you can still cast spells when you're restrained. 
MATT: Yeah, you can still cast a spell. Just any attack rolls you make are at disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
SAM: Shit, I should've given you the d6. 
MARISHA: It's okay, it's okay. 
ASHLEY: All right. So what I'm going to do here. 
SAM: I'll give it to you next. 
TRAVIS: He's got to have legendary reactions, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
SAM: I think he's like level seven. 
LIAM: He's a millennia old. 
TRAVIS: I'm just calling it out. So if you think you're going to take a one shot at something and it's going to waste it, just consider that. 
ASHLEY: Are we trying to possibly bamf out if we can get together? 
LAURA and SAM: If we can get together. 
TALIESIN: Get everybody to get over here. 
ASHLEY: That's what we're still trying to do. Okay. 
MARISHA: Can you Misty Step? 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: Go ahead. Go, go. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I don't know if this is going to do anything. I am going to cast Wall of Stone. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I want to completely encase Ludinus in that wall of stone. 
MARISHA and SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: He's right next to the lava, or to the wall already, so that's good. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. You can make a circle around him, sure. 
LIAM: Double restrained. 
MATT: So-- Create 10-foot by 10-foot panels. 
SAM: How many can you create? 
MATT: 10 of them, if you want to. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
SAM: You could go all the way to the ceiling with it? 
MATT: Six inches thick. If you want to. 
LIAM: I'm sure you could for sure go (rock shifting). 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Just over the top of him? 
SAM: Oh, that too. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: The pieces won't look like it-- 
ASHLEY: That's what I was thinking. 
LIAM: -- but what it really is is-- 
TRAVIS: Make a little freezer? 
ASHLEY: He's going to have to break out of it. 
MATT: (destruction) 
LAURA: Ah! He's dead, he's dead, he's dead! 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, yeah! 
LAURA: We got him! 
TRAVIS: He's fucking dead! 
LIAM: No take backs. 
MATT: If we went by that rule, you guys would have been dead a long time ago. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: True. Every time we break out stands. 
LIAM: Orym has no arms. 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: So you all watch-- 
TRAVIS: My feet don't exist! 
MATT: You all watch as suddenly the opposite end of the chamber, as Ludinus is stepping back, and the defender is stepping forward-- (rock walls bursting forth) The porous rock-- 
LAURA: Oh, he made a wall of stone around himself! 
MATT: -- surrounds him. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: Does he still have his grip on them? Does it block his eyeline or anything? 
MATT: You don't see anything yet. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
LIAM: Not a bad move. Not a bad idea. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Shit, I don't think I can do anything else. 
LAURA: That was good, though. 
ASHLEY: (distressed sigh) Okay. 
SAM: Are you okay healing-wise? Can you heal yourself? 
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Can you heal someone else? 
TRAVIS: He's casting a spell-- 
LAURA: He's got to use something to break out of that. 
TRAVIS: -- in terms of invisibility. 
SAM: No, that was a spell. 
LAURA: If he uses his action to break out of it-- 
MATT: He's still invoking-- 
LAURA: -- then it releases you. 
SAM: What about-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: What about Mister? Can Mister do something? 
ASHLEY: I can't bring out Mister because I've already Wild Shaped twice. Is there anybody who needs healing? 
SAM: I don't think you can do that anyway, because that would be another spell. 
ASHLEY: Well, with cunning? 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: (hopeful murmuring) 
MATT: No, unfortunately. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, all right. I think I need to stay. 
LIAM: "What the fuck am I doing here?" 
MATT: Okay. Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: Oh my god, everything keeps changing so quick. Which changes my plans every time. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: That's the beauty. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That's the beauty. 
LAURA: (bewildered) What? 
MARISHA: Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay, this juggernaut guy is a problem, right? 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, he's just still there. 
MARISHA: He's a problem. 
LIAM: I kind of like him. 
TRAVIS: He could be a crisis intervention agent. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: He looks kind of nice. 
TRAVIS: He could be all about his words. 
LIAM: Okay, sir, what I'm going-- 
TALIESIN: I'm here as a negotiator. 
LIAM: -- to need from you right now. 
TALIESIN: I need a list of your problems. 
TRAVIS: Let's all just take a step back. 
MARISHA: First and foremost, I'm going to Quicken Spell and Mirror Image myself. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: Never mind. 
MARISHA: Him being base to base with you, is that bad, Liam? 
MATT: We'll say this is Mirror Image on you. 
LIAM: It's okay. 
TRAVIS: In melee? 
MARISHA: It's okay? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: I mean, I have plans that will go out the window when everything changes three more times. 
MARISHA: I know. I know. 
TALIESIN: Cheers to that. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
SAM: Teleport can't work on objects. 
MARISHA: Okay. Shit, shit. 
TRAVIS: If-then. If. Then. 
SAM: I'm going to do it. 
MARISHA: He needs to die. I'm going to Blight him. 
MATT: You're going to Blight him, okay. It's a constitution saving throw? 
MARISHA: Oh god! Yeah. No, that's not-- Bad idea. 
SAM: Wait, who are you Blighting? 
LIAM: The big guy. 
MARISHA: The big juggernaut. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: That is going to be a 16? 
MARISHA: Fail. 
MATT: Fail. Full damage. 
SAM: Remember when we were making rock water slides? That was fun. 
ASHLEY: That was fun. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Does Blight make him weak? 
TRAVIS: Made it right the first time. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: What does Blight do? 
MARISHA: No, it's just necromantic. A lot of damage. 
TRAVIS: Also, future hits-- 
SAM: On his next turn, does he get disadvantage or anything? 
TALIESIN: I thought there was a-- 
MARISHA: If the target is a plant creature-- 
MATT: It takes double damage. That's all. 
MARISHA: Or a magical plant. 
LAURA: He takes double damage? 
MARISHA: Is he a magical plant? 
LIAM: If it's a plant matter creature. 
MATT: If it's a magical plant or a plant. 
SAM: (belches) 
LAURA: Oh, got it. 
MATT: But it's just 8d8 necrotic damage. It's damage dealing spell. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: What? 
ASHLEY: I was taking it in. 
LAURA: Oh, gross. 
TRAVIS: Did a bunch of Cheetos come out with that burp? 
SAM: That's the grossest thing ever. 
ASHLEY: It's so disgusting. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It was like a sausage going-- We're free! 
MARISHA: 26. 
ASHLEY: I hope I didn't just mess this up for the plan. 
MARISHA: 32 damage. 
SAM: You? 
MATT: 32 points of damage. You got it. 
MARISHA: That's not as good as I wanted. 
MATT: As you reach out and draw on it, you watch as the deep red skin that's exposed from its leather and metal armored straps around it, and its odd, like, bone spikes that come out of the back of the armor. You're uncertain if it's part of it, or just decor. It glances over at you just as you watch the red veins turn black across its body and it-- (grunt) (roar) 
MARISHA: (intimidating snarl) I'm going to step closer to FCG, just to be forever close to him in case we bamf. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. I don't feel good about any of this. 
SAM: Nope. Every move is wrong. 
MARISHA: Every move is wrong. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
SAM: Closer, wrong. Farther away? 
MARISHA: Wrong. 
SAM: Also wrong. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yep, yep. 
MATT: Chetney, it's your turn. 
MARISHA: If it's undercooked, jail. 
SAM: Move, action, bonus action? 
MATT: You done? 
MARISHA: I did all the things. 
LIAM: We've got a 1,000-year-old wizard who's barely gotten started. 
SAM: He just wants to talk. 
MATT: This defender is going to step up here. Actually, he's going to, yeah, going to pull back to here. And keeping the blade at the side, is now eyeing Fearne and has his arm open. 
LAURA: Open? For what? 
TRAVIS: He's holding, he's holding something. 
MATT: All right. Ashton, you're up. Imogen, you're on deck. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, he's just holding a-- 
TALIESIN: I take it we're just fucking with this guy? So I'm going to walk up right next to Orym. Oh yeah. I am-- 
MATT: Over this way? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, right there. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: And very calmly, make eye contact. I'm going to pick up the hammer, which has got that weird silver, old-time film gray tone. I'm just going to take a big fucking swing at this guy. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: And see what I hit. 
TRAVIS: Do you have advantage? 
TALIESIN: I don't think I have advantage from here. 
MATT: Nope. 
TRAVIS: I should've kept going around. 
MATT: You can go reckless, if you want. 
TALIESIN: I don't feel like it right now. I'm trying to be smart. 
MATT: Good on you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (like Yoda) There is no try. 
TALIESIN: 18 to hit. 
TRAVIS: (like Yoda) Only rage. 
MATT: 18 does hit. 
TALIESIN: All right! So I'm also going to burn a Chaos Burst. 
TRAVIS: 18 hits the Juggernaut. 
TALIESIN: So they have to make a strength saving throw. 
MATT: Okay. That is going to be 21. 
TALIESIN: Okay, they save it, but that's okay because they take, ha. 24 points of damage. 
MATT: Nice. 
TALIESIN: And are moved five feet to the, five feet that way. 
MATT: This way? 
SAM: To the lava? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, into the lava. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Okay, they're not quite in there. 
MARISHA: Oh! Really? 
MATT: They're right on the edge. To be submerged, they have to be fully in there. 
LIAM: Just teed him up there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, isn't that weird? Then I'll take my second hit. All right, that's not the die, here we are. Yeah, it's 22 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TALIESIN: Do I want to try and prone him? Eh, hold off, well, we'll see. Five. Actually, prone would be really funny. Let's try one more Chaos Burst. Make another strength saving throw. 
MATT: Gotcha. That's even higher. That's a 24. 
TALIESIN: Fuck that. Okay, that's fine. 
MATT: He's a big dude. 
TALIESIN: I know, 17 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. All righty, does that finish your go? 
TALIESIN: Um. Yeah, yeah, I think I'm good. 
MATT: All right, Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to quicken a spell. 
MARISHA: I know. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- 
MATT: Now, actually, interesting question, because you weren't attacked last round. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: Would your rage have dropped? 
TALIESIN: No, because I was taking damage. It was enough of a turn that I would've taken dam-- 
MATT: You hadn't taken damage yet because it was going to be the top of your next turn. 
LAURA: But he grabbed onto the shard. 
MATT: You did, but he handed it to Chetney before he took any damage. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Is it enough time for the rage to have to reboot, or no? 
MATT: If you aren't attacked or take damage until the beginning of your next turn, you lose rage. Unfortunately. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so should I just keep the rage now or re-up a different rage? 
MATT: We'll reduce the rage damage and we can just call it a Chaos Burst, if you want. 
TALIESIN: Okay. All right. Well, I wouldn't have used two Chaos. Well, that would've changed a whole bunch of shit. I'd say, okay, so can I kill the Chaos Bursts? Well, can I kill the Chaos Bursts and then-- 
MATT: Sure. How much extra rage damage? 
TALIESIN: It's three, so it'd be six points. 
MATT: Okay. Got it. 
TALIESIN: All right. Now, I'll use my bonus action rage. My last rage. 
MATT: Last rage. Okay. There you go. 
TALIESIN: Where are we at? Come on. Ooh. Okay. That's fun. 
MATT: All righty. That finishes your go. 
TALIESIN: I get, yeah. Now, the invisibility has begun to kick in and suddenly I'm a bit see-through. 
MATT: You got it. Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: I'm going to quicken a spell. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Across the lake centered on, between the wall of stone and the guard, I'm going to cast-- The area suddenly opens up and is filled with crackling thunder and bursts and it gets dark. I'm going to cast Seething Storm-- 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: On that area. So that's a 20-foot sphere. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: 20-foot sphere. Right about there. Right? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. To get both of them. 
MATT: Got it. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
SAM: Yes. Amazing. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: That is now crackling over there. I'll put this here as a reminder. 
LAURA: Any creature that starts in the area takes lightning damage and ends the turn takes force damage-- 
MATT: Gotcha. 
LAURA: If they end there, but everybody in that area is blinded. 
MATT: Gotcha. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Really? 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And Telekinesis, you have to be able to see your target. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
SAM: Wait, does it drop? 
TRAVIS: Find out if he's-- 
SAM: It's okay. No, it's working. It's working. 
LAURA: That's why I bonus action, I quickened that first. 
MATT: You've also dropped your Telekinesis now because you've shifted to this for concentration. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Smarty, smarty, smarty. 
MARISHA: So neither one of them can see, right? Because Ludinus already couldn't see, theoretically. Might be furthering your theory. 
TRAVIS: Couldn't see? 
MATT: Okay. So that finishes your go. 
SAM: Well, they can see-- Yeah, no, you're right. 
LAURA: I'll also do for my action. 
MARISHA: Or his is not the same thing? 
MATT: There's a difference between targeting a creature and maintaining. So right now he can hold, he just can't move her unless he sees where he's moving her. 
SAM: Got it. 
MATT: But the damage still does force him to make concentration checks. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: It's a great move. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. That was rad. 
SAM: First good move. 
LIAM: No, still wrong. 
LAURA: That's all right. I did that before my other thing. I don't want to touch the juggernaut. I don't want to be close to the juggernaut. 
TRAVIS: Nobody touches the juggernaut, bitch! (laughter) 
SAM: (gruffly) Stop touching me! 
LIAM: (gruffly) Nobody ever wants to touch me. 
MATT: Ah, poor Cain. (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm going to do a little thing I've never done before and I'm going to cast Blade Ward on myself. 
SAM: Nice! 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: It's a good one. 
LAURA: Yeah, it gives me resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. 
MATT: You got it. 
TALIESIN: Welcome to the Barbarian Club. 
MATT: Cool. 
TRAVIS: What does the juggernaut-- he's got those big crazy-ass knuckle arm things. Does he have any weapons outside of those that we can see? 
MATT: No. Well, what you see is the big bits of hide armor with weird metal and bone put into it. You see these large bone protrusions that come out of the back and you can see, he has belts and a material hanging there, like a thick leather, looks like a battle apron, in a way. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: He's got these two-- 
TRAVIS: The world's largest brass knuckles. Wow. Okay. 
SAM: Orym's going to do some shit. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
MATT: Bone splinter cestus, specifically. That finishes your go. Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: Okay, so Orym's not going to take his eyes off the juggernaut. He's going to step under through Ashton's legs. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Ready for it. 
LIAM: Slip over to here. I immediately smell the scent of cypress trees and Bengay and know that Chetney is close. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Cypress. 
LIAM: I fucking-- (laughter) 
LIAM: I launch at the Reiloran, the juggernaut. 
SAM: Do you share that information with us? 
LIAM: No. 
SAM: Okay. Damn it. 
LIAM: I leap up, plant a foot into the juggernaut's knee and stab into his gut. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: That is a one, which I will reroll. That is a 21. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: 21 hits. 
LIAM: I will make this a Pushing Attack. 
SAM: Yes, you will! 
MATT: Okay 
ASHLEY: Let's go. 
LIAM: So the damage is eight plus-- So that's 18 points of damage, has to beat a strength save. So he's strong as fuck. 17. 
MATT: 17. 17 on the dot. 
LIAM: Here we go again. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
LIAM: That's a 20. 
MATT: 20 hits again. 
LIAM: Pushing Attack. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: 10 plus, 18 points of damage. 
MATT: 18 points of damage again. 
LAURA: I didn't need to use the quicken-- Yes, I did. 
MATT: Yes, you did. (laughter) 
MATT: Yes, you did. That is going to be a 10. 
LIAM: 10? 15 feet into the lava. 
TRAVIS: 15 feet! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: 15?! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: Boom, boom, boom. 
TALIESIN: Elbow to elbow. 
MATT: Into it up to its waist. So as if it gets pushed back in that space, do 6d10 fire damage. 
ASHLEY: (whoops) 
MARISHA: Come on! Kill him! 
LAURA: He's got a little bit of resistance. 
MATT: Well, he's not fully submerged. 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: He's half submerged. 
LAURA: It's just he's not fully submerged. 
MARISHA: He's not fully submerged. Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: Because he's big. 
ASHLEY: He big boy. 
LIAM: 25. 33. 
MATT: 33. Woo woo. It's like (pained grunts). He's looking hurt. 
LIAM: Orym is going to run, leap. 
LAURA: It was. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LIAM: Against this motherfucker. So I'm on him. 
MATT: Okay. All right, yeah. 
LAURA: Come back. 
LIAM: Third slash. 
MARISHA: Are you doing parkour? 
LAURA: Jumping on him. 
TRAVIS: Parkour! 
LAURA: Parkour off him? 
LIAM: Third slash. 
LAURA: Third slash. 
LIAM: 18 hit? 
MATT: 18. 
TRAVIS: It does. 
LIAM: Pushing Attack! 
TRAVIS: Down?! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Piledrive this son of a bitch! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Send him! 
LIAM: 19 points of damage, DC 17. 
MATT: DC 17. Natural 19. (groaning) 
LIAM: Action Surge. (laughter) 
LIAM: 23. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Come on, dude. 
LIAM: 12 plus-- 14 points of damage. 
MATT: 14 points of damage? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Going to make a save? 
LIAM: Save. 17. 
MATT: You doing it again? 
LIAM: Oh yeah. Pushing Attack. 
MATT: (laughs) Natural 18. (groaning) 
MATT: He's rolling good this time around. 
SAM: Another! 
LIAM: 20 to hit. 
MATT: 20 hits. 
LIAM: 12. 17 points of damage, Pushing Attack. 
MATT: 17 points of damage. 
LAURA: Come on, come on, come on. 
MARISHA: Come on! This is epic as fuck. 
MATT: That's cocked. Natural 20. (cheers and groans) 
MATT: He's doing real well here in the last bit. 
LIAM: Last of my six, 22 to hit. 
MATT: 22 to hit. 
LIAM: Last superiority die, Pushing Attack. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
TRAVIS: Last superiority die. 
LIAM: 15 points of damage. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
LIAM: All right, so he leaps up on the knee, like I said, jams it in there. He doesn't move, Orym pulls it out, whips up in the air and then kicks this motherfucker in the face, sending him staggering back, and land. Flea jump, land, slash-slash and then I use Gust as I bring Seedling down into his head and wind goes whoosh and as he submerges into the ground, I back flip off of this shit-hole. 
ASHLEY: Yes, you do. 
LIAM: And land right on the stone. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Epic fucking turn! 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
TRAVIS: Epic turn! Gust, a sonic boom. 
ASHLEY: Goosh! 
MATT: As you turn off and land, you watch as he backs up burning to the point where his body stops moving and the gust of air causes the rock around him to cool and lock him into place. (yelling) 
MATT: As he burns-- 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MATT: This little dark point around him. 
LIAM: Take him off the board, Matt. Take him away! 
MATT: But that is now a walkable point. That is now a walkable point. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: All right, all right. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: I am out of gas. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Awesome. Such a good turn. 
TALIESIN: Fucking killed. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Here comes the pendulum. 
MARISHA: Wow. Okay. 
SAM: Here comes the mage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That was sick. 
MATT: Top of his turn, he takes what damage? 
LAURA: What did I cast? 
SAM: You said 4d6 something. 
LAURA: 2d6. No, it's 2d6 lightning damage at the start. 
MATT: Okay, go for it. Go ahead and roll that. 
SAM: And roll 2d6 at the end of their turn? 
MATT: If he stays in it, yeah. 
LAURA: If he doesn't get out of it. 
LIAM: Someone watching might ask why I have six superiority die at level 11. It's because I took Fighting Initiate at the very beginning of this campaign. So six superiority die. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
LAURA: 10 points of lightning damage. 
MATT: 10 points lightning damage to Ludinus. Yeah. Easily maintains concentration. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Easily maintains. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. We got to figure out what to do about that shit. That's a problem. 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. 
SAM: Is it Ludinus? 
TRAVIS: Sam's in conspiracy mode, man. 
TALIESIN: I suppose a TPK is the only way to really find out. 
MARISHA: It's like Vision 2.0. It's like new Vision or something. 
TRAVIS: Or it protects his mind from her, the daughter of his coworker. 
MATT: Is going to use his Magic Adept feat to spend his sorcery points to Quickened Spell and is going to cast-- 
TRAVIS: Fuck your wall? 
MATT: Dimension Door. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: So he's actually here. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
SAM: Or it's just a very convincing-- 
TRAVIS: Jesus. (laughs) 
SAM: A very convincing hologram. 
MARISHA: You said he can quicken this spell. Do we know if Ludinus is a sorcerer? 
LAURA: He has Magic Initiate. So he can take a little sorcery-- 
MATT: Metamagic Adept. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: The other effect. 
MATT: So (whoosh) appears there, looks over up at you again, Fearne, and is going to attempt to pull you even higher in the air. Actually no, he's going to pull you over to him. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
MATT: So for that-- 
SAM: We need her back over here. 
TRAVIS: He's going to take her hostage. 
SAM: Goddamn it. 
MATT: Okay, so now let's repeat another contest. Make a strength check. 
LAURA: You got a six added to this roll. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: If you want it. If you need it. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Because I have minus two for strength. 
MARISHA: This is just a spell he's maintaining right now? 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. I mean... 
ASHLEY: Seven. (sympathetic noises) 
LIAM: Oh wow. 
ASHLEY: Seven. 
SAM: Ugh. 
TALIESIN: That's better. 
MATT: Right over next to him. 
LAURA: I didn't realize Fearne was so fucking weak. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know. My strength is shit. 
LAURA: What happened? 
ASHLEY: It's minus two. 
SAM: Well, she has a lot of charm. 
ASHLEY: I dumped it all into my wisdom. 
LAURA: Yeah, I get it. 
ASHLEY: I'm very, very smart. 
SAM: Hey, she's not going to fall in lava anymore. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's nice. 
LAURA: That's good. 
MATT: He pulls you in. "Extremely rude of your friends not to even treat for a conversation." 
ASHLEY: I can talk with you. Easy peasy. Let's just talk, let's just talk. 
MATT: "Let's find a better place to converse." 
ALL: No! 
MARISHA: 60 feet. They've got to be more than 60 feet away. Right? 
MATT: That brings us now to the juggernaut's turn and he's done. Chetney, FCG, you're up. Chetney, then FCG. So Chetney. 
TRAVIS: So y'all are right there, huh? 
SAM: You need to get within 60 feet of him now. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Who does? 
MARISHA: I do. So I can Counterspell him. 
SAM: But she's not going to. Oh wait, she could on her turn. 
LAURA: She could. 
SAM: On her turn, yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm coming up. 
LAURA: He goes after Orym. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
TALIESIN: Man. 
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I'm going to click my Boots of Speed. 
MATT: Okay. Which means doubles your movement. 
TRAVIS: It does. So my movement becomes 90. Can I use half of that to come this direction? 
MATT: 90. That's so fuckin' nuts. Vax 2.0. 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. 
TRAVIS: I'll just use 45. 45 is all I want. 
MATT: It's right there. All right. 
TRAVIS: I think that puts me within 30 feet of him. 
MATT: About there would be 30 feet. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Fuck it. We're taking chances. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to use-- Oh, I can't, that's a bonus action, too! Fuck! FCG, Fearne, Laudna. God, he's a full turn away, but he's before me. Shit! Can I retcon, and I'll just-- (groans) I'll go stand near FCG and I'll hold-- I'll hold-- (sighs) I'll hold my attack if somebody comes within melee range. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Actually, I'll move to the exterior of 10 feet of FCG, towards that direction. 
MATT: There you go. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Fuck. 
MATT: Holding your action. FCG, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
SAM: Anyone need healing? There's nothing I can do! 
LAURA: He took 10 points of lightning. 
TALIESIN: I'll never say no, but other than that. I know we're-- 
SAM: I mean, I can try to hit this dude over there. 
TALIESIN: We can't see him, I don't think. 
SAM: He's in a storm, but I think we can still make out his. It's not dark, is it? 
MARISHA: He's blind, but I think we can see him. 
SAM: But like, what's the point? He's so far away. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. He's not a threat anymore. 
SAM: I can't do an area attack on Ludinus, because Fearne's right there. 
TRAVIS: (shushes) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: He's about to take a fuckton of damage. 
SAM: It's not going to do anything. The only thing that it would do is maybe make him drop concentration on you. 
LAURA: Which would be great. 
SAM: But it would hurt you. 
LAURA: How many quicken spells does he get as a Magic--? 
ASHLEY: 72 hit points. 
SAM: Well then, I'll do a Spiritual Weapon on him. 
MATT: What's the range on Spiritual Weapon? 
SAM: 60 feet. I can walk a little closer. 
TRAVIS: Mercer! 
MATT: What's up? 
LIAM: I don't know how that class works at all. 
LAURA: He's a wizard. 
TALIESIN: He's a wizard with sorcery points. 
LAURA: You can take a feat-- 
LIAM: I don't know how that feat works. 
MATT: 60 feet, you'd have to get about 10 feet closer to him. 
TALIESIN: You have a couple points that you can spend to modify the way-- 
SAM: Because we're trying to get him to drop concentration, right? 
LAURA: Yes. 
LIAM: In vague terms, but I couldn't give you specifics. 
SAM: Okay. 
SAM: I'll walk 10 feet closer. Cast Spiritual Weapon on him. 
MATT: In what form? 
SAM: Oh. Well, because we're doing a hostage situation. 
SAM: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. All right. 
SAM: I'm going to do a hand holding a pepperbox right up to his temple. (laughter) 
SAM: Don't make me do it, man. 
MATT: There it is. (laughter) 
SAM: Don't make me do it. I'm crazy. I'm loco. (laughter) 
SAM: I will hit him with it. 
MATT: Okay. Roll for an attack. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Just base level two? 
SAM: No, I'm sorry, I'm doing it at 4th-level. 
MATT: 4th-level. You got it. 
SAM: Which makes it stronger, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
MATT: When you hit it does 2d? 
SAM: Yeah. 2d8 plus three. If I hit. 
MATT: If you hit. So roll the attack. 
SAM: Okay. Come on. Okay. 19 to hit. 
MATT: 19 just hits. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: Yeah! 
LAURA: That's good, that's good. 
ASHLEY: That's great, that's great, that's great. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
LIAM: Dis bish. 
SAM: Seven, three, plus three. 13 points of damage. Do I get Divine Strike on this? 
MATT: That's only when you're-- 
SAM: Only weapon attacks, right? 
MATT: -- physically attacking. He does roll to maintain concentration. But yeah, he's fine. 
SAM: Oh, goddamn it. 
TRAVIS: Hey man, it was worth a shot. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So that's your bonus action, right? Or is it an action to cast it? Is it a bonus action to cast or an action to cast? 
SAM: Oh no, it's my bonus action. I didn't want to use my bonus action. I wanted to use my action. 
TRAVIS: That's what I did on my turn! 
SAM: Fuck, I did the same thing as you! (laughter) 
SAM: Goddamn it! 
TRAVIS: But if I didn't use it, I couldn't get close enough to do it anyways, so it was fucking worthless. I was five feet short! 
SAM: I wanted to use my bonus action so that I could save-- I mean, I wanted to use my action so I can keep my bonus action to give her a d6. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: "As a bonus action, you can impart a--" Fuck! (laughter) 
SAM: We suck at this. 
TRAVIS: You got us fucked up, Matt! You got us fucked up! 
SAM: We're in our head! (laughter) 
MATT: I know. I love it. (laughter) 
MATT: Is that your turn? You have an action still? 
SAM: I have an action, which I can't use for a spell and no one's around. 
MATT: You can use it for a cantrip, if you wanted to. 
SAM: You can? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah, you can do a cantrip and a spell in the same turn. You just can't do two spells. 
SAM: Oh, I didn't know that. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Well then, shit. I'll shoot a Sacred Flame at him. 
MATT: Okay, so dex save on his point? 
SAM: It's dex 15. I bet he'll save. 
MATT: No, not with a natural two. 
LIAM: Ooh! 
SAM: Okay, 3d8 damage. Let's do this dance again. Eight. 
ASHLEY: We don't know. 
LAURA: He saves against mine. 
SAM: Terrible. Okay. 14 points of damage. 
MATT: 14 points of damage, all right. 
SAM: With that one do I get to add Divine? No. 
MATT: No. He maintains concentration. But he gets slammed, or I should say shot by the ethereal pepper box. (laughter) 
SAM: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Gets hit with that and then the flames burn up around and Fearne, you watch him (wince) (sighs) shake it off a little bit. He's showing a little wear and tear, he's taken some damage, but he's not looking rough. 
LAURA: No, that's not him. 
TRAVIS: Don't even toss that out there. Don't say that shit. 
SAM: I'll use the rest of my movement to tuck back another 10 feet back where I was. Yeah. 
MATT: All righty 
SAM: When I was-- Oh, I don't smell. I was going to say when I was over there, did I smell Chetney, but I don't have a nose. 
LAURA: That's what I was looking for before! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh, did I not say I made noise as I ran by? 
MATT: You weren't doing it stealthily. So you heard-- (gnomish footsteps) 
SAM: Oh. Did I hear him come back? No. 
TRAVIS: I was going to make noise to let you know that I'm here, that's why I came back. 
SAM: Should've slapped me on the butt. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: All righty. Finishing FCG's go, Fearne, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
TRAVIS: I tag your balls. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Got to stretch every morning. 
ASHLEY: So, I don't know if I can do this. 
TRAVIS: Use it or lose it. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: But I'm thinking of casting Wall of Fire. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Just sort of-- Hang on. Standby. 
SAM: You have no Teleport, no Blink, no-- 
TRAVIS: When does that secondary guard go? Is he at the bottom of the initiative order? 
MATT: He's at the very bottom of initiative order. 
SAM: You have no Misty Step, you have no Invisible. 
MATT: He rolled natural one on his initiative. 
SAM: You have no-- 
LIAM: You can put the wall through him, around him. 
ASHLEY: I can put it-- 
LIAM: He can probably move through it-- 
ASHLEY: It doesn't say that I can't-- 
LIAM: -- pretty easy, but. 
ASHLEY: It doesn't say that I can't put it where somebody's standing. 
MATT: Correct. You can create the wall on somebody, yes. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. I'd like to create it on him. 
MATT: Hmm. 
ASHLEY: If that's not doable, I might have another thing. 
MATT: No, no, no, it's doable. He's going to Counterspell. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So he has to roll to see if it counters it. 
TRAVIS: That's a reaction. 
SAM: He just Counterspelled. 
MARISHA: He did, he did. 
LIAM: But we're all spread out. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
MARISHA: I don't think I can reach him right now. 
MATT: It's a level four spell, so he has to beat your-- 
MARISHA: And also, I don't use a reaction. 
SAM: No, of course not. 
MATT: So he'll be rolling as spell attack modifier. 
SAM: But this is good. He's using a reaction. 
ASHLEY: So it's a dex save of 18. 
TRAVIS: All in one round, right? 
MATT: Well, first he has to see he Counterspelled. 
ASHLEY: Oh, because of the Counterspell, sorry. 
MATT: Natural 20, yeah. 
LAURA: (scoffs) 
MATT: Your Wall of Fire-- (dissipating puff) 
MARISHA: Fuck. Fuck. 
MATT: It begins to burn around him and he goes-- 
SAM: That's okay. 
MARISHA: He used his reaction. 
MATT: Wrinkles his nose and does a quick little gesture with his free hand and you watch as your fire just dissipates. 
TRAVIS: That's also just Counterspell. So he's got legendary reactions, right? 
MARISHA: Well no, to the end of his-- It has to reset. 
LIAM: We don't know. 
LAURA: We don't know 
MARISHA: So if he tries to bamf-- 
LAURA: Maybe this version of Ludinus doesn't have it. 
MARISHA: -- I can Counterspell it and he can't Counterspell me back. 
LAURA: Maybe this isn't really Ludinus. 
TRAVIS: Why do you all keep saying that? 
MATT: That's your action? 
ASHLEY: That's my action. 
LIAM: I'm open to it, I'm ready for it. 
LAURA: Stone in his head. 
LIAM: We haven't seen it happen yet. 
SAM: This is good. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it can't be Ludinus. 
ASHLEY: I have a bonus action. 
MARISHA: It can't be real Ludinus. 
ASHLEY: Wait, let me just-- (speed reading) 
TRAVIS: Luda! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Fuck. Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Ludinette. 
TRAVIS: (rap) ♪ Ludinus going first 'cause you never ♪ 
SAM: You could talk to him. 
TRAVIS: ♪ He won't stop ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: DJ Khaled, Ludinus! 
MATT: No. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Because I can't do another spell. 
TRAVIS: ♪ All I do is win, win, win, no matter what ♪ 
MATT: All I think of with DJ Khaled is the "Overwatch" thing, like, "Watch this!" 
MARISHA: He does this weird shuffle that sucks. 
SAM: You could talk to him. 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Oh, buddy. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Re-watch it. 
MATT: It's great. 
TRAVIS: It is a good shuffle. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Let's just-- 
MARISHA: ♪ All right all right ♪ 
ASHLEY: You said there was an olive branch situation. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Clearly, you've got me tied down here now. I can't do anything to you. What do you need? What do you want? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Tell me what. 
ASHLEY: What do you want? 
MATT: "The time for conversation was passed when your compatriots murdered my companions when I was here on a diplomatic mission. So let's wait until we're alone." 
ASHLEY: Well, hold on a minute. To be fair, to be fucking fair, okay? You and your group have murdered my friends and we brought them back, but that's besides the point. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I think we're pretty even here, and I think maybe just a little bit of a conversation might be something that we all could use in this moment. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
TRAVIS: Come on! Can't resist against that? Give him that charm, Calloway! 
LAURA: Yeah, with advantage because you're so charming. 
SAM: Yeah, double advantage. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: Show us some of that goat leg! 
MATT: Can't Guide yourself. 
ASHLEY: I can't? Fuck! 
MATT: It's an action to Guide yourself. 
ASHLEY: I know, whatever. I'm trying! (laughter) 
SAM: Guidance! 
MATT: Y'all pushing 5e to its limits over here. 
MARISHA: "I know, whatever. I'm trying." 
TRAVIS: I know! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 18. 
SAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: That's pretty good. 
MATT: 18. 
LIAM: No? Yep. 
MATT: "I'm certainly curious as to the similar paths we walk given the interesting choice of location, and--" Glances past you towards Ashton. "-- patrons." That finishes your turn. 
SAM: Okay. Maybe he'll talk. 
MATT: Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: (anxious moans) Ah! Okay, I'm going to move my full movement this way. 
SAM: Into the lava. 
MARISHA: Not into the lava, but here-ish. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Can I still see him? 
MATT: You can. Through the massive, divine gun-wielding arm that's-- (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: A normal-sized arm. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Am I still being held by him, also? That's still up. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Dang it. 
MARISHA: I'm going to let out a little whistle for my doggo. 
SAM: What? You have a dog? 
LIAM: In her chest. 
MARISHA: Yep, in my chest. 
ASHLEY: Let's go, doggo. 
MARISHA: My Hound of Ill Omen is going to burst forth. 120 feet, he is going to go right next to Ludinus. I'm supposed to roll initiative for him, but should he just go on my turn? 
MATT: I mean, roll initiative for him, see where he goes. 
LIAM: (growly barks) 
MARISHA: Two, so he's under me. 
MATT: Okay, so he literally comes right after you and then comes the-- 
MARISHA: Okay, but that's okay. 
LIAM: Shit, what do we do? 
MARISHA: This is dumb. I am going to try something new. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MARISHA: I'm going to do Phantasmal Force. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: So I'm going to make this illusion that this lava pool is splitting right in between Ludinus and Fearne, and the lava is crackling and boiling and separating, pushing the two of them apart. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. What's the save on that one? 
MARISHA: It is a DC intelligence save, but he has disadvantage because he's base to base with my hound. 
MATT: That's true. 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
LAURA: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Good thinking. 
MATT: Ah, that puts him at an 18. 
MARISHA: With disadvantage? 
MATT: It's like he's really intelligent. 
MARISHA: I know, it was a gamble. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Damn, Mercer. You didn't have to do it like that, dog. 
LIAM: Cool move, cool move. 
ASHLEY: He's cold! 
MATT: It's a good maneuver. It's a good maneuver. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: But not good enough. 
MARISHA: That's it, and then my doggo goes, I guess. 
MATT: Yeah, it's your dog's turn. 
LIAM: ♪ He's cold as ice ♪ 
MARISHA: (groans) Gosh, that was so close. 
TALIESIN: Does the dog give advantage for in combat? 
MARISHA: He does give pack tactics, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: He gets pack tactics, yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he grants that. 
MATT: He grants it to other people? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Oh, that's pretty cool. 
MARISHA: Dire wolf shit. 
TALIESIN: Cool. Good to know. 
MARISHA: That's good. That's a natural 19 plus five with his bite attack. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
MARISHA: 2d6 plus three. Okay, 10 damage. He has to succeed on a strength saving throw. 
MATT: Strength saving throw. That's going to be a six. 
MARISHA: He's knocked down. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Ow. 
MATT: (grunts) All right. 
SAM: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: Concentration. Yeah, maintains concentration. 
ASHLEY: How do you want to do this? 
LIAM: You just pushed an archmage into the dirt. 
MARISHA: I did, with a ghost dog. 
MATT: So pack tactics gives it advantage when it's in the area, it doesn't give other people advantage. 
MARISHA: Oh, it doesn't? 
LIAM: I'm very old. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Just want to clarify. 
MARISHA: "Wolf has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within five feet." Okay. 
MATT: Yeah, so it gets advantage. 
MARISHA: So if he flanks? 
MATT: If it's a flank situation, maybe, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay, that's what I thought, I'm sorry. 
MATT: That's okay. 
MARISHA: That's what I meant. 
MATT: That finishes your go? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: The hound's go. All right, it's now the defender's turn. He takes 2d6 damage at the top? 
LAURA: Eight points of lightning damage. 
MATT: Eight points of lightning damage to him. "No!" He's going to run. 
SAM: He's protecting his master. 
MATT: 30 there. 
TRAVIS: His real master? 
MATT: He's going to attack your hound. Twice with his weapon there. 
TRAVIS: Not the dogey. 
MATT: That's going to be 16. 
MARISHA: Miss. 
MATT: Miss? 
MARISHA: 18. 
MATT: Dang! That's awesome. And then natural 20. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that hits. 
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise. 
MATT: All right, puts it at-- 19 points of slashing damage. 
MARISHA: He's dead. (groaning) 
TRAVIS: The dog? 
LAURA: Doggie, no. 
ASHLEY: Nom nom nom. 
MARISHA: A handful of hit points. 
LIAM: You've gone too far, Matt. 
MATT: Good. All right, that finishes the defender's go. No, actually, has five more feet of movement, so he's going to step into where the hound was. He'll stay there, keep his shield there at the ready. "Martinet!" And just put it to the side. 
TRAVIS: Official names, Martinet Ludinus Da'leth. 
SAM: Oh, this is his rank, right? 
ASHLEY: What did he say, what did he say? 
LAURA: Martinet! 
TRAVIS: Martinet Ludinus-- 
MATT: Ashton, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
TALIESIN: Question, does Wormhole Strike count as a closeup melee attack even though it's a distance strike, or does it count as a ranged attack? 
MATT: In what context? 
TALIESIN: If I were to hit somebody who is prone, would I have disadvantage or advantage? I know, odd question. 
MATT: In this instance, you're making a melee attack at a distance. 
TALIESIN: So it'd be disadvantage? 
MATT: No, because it's not a ranged attack. 
TALIESIN: I know, isn't that odd? 
MATT: So you would have advantage, yeah, you would. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: That's the benefit of that particular ability. You got to burn a Chaos Burst to do it and it doesn't do any additional damage, but-- 
TALIESIN: That's fine. 
MATT: This is one of those instances where, yeah, you can do that. 
TALIESIN: I'm going walk over to the edge where I know-- Well, let's see, where's my 60 feet. So-- I'm going to walk up to not quite to the edge. Walk up pretty close to the edge of the hot right there. 
MATT: 25 right there? 
TALIESIN: Maybe not quite that far, but yeah, right there. That's 60 feet, give or take. 
MATT: Maybe. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Give or take. 
TALIESIN: That's 60 feet. I'm feeling pretty confident. 
MATT: Yeah, he's within 60 feet. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it, drop that fucking spell and I'm going to splash down with a Wormhole Strike right on top of that prone motherfucker. 
MATT: Okay, roll for an attack. 
TALIESIN: That's 22 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TALIESIN: That's 20 points of damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: If I do two hits, does he do the two together then he has to roll against to save? 
MATT: No, it's against each one. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so-- 
MATT: First one maintains concentration. 
TALIESIN: Well, yep, fuck it. I know that by the time this ends we're all going to be fucked anyway, so might as well go for another. 
SAM: He can just cast another spell. 
LAURA: I know, but if he can drop concentration-- 
TALIESIN: That's cocked. 
LAURA: -- we can get Fearne back to us. 
TALIESIN: Damn it. Fuck, I miss, 14. 
MATT: 14 misses. 
TALIESIN: Shit. I don't know how I did it. The one that hit-- 
MATT: So you assume that you hit him once, it's hard to see him because he's clustered around by both Fearne, this sentient hand and the defender has a shield out in front. 
TALIESIN: Shit. I'm going to back up again to FCG. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: He didn't drop concentration? 
TALIESIN: No, I tried. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your go, Ashton. Imogen, you're up, with Orym on deck. 
SAM: Ugh. 
LAURA: (frustrated noise) 
MARISHA: What level spell is Teleport? 
LAURA: Okay, fuck. I'm going to move right here. 
SAM: Oh wait, Teleport? 
LAURA: Yeah? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Sorry. Seventh. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- 
SAM: Is Counterspell third or fourth? 
MARISHA: Counterspell is three. 
SAM: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- Sorry, my thing is being funny. 
TRAVIS: You're fine. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt into the back of the soldier and him. 
MATT: Okay, yeah. 
LAURA: He gets disadvantage on dexterity saving throws, right, because he's prone? 
MATT: Yeah, I mean, that's a full line there. 
LIAM: Dang. 
MATT: Yeah. Yes, it is. All righty, so the defender. 
LAURA: That's a 5th-level. 
MATT: 5th-level, nice. The defender fails. Damn, had a really nice check, too, but still failed. And then the-- Ludinus with disadvantage is going to be still a 24. 
LAURA: On dexterity?! 
SAM: Good lord. 
MATT: He rolled pretty good for disadvantage. 
LAURA: Sheesh! 
SAM: Also, he's got like a 20 in every stat. 
LAURA: Jesus. He rolled a two before on dex! I know it's possible. Okay, he does-- 
MATT: Well, it was a natural two. 
LAURA: Right, yeah, I know. 10d6 damage to the little dude. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I want to see if I have enough. 
TALIESIN: We're burning a lot of shit here. 
LAURA: 10. 
SAM: Whoa, whoa. 
LIAM: Ooh, some good. Ooh, my. 
LAURA: Yeah, okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh my! 
LAURA: 12, 22, 28, 36, 41, 42 points of lightning damage. 
SAM: Damn. 
MATT: 42, he gets fried from behind and just drops to the ground, smoke emitting from underneath the armor while Ludinus takes half that. 
LAURA: Yeah, so 21 points. 
ASHLEY: Dang, nice, nice. 
LAURA: Concentration check. 
MATT: Yes, indeed. He drops concentration. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
SAM: He breaks concentration. 
ASHLEY: Let's go! 
MATT: From that point, Fearne, you feel the grip release you. 
LAURA: You have to get, but he's going to have a turn after Orym. 
MARISHA: Is he still down? He's down. 
TRAVIS: He just needs half his movement. 
MARISHA: I know, but-- 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: For my bonus action, I'm going to Telekinetic Pull her five feet away from him. 
MATT: What's the range on that? 
LAURA: I don't know. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Whatever it needs to be. You know. 
LAURA: It's 30 feet. It doesn't work. 
MATT: It's not going to do that, sorry. 
ASHLEY: I accept. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Thanks for trying. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Imogen? 
TALIESIN: Roll back towards FCG. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going to step back towards. Hold on, let me just double, double, triple check. 
MARISHA: (muttering) Bamf or Polymorph and-- 
ASHLEY: Maybe. 
MARISHA: Something. 
ASHLEY: I was thinking about it. 
LAURA: I'm going to use my bonus action to-- 
SAM: I also want to know what he wanted to tell us. 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: He wanted to talk. 
LAURA: To get a spell back. 
TRAVIS: He's going after the gem to get titan power. 
LAURA: I'm going to use my bonus action to use some sorcery points. 
MATT: You got it. All right, Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: Orym screams Fearne's name. He's going to run five, 10, 15, 20. 
LAURA: You can use a thingy, right? 
LIAM: 25, 30. I can't use a thingy. I will pull a dagger out of each boot and just wing them at Ludinus' body on the ground. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: At disadvantage. 
MATT: Yeah, because he is prone. 
LIAM: Yep. I'm far. That's balls, that's 17, that misses. 
MATT: Misses. 
TRAVIS: Lob it. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Also misses. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: (dagger missing noises) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Let me just check one thing. 
TRAVIS: Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Same team, same team. 
LIAM: That's it. I just stand there ineffectually, looking at Fearne, willing her to get the fuck out of there. That's the end of my turn. 
MATT: Okay, that brings us to Ludinus' turn. 
TALIESIN: You're not going to roll back towards us? 
LIAM: I can't, I use my full movement to get that far. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Whatcha gonna do when they come for you ♪ 
ALL: ♪ Bad boys, bad boys ♪ ♪ Whatcha gonna to do ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ Whatcha gonna-- ♪ 
MATT: All right. So. 
TRAVIS: (scatting) 
MATT: Ludinus gets back up. (laughter) 
MATT: Here as the spectral hand remains, looks over towards you and goes, "(sighs) It's a shame, but at the very least a lesson can be learned here." As he steps past you, you can take an attack of opportunity, if you'd like. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Oh no, he's do some really terrible stuff to us. 
ASHLEY: Yes, uh-- 
TRAVIS: You were saying that as he was looking at Fearne? 
MATT: Yes, as he walks past her, so it's a physical attack. Go ahead and roll an attack of opportunity with your melee attack. 
ASHLEY: Sickle. 
MATT: Your sickle. 
MARISHA: What's about to happen? 
LAURA: We're going to die. 
ASHLEY: Can I do it with my thorn whip? 
MATT: No. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: That's a cantrip. You'd have to have War Caster to do that. 
ASHLEY: I just, I understand. 
LAURA: I just wanted her to get back so we could Teleport. 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: You just (whooshes) wide. He looks out and begins to mutter an incantation under his breath. As his fingers spread, the air seems to shimmer. I need 30-foot radius sphere. 
MARISHA: Counterspell. 
ASHLEY: What's he doing? 
MATT: Counterspell? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. It's a 60-foot range. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: You are within 60 feet. Go ahead and roll and see if you counter it. This is a 9th-level spell. (screaming) 
ASHLEY: What? 
TRAVIS: You can't casually drop the nine! 
MATT: So you need to beat a 19. 
MARISHA: I need to beat a 19. 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: My spellcasting-- 
TRAVIS: Don't you have a d6? Don't you have a d6 from FCG? 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: I didn't give her the fucking d6 because of bonus actions. 
MARISHA: My spellcasting modifier is five. 
MATT: Right, so roll a d20. 
TRAVIS: 14. 
MARISHA: So I have to roll a 14. 
MATT: You have to roll 14 or higher. 
TRAVIS: That's plenty of outs. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: That's plenty of outs. 
SAM: I didn't give you the goddamn six! 
MARISHA: I have a 25% chance of hitting this. 
TRAVIS: You won't roll it. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give it to me, give it to me. 
TRAVIS: You are going to fuck it up. You're going to let everybody die. 
MARISHA: I must overcome the man! 
TRAVIS: If this comes out good, you'll dream about this forever. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (yelling) 
LAURA: Is it a natural 20?! 
MARISHA: It's a 14! 
MATT: Take a fucking picture of that. (yelling and laughter) 
MATT: Oh my god. Take a picture of that fucking shit right there. 
LIAM: Take your 9th-level spell and shove it up your ass! 
TRAVIS: The magic works! It works! 
SAM: 9th-level spell. 
ASHLEY: The magic works. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, I got it. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Yes! Yes, you dead woman, yes! 
MARISHA: That's right. Doubt me! 
SAM: It could be anything. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Each of you feel this strange, alien arcane hand begin to reach into your mind, your memories, your fears, and then suddenly (puffs) it's gone. You see Ludinus go. He's going to Counterspell you. 
MARISHA: Huh? 
MATT: Try and continue the spell to see if he can do that. 
SAM: Didn't he already use his reaction? 
MATT: It's a new turn. 
SAM: Does he recharge at the end of his turn? 
MATT: Huh? Top of your turn, you get your reaction back. 
SAM: Top of your turn. 
MATT: And it's a 3rd-level? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So it has to beat a 13. 
LIAM: He rolled a six. 
MATT: It's a 12. (yelling) (yelling) 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
MARISHA: What! 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Take a picture of it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Take a picture of it. 
MATT: Goddamn it. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. Whoa. 
MATT: As he tries, the Counterspell just shatters. 
SAM: Oh no, he's going to hate you. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he is. 
LIAM: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: "Well, at the very least, we have more information," and he's going to keep walking. 
MARISHA: We have more information? 
MATT: 25 to 30 and then just fall into the lava. 
LAURA: Yeah, he's not real. 
TALIESIN: Knew it! 
MARISHA: He's not-- 
MATT: (splashing, steam whooshing) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: He's not real! 
TALIESIN: Leave a message next time, you fuck! 
MATT: As his body hits the lava, his flesh melts immediately into a pile of snow that almost instantaneously turns into steam. 
ASHLEY: Can I try to grab the-- 
LAURA: What about the stone? 
MARISHA: Yeah, in his head? 
MATT: The stone, if you want to try and rush over. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to grab it. 
MATT: Okay, so you run, you rush over to the side. Go ahead and make an investigation check to see if you can see it. Investigation or perception, your choice. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I'm going to do this one. 
LAURA: Epic. Epic. 
MARISHA: That was crazy. (laughs) 
LAURA: So it's like his mental-- 
SAM: No, it's his simulacrum. 
MARISHA: Yeah, but his brain is still-- 
LAURA: His brain is in it. 
MARISHA: In a, yeah. 
ASHLEY: 24. 
MARISHA: Cloned. 
MATT: 24. 
LAURA: So he's seeing through it. 
MATT: You see it, you grab for it. You will take fire damage from this. 
ASHLEY: That's okay. 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Wow. 
SAM: (deep exhale) 
LIAM: Wow. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You take 18 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Was it going to be Modify Memory? You reach to it, into our brains? 9th-level? 
TALIESIN: No. 
MARISHA: Fear and-- 
LIAM: Some custom Martian-- 
TALIESIN: It's some crazy Martian bullshit. 
MATT: So you pull it forth and look at it, and the stone, the opal that's in your grasp, as the fire burns away, it is cracked. 
TALIESIN: Good to have anyway. 
LAURA: Yeah, definitely. You can check it out, see what's going on. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Can I try to Mend it? 
TALIESIN: Turn into a necklace. 
MARISHA: I mean, it's magic. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
LAURA: We can bring it to-- 
TALIESIN: Imahara. 
LAURA: Yeah, Imahara. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
TRAVIS: Are the threats gone? 
MATT: It seems like there's no immediate threats that you know of. 
TRAVIS: How is the lava lake looking? 
MATT: It looks the same as before. 
LAURA: We got to get out of here. 
TALIESIN: Let's get the fuck out of here, everybody. I'm so tired. 
SAM: There's nothing here for us to fight. 
TALIESIN: We're going to go now. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: What if he just sends another group? I have a feeling he can make more and more of that shit. 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: He can just keep making himself. 
TRAVIS: Fearne, get over here! 
SAM: Can we at least investigate the dead body of the guard, see if there's anything? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want to check the guard? 
LAURA: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll check the butt. Well, who's better at that? I'm not very good. 
TRAVIS: Check the butt? 
ASHLEY: I'll check the butt. Anybody else-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: It's firm. 
ASHLEY: What's going on in there? 
LIAM: Spread 'em. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's check the body. 
SAM: Chetney, can you go check the body? You're good at that. 
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll run over. (rapid pitter-patter) 
MATT: The body of--? 
TRAVIS: The guard. 
LAURA: The one guard that is-- 
LIAM: One guard. 
TRAVIS: The only one left. 
TALIESIN: The only one we didn't throw into the lava pit. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Indeed, there is a set of Ruby Vanguard raiments, a nice big shield, like a tower shield, a longsword that looks very well made, and looks to be about, I'd say, 325 gold. 
TRAVIS: Sweet. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Should we take his clothes and shield? 
TRAVIS: Bonus for Chetney! There's nothing but weapons over here. 
SAM: Take his clothes for sure. 
TRAVIS: I'm actually going to take all of it and I'm shoving it in the bag of holding. 
MATT: Yeah. The robe, while the snow melts and the steam rises, you can see the robe that he was wearing is still floating-- 
LAURA: Ludinus? 
MATT: -- and slowly sinking into the water. 
LAURA: Get it! Grab it! Grab it! 
SAM: Oh grab him! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: What was? 
SAM: The robe. 
LIAM: The robe. 
MATT: Who's grabbing it? 
LIAM: That's good for-- 
ASHLEY: I can grab it, I can grab it. 
LAURA: Yeah, or I can cast Telekinesis again and pull it out. 
TRAVIS: I can grab it, too, I'm right there. 
LAURA: Okay, whoever's there. 
LIAM: We got it. 
SAM: You're busy. You're busy. 
LAURA: We just need to get it. 
MATT: Okay, so you rush over real fast and grab it before it vanishes and pull it out and it-- 
LIAM: Yeah, it's for one of our witches. 
MATT: It's warm to the touch and it's just a-- It's like a simpler replica of the ceremonial robes that Ludinus wore at the creation of the Bloody Bridge. 
LAURA: Okay, we got to check that out. 
TALIESIN: But is it damaged by the-- 
MATT: It is not damaged. 
TALIESIN: Oh, there you go! 
LAURA: Amazing. Yeah. 
SAM: It's a replica-- 
TALIESIN: You have two toys to play with, right? 
SAM: It's a costume replica or--? 
MATT: It just looks like a simpler version. Same design, but it's less ornamental. 
LAURA: It's not like Ludinus-- 
MARISHA: Spirit Halloween. 
LAURA: -- would give up his cloak. 
TALIESIN: It's Spirit "red moon ritual robe." 
MARISHA: Red moon-- (laughs) 
MATT: Yes, yeah. Yeah, exactly. (laughter) 
LIAM: It didn't incinerate immediately, which means it's magic. Okay. 
LAURA: Which means it's magic. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Comic-Con, they had robes ready 15 minutes after the solstice began. People were already wearing that shit. 
SAM: Should we say a little prayer for all the falling doompa-loompas? 
TALIESIN: Yes, and it should start with a fucking Teleport spell. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's what they would have wanted. 
SAM: Yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: All right. Doompa-loompa doompity-doo. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: The elder speaks. 
SAM: I want to get away from you. (laughter) 
SAM: Gather round, I guess we'll Teleport out of here. 
TALIESIN: Let's get the fuck-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- out of this place. 
SAM: Where are we going? 
LAURA: Are we going back to-- 
SAM: Where were we going to meet Timothée Chalamet? (laughs) Kimothée Chalamet. 
ASHLEY: Kimothée Chalamet? 
LAURA: Kimothée Chalamet. 
TRAVIS: But we're in the Shattered Teeth. Are we really leaving? 
ASHLEY: Wait, isn't there somewhere else we have to go? 
SAM: Oh, it's so nice here. 
MARISHA: It is so nice. 
ASHLEY: There's nowhere else we have to go here? 
LAURA: Yes, we have to meet up with-- 
MARISHA: But we should probably get back to Imahara Joe. 
ASHLEY: Aw. 
LAURA: Yeah, we have to find out if they've-- 
TRAVIS: But there's 20, 41 islands or whatever, how many? 
MARISHA: I know. 
SAM and ASHLEY: 43. 
LAURA: I think our-- 
TRAVIS: We've been on two! 
ASHLEY: I know. 
TALIESIN: Three. 
LAURA: I think our easy breezy no time limit street is ending as Ludinus is tracking us more and more. 
TRAVIS: That's very fair. 
TALIESIN: I really wish we could stay, too, but yes, we'll come back. 
ASHLEY: What information did he get? Why did he-- 
TRAVIS: What we were after. 
TALIESIN: I'm definitely coming back here. 
LAURA: He's got more information. He knows that we have a shard. He knows that she can-- 
SAM: She can do Counterspell. 
LAURA: He knows our abilities. 
TALIESIN: You fucked him up real good. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
LAURA: But. yeah, we did. We did way better than I thought we would against him. 
ASHLEY: We did way better. 
SAM: He knows we've got a rod. 
ASHLEY: We did way better. 
LAURA: He knows we're learning stuff. 
LIAM: So options, where we can go. Back to Evontra'vir? 
LAURA: I think it's dangerous to bamf inside of the Shattered Teeth. 
TALIESIN: I would agree. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: We got to go back to Imahara Joe, then, unless there's anyone else that we need to visit. 
TALIESIN: Where is Imahara again? 
SAM: Kimothée Chalamet was going to come back and meet us there, or she was going to reach out to us? 
LAURA: She was going to just-- 
MATT: She sent the individuals that you saved from Bassuras to meet with another tinkerer with a mind for odd mechanics and magic. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. 
MATT: So you asked them be sent-- 
LAURA: But we didn't know where. 
MATT: -- to Whitestone. 
LAURA: (gasps) They're in Whitestone. We should go to Whitestone. 
SAM: Okay. But-- Okay, we can go to Whitestone. 
TALIESIN: I would feel better with that fucking fire crystal in Whitestone, at this point. 
ASHLEY: Wait, where's Imahara right now? 
TALIESIN: Whitestone. 
MARISHA: Imahara said it was going to take two-ish weeks. 
MATT: On his own. 
LAURA: But he's got help from several other people now. 
MATT: He said he has with the help of Vespa and the help of-- 
SAM: Because Whitestone has stuff. 
ASHLEY: Dancer? 
MATT: Yeah, the Terrible Tinkerer of Tal'Dorei-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, the Terrible-- Okay. 
SAM: Labs and stuff. 
MATT: It might go much faster. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: So wait. Did we send Imahara Joe to Whitestone? 
TALIESIN: I'm glad that caught on. 
SAM: Yes, and Dancer. 
MARISHA: And Dancer. 
SAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Terrible Tinkerer of Tal'Dorei. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Right. 
TRAVIS: Triple T's. 
SAM: Okay, then Whitestone. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Gather round. 
ASHLEY: For I have news. 
SAM: For I have news. I guess I'll target, do you want to go to the palace, or the Sun Tree, or--? 
LAURA: I mean-- 
LIAM: They're walking distance. 
LAURA: Yeah, I think Sun Tree is a nice-- 
SAM: All right. 
LIAM: Change. 
SAM: Aim for the Sun Tree. 
MATT: Okay. As you clutch the staff that Ludinus recognized in your hand, the twisted wood and the odd crystal at its edge, you concentrate and watch as the various glowing glyphs in the side diminish as it expends the power within. All of you feel that familiar rush, that rise under your stomach of anticipation and energy as you all are pulled between realms. We'll roll for where you get next round as we're going to end the episode there. 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Oh! 
LIAM: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: We roll now or next episode? 
LAURA: Next episode? Next episode? 
MATT: We'll roll the beginning of the next episode. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MATT: See if it succeeds. 
LIAM: So we're caught in the in-between room. 
SAM: What a crazy fight. 
ASHLEY: That was so fun. 
SAM: And that wasn't even a real guy! 
MARISHA: That was wild. No. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: I feel both a little bad that we didn't get to hear a villain speech, and also very impressed that we managed to interrupt a villain speech that completely. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
SAM: I wanted to know what he was going to say! 
LAURA: I'm sorry! 
ASHLEY: No, no. It's-- 
MARISHA: I mean, we can fill in the blanks. 
LAURA: I had flashbacks to feeling so dumb for letting him keep talking when he ended the world and I was like, why do we just let him keep talking? 
ASHLEY: I feel so-- 
LIAM: Honestly-- 
LAURA: I feel like that's biggest-- 
TRAVIS: We were trying. 
LAURA: -- insult to him is to fucking-- 
LIAM: It feels great to have put egg on the face of the archmage. His shit did not work. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's pretty good. 
LIAM: It just did not work. 
SAM: Yeah, you destroyed him. 
LAURA: Yeah. Laudna, that was amazing. 
SAM: With some clutch rolls. 
MARISHA: Serious, thank god, all the shit rolls that I've been rolling this entire game, it didn't matter. It's the only one that mattered. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What? 
LIAM: 9th-level. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Stabbed a man into the fucking fire, like the fire didn't kill him, the stabbing. 
MATT: That was awesome. 
TALIESIN: You beat the lava in a race. 
LIAM: I was like, "I know this guy is strong, but if I do it six times." 
TRAVIS: Empty the clip! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Surely, I can get him. 
MATT: Even his versions of himself wouldn't let you get the final blow. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: He was like, "Mm-mm." 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm going to do this myself. 
MATT: Well, I'm excited to see where we go next time when we pick up from here. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
MATT: Thank you all for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? 
SAM: Yay! 
MATT: Good night.
