MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons while dressed as horses. 
ALL: (garbled) We play Dungeons & Dragons while dressed as horses! 
MATT: Apparently. 
LAURA: This is falling. 
MATT: Oh man. 
MARISHA: We've got to get through this fast, before they all fall apart. 
MATT: Yeah, so first up, Nord VPN, which means a visit from the world's number one French magician-- 
SAM: Oui, oui. C'est moi, Nordo the Nagnificent. 
MATT: No, Nordo, I'm sorry, not you. I said the number one magician. You're second best, if you remember. Please welcome Twilight Charm! (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Bonsoir, bonsoir, oui oui. I am called Twilight Charm, France's great equine magician. (laughter) 
SAM: Merde! 
ASHLEY: Before I commence le show, let me first thank my fandom, the Sparkles. Je t'aime, je t'aime. And I also want to thank NordVPN for sponsoring this show. You know-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: While I am here in America-- What is this turning into? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: -- for the Equine Magic Super Bowl, I use NordVPN to surf the internet. And-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Shit. My laptop thinks it's still in France, so I can watch my favorite streaming shows and feel safe while doing it. (laughter) 
MATT: (hysterically) What shows do you watch in France? 
ASHLEY: You know, "RuPaul's Cigarette Drag Race." "Two Smoke Girls." "The Wheel of Mime." "Road Rules." And another thing about NordVPN-- 
SAM: Let me guess, NordVPN has an exclusive deal at nordvpn.com/criticalrole? Our viewers will get extra subscription time with their order, and you can try it risk-free now with a 30-day money back guarantee? That's my line! 
ASHLEY: Zat is correct, but I would have said it with more je ne sais pas. 
SAM: Forget this verbal jousting. Let's settle our boeuf how real horse magicians do, with a magic-off. 
ASHLEY: Very well, your best trick versus mine. These idiots will decide who wins. (laughter) 
LIAM and LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
LAURA: That's not-- 
MATT: Okay! 
ASHLEY: I'm French! It's my way! 
MATT: All right, no, I get that. 
SAM: Okay, I will start. Here is my first trick. Watch this. Ooh! 
LAURA: Wow! 
ASHLEY: Mon dieu, that was a fantastic trick. Well played. My trick is: Ready, do you see it? And now it's another-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Hold on. Give me one more second. I was ill prepared. There we go. 
SAM: Anytime! 
ASHLEY: See this? And now it is yellow and purple! 
ALL: Whoa! 
SAM: Wait, I have another trick! I have another trick! Watch, it's just a normal piece of rope. Ooh! But now... it is stiff. 
LAURA and LIAM: Whoa! 
SAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Wow, amazing. I just have this. This is black, and now, it's red. (laughter) 
SAM: C'est incroyable! Well, idiots, it's up to you to decide who wins. 
ASHLEY: Hee hee hee, hoh hoh hoh! (disappointed noises) 
LAURA: We really do choose now? 
LIAM: So we have choose who-- 
SAM: Yes, please choose! 
TRAVIS: I think bonsoir, bonsoir. 
ASHLEY: You know it's me. It's me, number one. 
MATT: The French one. 
SAM: All right, all right. 
MATT: Twilight Sparkle. 
SAM: Well, I cannot stay mad. 
TALIESIN: I have my Sparkles t-shirt. 
SAM: I cannot stay mad at you, Twilight Charm. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
SAM: Shall we toast to the new champion? 
ASHLEY: Ah, ooh la la. 
SAM: A toast to NordVPN. Grab your deal at nordvpn.com/criticalrole. 
ASHLEY: Matt, cognac to you. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Hail the conquering hero! (applause) 
LIAM: Wow. 
MATT: I think you almost killed Travis. 
TRAVIS: I was having trouble breathing for a minute. 
MARISHA: I don't understand. What's that? 
TRAVIS: Should we move that glass? It's just going to-- 
LAURA: Travis, he's going to hit it. Oh wow. (soft whoosh) 
LAURA: Amazing. 
ASHLEY: That's a little-- 
LAURA: Is it really-- Is it really alcohol? 
LIAM: I hope so. 
ASHLEY: Maybe you should taste it and find out. 
TALIESIN: That never goes well. 
MATT: Speaking of finding out. Our second sponsor is Warner Bros. Games and their new game, Mortal Kombat 1. 
TRAVIS: Mortal Kombat! 
MATT: It's the latest title in the acclaimed Mortal Kombat video game franchise developed by the award-winning NetherRealm Studios. 
MARISHA: Toasty! 
MATT: This game-- indeed-- introduces a revitalized Mortal Kombat universe crafted by the Fire God Liu Kang. It showcases reimagined versions of iconic characters in unprecedented ways. The game also presents a new fighting system, various game modes, bone-crushing finishing moves, and more.

MARISHA: So cool. 
MATT: Laura, you got some stuff to talk about. 
LAURA: I have stuff to talk about! Okay, well, first, I'm going out of order, but I'm going to talk about this because I'm wearing it. 
MATT: I didn't even notice that, that's awesome! 
LAURA: This is our Laudna dress. 
MARISHA: It's so great. 
LAURA: Check it out. Oh no, it scrolled all the way! Wait, go back up! It's a dress! I'm going to go back, I'm going to talk about it in a second. Look! (laughter) We have Caduceus Clay kitchen stuff that we made. 
TRAVIS: Look, they got toadstools! 
LAURA: Wait, where's my potholder? 
MATT: That's pretty great. 
TALIESIN: It's over there. Matt, can you grab the-- 
LAURA: Oh, we threw the potholder. 
TALIESIN: I may have thrown the potholder. 
LIAM: It took us seven years to get this streamlined. 
LAURA: Art is by Savanna Mayer. We did it because we have that cookbook, you guys, so now you can have stuff that you can take it out of the oven with. 
ASHLEY: (French accent) You will not get messy anymore! 
LAURA: (French accent) You will not get messy because you can cover your body with this. (regular accent) And look at this potholder. 
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, wait! Hey! 
ASHLEY: Whoa, that's cool, actually. 
MARISHA: So you can wash it. 
ASHLEY: That's awesome. 
LIAM: New magician. 
LAURA: Isn't that awesome? We also have this, which I should have waited for, but this artist is Adriann Helton. 
MARISHA: It's so good, you guys. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. I should stand up a little bit. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, it's so flowy. 
ALL: Ooh! 
LAURA: So yeah, it's amazing. Then we also have these. New dice sets! (cheering) 
LAURA: Have you guys seen these in person yet? 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: We have an Ashton Greymoore set. 
ASHLEY: Pretty cool, guys. 
LAURA: You've got to look at them. 
TALIESIN: No, bring it. 
LAURA: Okay, hold them up because they're amazing, and tell me what they remind you of! 
TALIESIN: Oh wow, there we are. 
LAURA: They're like your mind stone. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god, there's little chunks of skull. 
LIAM: They're like pieces of his head. 
TALIESIN: Little brain chunks. 
LAURA: They're so beautiful. 
TALIESIN: They're really great. 
LIAM: And they got the hammer. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's got the hammer. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
LAURA: And then we also have-- 
TALIESIN: That's so pretty. 
LAURA: -- Fearne! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: I love them. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, look at the inside. 
LAURA: I know, it matches your little dress that you have on your cape. 
TRAVIS: A little liner? 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Nat 20. 
ASHLEY: They have little flowers on the inside. 
LAURA: Flowers inside! 
TALIESIN: Brought the hammer. 
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness! 
LAURA: Aren't they so pretty? What'd you roll? 
ASHLEY: Lucky number seven. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I rolled a nat 20, which means I get to keep them for the game. 
LAURA: Yeah, keep them. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there we go. Mine. 
LAURA: So yeah, that's what we got. 
ASHLEY: These are so pretty. 
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Laura. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, these are great. 
MATT: Lady I'm married to next to the horse. 
TRAVIS: Hey, next to the horse lady! 
MARISHA: You guys. The first episode of Candela Obscura: Chapter Two is available to watch right now on Twitch, YouTube, and our podcast channels. 
TRAVIS: So good. 
ASHLEY: It's so good. 
MARISHA: You guys got to watch it, it's bonkers. 
LIAM: I'm feeling the horror now. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you can join the Circle of Needle & Thread for Episode Two on September 28th, and if you want to learn a little more about this-- Whoa, whoa, calm. Shh, shh. 
ASHLEY: (whinnies) 
MARISHA: If you want to learn a little more about this new group of investigators, you can visit critrole.com for some fun Q&As with the cast on our website. 
TRAVIS: Nice, nice. 
MARISHA: Isn't that right, Nordy? 
SAM: (blows raspberry) 
MARISHA: He's a sweet boy. 
MATT: This is getting super surreal, very Twin Peaks-esque. Next up, Demiplane. (cheering) 
MATT: For those who aren't aware, Demiplane hosts digital toolsets for a vast range of tabletop games out there, and now... the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn has joined those very ranks! (cheering) 
MATT: Tal'Dorei Reborn is live on Demiplane's 5E nexus, their home for independent and third party publishing content for 5E. This nexus edition of Tal'Dorei Reborn, I made the place, I should pronounce it properly, is specifically formatted to be accessed with any device with tools and tips to make game prep even easier for you. In quarter one of 24... 24? 2024. You'll be able to create characters with Tal'Dorei Reborn's race, class, backgrounds, feats, items, and spells with 5E nexus' upcoming character tools that'll be launching around then. Plus, Demiplane makes it easy to discover people to play with using matchmaking and group finding capabilities. 
ASHLEY: So good.

TRAVIS: I've seen it, the 5E Nexus. It looks dope. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: I think that finally concludes our announcements, as much as I would love to keep Sam in that outfit. 
SAM: Oh god, it's so hot! 
MATT: I think let's go ahead and jump into the game and bring us into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last left off: Bell Hells had-- 
ASHLEY: Bell Hells? 
MARISHA: Yeah, Bell Hell. 
MATT: Bell Hells, Bells Hells. 
ASHLEY: Just the one. 
MATT: -- had sought out aid with an artifact they had uncovered that seemed tethered two parts of Ludinus Da'leth's past. In doing so, you sought out Dancer who has a tumultuous history with FCG, as well as heading back to Bassuras to bring their skill and talent to combine with that of Imahara Joe in hopes of discovering the true nature and/or the capabilities of this artifact once it were to be repaired, refurbished. Upon arriving there, you found that it seems a lot of outside military force by interested temple factions or other military factions from around Exandria are starting to gather in the Hellcatch around the ground zero of where the Bloody Bridge currently still tethers the moon Ruidus into the sky. Here, you also discovered that Imahara Joe's shop had been shuttered up, and apparently had long been captured by Paragon's Call within the city, and they were forcing him to do work for Paragon's Call itself, and by proxy, the Ruby Vanguard. You managed to ruin entirely Paragon's Call within, and foiled the plans and capabilities of General Ratanish, one of the secondary generals beneath Otohan Thull. Putting them to rest and covering your tracks, you saved Imahara Joe and another companion of his, also of quite intellect and capability. With the aid of Keyleth, sent them off to a safe space with her while she managed to handle her business in the time to come of growing tumult (Temult). 
TRAVIS: (knowing grunt) 
MARISHA: (gasps) It all comes around. 
MATT: Yes. Then sent you all to the rarely journeyed "continent" of clustered islands known as the Shattered Teeth-- 
LIAM: Sweet! 
MATT: -- to seek information and answers surrounding the essence and mystery of Ashton's past and current nature. 
TRAVIS: I'm very excited. 
MARISHA: Let's do it! 
MATT: As you all step through the temporarily open portal of the tree that sends you into this strange unfamiliar landscape, as the sound of the magical trunk closing behind you, you all begin to glance around. You now stand in the center of a relatively dense forest. Humid is the air. Not too terribly warm, but definitely a thick humidity that surrounds you. The trees themselves are these black and white spiraled birches that the actual trunks seem to grow in a corkscrew, a slow corkscrew into the sky where a thick canopy of birch leaves clusters up large parts of the sky. The current, now currently fading daylight that you can see at this point gives a strange yellowish tone. I say that because the cloud cover and the fog that chokes the middle of this forest is quite thick, and everything has this slight sepia amber hue. But here you are in the middle of this unknown space in what you hope to be the island of Slival. 
LAURA: Did you say what the temperature was like? 
MATT: It's a little warm, but not to an uncomfortable point. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Can we see other islands among us? Does this-- 
SAM: Well yeah, are we in a thick of an island? 
LIAM: Would we know we're on an island if we didn't know where we were going? Are we landlocked at the moment? 
MARISHA: Yeah, can we see ocean? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit, first one! 
SAM: Ocean perception. 
LIAM: (energy beam) Natural 20. (clamoring excitedly) 
TRAVIS: Everything's going to be fine! 
MARISHA: It's all downhill from here. 
LIAM: For a total of 31! 
MATT: Dang! 
SAM: You can see the ocean. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's wet! 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: You cannot see the ocean. 
SAM: Ah, damn it. 
MATT: The fog is too thick. Even with a natural 20, you're unable to see too far beyond what is obscured by the general weather that surrounds you with this place. What you do pick up with the natural 20 as you glance around is this topography is slow rolling hills, it seems, and where the jungle gets dense in some places, you glance up into the distant trees and you can see all manner of shadowed little creatures that exist in the boughs of the trees above that are staring down and skittering and watching. Probably a good half dozen-- I'd say two dozen or so that are (skittering) darting around. 
LIAM: Like little marmoset type creatures? 
MATT: They look to be about maybe a foot and a half from end to end. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: (excitedly) Oh. 
TRAVIS: I see Orym doing his eyeball thing, and I use my nose. (exaggerated sniffs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: How does it smell? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! Get both nostrils going! 
TRAVIS: (uncertain hum) 
TALIESIN: You said all of that out loud. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You pick up-- 
ASHLEY: What you sniffs? 
MATT: You pick up the natural earthen musk of naturally rotting vegetation-- 
TRAVIS: Vegetation. 
MATT: -- with hints of lavender-- 
TRAVIS: Lavender, ooh! 
MATT: -- and a bit of sea spray. 
TRAVIS: Oh, sea spray. There's an ocean nearby. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Intoxicating. We are indeed lucky to be here. 
MATT: It's about this time with your perception-- 
SAM: Are you okay? 
TALIESIN: Is your whisper louder here? 
TRAVIS: It did get louder, yeah. 
LIAM: Yes, I hear you. 
MATT: With him making that note and you being so perceptive, you begin to pick up the faintest sound of waves crashing. You can pinpoint the direction in which they are the loudest. 
LIAM: Okay. I don't see it, but I think I hear surf off that way. Do you want to get a look? See where we are? 
MARISHA: That could be good. 
LAURA: I could fly up. 
SAM: I forget, is Keyleth with us? 
MATT and LAURA: No. 
SAM: Or did she just send us through? 
TRAVIS: She went to Whitestone. 
LAURA: She just sent us through. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: I could fly up and look around. Maybe the fog is not as heavy up high. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: But don't give away your position. Be careful. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Just stay low. 
SAM: Let's go look at the ocean, see where we are. 
TRAVIS: The lavender's dangerous around here. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: What? (laughter) 
LIAM: Anyway, I think it's that way. 
SAM: Yeah, let's go look. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: Let's go look. 
TALIESIN: What are you doing with the lavender, man? 
TRAVIS: I'm just chewing on some piece of moss. 
MARISHA: Why are you being so weird? 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: This is very rare terrain. 
ASHLEY: Is it not the same moss? 
MARISHA: This is fine. 
TRAVIS: Not a lot of people have been here. 
MARISHA: I don't think I realized you were such a big-- 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: -- ocean lover. 
TRAVIS: (slurps) 
SAM: Ugh. What has happened to him? 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
MARISHA: You're like an island boy? You operate on island time. 
TRAVIS: Well, you got to get to know the place you're in. You got to get it in your body, in your blood. 
MARISHA: Right. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Feel it. 
TALIESIN: Has no one noticed this is how he always is? Are we suddenly surprised? 
LAURA: No, I feel like this is extra Chet. 
LIAM: He's kind of twitchy. 
TRAVIS: I go over and I get some dirt, rub it in my hands. (deep inhale) 
SAM: You know what? I think it might be that he's been to every continent, maybe except this one. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: So-- 
LIAM: Smells are exciting? 
SAM: This is new for him, and he hasn't had a new experience in probably a hundred years or so. 
TRAVIS: Well, I've had a couple new experiences, but you know, new location. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Do you have a map with pins in it? 
TALIESIN: Letting that go. 
TRAVIS: No. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) That would be good. Should have done that. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll whittle one. 
MATT: There you go. 
SAM: Whittle a map. 
TRAVIS: I need wood. (skittering footsteps) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: All right. 
LAURA: Bye! (laughs) 
MATT: All right. Following the path to the sound, the rest of you following suit, you can hear the distant crashing. (ocean waves gently crashing) The moving of waves. As it gets louder and louder, you eventually can pick up the smell that you had picked up earlier, that salty hint of brine that comes on gusts of wind. The wind isn't continuous here, but there are bursts that come through. Especially as you get further away from the thickness of the forest where you arrived in. Eventually, you can feel the ocean breeze become a bit of a occasionally blowing wind. The trees begin to thin out a little bit. No more than maybe 20 or so minutes walk from where you first arrived, you can see where the tree line ends and the faint bit of fog begins to show the bluish color, although it may be slightly more of a grayish color of water beyond a cliff edge. 
LAURA: Oh, a cliff. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
SAM: What kind of cliff? 
LAURA: How high? 
MATT: You're not quite there yet, but as you approach and get closer to the edge, it takes you a moment to get the depth perception to focus. The fog is quite ever present here. It seems to, in some places, choke your vision out to maybe about 150 to 200 feet at most, other times even tighter than that. Once you get where the edge of the cliff is, you can see it drops about 150 or so feet at a pretty steep decline before it breaks into rocks. You can see there's a dark black pebbled beach, maybe only about five or 10 feet at the bottom before it goes right into the ocean lagoon that surrounds here. You can see that there are other outcroppings of heavy stone that are partially eroded over the ages that stick out like small spires or teeth from the ground or from the water itself in parts of this inlet. It goes off into endless water before the fog takes it entirely. 
LIAM: You said we've got maybe 100 to 200 feet of distance of sight around us. Does that mean that the cliff is somewhere between 100 and 200 feet down if we're able to see it? 
LAURA: He said about 150 feet. 
LIAM: 150? 
MATT: Yeah. So you can see down to the beach-- 
LIAM: So that's within that fog. 
MATT: -- and a little bit into the water, and then the fog consumes the rest of it. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: You said we could see other rocky-- 
TRAVIS: Black pebble beach? 
MARISHA: Yeah, jutting out, but we don't see any other islets or islands? 
MATT: Correct. You can't see very far beyond the edge of the ocean. 
LIAM: Just the edge of this one. 
LAURA: You know, I heard cluster of islands. I was picturing something more like Dalen's Closet. 
MARISHA: Oh, yes. 
LAURA: Yeah. It's supposed to be an amazing vacation spot. 
TRAVIS: It's overrated. 
TALIESIN: I've never been there. 
SAM: You've been there? 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Is that-- 
TRAVIS: I've been there. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: It's a closet? I don't understand. 
LAURA: It's like a vacation, resorty sort of place, you know? You stay on the beach, they have huts. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MARISHA: Fruity cocktails. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Lots of weddings, I hear. People go and have a-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, I understand. 
LAURA: Destination spot sort of thing. 
MARISHA: Yes, exactly. 
LIAM: Not easy to get to though, I hear. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: Well, if we can't go out into the ocean, should we look for a trail or a path or something or? 
TALIESIN: Did we take a long rest, out of curiosity, last game? 
LAURA: We took a short rest. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: We've not taken a long. 
TALIESIN: So you're still a little-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: A little wonky. 
SAM: Do we have any spells? 
LAURA: The person we're looking for is, what's their name? 
MARISHA: Slival. 
MATT: Slival's the island. 
SAM: That's the island. Jirana? 
MARISHA: Oh, we're on Slival. 
LAURA: Slival. 
MATT: Jirana. 
TALIESIN: We're on Slival. 
SAM: Jelovana? 
ASHLEY: Dawn Marshall? 
MATT and TRAVIS: Jirana. 
SAM and TALIESIN: Jirana. 
ASHLEY: That's something entirely different. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: How do you spell Jirana? 
ASHLEY: How did none of us-- 
MATT: J-I-R-A-N-A. 
LIAM: Was it Jirana the Shore Shrew? 
MATT: The Shore Shrew. 
LIAM: Shore Shrew. 
LAURA: Shore Shrew, that's right! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Jirana the Shore Shrew! 
SAM: Let me see if I have any sort of finding type spells. No. 
LIAM: Other than the critters that are moving through the trees, there's no signs of life or that people have been around? 
MATT: You haven't seen any sort of structures or civilization. You've seen there are nests. There are plenty of insects around you. There is natural life on this island, but so far-- You've only seen but a small portion of it. From what you've seen so far, this portion is not very, not very civilized or built upon. Don't see signs of civilization. 
TRAVIS: Untouched. 
LIAM: Gosh, and we can't see far in any direction. 
LAURA: No. 
LIAM: Normally, I'd say have you or Pâté go aerial, but that's not going to really help. 
LAURA: Fly up. I mean, I can try to reach out mentally to Jirana. Jirana. 
MARISHA: Jirana. 
LAURA: Yeah. I don't know if it'll work. It depends on how close she is. I was able to do it to FCG because they were not too far away. 
MARISHA: Close enough. 
LAURA: Yeah. I can give it a try. 
MARISHA: You can certainly try. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We could at least see if there's anything around us that we're not aware of. 
LAURA: Yeah. So I'm going to try to send a message to Jirana. 
MATT: Sending or Message? 
LAURA: Sending. 
MATT: Okay. What do you say? 
LAURA: Jirana, my name is Imogen Temult. I was sent by Keyleth, the Voice of the Tempest, to meet with you. Are you here on the island of-- 
SAM: (whispers) Slival. 
LAURA: -- Slival? 
MATT: Okay. Roll a d100 for me, please. 
SAM: Ooh boy, wild magic. 
LAURA: Wah! 57. 
MATT: 57. That heavy static seems to come through again, and it seems the ever colorful pattern of the ever present magical tangled weave is still consuming the sky beyond the clouds above. 
LAURA: All right. Did I take any psychic damage from that? 
MATT: For this one? Yeah, you would take three points of psychic damage. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm resistant to it. 
MATT: So one point of psychic damage. 
TRAVIS: Sweet. 
SAM: So we either sort of blindly walk into the island or I could try to contact the Changebringer for guidance? That's a very low percentage. 
LAURA: The last time you tried that, they didn't help us much. 
TRAVIS: A little aerial view might be good. 
SAM: Well, I mean, she just works in mysterious ways, that's all. Eventually, we found exactly where we needed. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: So I would say that she did help. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: I thought you didn't want to give away our position. That's literally what you said like five minutes ago. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm feeling it now. 
LAURA: Are we looking for a big giant tree? 
TALIESIN: I mean, maybe. Technically, probably. 
MARISHA: Keyleth mentioned-- Right? Yeah, they're like-- 
TALIESIN: Evontra'vir tree. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's supposed to be a big old tree. 
MARISHA: Right. 
SAM: Evontra'vir. 
LAURA: Yeah. So maybe I fly up, see if I can spot a tree coming out of-- 
SAM: Hope it's within 200 feet of us. 
MARISHA: The Great Tree of Atrophy. 
LAURA: Well, maybe if it's big enough, I'll be able to see it. 
SAM: Maybe. Maybe. 
LAURA: All right. So let me see. Do I have a spell? 
MARISHA: But it says, but the Evontra'vir, the Tree of Atrophy was on the isle of Kalutha. 
SAM: Oh wait, what? Is that true? 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Slival, Jirana is Slival. Did she send us to Slival? Is this Slival? Or did she send us to the-- 
TRAVIS: Slival is where she sent us, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Because she's uncertain where the island of Kalutha is. She's never been there. 
TRAVIS: Doesn't mean we can't find it. 
MATT: But Jirana would be the person to talk to. 
TRAVIS: That also doesn't mean we can't see it from here. 
MATT: That's true. 
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe if we get high enough, we can see above the fog. I can fly me and another person up. Who's got really good vision? 
SAM: Someone with good eyes. 
LAURA: That's you, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Mine are actually pretty good, too. 
LAURA: Actually, I could, yeah. I'll fly me and him up. 
MATT: Okay. So you grab Orym and take off up into the sky. 
TRAVIS: We should just keep moving. 
MARISHA: I'll send Pâté with them as well so I can have eyes if something goes wrong. 
MATT: All right. "Don't worry, I'm coming as well! (groans)" All that (flutters) behind you. 
TALIESIN: Ugh. 
LIAM: Me? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 
MARISHA: His skin is just flapping. Flapping in the wind. 
MATT: The bones are like (chatters). 
LIAM: He's the size of my whole back. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: He's a cute little backpack! 
LIAM: Have I ever flown? 
LAURA: How about you're on my back, and then he's on your back. 
MARISHA: That's so cute! 
LIAM: Great, yep. 
MATT: It's a technicolor snowman. 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Let's go! 
LIAM: Have I ever flown before? I don't think so. 
MATT: You've certainly fallen pretty far. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: How do you feel about this? Is it okay? 
MARISHA: You can jump real high. 
LIAM: It's pretty cool. Yes. But I can only see a hundred feet, right? 
LAURA: Well, until we get above the fog potentially. 
LIAM: We'll see, we'll see. 
MATT: You climb-- 
LIAM: Woo! 
MATT: 50, 100, 200 feet. 400 feet. 
MARISHA: Jeez. 
MATT: 600 feet. The temperature's dropping a little bit. The fog you're worried is about to go on forever until eventually it begins to thin and break. So you both (whooshes) break up into a clear blue sky surrounding you on the horizon. As you glance down, it is a near endless fog bank that consumes the entire ocean beneath you except for the occasional rare breaks where you can see that deep dark blue that peeks through ever so faintly This entire region as the, even up here with the blue sky is turning to the darker shades as the sun is setting on this side of Exandria. You don't have that much daylight left, and what you do have, everything just feels like a dreamscape beneath you. You're above the clouds, but everything beneath you looks like a cloud. 
LIAM: So all of the Shattered Teeth are obscured, 
MATT: From where you currently are flying, the majority of it is, yeah. 
LAURA: In your head, you hear: You see anything? 
LIAM: Do I? Can I see any shadow in any direction? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
SAM: Switch to infrared. 
LAURA: Are we dreaming? 
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and LAURA: Can you read my mind? 
LIAM: Well, I'm going to reroll my one, but that's okay because the other was a natural 20. 
SAM: Ooh! 
LIAM: So a 31. 
MATT: 31. 
TALIESIN: On your toes today. 
MATT: From up here, as the light of the day begins to fade, you glance through for anything unique or different. You can see it in the breaks as you sit there and breathe quietly. From this distance, you can't see the patterns of waves moving. But the coloration, you can definitely see the pockets of where ocean is visible. You do see, god, it could be miles away, you're uncertain, nut a shadow weave through one of the top parts of the fog bank. 
LAURA: What was it? 
LIAM: Something there. Land, maybe. Can you help me remember? 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: You point out for it, and you see something, this shadow rise again, but it goes a little higher. At this point, it's like a-- 
MARISHA: Nope. 
ASHLEY: Oh. No, no, no, no. 
LAURA: That is a creature, Orym. That is a very large creature. 
LIAM: It's so far away. 
LAURA: Looked like an island, but it was definitely not staying still. 
TRAVIS: You know the thing about creatures that are like that? 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: It could be. 
LAURA: Uk'otoa. 
LIAM: Uk'otoa. 
SAM: Cloudk'otoa? 
MARISHA and LAURA: Cloudk'otoa. 
LAURA: Was it in the water or in the clouds? 
MATT: In the clouds. 
MARISHA: The Fog Ness Monster. 
SAM: The Fog Ness Monster. 
LAURA: We're going down. That's a very large creature, and we are leaving the sky, yes? 
TALIESIN: Fog Ness Monster. 
ASHLEY: This is a Loch Ness Monster situation? 
LAURA: So we'll just, as quietly as possible, drift down. 
TRAVIS: Go make friends. What if it's Falkor? 
LAURA: It is not Falkor. 
SAM: What is that? A ring or earrings? 
MATT: As you head back down, you're about to emerge once more into the cloud and fog bank that consumes this portion of the Shattered Teeth in the ocean island below. You get one final glimpse of the shadow in the distance. Once again, you have no basis of comparison to get a true point of depth perception on it distance-wise. But with the 31, you estimate that thing's probably 100 feet long or more. 
SAM: What if it's a good guy? 
LAURA: A dragon? Was it a dragon? 
MATT: You can't make out more than just the shape. You watch as it goes through, and there's enough movement where the length of it continues to arc. 
TRAVIS: What are talking about? 
LAURA: What if it's a nice Falkor? It's never a nice Falkor. 
LIAM: Are we lowering all the way down? Is that what we're doing? 
LAURA: That was the goal. 
TALIESIN: There'll be no problem with us-- 
ASHLEY: Big old fluffums! 
TALIESIN: -- sleeping for a night. 
LAURA: Are you okay, do you want to stop? 
LIAM: No, we're good, I'm just-- 
LAURA: Do you want to face off with this giant thing? 
LIAM: (nervous laugh) No. I'm going to try to stay faced in that direction as we lower so I can get a semblance of a bearing for the direction we saw it once we hit the ground. 
MATT: Okay. (whooshes) You eventually lower yourself down, touching once more on the island surface. 
LIAM: Big. 
LAURA: That was real big, right? 
LIAM: Big. We saw a thing. 
MARISHA: Oh, you're back. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you're back? 
LAURA: We just landed. 
TALIESIN: Did you see island? Did you see? 
LAURA: We saw shit. There was shit all to see. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
LAURA: It's all fog. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LIAM: It was fog forever. We felt like we were rising forever. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
LIAM: We did break the surface, but you can't see land, you can't see anything. 
ASHLEY: It's hidden. 
LIAM: The entire place is hidden, but we saw really big fucking thing in the cl-- 
MARISHA: Big how? Big round? 
TALIESIN: Big what? 
MARISHA: Big tall? 
TALIESIN: Tree big? 
LAURA: Big flying through the clouds. Potentially-- 
ASHLEY: Like a bird? 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: How big did you say, Orym? 
LIAM: 100ish feet and not a head. 
LAURA: We didn't see a head. 
MARISHA: Serpenty? 
LIAM: Maybe. 
MARISHA: Snakey? 
LAURA: But it was doing this. 
SAM: So maybe we don't go that way or we do go that way? 
LAURA: There's no way to, I don't think. 
TALIESIN: I think we're-- 
LAURA: It's in the sky. 
LIAM: When I point, am I pointing away from land here on some angle? 
MATT: Where you're pointing right now would be a little bit inland from where you're standing. If you want to make a nature check to see if you can ascertain some semblance of direction. You did see the direction where the sun was setting. This would be to pinpoint your knowledge. 
LIAM: I'm not as good at deese (these). Yeah, it's a three. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: Well, I think it was like-- 
LAURA: Wait, wait, it was a survival check? Was that a survival check? 
MATT: Survival check. 
LAURA: Could I do a survival check to figure out the direction? 
MATT: Survival or nature, both would work. 
LIAM: Then it's a five. 
MATT: Five, okay. Still a little tough, but. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Would I have had an idea of which direction it was? 
MATT: You can certainly give it a shot, since you both had a view. 
TRAVIS: Oh, you mean like they're trying to remember which way they saw it as they came down in the clouds? 
MATT: But also which direction the sun was setting and pick out where they are. 
LAURA: 23. 
MATT: There we go. Where you were facing out to the ocean was in an eastward direction where you saw this shadow space would be more of a northern direction. So you know you're on the eastern, some sort of eastern side of the island that you're currently on. 
LAURA: Great. Well. 
TRAVIS: We definitely go north. 
TALIESIN: At some point, we're going to have to camp, though, and being on the eastern side is probably good. We'll get the first sun so that we won't have to be dark forever. 
LAURA: So we're in a good place. Do you think we should get into tree cover to find camp here, or--? 
TALIESIN: Or we put our back against the cliff. I mean, that does-- What's more dangerous, anybody being able to get at us or something from the ocean? 
TRAVIS: 150 feet up from the water. 
MARISHA: What about a wind situation? Feels like we should be blocked from the elements, right? 
LIAM: Those animals in the trees, were they just curious, or did they look unnerving? 
MATT: Best you could tell without understanding them, from what you could see, the shadows moving around, they had these large, saucer-like eyes, grayish coloration around very, very big pupils. You couldn't see a mouth, but they skittered adjacently. There doesn't seem to be an aggression. Maybe curiosity. Maybe studying. Maybe, eventually, once they know enough, attacking. You have no concept. You'd have to take a look at them again. 
LIAM: I, at least, didn't get a predator vibe. 
MATT: Especially with the nature check of what you rolled before carrying over into that. 
LIAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
MATT: You're uncertain if you got a predator vibe. But you definitely saw a lot of them, and they definitely are aware of you. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: We got to pick a direction, y'all. Can't just sit here with our metal dicks in our hands. 
LAURA: Maybe we just-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Maybe we travel around the border of the island a bit to see if we see any kind of civilization. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Stay on the beach. Hope for a cave. 
SAM: On the cliff? 
LAURA: Cut along the cliff edge, yeah. 
SAM: All right. 
MARISHA: So are we going to move south or north? 
LAURA and TALIESIN: North. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Do we know direction? There's no sun, is there sun? 
LAURA: We just figured it out. 
SAM: Okay, okay. Well, let's go. 
TRAVIS: Ocean to the east, dragon was to the north, and we're on the eastern. 
SAM: Dragon? 
LAURA: Yeah, so we travel north along the cliff. 
TRAVIS: The serpentine, Falkor love snake. 
ASHLEY: The skittering was something else. 
MATT: The skittering was something else, yeah. 
LAURA: All right. So we're traveling along the edge. 
MATT: Okay. What's the marching order? 
LAURA: Marching order. 
LIAM: I'll go first. 
MARISHA: So we're going to be going counterclockwise. 
TALIESIN: Also, at some point, we're going need to take a nap because I know a few of us are tapped. 
ASHLEY: I can go after it Orym. 
LAURA: But it's getting late. It looked like the sun was setting from where we were. 
MATT: Who else is coming up behind them? 
TRAVIS: I'll be up there as well with the nose. 
MATT: Okay. How about the rest of you? 
TALIESIN: Squishies in the back. I'll take rear. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll go in the back. 
LAURA: I'll be behind Chet. 
SAM: I'm dead middle. 
LAURA: Or Ashton, behind Ashton. Wherever. 
MATT and TALIESIN: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, as you're not squishy nor-- 
LAURA: I'm pretty squishy, but. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, middle. The power. 
TRAVIS: You know what? I'll go, I'll be the caboose. I'll be the caboose. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'll switch. 
TRAVIS: Orym's fucking protected. 
MATT: There you go. 
TRAVIS: So we don't get snuck up on. 
MATT: Understood. So, in leading the front, who is guiding you northward across the island looking for something useful? 
LAURA: Pretty good at-- 
LIAM: I got good eyesight, but I'm not really-- 
LAURA: Okay, then I'll help guide. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: No! 
MATT: Roll survival. 
LIAM: I'll help you this time. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
MATT: What are you looking for in particular? 
LAURA: Any signs of, like, humanity. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: People that live here. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Yes? 
TALIESIN: I mean, things around. 
TRAVIS: (whispers) Traps. 
LAURA: You're going to look for traps. I'm looking for people that live here, right? Who's got an eye out for traps? 
LIAM: That would make sense. I would look for traps. 
TRAVIS: Just in case we landed in, like, hunting grounds. 
LAURA: 22, no. 
MATT: Perception or investigation check. 
LAURA: Yeah, 22. 
MATT: 22, okay. You, one, help forward a path that is-- 
LIAM: Reroll the one. 
MATT: -- seemingly the safest. A lot of the rock here, when it's exposed in places, is volcanic. The deep black rock here is jagged in places, and even the toughest of boots would take a heavy gash if you're not careful. So you tend to lead a way where it's the softer sediment that's filled in the smaller valleys between these hills and areas where the overgrowth makes a more spongy and welcoming stride upon your shoes and little feetsies. (laughter) 
MATT: I just wanted to say that real bad. (laughter) 
MATT: I don't get to narrate little feetsies too often. 
LIAM: He's talking about my feet. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (quick footsteps) 
MATT: But the light of day begins to fade to its entirety, leaving you into a darker, but still amorphous space around you as the fog gets thicker and thicker as the temperature begins to drop. But you also begin to see these tiny little firebug-like lights that start to-- 
ASHLEY: Aw! 
MATT: Light up through the bits of the local forest. 
ASHLEY: How darling! 
TALIESIN: You remember what happened last time we decided that something was glowy and cute? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It's true. 
LAURA: If it's a fairy or a pixie, we'll definitely not approach it, but it is lovely. 
TALIESIN: It is lovely. Let's-- 
LIAM: Just with caution, that's all. 
ASHLEY: It sets a really nice vibe, but we don't need to go near it. 
MARISHA: Can I-- Can I release an Infestation-- 
TRAVIS: What? 
SAM: Jesus. 
MARISHA: That's also looks like-- 
TRAVIS: So aggressive. 
MARISHA: -- the little fireflies to just, not attack, but to float near them and see-- 
TRAVIS: Can you just call an incursion? Is there a minor version of Infestation? 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: Bugs. (laughter) 
MATT: As you (buzzing) release this tiny glowing swarm. 
LAURA: Oh, pretty, Laudna! 
MARISHA: (pleased stammering) Take inspiration from my surroundings, you know? 
TALIESIN: A head comes out of your mouth. 
MATT: The coloration of these little lights fit in a teal, light blue coloration. 
LIAM: The ones from the island. 
MATT: The ones from the island. The ones that you create, what color did they give? 
LIAM: Bioluminescent wasps? 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Like a nice green. Like the ones on the east coast. 
ASHLEY: She wants to feel the color. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Like a nice-- 
MARISHA: Synesthesia. 
MATT: Yeah. As they (buzzes) begin to head towards the nearest tree line where a cluster of these lights are, the lights scatter. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MARISHA: And seem to flee from this sudden appearance. 
SAM: Well, that's rude. 
MARISHA: They don't like to make friends. 
SAM: That's very weird. 
TALIESIN: You're probably very visible. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Very, very visible. 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
TALIESIN: I am tapped. 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Do you have it? 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I think that'd be a really good idea. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it, just for you guys. 
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check for me if you're moving carefully through this area. 
LIAM: A 24 for trap checking. 
MATT: Got it. Good to know. 
LIAM: Stealth. 
TRAVIS: 37. 
LIAM: Nice! 
MARISHA: 33. 
MATT: 33. 
SAM: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
LAURA: It's not you. I promise. 
MATT: Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Yes. I can tell you-- 
SAM: Yes, I'm Fearne. 
ASHLEY: I was making sure I didn't stink. I think the horse costume had a funny scent. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: There's something wafting. (laughter) 
SAM: Blame it on the costume. 
ASHLEY: I just needed Laura to smell my armpits. 
LAURA: I checked; it's not her armpits. 
MATT: I respect that. Yeah, yeah. No, it's important. 
ASHLEY: What are we doing? 
MATT: Stealth. 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry! 
MATT: It's okay. 
LIAM: You just gave yourself Pass Without a Trace. 
LAURA: What did you roll for stealth? 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MATT: 18. 
LAURA and LIAM: That's with plus 10? 
ASHLEY: No, 28. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I am present, I am here. 
LAURA: Also 28. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: That thing that she did. (laughter) 
MATT: Orym? All righty. 
LIAM: 28 as well. 
MARISHA: I think we should stealth. 
TALIESIN: 22. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
MARISHA: What are we doing? (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (whooshes) 
LIAM: (like Fearne) I smell toast. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Something's burning. (laughter) 
MATT: As you-- 
MARISHA: Fearne, your tail. 
MATT: -- pull out this section heading into a small ravine, carefully being unseen as you move, keeping tabs on each other and occasionally seeing the lights that were gathering around. At first, they were beginning to cluster and follow a bit, but as you all began to use the space to not be seen and to cover your tracks and make as little sound as possible, they began to distance themselves a bit and spread out. 
MARISHA: These are the fireflies? 
MATT: The lights, yeah. 
TALIESIN: That is a very good thing. 
TRAVIS: The lights. 
MARISHA: The lights. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Very direct on that. 
MATT: Continuing on a bit further, you're now going northward, which is going a little more inland to this part of the island. The lights, as they move nearby, have that fog light aesthetic where what low glow there would be is now being diffused and is spreading it out into the space. Giving the light a larger appearance, which in itself is a little spooky. You probably pick up with your passive perception what it is. Can hear the faintest sound of tiny beating wings as one of them comes nearby. They go (beating wings) 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Yeah, it's fine. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
LIAM: Did it strafe by me or I just happened to hear one? 
MATT: It just cruised by. You're not sure if it noticed or picked up anything, but you just picked up the sound. Roll a perception check for me. 
LAURA: I should let you know that I regained my spells before our short rest, and then used my vial to regain my sorcery points. I didn't regain all my spells, but I regained a couple, so if it seems like-- 
MATT: Got it. 
LIAM: 24. 
MATT: 24. This looks like a tiny am-- Like an amphibious humanoid that's about an inch tall. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: What?! 
MATT: That has a set of wings. 
LAURA: It is fairies! 
MATT: It's like (wings fluttering), but it had this, where it had two arms and two legs and a bipedal glances, it also had a smooth, textured, toad-like skin to it. 
ASHLEY: Reptilian? 
LIAM: Was it just on its way or did it look at me? 
MATT: It didn't seem to notice you as it went by. 
SAM: Did it have little clothes? 
MARISHA: Did it look like Chrysta? 
MATT: (laughs) No, it had no clothing. It did have that glowing teal color. Its body had this teal and fuchsia combination like a swirl across its body. 
LIAM: Not bugs. The lights, they're not bugs. 
LAURA: What are they? 
LIAM: They're little, I want to say frog fairies, but that doesn't seem accurate. 
LAURA: Frog fairies? 
LIAM: But little guy. I saw arms and legs. 
MATT: You do hear, you're not quite certain where off, but this low, (low-pitched growl) this rumble growl that suddenly (whooshes) a heavy impact or some sort of a, whether it's an exhale or a small collapsing of a few stones that are echoing in the distance, you're not quite certain what it was, but there's this odd, sudden (whooshes) sound and the lights scatter off. 
MARISHA: Which direction did it come from? 
MATT: It would be-- 
TRAVIS: We're moving north to the west? Like, inland? 
MATT: It'd be northeast-ish from where you currently are. 
TRAVIS: Further up the coast? 
MARISHA: Did it seem far away? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
SAM: Fearne, you're good at, well, you have experience going through strange wooded places. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Should we move fast? Should we move slow? Should we bury ourselves? 
MARISHA: 18. 
ASHLEY: I feel like we should probably just move slow. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Just take it easy. I mean, if you want to roll in the dirt and get a little, you know? 
SAM: For camouflage? 
ASHLEY: Camouflage situation. 
TRAVIS: Au naturel. 
ASHLEY: Au naturel. 
MATT: The way the echo of the sound hit your ears, it felt like it was a ways away and sounded echoed a bit and diffused by the time it got to you, which made it hard to really pinpoint what it was or how far it is, but it moves a little bit away. 
ASHLEY: Whatever it is, it's probably more scared of us. 
SAM: Oh, than we are of it? 
ASHLEY: We're fine, we're fine. 
TALIESIN: Well, then I would argue that, I would argue that I'm-- 
ASHLEY: Do you want to fight me? 
TALIESIN: I'm very frightened. I'm more frightened of it than I am of you, so I'm just, I'm extrapolating. 
ASHLEY: I don't know if that's-- 
TALIESIN: I'm very frightened of you, don't get me wrong, but. That's, yeah. We do not know where the fuck we are. 
LIAM: If we're skirting the edge, are we still on a cliff, too? 
MATT: You're heading northward. The cliff is spread off a little bit, and you're going more inland now as you head north. The cliff that was on the east side is heading in a northeastern direction as it curves, and you guys continue going north inland. 
LIAM: We're heading towards where we think. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: All right, yeah. Just got to keep going, right? 
TALIESIN: At some point, we got to figure out some of the-- 
LAURA: I know, yeah. If I see along the way a place that looks like good campable, would you like us-- Should we stop? 
SAM: Well, yeah, and I'm looking for, I'm looking down. I'm going to look for trails. Not necessarily humanoid trails, but could be a trail made by a deer or something. 
MATT: Make a perception or survival check. 
TRAVIS: Maybe specifically that head towards the shore. Like the east, heading down the cliff? Because her name's The Shore Shrew, right? 
MARISHA: Right. She's going to be on a beach, right? 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Near the water? 
SAM: I don't care to tell you what rolled. 
MATT: Okay, fair enough. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I will not reveal it. 
TALIESIN: I mean, that's-- Yeah, maybe. 
MARISHA: I'll also, I'm going to do this anyway, I'm going to have Pâté go invisible. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Have him fly out ahead and be a little invisible scout for us. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: In the direction that we're going. 
MATT: "All right, which way you want me to go?" 
MARISHA: Okay, we're going-- 
MATT: "(grunting attentively)" 
MARISHA: Shut-- I'm talking, shh. We're going to be heading this way, kind of northwest, so I want you to just fly ahead, stay 50, 100 feet in front of us. 
LAURA: Quietly. 
MARISHA: Be my eyes, quietly. Don't touch the glowing teal buggies. Be quiet. 
LAURA: That means no singing, Pâté. Don't hum to yourself as you go. 
MARISHA: And don't hit on the fairies. 
TRAVIS: He's being pretty quiet. 
MARISHA: He is being very quiet. 
SAM: There's a lot of rules. 
MARISHA: He's being good. All right, ready? Go! (chuckling) 
MATT: Vanishes mid-flight. 
TRAVIS: (rapid pattering) 
MATT: So he's off, guarding the space as you continue. 
MARISHA: Who's near me? FCG? 
SAM: Hi! 
MARISHA: I'll hold onto FCG's little ponytail-- 
SAM: Ponytail, man-bun. 
MARISHA: -- and look through Pâté's eyes as we go. 
MATT: Okay. Pâté, trying to push through the fog elements of the evening mists, passing by some of the glowing orbs as they go, but nothing really catching his eye in the interim. You continue on as it gets darker and darker, until any semblance of daylight that is diffused by the surrounding weather has vanished. Now you are in pretty much pitch black, aside from the handful of gentle glowing points that occasionally drift through the nearby tree line or descend into this winding valley portion of the center island that you're following. 
SAM: We don't have any way of making camp, right? 
LAURA: That's what I was saying. If I find a place to camp, then did you want me to-- 
SAM: Yeah, I guess. 
LAURA: We should bunk down for the night. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we got to bunk down. 
LAURA: Maybe I can send out Dancing Lights in front. 
TRAVIS: (uncertain murmurs) 
MATT: You can do that. 
LAURA: But I'm going to try to make them look small, the same as those little fairy lights that we were seeing. 
MATT: Okay. Flickering Dancing Lights coasting out ahead of you a little bit, just to illuminate some of the path as you go. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That's very beautiful. 
TALIESIN: I feel like maybe, if we're not careful, I feel like that's a big sign that there are things moving through this place, wherever the lights might group together, I don't know. 
TRAVIS: One of you all up front's got darkvision, right? 
MARISHA: I have darkvision. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't remember. 
TRAVIS: Okay, good. 
MATT: Yeah, who of you has darkvision? 
LAURA: Well, then y'all should be in the front. 
MARISHA: Oh boy. 
MATT: Two of you are leading. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: The rest of you can't see anything, except for that faint little-- If you're putting the orbs up you can see what's directly around you. 
LAURA: I mean, if you want. Do you want me to take the orbs away? We can't see shit. 
TALIESIN: Give them a little bit of distance from us, I guess. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm spreading them out. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: That's good. 
TALIESIN: It's making me nervous. 
TRAVIS: We'll step up and take charge. 
MARISHA: We've got this. 
TRAVIS: Rise to the occasion. We will keep an eye-- 
MARISHA: Team Dogfight. 
TRAVIS: -- for a clearing and maybe also some low limbs in case we want to go for that jungle vibe. 
MARISHA: Yes. Also, those big spiderwebs. You know how-- 
LAURA: Can you talk quieter, Laudna? 
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. (whispering) Those big spiderwebs. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: You know, I feel like spiderwebs, they know. They know, and they build at face level. 
TRAVIS: So it catches you right across as you walk through it. Yeah. 
MARISHA: So I'm looking for spiders. 
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'll assist you. 
MARISHA: Oh! Oh! Aw, it was almost a natural 20 for spiders, but it's not. It's a 21. 
MATT: 21. No sign of any large webbing, necessarily. Though occasionally there are small spiders and insects that take up residence in the nearby trees and branches. You do come across, as you're pulling out of this small valley dip coming up closer to the more central part of the island, you step into a small divot and then step out and glance behind and notice the divot is more of an impression. The ground itself, the soft mud portion of this, is pretty smooth and compact where you had just put through, and it looks to be-- 
MARISHA: Does it look like a track? 
MATT: It looks like a very large foot, possibly. 
MARISHA and LIAM: (disgusted groans) 
MARISHA: Chet. Chet. 
TRAVIS: Yes? 
MARISHA: I think I just stepped in a really big print. 
LAURA: Oh my god, is it? How big is the track? How big is the track? 
LIAM: Are we in the Land of the Lost? 
MARISHA: What does it look like? 
TRAVIS: How many-- 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: The track, from what you can tell, is about seven or so feet from end to end. 
SAM: And it's a foot. 
MATT: The foot, from what you can see, as you get a glance at it, step back, it's not a humanoid foot. It's thinner and stretched, and it has almost webbed end to it. 
SAM: Like a bird? 
MARISHA: It's a fucking dragon. 
TRAVIS: Well, it's Skull Island. 
SAM: Like a bird? 
MARISHA: We're on Skull Island. 
MATT: Make a nature check for me. 
SAM: Birds are my-- I know birds. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: So do I get advantage? Bird-vantage? 
MATT: What's your first roll? 
SAM: Three. 
MATT: Three? You have no idea what this is. 
TRAVIS: Can I use my Hunter's Bane and a combination of Grim Psychometry-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: -- to try and recall information? 
LIAM: But those aren't words. 
TRAVIS: Sinister or tragic history of an object or an area or location that I'm in. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
MATT: If you want to try and touch into the history of this space. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, put my fingers in and (exaggerated sniff) take a big whiff. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll admit that is weird. 
MATT: Focusing in, as you concentrate and let the Hemocraft power connect with the natural energies of this landscape, you close your eyes and just feel the primal fight between predator and prey, a familiar space for you, intoxicating in moments. This is a very unbridled place where nature has long reigned, and as such, the denizens of this island have survived or hunted. You are uncertain who is who, but you get the sense that many innocent creatures have met their end in this land violently, not because of malice, not because of murderous intent, but because some things have to eat and some things have to be eaten. 
LAURA: Oh fuck. 
MARISHA: Oh my god, we're going to die. 
TRAVIS: This belongs to a foot. 
LAURA: Mm. 
SAM: So-- (laughs) Nice. Should we not spend the night here, then? Should we just keep going through the night? 
TALIESIN: Maybe we move the opposite direction of the foot and find camp. 
LIAM and LAURA: Well-- 
LIAM: We saw a massive shape in the distance off this island. We all just heard, something not too far off that sounded big, and now this. What is safe? 
MARISHA: Also-- 
TRAVIS: We should just stop. 
TALIESIN: Somewhere with cover? 
MARISHA: So this is a big, seven-foot print. 
TRAVIS: That looks like it has webbing, and how many-ish toes? 
MATT: It looks like three larger ones and one small side one. As you're glancing upon it, you can see there's another one that's not quite in-- This one pushed in deep and was easy to spot because it was put in the mud. There's a second one that's parallel to it that's partially against the rock. You see only the edge of it that touched the mud before it pressed into a piece of stone hill outcropping. 
MARISHA: I was curious, the next one, how far apart is it? How wide is the gait? 
MATT: There isn't a stride. They're just parallel. 
TRAVIS: What? The one that you stepped through is deep. 
LAURA: It flies. 
MARISHA: Like it landed. Can I look up? Does it look like the trees have been taken out? 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, any broken limbs? 
MATT: You glance up, and from what you can see, a lot of the treetops in this area, look like they've received damage. Not mass swaths of it, but you can see there's clusters of the nearby tops that are snapped and broken and fresh branches have grown. 
MARISHA: So it wasn't the most recent. 
MATT: Some of them look-- There's damage all over, but there's some that look fresh and some that look older. 
TRAVIS: I mean, wisdom would say that we freeze for the night, make camp, make as little noise as possible so we can hear the things that are moving. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Then start again when the sun rises. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: If it comes from above, how are we going to not get seen? 
SAM: Do we have any shelter that we can-- 
LAURA: Is there any shelter? 
LIAM: What's our terrain right where we are? 
LAURA: Is there something we can get under? Fallen logs or something? 
SAM: We're not near the cliffs anymore, are we? 
MATT: There are fallen trees, but the trees themselves are maybe about, at their thickest, about a foot and a half wide. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: They corkscrew upward, so those that are fallen aren't themselves massive redwood spaces to hide. A lot the topography here is just rolling hills and small valleys. There aren't, outside of the cliff edge that you saw, there aren't a lot of signs of caverns or spaces to hide. 
LAURA: What if we hole it up? 
LIAM: The stone you just mentioned is just a one-off boulder. 
MATT: I mean, there are parts of stone that you see, but they're just areas where either any sort of moss has been rubbed off of it-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. 
LIAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: -- or plant life didn't take root. 
SAM: Hold what? 
MARISHA: Use the hole. 
MATT: There is quite a bit of moss here. The moisture tends to bring-- 
TALIESIN: There's a problem with the hole. 
SAM: Won't we run out of air? 
MARISHA: We can leave it open. 
MATT: -- a unique ocean-based moss that grows over in areas between where the trees and root take place. 
LAURA: We could stick it up to a rock or something. 
LIAM: That's what I wondering. 
SAM: Are there any overturned trees that have some space under them or something that we could-- 
LAURA: Put the hole underneath, so we could open up the scarf? 
LIAM: So we don't get stepped on instantly. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Possibly. 
TALIESIN: There's a problem with the hole. 
MARISHA: You were saying they're only a foot and a half? 
TRAVIS: What's the problem? 
LIAM: Hold up. What's the problem? 
TALIESIN: That's where we put all of our problems from Imahara Joe's. 
LAURA: Oh, there's a bunch of dead bodies in the hole. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yep, and we haven't dumped them yet. I've been trying to find a place where it's not going to be a problem. 
SAM: Well, we were going to talk to one, weren't we? 
ASHLEY: We could dump them off the cliff. 
MATT: The hole, just so you're aware, also has to be laid out onto a flat surface. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's the other problem. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it can't be a-- (rolling hills). 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Can I check in with Pâté? Does he see anything? 
TALIESIN: Unless we're moving-- 
MATT: Pâté is glancing around. 
TALIESIN: I'd be fine dumping them out but we'll have to move away. 
MATT: You can see some of the little blue lights are inspecting the dull purple sparkles that you have preceding your walking. You can see they're passing by and gathering curiously, trying to figure out what it is that is giving off this different colored light. 
MARISHA: That's what Pâté can see? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's bad. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
LAURA: Everything's bad. 
LIAM: It feels like nowhere is safe. 
TALIESIN: Everything's bad. This place is bad. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Well, maybe we still try-- 
LIAM: Climbing a tree doesn't matter. 
MARISHA: -- and get to the beach, then, at least. 
LAURA: Maybe we head over to the shoreline, see if we can get down the cliff's edge. 
TRAVIS: It's pitch dark. 
LAURA: That's just a bad idea. 
TRAVIS: Descending 100 feet in the dark is pretty rough. Unless we have a soft way to fall? 
MARISHA: I have Feather Fall. 
SAM: We can Feather Fall. 
TRAVIS: For everybody? 
ASHLEY: I could try to carry some of you down. 
SAM: As an animal? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: I've got a propeller. 
MATT: (deep rumbling) That rush, that heavy rumble hits again. It seems a little further away than it was last time, but it's loud enough that wherever it is, it shakes the ground slightly, and you hear that sound once more. 
TALIESIN: Where the fuck did that come from? 
TRAVIS: It doesn't sound like a (thump)? It's a building-- 
MATT: It's a building, then a rushing impact, then it fades. 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
LAURA: Bless you. 
SAM: Adorable. 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: Bless you. 
LAURA: Ooh! (laughs) (cute fake sneeze) 
ASHLEY: A rushing impact, then a what? 
MATT: Then it fades. 
LIAM: Little dead Disney princess. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (cute fake sneeze) 
SAM: I mean, no matter how you slice it, if we make camp, it's not going to be a fun night. 
TRAVIS: No, it'll be great. 
SAM: We're going to be stressed out. 
TRAVIS: We either do it up here or we try and-- 
ASHLEY: We'll take watch. 
TRAVIS: -- jump down. 
MARISHA: I can get five of us down via Feather Fall. 
LIAM: But if we're plunking down for the night, right, someone's got to stay up. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, for sure. In shifts. 
LIAM: You can do that and you can do that. But that's not going to get us through the whole night. 
TRAVIS: I can. 
LIAM: You can do it, too? 
ASHLEY: We can take turns. 
MARISHA: What are you talking about? 
LIAM: Feather Fall? 
LAURA: Oh, no. She can do-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought you were-- 
MARISHA: Feather Fall to get us down the cliff. 
LIAM: I knew that. I know. 
LAURA: She can do five of us. 
MARISHA: I can do five people with Feather Fall. 
LIAM: No, I know that. I meant-- Never mind. 
MARISHA: I'm confused on your confusion. 
SAM: Then let's go to the cliffs. 
TALIESIN: I like the cliff, because it's something behind us. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Did we lose the cliff? Did we go away from the cliff. 
SAM: We did. 
TALIESIN: We know where it is, though. 
TRAVIS: Now it's-- 
MATT: You traveled a ways inland. You can probably head east and eventually find another part of the cliff, if you'd like to. 
TALIESIN: Does it feel like that would be, assuming it doesn't get weird and turn into a fjord, how far would it feel like we have ventured beyond it, if nothing had changed, just from the angle? 
MATT: If nothing had changed the angle? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, geometry-wise. 
MATT: Probably a good 40 minutes or so to get to the edge of the cliff. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LAURA: Uh. 
TRAVIS: Let's-- We can just park it here. 
LAURA: Just plunk down and hide our stuff? 
TRAVIS: Circle up. 
TALIESIN: How's our cover? Let's find a little bit of cloud cover and let's make sure those little twinkly fuckers-- 
LAURA: I will turn them off, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: No, not yours. I'm talking about the other ones. Yours are fine. 
TRAVIS: We'll find a nearby tree, if we find one. 
SAM: Can we find a nearby tree? 
MATT: You can find one that's fallen. You can see it fell and splintered about five or so feet up, and part of it is still connected, so it gives a slight canopy that you could lay something over. 
LAURA: That's something. 
MATT: But that's about as best as you can-- 
TRAVIS: We'll get into the base of it. It'll be nice and quiet. No fire. 
TALIESIN: We'll have to-- Yeah. Keep those weird little frog people away. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I have something I could try. 
SAM: Ooh? 
TALIESIN: Yeah? 
ASHLEY: So I think I can make plants grow, but it might be-- 
SAM: Around us? 
ASHLEY: -- a really large space that might look weird. It's like, oh, this is very lush over here. This is strange. 
SAM: It's nighttime. No one can see. 
TALIESIN: And it's thick fog. 
LAURA: Yeah. That's true. Plants are plants. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Try it. 
TALIESIN: I'm into it. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: Grow them around us? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: Let's do it. 
ASHLEY: Just find a little area. 
TALIESIN: Let's get those logs. 
TRAVIS: If it gets us killed, you'll never forgive yourself. 
LAURA: All right, let's do it under that tree. 
MARISHA: Yeah, can you use-- 
ASHLEY: Chet! 
MARISHA: -- the tree and make it like-- 
LAURA: A tent? 
MARISHA: Like an A-frame situation? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I will try to make-- I'm going to cast Plant Growth. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to make us a beautiful, A-frame situation-- 
TRAVIS, MATT, and MARISHA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: -- that also looks-- 
SAM: Natural. 
LAURA: It belongs here? 
ASHLEY: -- natural, like it belongs here. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Give us a little space. 
LIAM: Shatteredcore. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I like it. 
ASHLEY: But the thing is, it does-- Wait, this is the thing that's tricky about it. 
TRAVIS: It does produce a siren. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: A noise? 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (wailing sirens) 
ASHLEY: So it's 100-foot radius. 
TRAVIS: (siren beeps) 
LAURA: It's that big? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Oh no, it doesn't have to be, though. 
ASHLEY: It doesn't have to be, so I just want to put it in this little area. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, man, 25 by 25, we'll be fine. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Growing some vines. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, just something easy, something that feels like the rest of the plants in this space. 
TRAVIS: A little Bob Ross cabin. 
ASHLEY: A little Bob Ross. 
MATT: Great. So as you all cluster around the base of this tree, you connect with the energies of this island, and then will the vitality to be instilled within everything in the immediate vicinity. The rest of you hear the creaking and the crackling of dried leaves and branches and bark cracking and splitting. As you look around, you can see some of the other fallen trees that have been long rotting and being taken back by the forest have cracked open, and vibrant, fresh green growth is bursting forth from them that seems to swirl up like vine wall cover that seems to reach up and wrap around the top of this fallen tree until you have, essentially, a relatively tight space for the seven of you, but a space that acts like a large, natural tent. 
MARISHA: This is so cozy, Fearne. 
LAURA: This is beautiful. 
ASHLEY: Can I make a little door out of the branches? Just try to make-- 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. Some flowers grow. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: They give a beautiful swishing bead curtain vibe. 
SAM: How about individual rooms inside? A bathroom? 
ASHLEY: You name it, I'll try to add it. 
LAURA: A little porta-potty. 
ASHLEY: A little porta-potty? I'll put a little hole inside. 
MATT: There you go. 
SAM: Okay, great. 
TALIESIN: We can use our hole, the portable hole. 
LAURA: Our portable hole just smells like piss. 
LIAM: Sorry, guys. 
ASHLEY: We'll figure it out. 
LIAM: You're dead. 
MARISHA: Can you take your Dancing Lights and make them like fairy lights on the roof? 
LAURA: As long as it doesn't show. I don't want it to show too much. 
LIAM: Is the rest of the game just us decorating? 
TRAVIS: We went from vibing to "House Hunters." 
MARISHA: It's a girls' weekend. We're going to glamp. 
LAURA: I fade down the Dancing Lights to where they're really subtle in here. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Philips Hue. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: They just slowly change color. 
SAM: This is so nice, Fearne! 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is great. 
ASHLEY: It's a little fort. 
TRAVIS: Can you change them to Edison? 
MATT: All right, who's keeping watch? 
LAURA: Who's keeping watch? 
LIAM: I'll start. 
ASHLEY: Well, you know. I'll work on it. 
LIAM: But is there enough light with all the glowing things in the air for those of us without darkvision to see somewhat? 
MATT: You can see occasionally clusters of two or three of these lights traveling together, and they light up the surrounding fog to the point where you can see maybe a few feet beyond them, and that's it. 
LAURA: I should turn off our interior lights to make it easier to see outside. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: How about I go first? Because I got the darkvision. 
ASHLEY: (coughing) 
LAURA: Are you okay? 
ASHLEY: Wrong pipe. (coughs) 
TRAVIS: I'll stay just outside of the entrance. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Back to it. 
MATT: Jumping heavy time zones, so for the rest of you, it's still early afternoon, but it's night where you are now, which is on the other side of Exandria for the most part, so you're all having to force yourselves to rest. You're exhausted and you're hurt, but it's going to be a little tough to push through for a full night's rest. But you can manage to do it. 
LIAM: Tree lag's a bitch. 
MATT: Yep. First watch, roll perception for me. 
TRAVIS: Perception. 
TALIESIN: Tree lag? That's stupid. 
TRAVIS: 16. 
MATT: 16. That heavy (rumbling) sound, you still hear. Every 15, 20 minutes or so, it seems to happen, and it's consistent in its strength and its pattern. Sometimes it's a little louder, sometimes it's a little softer, but it's pretty consistent. 
TRAVIS: Any changes on the wind? 
LAURA: If you stopped tooting, then maybe there wouldn't be. 
MATT: Not in particular. You do see some of these glowing entities passing around. At one point, you swear you see two of them stop and they glance in. Like they've noticed this change in topography. Then once they clock you seeing them, they dart off and vanish. 
LAURA: Cute. I love them. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (slurps) 
MATT: (laughs) Do you? 
TALIESIN: You're not supposed to eat the wings, man. 
TRAVIS: No. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (shouts) (laughter) 
MATT: I just had to check. I had to check. 
TRAVIS: No, no! (laughter) 
MARISHA: We wake up. Chet's just gone. 
TRAVIS: I'm just a skeleton in the doorway. 
MARISHA: Just bones, yeah! 
LIAM: Yeah, don't poke the piranha. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: All right. Other than that, your watch is uneventful. 
TRAVIS: Cool. Tag. 
MARISHA: Tag. All right. 
SAM: You're doing it? 
MARISHA: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Oh, you've got darkvision, too? 
MARISHA: I've got darkvision. 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: Who has darkvision? You have darkvision? 
SAM: I have, no. 
MARISHA, ASHLEY, LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: I've got a light. 
MARISHA: I've got Pâté with me as well. 
MATT: Indeed. "Can I... Can I, can I, can I talk again?" 
MARISHA: Oh, oh my goodness. Yes, you can talk again, but you have to be very quiet. 
MATT: "Yeah, but that's not being quiet." 
MARISHA: You can, you have to like, like barely whisper. 
MATT: "This is as low as I go. You didn't make me to be quiet." (laughter) 
MARISHA: I didn't, did I? 
MATT: "No." 
MARISHA: Your vocal cords are also just dried sinew, so it's not your fault. 
MATT: "It's not my fault." 
MARISHA: It's not your fault. 
MATT: "It's not my fault." 
MARISHA: Be proud of who you are. 
MATT: "Oh, I am." 
MARISHA: Okay. All right. (laughter) 
MATT: Roll a perception check for me. 
TALIESIN: So much loaded in that. 
MARISHA: Come on. It's all right, it's all right. 17. It's not the worst. 
MATT: 17. Okay. You also hear that occasional (whooshes) sound. 
MARISHA: Can I start counting the minutes between it? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh, like lightning? 
MARISHA: Yes. Yeah, I was counting the seconds. 
MATT: Between 15 to 30 minutes between them average. 
TRAVIS: And fairly uniform? 
MATT: Fairly uniform. 
LAURA: What if-- (gasps) 
MARISHA: Maybe it's like a geyser or something? 
LAURA: What if the creature is The Shore Shrew? 
TRAVIS: Okay, just go to sleep. (laughter) 
LIAM: Imogen just sits up. 
LAURA: No, but seriously, what if The Shore Shrew is like some giant... 
TRAVIS: Salamander? 
TALIESIN: I feel like Keyleth would have mentioned that. Go back to sleep. She would have said, big lizard. 
MARISHA: I don't know. What if she didn't want to scare us? It doesn't matter. 
TRAVIS: It doesn't doppler, right? It's from a fixed point, the sound? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's got to be some sort of, and does it sound like-- 
TRAVIS: It could be a geyser. 
MARISHA: It sounds like those geyser. 
TRAVIS: It could be a something. Could be mechanical? 
MARISHA: Those ocean, blow hole things. 
TRAVIS: Right. 
MARISHA: Like the, yes. 
TRAVIS: (watery explosion) 
SAM: White noise machine? 
MATT: Make a nature check. 
TALIESIN: Nature's white noise machine. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: What's that pirate island on the east coast? 
MARISHA: Ugh, five. 
TALIESIN: The one that fills up with water? 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Garbage. 
TRAVIS: Could I assist her as we trade shifts? 
MATT: (laughs) I'll say probably not because you already traded shifts. Sorry. Good looking out. Partway through your watch, you do, because even though they scattered off, you glance out and can see that more and more of these little glowing lizard fairy creatures are gathering by branches, and like they're calling their friends over to come and see this strange new thing that's come to the island. You watch a dozen, maybe 20 of them now are all caught up in the branches above. 
MARISHA: I'm going to do that thing where, like, I take some leaves and lay really still and see if they come near me. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: And eat one? 
TRAVIS: (slurps) 
MATT: You see a few of them move together and talk. They shove one of them forward. They're like (buzzes). (laughter) 
MATT: It looks back. 
SAM: "You talk to her." 
MATT: (buzzes) They like, (tiny thump) It lands on where your leg is. You get a close look of it. It has these very long-- 
TRAVIS: One eye. 
MATT: Yeah, one long, thin arms that like dangle from the front of it. It has stronger, thicker legs. Its head comes to a long, pointed snout that ends in a small horn or some sort of spike at the tip. It looks like an odd lizard with insect-like wings. You watch the glow that it gives is while it's flying because as it lands, the glow vanishes. Then it like (buzzes), and it glows and then it lands closer, and it gives off that light. 
LAURA: Cute! 
MATT: As it gets closer, you can see it has these very faint almost cloudy, yellow-green eyes with no noticeable pupil. So you're not quite sure where it's looking. They bug out a little bit on the sides. Then it sticks out its tongue to feel the vibration in the air as it goes, like a snake. The fuchsia teal swirl of color across its skin makes it very unique from what you've seen as you passed by, though with no light here, it's this black and white in the shadow kind of almost a zebra stripe pattern across it. It (gently thuds). 
MARISHA: I'm just not moving. 
MATT: (flutters) It darts back. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: You just cadavered for that whole thing? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I just imagine it walking on your eye. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Like Aeon Flux? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You close it. 
ASHLEY: Oh dang, good reference. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: You continue to not breathe. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Yeah. It's really low, anyway. It's good. 
MATT: Okay. The rest of your watch is uneventful. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Is there a third watch or does that take us through the night? 
MATT: I'd say given the fact that, we can probably go with a third if you really want to or you can try and get up and start moving before the sun rises. 
LIAM: Will we get a long rest? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: I'll give you a long rest, if you want to do that. You both take long watches. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can take extra long. I'm okay. 
TALIESIN: I actually prefer moving before the sun rises. 
MARISHA: Well, this counts as a short rest for sure, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: That was just a short rest for you two? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: The rest of you would get full long rests, but-- 
LAURA: But if we split it up and did another person, they would get long rests out of it? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Then, yeah! 
SAM: Well, let's do that. Yeah, I can do another watch. 
LAURA: Yeah, let them get a long rest. 
MARISHA: Tag. 
LIAM: Also, gameplay wise, in the future, a short rest recharges me completely. 
TALIESIN and SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: Completely. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Good to know. 
MARISHA: My warlock spells come back at a short rest. 
MATT: All right, so you're taking the last watch? 
SAM: I'll take the last watch. 
TRAVIS: I turn into a wolf. 
MATT: Perception check for me. 
TRAVIS: It's not complicated. 
SAM: Hmm? 
MATT: Perception check. 
SAM: Perception check. Disadvantage? 
MARISHA: "I'm basic as fuck." 
TRAVIS: That's what I've got. 
MATT: Because you do not have night vision. 
TRAVIS: Curse! Rawr! 
SAM: That is true. 
MATT: Yeah, so definitely at disadvantage. 
TALIESIN: And you're going to-- 
SAM: Do I have any spells that can give me light? I have a Light spell, but I don't think they want me to turn it on. So I won't do that. 
MARISHA: Do you want Pâté to stay up with you? 
SAM: Oh, sure. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: "I can be nice and quiet." 
SAM: Great. I got no problem with you. I never have. 
MATT: "I like him!" 
MARISHA: But remember. 
SAM: 14. 
MATT: "I am." 14, okay. You also, as you take your perching glance out beyond the exterior of this makeshift tent, can see the glowing curious bunch that is swelling with more and more individual glowing creatures before they come and land and the glow stops. At first, it looks like there's just a handful, and then every now and then, when you look out and make your movement known, about 30 points of light glow as they all suddenly shift and move and find other perches, and then all darken again. 
SAM: Are any within 20, 30 feet? 
MATT: Yeah, the majority of them probably. 
SAM: I'm going to cast, I don't know if this will work, Speak with Animals. Don't know if they're an animal. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'll very lightly say: Can you guys understand me? Do you talk? 
MATT: A few of them light up for a second and gather together. Then float. Then two of them (flutter) glide up to look at you in the front of the face. Their weird little lizard heads glancing. 
LAURA: They're so cute. 
MATT: One of them gets real close, and grabs onto the side of your head and perches on the side. Don't seem to be communicating, but one of them feels comfortable enough to attach itself to the side of your face. 
SAM: Oh. Well, you're so cute. Maybe you can understand me, but can't talk back? We're looking for folks like us. Do you know which direction they'd be? Well, not like me. Like them. Like humanoid type people. 
TRAVIS: You point to the corpse by the door. 
SAM: Oh yeah, that's not a dead body, that's my friend. 
MARISHA: Asleep with her eyes open. (snores) (laughter) 
SAM: I'll just. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: They pop open. 
SAM: Do you understand me, maybe? 
MARISHA: Drift open. 
SAM: They don't understand me. 
MATT: (chittering) It makes this weird clicking cricket sound. 
TRAVIS: Oh, they're talking. 
MATT: You hear two other ones (chittering). 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
MATT: There's a chatter amongst the branches before it gets quiet, and then one of them finally goes (chittering). 
SAM: Oh, well. Is that communication? Oh. Can you point with your finger? Can you point in a direction where there's people? 
MATT: (chittering) 
SAM: Just everywhere? Where is the most people? Oh, you're just pointing around randomly, aren't you? Because you don't understand me. How do you know if you know what I am saying? Okay. 
TRAVIS: What direction did they point? 
SAM: They pointed everywhere. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
SAM: Which direction is the real crazy sound that we keep hearing? The whoosh, whoosh. Where is that? Oh, so you do understand? Okay. So there's people everywhere, that thing's that way. Hmm. (laughter) 
LAURA: He just understood the sound that you did, though. 
SAM: Oh, okay, okay. How about I'll do the sound that humans make. "Oh hi, I'm (murmurs) Scott. Oh hey, what's your name?" 
MARISHA: I'm Scott. 
SAM: "(murmurs) (laughs)" Where does that sound come from? 
MATT: (lighthearted clicks) It laughs in your face. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: He's slaying them! 
MATT: (chittering) 
SAM: I'm here all night. 
MATT: About four more like. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: They attach to the sides of your head now and they're like (chittering). 
MARISHA: They're so cute. 
SAM: They're cute. 
LAURA: They're going to disassemble him. (laughter) 
LAURA: They're cute now, and then-- 
LIAM: They're just waiting until enough of them have arrived. 
SAM: Do I have anything to give? 
LAURA: (like Alan Rickman) Not "minors." 
LIAM: (like Alan Rickman) Miners, not minors. 
SAM: How about-- 
TRAVIS: Two of them show drill bits. 
SAM: I don't have any food! I don't eat. I'm sorry I can't offer you anything. I'll pickpocket off of Chetney some food. Some dried meats or something. Does he have any? He has dried meats. He's a wolf. 
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check with advantage because he's asleep. 
SAM: Okay. Uh-huh, that's four and a six. 
MATT: You feel something tugging on your belt. 
TRAVIS: (whipping impact) 
SAM: Ah! No. Go back to sleep, you need your rest. 
MATT: There's these bright purple glows around the outside of FCG's face as four of these creatures scatter off, spooked. 
SAM: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. I just needed some food to offer my new friends. 
TRAVIS: Wait, we weren't supposed to be bartering with them. What were you doing? 
SAM: Shh, go to sleep. 
TRAVIS: Oh, all right. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Is this real? 
SAM: I try again to take the meat out of his pocket. 
TRAVIS: Grab my meat. (laughter) 
SAM: I hope he doesn't die. 
MATT: Slowly one of them comes back. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, when was the last time you rolled? 
TRAVIS: Coming up. 
MATT: The glow swoops in. (chittering) 
SAM: If I got any dried meat, I'll offer it to them. 
MATT: It dips to the ground and has to pick itself back up again. (chittering) 
SAM: They're just adorable. I wish that you guys were up to see this. 
MATT: Carries it off and a few others gather behind it. Six more look inside the tent curling around. (chittering) 
SAM: I wish I could talk to y'all. Hmm. 
MARISHA: We're going to wake up, and he's going to be Gulliver's Traveled away. 
SAM: Dr. Dolittle. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: There is the faintest bit of light beginning to appear in the cloud cover above and the fog nearby. Just the early signs of dawn beginning for the new day. 
LAURA: I could try to talk to them telepathically. 
SAM: Oh wait, I could probably do that, too, can't I? No, I can just Detect Thoughts. I can, yeah. I can detect. I'll Detect Thoughts and see if I can discern what their thoughts are. 
MATT: Okay. Within 30 feet of you, you immediately detect of these smaller minds probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 40 of them that have gathered on the outside of this tent. Immediately, just the immediate realization that makes you, well, if you had a sphincter, it'd pucker a little bit. 
SAM: I can install one. 
MATT: There you go. There's something to talk about Dancer with. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Makes your O-ring tighten. 
MATT: You just pick one and try and read its thoughts? 
SAM: Sure, yeah, the one closest to me. 
MATT: The one closest to you that's curling underneath inside the tent. 
MARISHA: Pussy had a sphincter. (laughter) 
LIAM: Is that how that works? 
TRAVIS: Goddamn it. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. 
MATT: Um. 
TRAVIS: High fantasy, baby. 
MATT: Mm. Mm. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's the new feature on Pussy II. 
MARISHA: This Pussy's got a butthole. 
MATT: (heavy sigh) 
TRAVIS: Stop! Drink this. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Drink this. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: This Pussy's got a butthole! 
LIAM: That's okay, I'm waiting for the Mark Three. We'll see what we get. (laughter) 
MATT: The nearest one to you, from what you get, it's a sense of excitement and curiosity, as well as protective worry. 
SAM: Oh. Protective worry. Is that one close enough to touch? 
MATT: It's about three or four feet from you. You'd have to move a little, but you can get there. 
SAM: I just reach out my hand. It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you. 
MATT: Onto your hand. (chittering) 
SAM: With touch, I will cast Tongues on it. 
MATT: Hmm! 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
SAM: Maybe it can talk if I do that? Can you talk now? 
MATT: "What are you?" 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: Hey! 
MATT: "Do you have food as well?" 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: Oh, I do have food. Well, yeah, I can go get you some. I'll go get you some. Who are you? What's your-- 
MATT: "It's only fair. You gave so much to him. I want some food as well." 
SAM: Sure, sure. I'll try one more time to just pickpocket Chetney. 
TRAVIS: (snores) 
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check. 
SAM: Natural-- Two natural 20s?! 
LAURA and MARISHA: What! 
ASHLEY: No way! 
SAM: Wait, what is that? No, that's a four and a natural 20. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: Snatched without issue. 
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you. 
SAM: I'll give you, what's your name, little fella? 
MATT: "(munches) I don't have a name. I'm just me." 
SAM: You're Me! Oh! Well, smiley night to ya. 
MATT: "(chews)" 
SAM: Are you, what are you? Well, I mean, I guess, are you? Oh boy, what do I ask this guy? 
ASHLEY: Ask about the creature. 
LAURA: Ask, yeah, what the sound is. 
SAM: What? Oh yeah. So that big sound that we keep hearing. That's a bad thing, right? 
MATT: "There are many sounds. Which one?" 
SAM: The whoosh. 
MATT: "Oh, that's the spray cannon." 
MARISHA: The spray cannon. 
SAM: Oh, it's like a machine? 
MATT: "There are many holes in this island, and a lot of the water just push through it, and it makes a big spray cannon. (chittering)" 
SAM: Is it dangerous to go near? 
MATT: "Dangerous to go inside, mm." 
SAM: Is there a village or anything where people live? 
MATT: "We live in many villages." 
SAM: Oh, you have villages? 
MATT: "Yes." 
SAM: Are they in the trees? 
MATT: "Yes, and there are some in the ground, and there are some in the bush." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
SAM: Is there a way that we could come visit one? We're very nice. 
MATT: "(uncertain noise) Maybe." 
SAM: We wouldn't go inside, we would just wait outside. 
MATT: "You are very big and you make a lot of noise. (munches) And we don't want to bring the smelly one." 
LAURA: Smelly one? 
SAM: Oh, her? 
LAURA: Who's the smelly one? 
MARISHA: Hey. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh, maybe the smelly one's a monster. 
ASHLEY: Who's the smelly one? 
SAM: Is the smelly one the dead one over here? 
MATT: "(sniffs) N-n-ye... Different smelly one." (laughs) 
SAM: Which one of us is the smelly one? 
MATT: "None of you is smelly one." 
SAM: Who's the smelly one? 
MATT: "The big one, it smells." 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: "It smells. (sniffs)" 
SAM: Oh, it smells bad, or it has the ability to smell very well? 
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, that one." 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: It smells. It can smell you. It can smell you, it could probably smell us, too. 
MATT: "Probably." 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: "Pweeably" 
MARISHA: (laughs) I know, it's great. 
LAURA: Did he just say, "Preebalby?" (laughs) 
SAM: Do you do any-- You're so cute. 
ASHLEY: Preebalby. 
SAM: Do you do anything to conceal your smell or is there any smell that it can't? 
MATT: "Yeah." It points to it. 
SAM: Is it rosemary? (laughs) Is it lavender? 
MATT: (laughs) You can see that teal coloration on its body, it wipes off some of it. You can see, its full body is fuchsia, but that teal color is something else that it puts across it. 
SAM: To mask the smell? 
MATT: "Yes." 
SAM: Can we find some of that around here in the bushes? 
MATT: "Okay." 
SAM: Oh, can you take me to it right now? 
MATT: "Maybe. I have to see if it's okay." 
SAM: Okay, yeah, I'll wait here patiently. 
MATT: "Okay." (flutters) It darts off for a bit. 
ASHLEY: I love him. 
SAM: Me! 
LAURA: It's just Me. 
MATT: A few moments pass, you hear outside. (chittering) 
SAM: Pâté, don't say anything. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (Pâté) "Can I eat one?" 
SAM: No, you cannot eat one. 
MATT: "Okay, I'll ask again later." (laughter) 
MATT: Comes back. (Me) "Um, I don't know if we have enough for the big ones." 
SAM: Mm. 
MATT: "I can give you maybe a bit." 
SAM: Oh, I'll take it, thank you. 
MATT: "Okay." 
SAM: Thank you so much. 
MATT: Then it crawls up into your hand. 
SAM: (gasps) (groans) 
MARISHA: Oh. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He's not going to shit, no. 
MATT: It fills your palm with a little bit of teal warm matter. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Poo? He shit in your hand? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: He shit in your hand?! 
MATT: Yep. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He shit in your hand! 
SAM: Why do things keep shitting on me? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Scanlan lives. 
LAURA: It's blue poo? 
LIAM: It's a teal shit? 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Hey. 
TALIESIN: Ah, living the dream. 
LIAM: I like that he went and got permission to shit in your hand. 
LAURA: "I got to make sure I have enough." (laughter) 
LAURA: Well, maybe that means other ones could shit in our hands. 
SAM: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: That just means we have to cover ourselves in our shit. 
MARISHA: Shit. (laughs) 
SAM: Thank you so much. 
TALIESIN: Only if it's teal. 
LIAM: But his size, it's just like this. (laughs) 
MATT: "You're welcome." 
SAM: Your village, we don't want to disturb your village, or make a ruckus, or draw attention to you, you're so sweet. Are there any villages, or structures, or buildings that are slightly more our size that we could go visit? 
MATT: "Not here, no." 
SAM: Do you know where? 
MATT: "No, there's no bigger villages." 
SAM: On the whole island? 
MATT: "No." 
SAM: Oh, are there any people who live here anywhere? Not in a village, but in a hut? 
MATT: "There is Toriz." 
SAM: I'm sorry? 
MATT: "Toriz." 
SAM: Toriz? 
ASHLEY: Tortoise. 
SAM: Oh, a tortoise. 
MATT: "Toriz." 
SAM: Toriz? 
TRAVIS: Toriz. 
MATT: "Toriz." 
LAURA: I think we wrote that. Toriz, we have that written down. 
SAM: I wrote the word, "Toriz," but nothing after it. 
LAURA: Is that Jirana? 
MATT: "Toriz is the protector." 
SAM: Oh, where is they? 
MATT: "T-T-Toriz comes when there's big lights or big sounds to say we're in trouble." 
SAM: Oh, but that might draw the attention of the one who smells, right? 
MATT: "Maybe, but sometimes helps save us from one who smells." 
SAM: (gasps) 
LAURA: Toriz was Keyleth's friend. 
SAM: Oh, I thought that was Jirana. Toriz is somebody else that Keyleth was with? 
MARISHA: Did Keyleth mention it? 
SAM: Is there any particular color of light that will draw Toriz to us? 
MATT: "Big fire." You hear all these other creatures, all the voices out there like, (chittering). 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: This big echo of many, many voices as soon as you say, "Fire." And gets this look in its eyes, like. 
SAM: Oh, you guys are pyros. (laughter) 
SAM: All right. 
LAURA: Oh, they're going to love you. 
MATT: "Can you make a big fire?" 
SAM: Oh yes, we can make big fire. I can't myself. 
MATT: (chittering) 
SAM: But my friends can. 
MATT: You hear all this chatter and this seeming jovial, like (chittering) 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: "You promise to make us a very big fire?" 
SAM: You want us to make you a big fire? 
MATT: "Yeah!" 
SAM: When these guys wake up, we'll get one going, for sure. Is there anything else that you guys like to eat or need for your village? 
MATT: "Always enjoy food." 
SAM: Okay, well, oh man, this is so great. None of you have names, or--? 
MATT: "We know each other by the smells." 
SAM: Oh, that's so sweet. Well, my name's Fresh Cut Grass, and I was named after a sweet smell that my friend knew. 
MATT: "Oh, that's very nice. You're also thought of as smells. (laughs)" 
SAM: Oh wow, I guess we're sort of like kin, then. I think I'm going to wake up my friends so they can meet you, too. Don't be shocked if they're a little scared when they wake up and see all your friends around us. 
MATT: "All right, it's safe?" 
SAM: Oh, very safe, but maybe everybody take 10 steps back. 
MATT: (flutters) They all gather out the outside and stop. (laughs) 
SAM: Okay, is it time to wake up these fellows? Has it been a long rest for them? 
MATT: I'll say, yeah. It's been a communal long rest, at this point. 
TALIESIN: Awesome. 
SAM: I will gently wake some of them up, maybe Orym first. (laughs) Not Chetney. Oh god. 
TRAVIS: (deep inhale) 
LAURA: Is he dead? 
MARISHA: Oh, why are you getting so close? 
TRAVIS: 98. 
MARISHA: Why are you getting so close? 
TALIESIN and LIAM: Whoa. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's okay. 
ASHLEY: I don't like this game. 
TRAVIS: I wake up with one side of my face. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: Who made toast? 
MARISHA: Was minor. 
SAM: Orym, we got company. 
LIAM: What time is it? 
SAM: It's good, they're good. 
LIAM: Orym rolls over and he starts doing pushups. 
LAURA: No. (laughs) 
SAM: No, not yet, just hold off on the morning workout. We got friends! 
MATT: (chittering) (flutters) It coasts over and latches onto your chest, one of these creatures. 
LIAM: Hey. 
MATT: Looks up at you. (chittering) 
LIAM: When did this happen? 
MATT: Let me see how long the spell lasts, I'll tell you how long it's been. One hour, I better cast it again. 
TALIESIN: I mean, you've been talking for 20 minutes now? 
SAM: Yeah, we'll see. I don't know, that's up to Matt. 
MATT: Say the tail end of it can continue on. 
SAM: Okay. Yeah, and I'll gently wake up everybody and warn them what's going on, and not to make any sudden sounds or smells, Chetney, no farting. 
ASHLEY: Oh wait, did you wake us all up? 
SAM: I'm waking you all up. 
LAURA: They probably are used to the smell of poop. 
SAM: That's true. 
MATT: (chittering) 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
SAM: Hey, everybody, meet Me and Me's friends. 
TRAVIS: Aw. 
LAURA: (yawns) 
LIAM: Mes. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. 
SAM: The Mes, the Mini-Mes. 
LAURA: Do they speak Common? 
SAM: They speak Me. 
MATT: They all start fluttering in en mass until they fill the insides of the tent. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
MATT: There's the bursts of blue light as they swarm in. Then it all goes to a darkness before they all-- 
LAURA: Are they going to attack us? 
MATT: -- land in there. 
SAM: I don't think so, they're really nice. I only speak to one of them, and that's this guy, Me. 
MATT: (chittering) 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "But many of us have come to say hello." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I hold out my hands. 
MATT: Four of them like (flutters). 
MARISHA: (excited noises) 
MATT: (flutters) (chittering) 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: I'm going to tell it. 
SAM: You all can understand him, too, yeah. 
TALIESIN: No, we can. 
LAURA: Oh, we can? 
SAM: Yeah, he speak-- I gave him the power. So yes, he can speak to all of us and understand what we say. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: "H-hello." 
LAURA: Hi, Me. 
TALIESIN: Hi. 
ASHLEY: Hello. 
MATT: "Fr-friends of this one." 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah, we're pretty good friends. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to telepathically speak to the one in my hand. Can you understand me? 
MATT: "(chitters)" 
LAURA: It should be able to, I can communicate with one creature. 
MATT: No, I know, it's just very confused by feeling a voice in its head, it's like. (chittering) 
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'm in your head. 
TRAVIS: His head goes (pops). (laughter) 
LIAM: The last thing it heard. (laughter) 
SAM: (screams) 
MARISHA: I'm in your head. Boom! 
TRAVIS: Roll initiative. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You've got poo in there now. You have so much lavender poo in your hand. 
TRAVIS: Can you help me? (pops) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Never go full Akira. 
TRAVIS: Too much, too much. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: (pops) 
MATT: It seems like it understands you. 
LAURA: Hi. 
TALIESIN: FCG, this is either a great idea or a terrible idea, I can't believe you did this and maybe you're brilliant or maybe this is terrible. 
SAM: They gave me some information, we need to make a big fire to call Toriz here. 
LAURA: Oh, that was Keyleth's friend. 
SAM: Yes, the one who protects, right? 
MATT: "Yes." 
TALIESIN: Does this person protect them from us? 
SAM: Protect them from the one who smells. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: The one who smells. 
SAM: The serpent creature that you all said that you saw. 
LAURA: The one with the big foot? 
MATT: "Protect us from all things that would be dangerous." 
TALIESIN: Does the serpent creature have a giant foot? The smelly one have a really, really big foot, bigger than our feet? 
MATT: "It's very big foot, yes." 
TALIESIN: Okay, bigger than ours? 
MATT: "Bigger than your feet, yes." 
ASHLEY: And it flies. 
TRAVIS: Oh. (laughs) 
MATT: "No, it crawls, many legs." 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, many legs. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: "Big nose." 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: "Smelly. (sniffs)" 
ASHLEY: Big, smelly. Does it have fur? 
MATT: "Ah, maybe, sort of. I didn't get a very good look, it just ran away very fast." 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: What? (laughs) 
MATT: "Ran away very fast." 
SAM: Oh yeah, got it. 
ASHLEY: Very fast, very fast. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's very fast. 
ASHLEY: Lots of legs? 
MATT: "I think so, its colors change." 
ASHLEY: The colors change. 
LIAM: Is it as tall as the trees? 
MATT: "No. Some trees, small trees." 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I can see how this is going to be very confusing. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: So-- 
LAURA: The fire will not attract that creature? 
MATT: "I don't know." 
TALIESIN: Why do they want a fire? 
SAM: Because it attracts Toriz, and that's who we want to see. 
TALIESIN: Why does it attract Toriz? 
SAM: Because Toriz can see it. Me also said a big light would attract Toriz, so it doesn't necessarily have to be fire, I just assume that that's the only big-- 
MATT: "You promised a fire." 
SAM: Oh, they like fire. (laughter) (pen smacks) 
LAURA: Is there a safe place to start a fire where we won't hit any of y'all? 
SAM: Or your villages because we don't know where they are. 
MATT: "On the rocks!" 
SAM: On the rocks. Will you take us? 
MATT: "Me show you." 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, now's a good enough time to get up us any. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, this is happening. You mentioned the whooshy sound, did it tell you? 
SAM: That's harmless, we were scared for nothing. We're fine, it's just a geyser thing. It's water that shoots up between the-- 
MARISHA: I knew it. 
SAM: It's a geyser thing. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. 
TRAVIS: Breaker hole. (yawns) 
SAM: Yeah, it's fine. 
TALIESIN: Why do I feel hung over? 
MATT: All the creatures scatter off. The blue lights gathered outside and swirling around almost in a waiting state. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: Let's go. Well, you lead, we'll follow. 
MATT: "Very well. Come on, come on, we're going to make a fire!" 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. (laughter) 
MATT: It takes off and all bunch of them gather. Now, this point, you can see, there was the 40 that you felt, as they vanish, there's 100 plus that descend out of nearby branches, that have all gathered at the newcomers. They all (whooshes) swirl partially around you as you begin to move, and some keeping a boundary of curiosity, just coming up to you, looking at you, then darting off again and just keeping circles. Like this cloud of light that accompanies you as you begin to move through the forest. 
TRAVIS: Entourage. 
LAURA: In your head, you hear, Orym. 
LIAM: Hmm? 
LAURA: Y-y-y-you're, you're a little worried they're going to just push us right off the cliff? 
LIAM: Oh, I wasn't. (laughter) (pen smacks) (laughter) 
SAM: Tip of the spear, follow along behind Me. 
MATT: All right, as the dawn light curls from that dull, faint bit of navy into a softer blue, still diffused through the extremely thick mist and fog that swallows this island, you follow this technicolor swarm of blues that shifts with the color refraction of the rising sunlight. Until you climb around the outskirts of this particular part of the forest, and then up one portion of this partially moss-covered, heavy, volcanic rock hill leading you across it. This one's a little harder to climb across, but the moss bits do make for softer footfalls. As you follow suit, they circle back and make sure that you're following. You still hear those, (whooshes) those heavy sounds getting louder. Not directly in the direction you're traveling, but they're somewhat taking you towards the vicinity of where that sound was coming from. 
LIAM: It's still perpetual fog? 
MATT: It is at the moment, yeah. The further you travel with them, that sound, that (whooshes) gets a little bit more and more recurring, like the tide is shifting in a way that whatever splashing, subterranean water tunnel that's being forced through is much more present. That smell of sea spray is getting more prominent here, though you're not quite near the coast. As you begin to move up towards the peak of this current volcanic hill, you can see there's a 60-foot plateau at the top of it. Up here, you can see there are old, weathered remnants of a campsite, a tent that has been long retaken and fallen apart as nature has consumed it. You can see bits of splintered, once-worked wood, you can see charcoal marks where once maybe a campfire had set. You're not quite sure how old at a glance it may have been, but it looks like this was an area where someone set camp at some point in the past. 
LIAM: I'll bite, I want to try to get a sense of who they were, or how long ago, or--? 
MATT: Make an investigation check. 
TRAVIS: I'll join, especially that wood. 
LIAM: Pfft. Eh, not my forte, just a big old nine. 
MATT: Big old nine. 
TRAVIS: 24, and I'll again use that Grim Psychometry on the wood, specifically. 
MATT: (laughs) As you close your eyes and focus on this space, that shadow behind the closing of your lids suddenly is interrupted with a splash of crimson. You hear screams, and you see the shadows of bearded men, shouting, fleeing, the fear itself, the scent is almost caught in your nose as they throw each other to the side to keep themselves alive. Brotherhood non-existent as they run in the darkness, the bit of their campfire slightly dwindling in the background. You watch as the flame crackles and moves, and then it changes color as a massive beast moves through the shadow. You hear a low guttural growl and what looks like a flower of bright pink colors seems to apparate out of nowhere behind a figure. As it raises, you see glistening, wet teeth beneath it as a jaw opens. One final scream, another splash of crimson, and then you're pulled back. You look around and you can see this is what little bit remains of whoever decided to set up here. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm working real hard to interpret everything that's happening is okay, that does not make me happy. This just feels like a bad idea top to bottom. 
MARISHA: What does? 
TALIESIN: All of this, we are-- I don't know, I feel like I'm leaning into an awful lot of interpretation with the things that are being told to us. I'm trying real hard to trust, but this feels bad. 
MARISHA: Well, we're here looking for titan influence. This is your chance to get in touch with your roots. 
TRAVIS: It's a raw land, yeah. It's untamed, unbridled. 
MATT: (flutters) 
TALIESIN: I mean, I feel like they tamed it pretty good. 
MATT: One of them flies over towards you and lands on your shoulder. (chittering) 
ASHLEY: Is Tongues still cast? 
SAM: I can cast it again if it's run out. 
ASHLEY: Has it been an hour? 
MATT: You've traveled for quite a bit, the spell has faded. 
SAM: Is the one on me Me? 
MATT: Best you can tell. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Okay. I'll cast Tongues on him again. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. (crackles) "So now you make the fire?" 
SAM: I believe so. Would you all like to make the fire and summon Toriz? 
TALIESIN: I would like to do it and then take some cover. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Should we hide after we make the fire, maybe? 
MARISHA: Might be a good idea because you know, if Toriz is the protectors of the land and then we look like people who are here to destroy the land-- 
LAURA: Attack the land. 
MARISHA: Then maybe that will backfire. 
LAURA: We have let Toriz know that we are from Keyleth, that Keyleth sent us. 
TALIESIN: Because if I were a protector, I'd be protecting them from us. 
MARISHA: 100%. 
TALIESIN: Because, again, leaning real hard into the best interpretation of these events. 
MARISHA: What if we paint ourselves blue? 
SAM: I love your optimism. What? 
MARISHA: I don't know. Just try to mesh with the locals and get in touch with the-- 
TALIESIN: I'm already pretty-- 
MARISHA: -- their culture. 
ASHLEY: Well, me. 
MARISHA: Is that weird? 
SAM: I don't-- Do we have blue paint? 
TRAVIS: We have a little bit. 
SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
LAURA: Well, how did you get... You got little blue streaks on you. How did you get that? 
SAM: Oh, that's just a friendly... They conceal their smell by pooping on themselves and smearing it all-- 
LAURA: Pooping? 
SAM: Pooping on themselves and smearing it all over their bodies. So, they granted me a little bit of poop. 
TALIESIN: That's funny. I'm going to remember that one. 
LAURA: There's a lot of them. They could poop on us. 
SAM: That's what I suggested. They didn't think that, maybe they'd need a lot of fiber first. I don't know. 
LAURA: Me, could everyone poop on us? (laughs) So fucking gross! 
LIAM: That won't be taken out of context or sampled or used for anything. 
SAM: Do you think that you group of-- 
MATT: I love playing this game. 
ASHLEY: Just rain down on us. 
TRAVIS: We used to be wary a few years back. 
SAM: Oh yeah! They can fly! 
TRAVIS: Worried about that exact thing, and then-- 
MARISHA: Now it's whatever. 
TRAVIS: Will you poop on us? 
SAM: I think you're right! They could fly over us and just-- 
ASHLEY: Do a drive-by pooping. 
SAM: Just rain down. 
TRAVIS: Nope, not anymore. 
ASHLEY: Drive-by pooping. A question, can you understand me? 
MATT: "You want to rain from me?" 
TRAVIS: Rain? (laughs) 
SAM: Rain from Me? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
SAM: I do. I would like-- 
TRAVIS: Bring the monsoon. 
SAM: I would like it. 
MARISHA: ♪ Rain ♪ 
MATT: ♪ From me ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ On me ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: ♪ Waiting for the rain ♪ (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wait, just doing my due diligence here. How do we know-- 
LAURA: Doody diligence? 
ASHLEY: My duty, my double D due diligence. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: How do we know you're not bringing us here to just give us to this creature? 
LAURA: Oh yeah, you sacrificing? 
ASHLEY: You're not working or with this creature? 
MATT: "We just want to see the fire." 
ASHLEY: You just want to see the fire. 
LAURA: Insight check. 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Insight check that fucking tiny-ass thing. 
SAM: They're sweet! They're sweet little guys! 
LAURA: 20! (cheering) 
SAM: Ooh, a whisper! I don't have anything to-- 
TALIESIN: ♪ Mysterious whispers ♪ 
SAM: I'm not supposed to do the-- 
TRAVIS: Don't do it if you're not supposed to. 
SAM: They told me not to do it for this. What else can we talk about? 
TRAVIS: Candela! 
MARISHA: Candela? Yes? 
TRAVIS: Chapter Two. 
SAM: Is it out? 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yes! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: She was inside of a horse. 
MARISHA: The window's on Monday now. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
SAM: It comes out on Mondays? 
MARISHA: Comes out on Mondays now! 
SAM: Wow! Candela. 
LIAM: Laudna, big Candela fan. 
TALIESIN: Monday, the scariest day. 
MARISHA: She is. 
MATT: "You smell like fire." 
LAURA: I think they just like fire. 
ASHLEY: They do? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
TRAVIS: Why don't we spread out? 
LAURA: Yeah, let's back up. 
SAM: Mister can do that, right? 
LAURA: Do some fire. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we can make some fire. 
TALIESIN: Let's get some wood, and Mister's a good idea. 
ASHLEY: You want to see something? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
ASHLEY: Don't be scared! 
SAM: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: (smooches) Mister! Mister! 
MATT: (whoosh, monkey hoots) They all begin to scatter out a bit. 
SAM: Oh no! Oh no! 
ASHLEY: It's okay! It's okay! 
MATT: (hoots quietly) 
ASHLEY: Are they going to shit on us, or--? 
SAM: If we ask them to, maybe. 
ASHLEY: Is that weird? 
LAURA: To have them poop on us? 
TALIESIN: What isn't weird at this point? 
ASHLEY: Wait, I don't understand why they're pooping on us. You didn't tell us. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: The poop conceals the smell. The big creature that's out there can smell really well and the poop conceals the smell, so that one can't smell us. 
LAURA: I don't want to be stinky. 
SAM: It's poop-o-flage. 
TRAVIS: But the poop, the ratio of poop to body size is a bit off in this. 
SAM: Yeah, but every little counts! Every little helps! 
TRAVIS: We'll have some poop freckles. 
LAURA: I mean, there's hundreds of them. If we got pooped on by all of them-- 
ASHLEY: If we all got together. 
LAURA: I bet it would be enough. 
SAM: I can't-- You know, here, smell my hands. 
TRAVIS: Just hundreds of-- 
SAM: What do they smell like? I can't smell. 
TALIESIN: They smell like lavender and hay or something. I don't know. 
MATT: It does smell like lavender. 
SAM: Hey, it's the lavender you've been smelling! 
MATT: That faint bit of lavender smell, that moss that you were chewing on earlier. 
TRAVIS: Oh good! 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Let's be honest, It's all the same thing. 
MARISHA: Put it on our hotspots. 
SAM: Yeah. The pits and the bits? 
MARISHA: (laughs) The pits and the bits! 
ASHLEY: Pits and the-- 
TRAVIS: Well, let's line up then. Let's get this-- 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: The poop already started? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Let's huddle. 
LIAM: The transaction is fire for a shit show. 
MARISHA: For poop. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: You know what? Just to make it spread around more, I don't think you need to poop on me because I don't give off an odor. Do I? Do I give off an odor? 
LAURA: You kind smell like oil. 
TALIESIN: Why are you-- Look over there. 
SAM: Oh, okay. Then poop on me. 
TALIESIN: Chet. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Chet would know. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wait, so they know what they're getting, I'll take the chisel and, yeah, run it up my thigh. (fire ignites) 
ASHLEY: I'll light up a Produce Flame. 
MATT: Okay. As soon as you both produce flame, all the ones that were spooked-- (rumbling shift) 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- zoom in, and you watch as the one that you were talking to just stares into the flames. 
TALIESIN: Oh. Let's kill it, let's kill it, let's kill it, let's kill it. 
TRAVIS: (sucks in flame) 
LIAM: They want them all. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: You want to touch it? 
TRAVIS: No. 
SAM: No! What? That'll kill them! 
ASHLEY: No, just a little poke? 
MARISHA: Wait, is he completely unresponsive? Is he catatonic? 
ASHLEY: Where'd he go? 
MARISHA: Me? 
SAM: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Kill it, kill it, kill it. 
MARISHA: Me? 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: He loves it. 
MATT: "No! Bring it back!" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Well, you just disappeared. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
ASHLEY: Just so you know, this is what's going to happen. But I think you guys need to do a shit. 
MATT: "Oh, right. Okay." 
SAM: Shit bath. 
TRAVIS: Shit shower. 
ASHLEY: Shit bath. Shit shower. 
LAURA: Oh god! 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Turns around and, well, you hear because it's translated to all of you, in his language goes like-- 
TRAVIS: Shattered Teeth, you guys. 
TALIESIN: I just-- 
MATT: "The arrivals require a rain party." (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
TALIESIN: It has a name? 
TRAVIS: Get together! Get together! Get together! Get together! 
MARISHA: We bunch up. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Little green shower. 
TRAVIS: Like we're in County. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. (laughs) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh god, I hate all of this. 
MATT: Here, as-- 
TALIESIN: I love it! 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes! 
MATT: As the orange and purple hues of the morning light diffuse through the beautiful mists here and the beautiful islands of the Shattered Teeth-- 
LIAM: Shattered or shittered? 
MATT: -- you all stand at the top of this volcanic hillscape, looking up into the sky, clutching each other as a swirling storm of beautiful glowing blue pixie-like reptile creatures swirl around you. Hundreds of them begin to gather and turn and spin. It is this incredible-- 
LAURA: (laughs) All back to back. 
MATT: -- beautiful array of strange alien nature-- 
LAURA: (laughs) No, Marisha! 
MATT: -- moving as one. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: As they curl across-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (wheezes laughter) 
MATT: (pellets dropping) (pellets downpour) 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a lot! 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I fall to my knees, like "Shawshank Redemption." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's like "Zoolander" in the gas station. 
MARISHA: Yes! Yeah! 
LAURA: You don't even have knees! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Wake me up before you go-go ♪ 
ASHLEY: Yeah! (laughs) 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Sometimes, I think I should have let that bedroom set kill you all. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: It's in my eye! 
TALIESIN: Oh god! 
LIAM: It's in my eye! 
MATT: It does sting. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
MATT: It's a brief deluge, but enough for a topical layer. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh great. SPF. 
TRAVIS: (spits) 
ASHLEY: (spits) 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: They all eventually come back down. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You can see a bunch of them flying, they're like "(panting)" 
LAURA: Oh, they really pooped themselves out. They deserve some flame. 
SAM: They did so much. Give them some-- 
MATT: They all immediately-- (focused whoosh) 
TALIESIN: Should we set the tent on fire, maybe? 
SAM: We can quickly gather some kindling and stuff. 
TRAVIS: But we moved. We left the tent. 
TALIESIN: Oh, we left the tent? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. We went under the rocks. 
TALIESIN: So that you're not holding the fire, let's put it-- 
TRAVIS: But we can gather some wood and also, I'll make some shavings. It'll be good. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So we can walk away from it. 
LAURA: Yeah. I can control flames, too. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll make it centered. 
LAURA: So I'll-- 
SAM: You can make it big? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll make it big as soon as you start it. 
TRAVIS: I'll go start gathering some kindling. I'm sure there's no-- Is there dry or dead wood around? 
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check. 
TRAVIS: I'll do investigation. 
MATT: Or survival as well, actually. 
TRAVIS: I'll do investigation. 
ASHLEY: Laudna-- 
MATT: That's gathering the materials, too. 
ASHLEY: I feel like it's time-- 
TRAVIS: 22. 
ASHLEY: -- for you to practice. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! It's been so long since we've had a lesson! 
ASHLEY: It's been so long and I really think this could be your moment. 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Just focus-- 
SAM: Practicing what? 
ASHLEY: -- and we can all make a really big fire. 
MARISHA: She was teaching me fire. 
SAM: Oh cool! 
ASHLEY: Yes. Powerful. Very V-V powerful over here. 
LAURA: But we need to back these pixies up so that they don't get exploded in that. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: 22 for investigation. 
MARISHA: Okay, and you can help control, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, I can try to control the flames when you do this, so it doesn't get too out of hand for the little fairies. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: While you're having this conversation, there's no driftwood that comes this high up in the area and you're not quite near enough to the cliff. It looks like nothing has been carried here. However, you do recall seeing a lot of drier, dead fallen trees and nearby brush on the journey here, and you know what wood catches well. 
TRAVIS: I do. 
MATT: Because you avoid using them (laughs) in children's toys. 
TRAVIS: Termite-laden. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'll go and pry some off and then also run some strips. 
TALIESIN: I'll-- 
MATT: Gather some things. 
TALIESIN: -- carry a bunch of shit for you. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful! 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful! 
LIAM: We're all smeared teal at this point? 
MATT: Yeah, you have-- 
TRAVIS: Freckles. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Jackson Pollocked. 
MATT: Yeah. Kind of. 
LIAM: (spitting) 
TALIESIN: Jackson Poo-licked. No. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Poo-licked. 
LIAM: Poo-licked is good. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That was not my best. 
SAM: Jackson Poo-licked. 
TALIESIN: That was not my best. I'll workshop it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got shit freckled. 
MATT: In a short time, you have a pretty decent basis for a pyre set up here at the top of this hill, and you do also note that, as the morning catches, the fog begins to pull back a little bit. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: The thickness of it seems to be at its strongest in the latter, as the night begins to come in and as the night begins to leave. It never entirely burns off, but you watch as the perimeter of where it begins to choke off your vision at its strongest expands out a few more hundred feet to where you can actually make out a lot more of the landscape around you. 
TALIESIN: Let's build this fucking fire. 
LIAM: It's still enough to mask other islands, right? 
MATT: Yeah. You still can't see beyond the edge of the island. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: Shall we? 
SAM: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: See what you kids can do. 
ASHLEY: All right. You ready? 
MARISHA: I'm ready. Hang on, I'll get-- 
TALIESIN: This is going get big, y'all. 
ASHLEY: Clip him on, get him ready. 
TALIESIN: Maybe. 
TRAVIS: Everybody, give 20, 40 feet of space from the fire. 
TALIESIN: Set out a perimeter, make sure no one's-- 
MATT: All the, now close to maybe 300 or so of these flying creatures that have all gathered around the outskirts of where you've built this pyre, and they're all chittering excitedly around them as they gather for the show that's about to start. 
TRAVIS: We make fire protection rings outside of the flames for people who want to. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Valid. 
TRAVIS: Stay back! 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: There's always one. 
ASHLEY: You ready? 
MARISHA: Feel free to critique my form. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: I think we should just let you go ham. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Just see how you feel. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'll shoot some flame as well. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. This is going to be fun. 
MARISHA: (steadying breaths) I create this little bead of fire in the center of my palm, and you see almost a thread. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Almost like I'm puppeteering this little ball of flame. 
ASHLEY: She's brilliant. 
MARISHA: I'm going to take it, and as it expands, just shoot it outward into a Fireball. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: (flame erupts) This massive explosion hits. All of the wood that you've gathered and all the materials that you placed here immediately catch flame as a massive pyre of bright orange roaring flame just (ignites). 
ASHLEY: That was amazing! That was amazing! 
MATT: -- emerges up. 
LAURA: That was beautiful. 
MARISHA: Was it good? 
ASHLEY: Yes! Yes! 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! 
MATT: You see the black smoke billowing up into a pillar that rises up and mingles with the mist that surrounds you. 
LAURA: I'm going to try to control it and make it swirl. 
MATT: (flame gathers, swirling) It's a beautiful display, and the flames themselves are curling up 25 feet or so-- 
LAURA: Wow! 
MATT: -- at the very tips of it. You're not sure how long it'll burn at that intensity, but definitely the initial spark and the initial burst of flame, it is a sight to behold here, and that's what you built. 
ASHLEY: I'll keep shooting Scorching Rays when it starts to go down a little bit. 
TRAVIS: Orym, eyes! 
MATT: (flame blasts) 
LIAM: I was about to say, Orym's going to flea hop up a tree to get a higher vantage point and look to see what's changing and happen. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: And do the opposite. 
MATT: You'll have to travel quite a bit to get to a tree because this volcanic part of the hill is pretty clear. 
LIAM: Oh, we're away from all of them? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: All right. Well, then I'll do it from right here. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll do the other side. 
TALIESIN: I'm doing a slow search. 
MATT: Okay. Perception checks for both of you. 
LAURA: I'm going to take any little sparks flying off, I'm going to make it look like those little pixie blizzard creatures flying around it, flame dancing around. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: You got it. That's cool! 
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! 
LIAM: 26. 
MATT: 26. 
TRAVIS: Oh, not as great. 11. 
MATT: Okay. The first thing you notice is the beautiful ring of flying, pixie-like creatures are all just locked in place, just completely immersed in this flame, silently, (light fluttering) glancing in the air. They are enchanted by this experience. As you keep watch and look out there-- 
LIAM: Temple burn. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: That would be three assholes, though. 
MATT: You don't hear anything, but you see, not far from where Chetney is looking out into the fog, you swear you see part of the volcanic rock begin to move. 
LAURA: Uh oh! That's the thing can change color I bet. 
TALIESIN: They're doing hand signals. Okay. 
SAM: Steal third? 
TALIESIN: Packing up. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: They're doing weird hand stuff. I mean-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Something there! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Where? Okay. 
MATT: Chetney, you just barely hear, maybe 10 feet behind you, what sounds like scraping across jagged stone. 
TRAVIS: Hmm? 
MATT: You glance over and you see this hulking, multi-legged form that is of the same color and texture of the surrounding volcanic rock. It's like a part of the hillside came alive and is now a multi-legged, serpent-like creature, like a massive Komodo dragon made of volcanic rock that is (stomping), and you watch as it's coming towards your direction, but a little bit to the right. To the front of its pointed snout, there is this almost five-pointed star of skin that has a pinkish-red color that you recall from the vision that you had. 
TRAVIS: Familiar. Familiar. (squawks) 
MATT: You make a sound? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (squawks) 
MATT: The creature (whooshes) shoots over in your direction. (snarls) You watch some of the coloration, that texture and dark coloration fades from the front of its face, and instead, you see pale white, almost bloodless colored skin with slight stripes of a deep burgundy that curl under the throat. It almost looks like some lizard or mole-like creature. You do not see eyes upon its head. There is this massive jaw of teeth that open and slobber, and this massive, nose-like star at the end of its mouth that (snarls). (stomping) Make a stealth check for me. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: I'm built for this, so. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: Don't squeeze one out right now, Chet. 
TRAVIS: 21. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LAURA: Eyy. 
SAM: It has really good smell perception. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it has a big-ass star on its face. 
MATT: (snarls) (sniffs) 
LAURA: We just smell like poop. 
MATT: (sniffs) 
TALIESIN: The fairies' poop. 
MATT: (chomps) 
ALL: (screaming) 
MATT: And we're going to go to break. (laughter) (yelling) 
TRAVIS: I thought we were clear! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh, damn it! 
MARISHA: What do we do? 
LIAM: Not with that nose. 
LAURA: I hope Toriz comes and saves us! 
TRAVIS: Damn it! 
TALIESIN: We did exactly what they told us to do. 
TRAVIS: No! 
ASHLEY: I knew it! 
TRAVIS: You made my chest hurt! 
MARISHA: But they're afraid of them, too! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: How was your mild heart attack, by the way, that Chetney had in his sleep? 
TRAVIS: (wails) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I don't think that they connect any of the things that happened. I think that this was just, yeah. I don't think this was malicious. I think it was just, yeah, I think it's like a five year old. 
MARISHA: I love them so much! 
TALIESIN: They're great. Boy, they're-- Yeah. 
MATT: Well, we'll see what happens when we come back here. We'll see you after the break. 
LAURA: Maybe they'll all save us. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

Break[]
It is time. (dramatic music) You have chosen to defy peace. Then you have chosen war with a god. (dramatic music) (man groaning) (mysterious music) (gentle music) The Midnight Queen is dead. As the bell tolls for Her Majesty, her succession looms in uncertainty, for with her dying breath, the queen invoked an ancient and deadly contest, compelling the Princesses of Twelvefold to meet in secret and battle one another, until the stroke of midnight reveals the victor, the new Midnight Queen. (fire roars) Erdene, the Gilded Champion; Dr. Lux, the Scholar Supreme; Rosaline, the Oneiromancer; Freya, Blood of the Tower; Hephesta, the Light Breaker; and then there's me, Boss No, the fairest of them all. Who will survive? (horse whinnies) Who will you choose? (dice rattling) Who will be Queen by Midnight? (gentle music) 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Look at this? Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here. You need this? You probably need this. This is seriously magical. Roll an Investigation if you want. It's basically perfect. I mean, the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. (gasp) Could anything be more perfect? Style should never be a dump stat, darling. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. (whimsical music) (adventurous music) 
LAURA: She can't fuck a raven. 
SAM: I mean, she might be able to. 
MARISHA: Once again, mages. 
MATT: Wild Shape! 
MARISHA: Wild Shape! 
DANI: Wild Shape! 
MARISHA: Oh no, has that happened? 
SAM: She can True Polymorph the raven into a dude. 
LAURA: Of course it has! 
MATT: I don't know! 
SAM: Or just put a big old dick on the raven. 
SAM: Do they use spells when they fuck? That's all I want to know. 
DANI: Top or bottom? Sorry. 
MARISHA: What's up? 
MATT: That's my secret. I'm always puckered. 
SAM: I think so. 
LAURA: Just because your wiener's made out of a drill. 
MATT: Y'all, this episode's horny as fuck. 
MARISHA: 69. 
MATT: I'm not complaining. 
TALIESIN: Those that rise from the trenches only to boldly dive into the catacombs of the Fairelands are few and far between. Any investigator, be they soldier or civilian, will eventually find themselves forced to abandon what is right for what must be done. The scars of war are deep and timeless. Those who survive must balance on a delicate thread of ever-fraying purpose, for to stare too deeply into the chasm of the past is to see nothing but a reflection of terror. When retribution crawls from the darkness, our inner fortitude is put to the test. The Circle of Needle & Thread. Assignment #533: Eye for an Eye. 
(tense mysterious music) (ominous music) 
Narrator 1: Hello. Narrator 2: It's us, we're back. Real quick spoiler warning. Narrator 1: If you have not listened to season one of "Midst," you're gonna wanna stop here. Narrator 3: Seriously, we'll give you three seconds. (suspenseful music) (countdown timer ticks) Narrator 1: All right, you've been warned. Narrator 2: So you may be asking yourself, what the hell?! Narrator 1: Why the fuck did the moon explode? Narrator 3: What's gonna happen to utterly doomed Midst and everybody trapped on it by an incoming wave of reality-devouring fog? Narrator 1: Are Lark and Tzila gonna be okay? Are they gonna figure out that Sherman's not dead? Narrator 3: What's Phineas gonna do now that he's been abandoned by the Trust, the very institution that raised him and gave him purpose and his sense of self-worth? And like, what is he gonna do? Narrator 2: Will Jonas Spahr do the right thing? What even is the right thing? Narrator 1: What is Imelda's deal? Narrator 3: Why did the Trust even bother rescuing Moc Weepe even though he's this weird sleazeball piece of shit who stabbed his closest friends in the back? Narrator 1: And what is a mirror hawk? Narrator 3: What is a bocular horse? What is going on with Weepe's voice? Is Landlord gonna die? ALL: No. Narrator 1: Okay, we will tell you this one. Landlord is not going to die. We're unreliable narrators, not monsters. Narrator 3: Why did Lark kill Fuze? Narrator 1: What is she trying to hide? Is the nutcracker okay? Narrator 3: Will the rapidly depreciating value of valor ever restabilize, or is the market doomed to implode? Narrator 1: Is the Trust bad? Narrator 3: Did Saskia's dogs really eat the melted corpse of enterprising businessman Atticus Concord? Narrator 2: Do the narrators even know what happens next? (tense silence) No, we have no idea. Narrator 1: Just kidding, we know. Narrator 3: And when season two of "Midst" unfolds August 23rd, you will know as well. Narrator 2: In the meantime for bonus episodes, merch, media and more, visit midst.co. Narrator 1: And don't forget to stock up on light bulbs. You might need them where we're going. 
(epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music) 
ANNOUNCER: We now go live to a special address from the President. GALE: Hey, dweebs. Now as your president, I've been kind of killing it lately. I gave global warming an atomic wedgie. I balanced the budget by selling my Pog collection, and I saved the Queen of England from that octopus! But my kick-assery is far from done. According to this chart that I made, an estimated 35% of you are still a bunch of nasty goobers, but don't worry, I have a plan. Operation: Gag Me With A Spoon. It's easy sleazy. According to this study that I wrote, if every citizen subscribed to Critical Role on Twitch, we could reduce maximum goobage by a metric buttload. Twitch is the only place where you'll get a live and moderated chat. And! If you subscribe to Critical Role, you instantly get access to all their shows as soon as the live broadcast ends. So while you're oogling those Critical Role dorks with their sick goof-'em-ups and their nutty voices, think of me, Gale, the current president of (blows raspberry) whatever. Now, I got to go make a fresh batch of spitballs, but I guess I have some time for your boring questions. You. REPORTER 1: Gale, is it true that if you subscribe to Critical Role through Prime Gaming, you have to resubscribe every month? GALE: Uh, yeah. I do it right after my monthly prank call to Pee-on O'Brien. Next question. REPORTER 2: Does Critical Role have exclusive emotes for their subscribers? GALE: Uh, doy. Of course they do. I like the "Hello, bees!" one because bees are cool. I replaced my whole security detail with a bunch of bees that think I'm their queen. Last question! REPORTER 3: Yeah, with all due respect, is Operation: Gag Me With a Spoon a real policy, or are you mad goofin'? (record scratch) GALE: (scoffs) Am I mad goofin'? What, do you see me scarfing Milk Duds while doodling ding-dongs in the SkyMall catalog? Listen, I know I'm new to this. And I admit that when I made the wish to be the boss of everything, I did not know the witch that works at Woolworth's was listening. Well, Faustian bargain or not, I am the president now, and I have an obligation to lead this country. So to answer your question: No, I am not mad goofin'. Security, take him out! (bees buzzing) REPORTER 3: (panicked yells) GALE: (cackles) (blows raspberry) Later, chudruckers! (large explosion) (fireworks exploding)

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: So as the entity sniffs around the outskirts-- 
SAM: Oh shit, that's right. 
MATT: -- of this volcanic hilltop. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: We didn't think about this at all. 
MARISHA: No, we didn't talk about it! 
MATT: Frozen in place, it lunges at you and-- It's cocked. 
LAURA: Oh, it's a natural 20? 
MATT: It's a natural 20. 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (cheer) 
MATT: Why are you cheering? 
LIAM: You guys get bored? 
TRAVIS: I'm excited. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Cool. Well, it critically bites you. 
MARISHA: Why were you cheering? 
SAM: 180 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: And you are now grappled. 
TRAVIS: Probably. 
MATT: You take-- 
TALIESIN: At least we can see it now. 
LAURA: It's because you rolled a 98. 
TRAVIS: Probably. 
LIAM: That's not just heartburn. 
MATT: 62 points of piercing damage. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: As its jaws-- (intense snap) Snap around you and it tries to pull you into its jaws. You just barely squeeze out and land back on your knees. Pain rocking your body as the teeth drag across your body as you manage to pull yourself free. 
SAM: Do we all see this happen? 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: You see this happening and all of you hear this skittering snap sound and the cry of Chetney and now see this entity, it slunk through the nearby mist. I need everyone to roll initiative. 
SAM: Oh shit! 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
SAM: This combat is brought to you by WizKids Minis. 
TALIESIN: Ew. 
SAM: Cree, Vessel of the Pattern Boxed Miniature available now. Behold, Cree, Vessel of the Pattern in all her twisted glory. Pre-order this tangled monstrosity today. Expand your collection of Critical Role miniatures at wizkids.io/crminis and your local game store. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: The rest of you have been gathered around the flames. 
TALIESIN: I was a little further. 
MARISHA: Oh no. Oh my god. Look at him. Is that what he is? 
MATT: Further back here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, halfway to Orym. 
MATT: Halfway to Orym. Over here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Initiative. 
LAURA: I would've naturally been really far away from the creature. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: The witches were dealing with fire. 
MATT: If anyone-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: -- had a particular place they want to be, they can tell me. 
TALIESIN: I was nervous-- 
LAURA: I think the witches were next to each other. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Or at least triangulated, maybe. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Like this? Maybe like-- 
LAURA: Yeah, maybe Laudna between, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh, shit. There's the creature. Okay, okay. 
MATT: There's the creature. 
SAM: Oh, he's a cutie pie. 
LAURA: Just a cutie! 
MATT: To that point-- 
LAURA: Giant clawed cutie. 
MATT: -- 25 to 20. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: 20 to 18. 
LIAM: 19. 
TRAVIS: 18. 
LAURA: 18. 
TALIESIN: Who goes first, then? 
MARISHA: Wait, the three of you? 
TRAVIS: Orym, Laudna, and Chet. 
LAURA: No, Imogen. I'm Imogen. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, Imogen. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: You rolled an 18, right? 
LAURA: I think your dex-- Well, my dex is pretty high but probably yours is higher. 
TRAVIS: Two. Plus two. 
LAURA: Mine is a plus two as well. 
MARISHA: Rollies! 
TRAVIS: Rollies. 
MATT: Rollies. 
SAM: Rollies. 
MATT: Let's do it. 
SAM: The game that's gripping-- 
TRAVIS: Three. 
SAM: -- the nation. 
LAURA: Three! 
TRAVIS, MATT, LAURA: Rollies! 
TRAVIS: Eight. 
LAURA: 17. (cheering) 
SAM: It's the game that's sweeping the nation. 
MATT: 15 to 10. 
TRAVIS: Orym, Imogen, Chet. 
MARISHA: Wait, what'd you say? 
MATT: 15 to 10. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: 10 to five. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
SAM: Nine. 
MARISHA: Nine. 
TALIESIN: Eight. 
MARISHA: Rollies. 
SAM: Rollies. Wait, wait, wait. 
MARISHA: Oh. What's your dex? 
SAM: It doesn't matter. 
MARISHA: It doesn't matter. Rollies is more fun. 
SAM: I got 12. 
MARISHA: I got two. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: So wait, so FCG. 
TRAVIS: FCG. Laudna. 
TALIESIN: Laudna, me. 
LAURA: What'd you roll? 
TALIESIN: Eight. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Ashton's eight. 
ASHLEY: Five. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow, okay. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Well, we were busy. 
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: We were busy with the fire! 
ASHLEY: We were busy. 
MATT: Given the fact that you already had sight on this creature and tried and give a warning from a distance without calling its attention. You see this creature completely swallow, for a brief moment, Chetney, before Chetney fights his way out to the ground, covered in his own gore. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: What do you do? 
LIAM: So Chetney just got absolutely wrecked, right? 
TRAVIS: Almost. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Pretty rough. 
LIAM: I shout out Chetney's name and I run off the edge and leap. I will roll, tuck and roll, and keep running. 
MATT: That's 30 right there. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check for me to make sure you can tumble into it and keep going. 
LIAM: Yeah. That is an 11. 
MATT: 11. (laughs) You don't fall prone, but you do hit and tumble hard on one shoulder. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You do take-- Oh, man, double sixes. 12 points of bludgeoning damage, as you (hard tumbling) Hit the ground, you get back on your feet still. But you took a hard hit to the shoulder in the process. 
LIAM: Okay, that was my movement. For my action, I will continue to run straight towards Chet. 
MATT: Okay. 15, 20, 25. 25, 30. 
LIAM: Then, yeah, 30. Then I will-- I'm not done. Hold on one second, sorry. 
MATT: You know what? Yeah, sure, why not? 
TALIESIN: Oh, nice. 
MATT: It is misty this day. 
TALIESIN: It's always misty. 
MATT: Isn't it, though? 
ASHLEY: Misty Mountains. 
LIAM: I will bonus action thrust Seedling out towards that creature's outstretched claw. 
SAM: Seedling! 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: And use it to ensnare it. Well, just stick to its hand and pull myself right up to its face. 
MATT: Okay. We'll see. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: That makes it a dexterity save, right? 
LIAM: It does. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
SAM: Reverse ball. 
MATT: That is going to be a 10. 
LIAM: Fails. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Instead of trying to pull it to me, I'm going to let it, since I'm so much smaller, get pulled to it. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: I'm going to kick off of its snout, as I crash into it and then land down between Chet and it and pushing, use Bait and Switch, which doesn't use any action economy, bonus actions, not listed. 
MATT: Right. 
LIAM: I will give Chet... an additional five AC to the start of my next turn-- 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
LIAM: -- and shove my shield up in this thing's weird looking nose. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Done. 
MATT: Okay, finishing Orym's go, that brings us to Imogen, with Chetney on deck. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
LAURA: One second, let me just check. 
LIAM: Don't roll that d100 again. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to move my hands and on the rock over here-- A little bit over, yeah. A little tear is going to open up, and a Reiloran is going to step through. 
ALL: (oohing) 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: See, I get excited for the bad stuff. 
MATT: Right over here? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: I'm summoning a Hex Mind. 
MATT: Got it. 
LIAM: Cool. 
LAURA: Whatever that is. Do they get an immediate-- 
MATT: At the end of your turn. 
LAURA: Okay, great. So there's that and then-- 
MATT: You watch-- (chittering tears) As tearing out of this small, red, glowing rift across the battlefield. (electric tear) A thin, lanky Reiloran pulls out. It's not dissimilar to the one you previously saw in the chamber where you were talking with Keyleth. 
LAURA: And I am going to-- 
MARISHA: Didn't you get-- A gross smelly hair oil or something? 
LAURA: Quicken spell? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to quicken a spell. 
MATT: Okay, go for it. 
LAURA: Oh, that's 60 feet, though. It's more than 120 feet from me to the creature, isn't it? 
MATT: You to the creature? That is 85 feet. So, no, it's about 90 feet from you. 
LAURA: Great. Well, let me see. I don't know. I don't know, can you double sorcery points? Can I Quicken a spell and Distant a spell on the same turn? 
MATT: If you have enough sorcery points for it. 
LAURA: Okay, great. Great, then I'm going to do that. 
LIAM: Use those sorcery points. 
TALIESIN: What are you casting again? 
LAURA: One second. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, no. 
LAURA: I'm going to Quicken a spell and I'm going to cast-- Mind Sliver on the creature. So it's an intelligence save. 
MATT: Intelligence save. Got it. It's going to be a 12. 
LAURA: Then it fails and it takes 2d6. That's 11 points of psychic damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Let's see. "The target must succeed on an intelligence saving throw and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of my next turn." 
MATT: Got you, so the next save it has to make is minus 1d4. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Good to know. 
LAURA: Now the Reiloran gets to go. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: That is going to do-- It's going to do a Mind Spike. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Which is 1d8 plus three, plus the spell's level of psychic damage. Okay, so-- I spell attack it, okay. 
MATT: Yes, you roll for attack. 
LAURA: That's with my modifier? 
MATT: Yes. Whatever the modifier is for the-- 
LAURA: So, 20. 
MATT: 20? That hits. 
LAURA: Okay. So 1d8-- is nine points of psychic damage. 
MATT: Nine points of psych damage to it. Does it get more than one attack? If you look at the top of the creature elements, under its attacks, it might say multiattack. 
LAURA: Multiattack! Yes! So it does it again. 
MATT: Does it twice, yes. 
LAURA: Sweet! 
MATT and LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: That was bad. 14. Probably doesn't hit. 
MATT: 14, unfortunately, does not hit. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: And the Reiloran's turn. You got it, all right. Finishing Imogen. 
SAM: Dead yet? 
MATT: Chet, you're up. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (squeals) Oh my fucking god! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (yells) Is all internal monologue because I'm just shuddering in shock and fucking pain. I'll wipe some of the blood out of my gaping chest wounds and I'll-- Flick a Curse of Bloated Agony at the creature within 30 feet-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: -- as a bonus action. 
MATT: (impact) (gross sucking) 
MATT: It seeps into its pale exterior skin, leaving these black marks where the blood spatters hit. 
TRAVIS: Amazing, and I will use my action and my speed to go 70 feet back towards the Reiloran. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'll try and get up on that rock behind it. Going, oh my god! 
MATT: Yep, easy enough to do. 
TRAVIS: And that's my turn. 
MATT: All right, finishing your go. It is now the creature's turn. 
SAM: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: Well, okay. 
MATT: The creature that sensed the arrival and the direction of where you were previously, is going to lash out at where it thinks you still are to try and finish the job. But Orym is there instead. So it's going to go ahead and-- One bite and two claw attacks against you. 
SAM: That's a lot. 
MATT: Attack's going to be 16 to hit. 
LIAM: (whooshes) 
MATT: Glances off the shield, as it snaps out. But as the jaw moves by, you look right as one of its claws is now scratching out towards you as it reflects off of that. That's going to be an 18 to hit. 
LIAM: Miss. 
MATT: Misses. You just duck out of the way, getting the shield low and just-- It scrapes the claws like-- (raspy scratches) Across the metal, leaving sparks for a second, as it pushes you almost to the ground, your leg almost buckling from the weight as it pushes onto your shield. Its back, let's say, secondary leg on that side, is going to try and claw upward from underneath to try and knock the shield over like it's walking past you. That's going to be 20 to hit. 
LIAM: That hits. 
MATT: Okay. So you get one hit. That will be... 22 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: In doing so, it also pushes past you a bit over here. Doesn't quite leave the range, but it's like-- (growls and sniffs) It's smelling loud in the air and it can smell the smoke and it seems like it's picking up the scent of just you. It doesn't seem to be picking up anybody else. 
TRAVIS: And a question for Blood Curse. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It says "it takes 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one attack--" 
MATT: Which it did. 
TRAVIS: "-- during a turn." 
MATT: So it takes 1d8 necrotic damage. 
TRAVIS: Even if they miss it takes it? 
MATT: Yeah, it's still taking in the attacks, yup. 
TRAVIS: 1d8. 
TALIESIN: That's cool. 
TRAVIS: One. Five. Five points of necrotic damage. 
MATT: All right. All righty, that finishes its go. FCG, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
SAM: Shit! I didn't plan anything. 
MARISHA: Wait, did you go? 
SAM: I will-- 
TRAVIS: I ran. 
MARISHA: You ran. 
SAM: He ran. So I can come over and try to heal Chet. It feels like this thing needs to be within range of us to attack us, so I'm going to cast Compulsion on it. I'm trying to compel it to move elsewhere. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: That is a wisdom save? 
SAM: It is a wisdom 15 save. 
MATT: All right. That is going to be a 14 exactly. 
SAM: Hey! 
MATT: It just fails. 
SAM: Okay, I don't want it to go towards Chetney. I don't want it to go near anyone. So I'm going to point it towards-- I compel it to move towards, between those two rocks. On this side of the board. 
MATT: On this side? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: All right, it is compelled. 
SAM: When it moves there-- Which is on its turn or now? Probably on its turn. 
MATT: Yeah, "each affected must use his movement, as possible to move in that direction on its next turn." So yeah. 
SAM: Got it. 
MATT: So it doesn't move right now, but next turn it will move that direction. 
SAM: Got it. It'll trigger attack of opportunity once it does. 
MATT: Sure, it can still take its action before it moves. 
SAM: That's true. Shit. All right, great. But I can move it around wherever I want to move it. 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: All right. Then I'll get out of here by moving towards Chetney. 
MATT: All right. Full move? 
SAM: Yes, please. 
MATT: There you go. 
SAM: And that's it. 
MATT: Just cruising across the rocks. (bouncy wheels) 
SAM: I think that's all I can do. 
MATT: All righty. Laudna, you're up. Ashton, you're on deck. 
LAURA: All right. First and foremost, I'm going to bonus action Hex it. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: It's a 90-foot-- 
MATT: 90 feet? 
MARISHA: -- spell. 
MATT: Yeah, you can definitely hit it within 90 feet. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Hexed. 
MARISHA: Then-- 
TRAVIS: Jeez. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: My hands are terrible. 
MARISHA: Can I move and get behind this rock situation? 
MATT: One, two, three, four, five, six. 
MARISHA: Yeah, so let's see. Five, 10. 
MATT: You got three quarter cover behind there and still be able to see it. 
MARISHA: Damn it. Okay, great. I'll have to wait and do this next turn. I'm going to send Pâté over. 
MATT: Pâté flies over. 
MARISHA: And be like-- 
MATT: What's his flying speed? 
MARISHA: 40 feet. 
MATT: 40 feet? 
MARISHA: He should make it. 
MATT: Well, if he's back here with you and then moves with you-- 
SAM: That's Imogen. 
LAURA: Laudna was there. 
MARISHA: But I was there. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: So 40 feet would get him to about there. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
SAM: Where's all of our Me friends? 
LAURA: Yeah, where are they? 
MATT: They're just up here. 
LAURA: Are they still just watching the fire or are they taking in the attack that's happening? Can we tell? 
MATT: At the moment, you see most of them are still staring at the fire, but all the ones that are over in this area are now starting to scatter. 
SAM: Okay, good. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Run, Me friends, run! Or fly. 
MARISHA: Fly! Are we on a cliff face? 
MATT: No, you're on a plateau, a hilltop. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Well, FCG is compelling him, so I don't want to do anything to mess that up. So I'm going to pump some Eldritch Blasts in him. 
LAURA: If he gets hit, does the Comp-- 
SAM: I don't think so, I think it just works. 
TALIESIN: I don't think there's a save to it. I wouldn't want him to hit anyone, anyway. 
TRAVIS: We'll find out. 
MARISHA: Yeah, tell me. 
SAM: No. No, he's just-- He's just mine now. I tell him where to move for the next minute. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. Oh! 
SAM: I can have him move to Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Or into the fire. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Well, then I might as well-- 
SAM: I can't have him move into the fire, but I could-- Maybe I should have him move to you. 
TALIESIN: Well, next. 
SAM: Because you can hit him. 
TALIESIN: I'm heading straight there, anyway. 
MARISHA: Okay, two Eldritch Blasts with Hex. 
TALIESIN: God forbid, if I roll a two, I'm really going to-- Or if I roll a three-- 
MARISHA: Okay, so 27 for the first one and 22 for the second. 
MATT: Both hit. 
MARISHA: Then-- Damage is going to be... And a d10. Okay, for the first one-- 14 damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: For the second one... 12 damage. 
MATT: 12 damage. All right, 26. (blasting) (growling and sniffing) You see it's smelling out in different directions. 
MARISHA: That's my turn. 
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn, Ashton, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take the fist, knock a couple times, get a spark going, going to rage. That'll do. The rainbow sparks start fucking flying off the hammer and off my head. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Off the dome. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. A big, sparkly rainbow charge of-- What does 40 feet get me, how close to this motherfucker? 
MATT: 40 feet? 
TRAVIS: What is 40 feet? 
MATT: 40 will get you about there. 
TALIESIN: All right. What am I going to do, then? I'm going to-- I'm going to run directly at it and I'm going to keep going for another 40 feet and I'm going to bark at it a couple of times. (barks) 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: (laughs) Immediately it (snarls) 
TRAVIS: Oh jeez. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I mean, he's raging. 
MATT: All right? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: That finishes your go. Fearne, you're up with Orym on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right. So I'm a Scorching Ray. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: So-- 
TALIESIN: Better to hit me than you. 
ASHLEY: Let's do this one. 13? 
MATT: 13 misses. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 18? 
MATT: 18 hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 22. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So-- 
MATT: So that's 4d6 fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Plus 1d8 because-- 
MATT: Because you're awesome in fire. 
ASHLEY: -- Mister's out? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: And-- 
MATT: Actually, I should put him over here. 
ASHLEY: 4d6. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
LAURA: Look at all these buddies! 
TALIESIN: I think we're now-- 
MATT: I know! Oh god! Stay up there, buddy. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Mister! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: You stay put! 
TALIESIN: I am perfectly happy to be a distraction. 
ASHLEY: That's six. Okay. 16 points of damage. 
MATT: 16 points of fire damage. All righty. 
ASHLEY: Then Mister is going to shoot some flaming shit. 
MATT: Let's do it! 
SAM: It's just a shitty day. 
ASHLEY: It's just a shitty day. 
SAM: Episode title, "Shit Show!" 
LAURA: Shit show. 
TALIESIN: I mean-- 
MARISHA: That's pretty good. 
TALIESIN: Wow! Wow. All right. 
LIAM: Shore Shrew Shit Show. 
ASHLEY: That's the wrong thing. So sorry. 
SAM: Plot our next demise. He can't move toward us. What can he do? 
MARISHA: Oh my god! Staring you down. 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
SAM: The power. 
SAM and TRAVIS: To move you. 
ASHLEY: Sorry! Sorry! 
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and SAM: ♪ ("Wonderboy" by Tenacious D) ♪ 
TRAVIS: None of those notes were right. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Not a single one. 
SAM: ♪ ("Wonderboy" by Tenacious D) ♪ 
ASHLEY: So sorry! I'm so sorry! 
MARISHA: They're touring again. 
SAM: I'm pretty sure that was the THX sound. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
ASHLEY: Wait. Does he attack? He just shoots his poop. Why am I blanking right now? 
MATT: Yeah, and you roll for attack with it. 
ASHLEY: Then what do I add for his attack? Why am I having a brain fart right now? 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: I don't know. I'll come around. I'll show you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Shit show. 
ASHLEY: Is it here somewhere and I'm just not seeing it? 
SAM: Ashley's been shoveling shit for 70 episodes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Then-- 
TALIESIN: Some days you wake up and you forget what breakfast looks like. 
SAM: It's too-- 
MATT: Your spell attack modifier. 
SAM: Sometimes it looks like shit. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! Okay. That was weird. Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) Sometimes the brain farts hit. 
ASHLEY: 16. 
MATT: 16 just barely misses. (groaning) 
MARISHA: Oh, 17's the magic-- 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right. 
LAURA: ♪ Is the magic number ♪ 
ASHLEY: Good to know. Good to know. All right. 
LIAM: Yes, it is. 
SAM: Good to know. 
ASHLEY: That's my turn. 
SAM: (scoffs) 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to say. 
TRAVIS: Good to know. 
ASHLEY: That's my turn. 
TRAVIS: Good to know. 
ASHLEY: That's my turn. 
MATT: All right. As you're all facing this direction, off in this direction-- 
TRAVIS: God! 
LAURA: Yes! Yes! No! 
MATT: A heavy (rumbles) an impact sound hits, shakes the ground, and you hear (low-pitched croak). 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Uh oh! 
SAM: Are you Keyleth's friend? 
MATT: All of the currently focused in flame flying creatures (whooshes) look around, and the entity that's currently in the middle of the battle. (pants) 
LAURA: Uh-oh! 
MATT: Everyone is paying attention. Orym, what are you doing? 
MARISHA: Can you talk to me? 
TRAVIS: Oh boy! 
LIAM: So off in that direction? 
SAM: Can I talk to you? 
LIAM: We heard a bigger fish? 
SAM: Oh! Oh! (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Too far away from there yet. 
LIAM: Okay. Do I know how far off that felt? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah! 
MATT: With your passive perception, probably 500, 600 feet. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay. This changes slightly what I'm going to do. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, you can! 
TRAVIS: You got a little drunk there. 
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. (laughs) 
LIAM: (slurring gibberish) Yeah, throwing out what I was going to do and I'm just, as Ash has it preoccupied, I'm going to hop back and forth and look for a break in its legs, and I'm going to stab the motherfucker. We're flanking, are we not? 
MATT: You? If you move right here, you'll be flanking. 
LIAM: Then I will scoot my boot. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: Then you can shove your sword in its booty. 
LIAM: Right up his poop hole. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: That is-- What is that? 
ASHLEY: What a theme. 
LIAM: That's a low roll, is what that is. 
TALIESIN: I can never read those dice. 
LIAM: That's a 15, so that misses. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's 6.9, is it? 
LIAM: Advantage. The second hits. That's a 27. 
TRAVIS: Period-- 
MATT: That definitely hits. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- destroyed a good thing. 
LIAM: Okay. Let's make it a Goading attack. 
SAM: Yeah! 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: Right up the butt! 
LIAM: So, yep. 
MATT: That will get its attention. 
LIAM: Yep. 
TALIESIN: (squeals) 
LIAM: Stabbed him in the sphincter. That's a wisdom save. 
MATT: A wisdom save? Wisdom save. That's a natural 16? 
LIAM: That beats-- 
LAURA: Ow! 
LIAM: Does it? No, it fails because I'm 17. 
MATT: 17? Then yeah. It has no wisdom bonus, so it's just straight 16. 
LIAM: Okay, so that is, one plus six is seven plus 10, 16 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: And disadvantage against anyone but me. Since I've poked its pooper. 
MATT: Awesome. (laughs) Finishing your go, that brings us to Imogen with Chetney on deck. 
LAURA: (shouts) Oh! That's right! 
SAM: You're Laudna. 
LAURA: I'm ready. I'm ready! I'm going to-- how far can I do this? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Ready for the big ride, baby ♪ 
LAURA: It's probably very dextrous. 
SAM: You got this! Take this guy out before the big guy comes. 
LAURA: I am going to ♪ Lightning Bolt ♪ it. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Dramatic. 
TRAVIS: It. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It. 
LAURA: You said I was 90 feet away the last time. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: The lightning bolt is 100 foot, right, distance? 
MATT: This is a hundred-foot line, right? 
TALIESIN: The fire attack was just fine. Nothing weird about the fire, it didn't see us? 
MATT: You can hit it in a way that doesn't hurt your friends. 
LAURA: Great. I would've shimmied over if I had to do that. 
MATT: I'm sure. Yeah. 
MARISHA: I don't know. Fearne didn't. 
LAURA: I'm looking through the flames! 
TALIESIN: Did the fire attack? No. 
ASHLEY: What'd I do? 
MARISHA: Was fire--? 
MATT: Five. 
ASHLEY: It didn't say. 
MATT: That would be 11, so it still fails. 
ASHLEY: I think it-- 
LAURA: Sweet! So that is 9d6. 
LIAM: If we're guaranteed kaiju sized, 500 feet is nothing. 
LAURA: Three, four. 
TRAVIS: You're right. You're right. It's a step. 
LAURA: Five, six, seven, eight, nine. 
TRAVIS: It's a round. But it was seven- foot footprints, so. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LAURA: 12. 
LIAM: The thing in the clouds was 100 feet-ish long. 
LAURA: 12, 16, 20, 25, 29, 30, 31 points. 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
MATT: 31 points 
MATT and LAURA: Of lightning damage. 
SAM: Great! Is it dead? 
MATT: (lightning blast) Through, blasting the side of the creature. It's distracted by the sound, gets hit. (crackling) (snarling, panting) It looks like it definitely is looking in the direction of where it came from, and (sniffs) smells. That's all. 
TRAVIS: Because you're behind the fire. 
LAURA: Yeah. Then my Reiloran's going to attack it as well. 
MATT: Go for it. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Two attacks on that. 
SAM: What does she do? 
TRAVIS: No, don't leave me, bodyguard! 
LAURA: Oh, natural 20! 
MATT: Nice! 
LIAM: Good job, Loran. 
LAURA: And a 16? 16 doesn't hit. 
MATT: 16 misses, unfortunately. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You watch the Reiloran back there, still semi-ethereal state, it pulls its arms up, and you watch us this slightly faint, red-pink energy draws from around it and it brings up its hands to the sides of its elongated head. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: Its eyes flare-- 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: -- and the creature buckles for a second from some sort of impact. 
LAURA: 11 points of psychic damage 
MATT: 11 points of psychic damage. 
TRAVIS: That's it? Go over there, you fucking red bitch! (laughter) 
MATT: Does that finish your go? 
SAM: Same team, Chetney! 
LAURA: That's everything. Yeah. 
MATT: Chetney, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Eye flare? That's it? Goddamn it! (growls) I turn into a wolf. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Nice! 
TALIESIN: About time. 
MATT: (crashes) 
TRAVIS: I will (footsteps) (thump) hop down behind FCG. 
SAM: Hello! 
MATT: (crashes) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) What the fuck was that sound? 
SAM and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: I will run around back here. 
MATT: All right. (stomping footsteps) Clamber back and then-- 
TRAVIS: One one step closer to FCG so I can see him. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: Yep. Yep. 
MATT: All righty. Finishing your go? 
TRAVIS: Yep! 
MATT: All righty. This creature is compelled. 
SAM: Compelled. 
TRAVIS: I'll hold an action in case anybody comes near me, but I'm not planning on it. 
SAM: Does it say he gets to remake saves? That's just it. 
MATT: No, at the end of its turn, it can try to make it. After moving, it can make a wisdom save. 
SAM: Got it. 
MATT: But first, it's going to, because you just slashed it, it looks like it's distracted right now from multiple things, multiple sides. But you did goad it last turn, so it's going to unleash three attacks on you. 
SAM: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it! 
MATT: So it'll-- 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: -- spin around to face you. 
LIAM: Oh, I don't like the way that thing looks. 
TALIESIN: Nope, that's bad! 
LAURA: Oh, I hadn't seen its face yet! 
TALIESIN: That's really bad. 
MATT: That is going to be a 26 to hit. 
LIAM: That hits a little bit. 
MATT: For the bite. 
LIAM: Just a little bit. 
MATT: Just a little bit. Then the two claw attacks afterward. 
SAM: But you know, he's got poop on him, Matt! 
MATT: That's going to be a 17. 
LIAM: Miss! 
MATT: And another natural 20. 
LIAM: Damn it! 
ALL: (groaning) 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs! 
LIAM and TRAVIS: (shouts) Oh! 
LIAM: Barb is back! 
MATT: Nice! 
SAM: Are you close enough? 
LAURA: Yes, she is! 
TRAVIS: The critical! 
MATT: What's the range on Silvery Barbs? 
MARISHA: Da-ba-da-ba- da-ba-da-ba-da. I'm pretty sure it's 60 feet. 
SAM: It's 60. I just saw it. It's up a little higher. It's 60. 
MARISHA: 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet. 
ASHLEY: Silvery Barbara Downs. 
TALIESIN: ♪ You run, you run ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Silvery Barbara Downs! (laughter) 
MATT: Still a natural 18, but not a crit. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Not a crit. 
LIAM: Oh, 18? 18? 
MATT and TALIESIN: Natural 18. 
LIAM: Natural 18. 
MATT: So yeah. So much higher. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: That would've been-- 
LIAM: Gotcha. 
MATT: 24. 
LIAM: That also hits a little bit. 
MATT: No, 25. 
LIAM: I take 20% of the total damage. 
MATT: Correct. So (laughs) bringing us the... 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Here we go. So the bite attack. 
LIAM: Thank you, Laudna. 
MARISHA: You have advantage. I'll give it to Orym. 
MATT: Take 30 points of piercing damage from the bite as it clamps down on your shield arm and actually almost eats your arm off. 
SAM: Oh god! 
MATT: You take your sword and dig through and pull yourself free. The second claw strike comes up and you barely deflect it with the shield, but the power in doing so puts the shield right out of the way of your defensive position and the other claw, it strikes you in the abdomen-- 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: For-- 
MARISHA: I wonder if I should've Silvery Barbs-ed the bite. 
TRAVIS: Who did? 
MATT: 25 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: Woo! 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
SAM: How you doing over there, Orym? 
LIAM: He's like-- 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no! 
SAM: I'm so far away. I was going to heal good old Chetney. 
MATT: Compulsion, it's going to-- 
ASHLEY: Look at his teefies. 
MATT: It looks over in the direction where that noise came from, and where do you want to compel it? Yeah, you said this way, right? 
SAM: Do I-- I mean, I think, yeah, that's where I told him last time. 
TALIESIN: I'm taking an attack, well-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
SAM: Yes, both of you can take attacks of opportunity. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take an attack of opportunity. Do we get advantage because of where it was on that attack, or no? 
MATT: No. By the time it leaves your combat position, it's no longer there. 
TALIESIN: I do get my d4 because of Aura of Fate. 
LIAM: 26 for me. 
TALIESIN: Well, it's interesting because-- No, I miss! Fuck! 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I fucking miss! 
LIAM: Nine points of damage. I rolled a 26 to hit. 
MATT: Nine points of damage? Got it. Cool. All right, so it darts off, skittering across the way, throwing rocks and bits of broken volcanic material behind it as it rushes off in that direction. Wisdom save. Try and resist the effect. 
SAM: Yes. 15. That is going to be a natural 17. So it does-- 
SAM: Oh damn it! 
MATT: It is no longer compelled. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it! 
TRAVIS: Orym, you might want to leave anyway, though. 
LAURA: Nah! 
MARISHA: Yeah, depending on what's going on. 
LAURA: He's actually scary, but cute at the same time. 
MARISHA: I know! 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: No! Laura, no! 
MATT: FCG, you're up with Laudna on deck. 
SAM: I'm up? 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: Jesus! 
LAURA: He's like, "Bleh!" 
SAM: I don't know if I can make it over there to you, Orym. I can do Healing Word, but that's so weak sauce. I can't touch you. 
LAURA: Don't you have something that it can be everybody in an area? 
SAM: In an area, yeah, but we're all spread out right now. 
TALIESIN: This is a really bad. I do not know what to do. 
SAM: I can do Mass Healing Word within a 60 feet. Are we all within 60 feet of each other? 
LIAM: Nah. 
LAURA: If you got in the center. 
SAM: Yeah, I could do that! 
TALIESIN: If you move forward, you could get a lot of us. 
TRAVIS: You're also then moving into the open. 
TALIESIN: Well, you're not going to be able to get both of them. They're just not 60 feet. 
SAM: It's really just the two of them. 
MARISHA: The two of them right now and it might be a waste. 
TALIESIN: It's 60 feet. Does that mean 120 feet or it's a 60-foot circle? 
TRAVIS: 60-foot radius. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: 60-foot radius. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: You're on death's door, Orym? 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
SAM: Okay, I'll move towards Orym a bit and I'll do Healing Word on him. 
MARISHA: It's 60-foot for a Healing Word, right? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: He doesn't need to be that close. 
MATT: You'd be that close. You can be back here and still get him. 
SAM: Oh, okay. I guess I'll do a 3rd-level Healing Word? It's still not that much. 3rd-level Healing Word. 
MARISHA: Do it at range. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Which is pretty good. 
LAURA: Eurgh! 
SAM: One? Five. Nine plus three, ♪ 12 points of healing! ♪ 
TALIESIN: Hey, you're double digits. 
SAM: Orym, get back in the fight! 
MATT: (exhales) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: Then I got an action. Sorry, Chetney! I can throw you this. 
TRAVIS: No. No, I got one. It's okay. 
SAM: Okay. Shit! I can't really do an action. I'm so far away from him. Maybe I can. I'll shoot a thing at him! I got a thing shooter! A bolt thrower! I'll shoot a bolt thrower at it. 
TRAVIS: Let it go! 
MATT: Okay. What's the weapon range on that one? 
SAM: 80 feet. 
MARISHA: Work! 
MATT: 80 feet. 
TRAVIS: Twerk. 
MATT: This this is 85 feet. 
LAURA: Work. 
ASHLEY: ♪ You better work, bitch ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ Twerk, twerk, twerk ♪ ♪ Twerk, twerk ♪ 
MATT: Yeah, he is within range. 
SAM: (exhales) 
MARISHA: Come on! 
SAM: Nope. 
MARISHA: Damn it! 
SAM: 12. 
LAURA: Does it ever work? 
SAM: Nope. Never. 
MATT: (whooshes) 
TRAVIS: Hey, at least you're consistent! 
MATT: That's true. Yeah. 
MARISHA: What is this campaign? This has to work. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
SAM: Yeah, I guess so. 
LAURA: It's going to be the final fight. 
MATT: All right, Laudna, you're up, Ashton on deck. 
MARISHA: I know! 
TALIESIN: Shit! 
LAURA: Crossbow's going to do-- 
MARISHA: Me? 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (funny voice) Me? 
MARISHA: (funny voice) Me? 
MATT: Oh, it also takes another d8 from the-- 
TRAVIS: No, it's only once per round. Bloated Agony? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I think I have to do it to-- 
MATT: It's once per round, but it just did another multiattack against, Orym. 
TRAVIS: I thought it was only on one round, and then I had to do it again if I wanted to keep it up. 
MATT: Oh, that's right because you didn't-- 
TRAVIS: I didn't amplify it. 
MATT: You didn't amplify it. You're good. 
MARISHA: I don't want to use my action to do this, but can I do a quick scan and see if I heard where that big rumbling (rumbling) came from? 
MATT: You can make a cursory glance, yeah. Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Didn't have enough blood to amplify, if you know what I mean. 
MATT: Understood. 
MARISHA: 18. 
MATT: 18. You know the direction. It came from loosely this direction, but you have no idea how far. You don't see anything. 
TRAVIS: All bad over here. 
MARISHA: It's bad. It's bad over there. Okay. 
LIAM: Got a cold front coming in from this side. 
TRAVIS: (whooshes) It's been pretty bad over here. But here, fucking horrible. 
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm going to tell Pâté: Hey, buddy, go for a ride! I want him to come and go for a ride, hold on to this little guy's little hornses. 
MATT: "All right, Mum! I've got him!" 
TRAVIS: "Mum!" 
MARISHA: Then-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: "Mum." 
MARISHA: Through Pâté, I'm going to do a Shocking Grasp. 
MATT: Certainly! Roll to attack. 
MARISHA: 25? 
MATT: 25 hits! 
MARISHA: Then, he's still Hexed. That's pretty good. Oh wait! No, sorry. I'll keep that. It's 2d8. Ugh! Okay. Eight, nine. 
TALIESIN: I'll just have to re-up it next round and hope. 
MARISHA: 12. Nine, 10, 11, 12. 13 damage. 
MATT: 13 damage. You got it. 
MARISHA: On the Shocking Grasp. Then, I'm going to slightly tiptoe over here. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: So I can get just the faintest bit-- 
MATT: Of a view on him? 
MARISHA: Of a view on him. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: I'm going to Quicken Spell and I'm going to take my spindly fingers and jam them into the dirt. 
SAM: Nice! 
MARISHA: You see all this little skittering start to, it emanates first from under Laudna's skin, and then you see little stink bugs-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Aw! 
MARISHA: -- crawl out. I'm going to send them across and do Infestation, but with stink bugs on him. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: He's got a very sensitive nose. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I don't like it! 
ASHLEY: That's a cool idea! 
MARISHA: Let's see what happens. 
MATT: All right, it's a constitution saving throw? 
MARISHA: Yep. 
MATT: That is going to be a 15. 
MARISHA: Fails. 
MATT: Fails. All righty. 
SAM: The stink! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Actually-- 
ASHLEY: It's not going to be able to smell anything. 
SAM: It can't smell past the stink! 
MATT: So it takes 1d6 poison damage. 
SAM: Jesus! 
LAURA: I don't know. 
SAM: What is happening? 
MARISHA: 2d6 because of my level right now. 
MATT: All right. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Then he moves in a random direction. 
MATT: All right, let's roll. 
MARISHA: Unless the stink messes with him in a more thematic way. 
MATT: I think this is what's causing him to move in a random direction is the stink, the smell of the stink bugs all firing in his direction. He's not quite sure. Stink bungs. 
ASHLEY: The stink bungs! 
TRAVIS: Shivering queef. 
MATT: He'll move. He climbs 15 feet up onto the rock right here. 
MARISHA: It's bad! Bad! No, wrong! 
MATT: (chuckles) 
MARISHA: Yeah, want Pâté to still be like-- 
MATT: Yeah, he's still like, "(grunts) Trying to help with all this! He's moving around a lot!" 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "It's a big guy, slimy." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Oh wait! Hang on. I get one more d6 because he's still hexed by me. 
MATT: That's true. 
MARISHA: Another three damage. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Hexed. 
MARISHA: Hexed. 
MATT: Don't forget that Hex! 
LAURA: So hot! 
MATT: (laughs) All righty, finishing your go, Ashton, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
TALIESIN: So at the beginning of this turn the sparks are starting to fade, and I have that kind of-- 
SAM: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy! (groans) 
TRAVIS: Oh, rage? Rage fade. 
TALIESIN: Rage fade. 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! 
TRAVIS: Fuck! I'm going to smack myself in the head with my hammer again. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! There we go! 
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens. 
LAURA: Oh no! You had to get a new-- 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: New rage. 
LAURA: A new rage? 
TALIESIN: It's the same thing. 
SAM: Same thing. 
TALIESIN: The rainbow pops right back in. Okay. 
LIAM: All the rage. 
TALIESIN: (exhales) I'm going to run straight at Orym and I'm going to say: Hop on! and we're going to keep running. 
MATT: So it's five, 10, 15. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Just step up onto the hammer-- 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LIAM: -- as he comes towards me. 
TALIESIN: Then keep going in that direction. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: No, towards the edge of the board. 
MATT: Oh, here we go. 
LAURA: That way? 
TALIESIN: Yep. Then, I'm going to use the rest of my... Now that you're there. 
TRAVIS: Oh, take cover. 
MATT: I will say, to move him along with you, it gives you half movement in the carrying process, so it does reduce your movement, bringing him there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Shit! Okay. 
MATT: The issue with helping a friend get over there-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. I'm debating what to do next, though. Do I take him all the way out of the system, or do I leave him there? 
MATT: It's up to you. 
TALIESIN: There's not actually a little cavern there, is there? 
MATT: Hmm? 
TALIESIN: That's just a hollow. 
LIAM: Over on this side? 
MATT: There might be a little hollow. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use... Yeah, I'm going to dash and keep heading down there. 
MATT: Okay. With your dash and movement, you can manage to get over to this little hollow space. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so there's a hollow? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Shoving you in back and-- 
MATT: It's only about maybe six, seven feet deep, but it's definitely a little hollow. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, and then I'm just posting up. 
MATT: Okay. You got it. 
LIAM: Thanks, Ash! 
TALIESIN: That was... a decision. 
MATT: (laughs) All righty. That finishes your go. Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to peek around towards you and I'm going to Scorching Ray again. 
MATT: Do it! Same level? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. So that's three rays. (whooshes) 
ASHLEY: Nope. 13. 
TALIESIN: Do you have anything you can do? 
ASHLEY: 16. 
LAURA: Come on! 
MARISHA: Oh man! 
TALIESIN: I'll drop this in. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: 12. 
MARISHA: No way! 
ASHLEY: No hits. 
LAURA: Boo! 
MATT: Rough rolls! 
MARISHA: Bummer! 
ASHLEY: Mister's going to go on a different one. Oh, it's cocked. 
SAM: Weird! 
LAURA: I know, this dice is always-- It lands so dumb! 
SAM: What? 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: Don't use that one! 
ASHLEY: I'll do something else! I'll do something else! (laughs) 
MARISHA: "It lands so dumb!" 
SAM: It does! 
LAURA: It does! It always lands on its edge every time! 
MARISHA: Really? 
ASHLEY: Mister hits with 25. 
MATT: Mister hits? Great! Go and roll damage from Mister's fiery turd gun. 
ASHLEY: Fiery turd. 
MATT: "(monkey shout)" (blast) 
ASHLEY: Nice! 10 points of damage. 
MATT: Great! Starting to show a little wear and tear on the creature as it gets hit. (blast) (snarls) 
TALIESIN: I'm-- 
MATT: Finish your go? 
TALIESIN: Burned a bunch of stupid-- 
MATT: That finish your go? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Wait, hold on. 
MATT: You want to keep moving? You still have 15 feet of movement. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I just thought of something. I'm going to stay. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Well, I'm going to tuck back. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Behind the rock. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: Just like-- 
MATT: As you stand there-- (low-pitched croak) 
LAURA: Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
TALIESIN: Do not like. 
MATT: There's a moment where everything around you gets a little darker. 
TALIESIN: Shit! 
TRAVIS: What? 
ASHLEY: Can't see! 
MATT: As you glance up and see a shadow-- 
LAURA: Maybe it's a good thing. 
MATT: -- in the sky above you that gets bigger and bigger. 
LAURA: I trust it. 
MATT: (extreme crash) An impact hits the ground and rocks and stones and bits of broken volcanic landscapes go flying around. Everybody in the vicinity make a dexterity saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: Everybody? 
MATT: Everybody except for... Actually, the two of you are safe, and Chetney's safe. So everybody who's out in the open here. 
MARISHA: Okay. Saving throw? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: 16? 
MATT: 16. You take one point of piercing damage. 
SAM: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
SAM: 15. 
MATT: One point of piercing damage. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: 19. 
SAM: It's not that bad. 
MATT: One point of piercing damage. 
LAURA: 22? 
MATT: One point of piercing damage. The rest of your are shielded from it. Just from the debris being blasted back. 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
MATT: As the dust settles for a moment, you can see this hulking black shape that's probably about 25 feet tall at the top and about 40 feet wide from side to side. What looks like a gargantuan, jet black, toad-like creature has just landed in the middle of this battlefield and left a crater there. It has two bulbous yellow eyes in the front and a third one that pops up towards the back-- 
LAURA: Sick! 
MATT: -- to where it has a visual side on all points. As it lands and curls up and looks towards this chameleon-type lizard, and its mouth opens up once more (low-pitched croak) giving this heavy, deep, bassy croak that quakes the stones around. As its mouth opens, Fearne, you're the only one-- Actually, Fearne and Laudna, you glance over. The inside of its mouth is glowing. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: You look over in the mouth where it glows and you see it's not fire. There are lanterns hanging on the inside. 
SAM: What? 
MATT: It looks like, for a brief moment, you can see a quick glimpse of a partially furnished living room and a hearth that's burning and crackling as the mouth closes, and it stands there-- 
LAURA: So exciting! 
MATT: -- inhales, and then gives one big (inhales) (vomiting roars) and its whole chest puffs outward, and the creature on the side of the hill shakes and looks like it's about to shit itself. 
TRAVIS: Yes, Matthew Mercer! What are you talking about? 
TALIESIN: Oh shit! 
MARISHA: We're going in, baby! 
MATT: That's about this big, right there. 
SAM: You don't have a mini for it? 
MATT: I don't have a mini that big! I tried to order a massive Halloween toad and it didn't come in time! 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Dang it! 
MATT: It was supposed to come today. But, that's okay. 
MARISHA: Matt, we have one of those toads at home for Halloween stuff. 
TRAVIS: Don't tell him that now! That doesn't help anything! 
MARISHA: Remember the black toad? 
MATT: Well-- 
MARISHA: Sorry! (laughs) 
SAM: (as Marisha) It's in the garage! 
MARISHA: It is in the garage! In the Halloween bin! 
TRAVIS: Why? Why? 
TALIESIN: This is on me. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry! 
MATT: (shouts) Use your imagination! (laughter) 
LAURA: I'm imagining. 
SAM: Can you run home? 
TALIESIN: I'm imagining a toad in the garage. 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: I'll send a PA. Patrick? 
LAURA: Should we pause the game? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: No. Here. 
SAM: Parker. 
MATT: Hand me that Beaurebar cup! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Actually, that's kind of dope. 
ASHLEY: Perfect. 
MATT: It's a little bit bigger than this. 
SAM: Hey! 
ALL: Hey! 
TALIESIN: Now it's a party. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: I don't get it. It has a straw, Matt? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: No no! Don't kill us! No, don't kill us! 
MATT: (laughs) All right. 
LIAM: Bonus action. Second Wind. I get back 11 hit points. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
LAURA: Yay! 
LIAM: Okay. I heard something. I don't know what. I lean against this rock. I walk under Ash's legs. Five, 10, 15, 20. Oh shit! I step back, and as I stumble backwards, I take two slashes with Seedling and cut the air-- 
MATT: (whooshes) 
LIAM: -- to hit the thing. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LIAM: No. Okay, so straight roll. 17? It hits, right? 
MATT: 17 hits. That's just enough. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Laudna, did you see that? 
MARISHA: I think I did! 
LIAM: I'm going to try to hit it in the eye and make another Goading attack. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: It looked cozy. 
ASHLEY: In its mouth. 
LIAM: Six plus four is 10. 
MARISHA: I saw it. 
SAM: Hey, guys! 
LIAM: Six is-- Oh, that's a nine! 
SAM: The creature has a straw on its back! 
LIAM: 19 points of damage on that one. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: 19 points of damage. Fails with his wisdom save with a 10. 
LIAM: Okay, so-- 
MATT: So it's definitely-- 
LIAM: Right? 
MATT: -- successfully goaded. 
LIAM: Then I will-- 
SAM: It's available in the store. (laughter) 
LIAM: I'm going to... Hmm. That's a 24 to hit. 
MATT: 24 to hit. 
LIAM: Slash away. Swing away. That's 10 points, and fuck it, I'm going to action surge and keep going. 
MATT: Do it, do it. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
LIAM: That's a 27 to hit. 
MATT: 27 hits. 
LIAM: That is nine points of damage. Last one is a two, and it misses. 
MATT: All righty. Well done! Does that finish your go? 
LIAM: I will stumble back a bit. 
MATT: Fair enough. 
LIAM: I've got a little bit of movement left. 
TALIESIN: What the fuck's going on? 
LIAM: Big frog! 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
LIAM: (shouts) Big frog! 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Big frog, chase me! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Big, big, big frog! 
MATT: All right, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Big frog, chase me! (shouts) 
ASHLEY: Big, big! 
MATT: I'm sorry, it's Imogen and then it's you. I'm sorry. 
LAURA: Okay. (wails) 
TALIESIN: ♪ (warbles) ♪ 
MATT: You can see, as it's sitting there, massive, massive muscular legs and these large webbed feet that you recognize from the imprint you saw the day before. As it begins to turn and right itself, there are four arms that dangle from the front, two that catch, and two that are reared up and grabbing the edge of the legs as it turns. 
LAURA: I am going to-- 
LIAM: (like Gollum) What is it? 
LAURA: -- use Telepathic Speech, and I'm going to say in its head-- 
LIAM: Ribbit. 
LAURA: Toriz, we were sent by the Voice of the Tempest! 
MATT: One of the eyes looks over to focus on you, and you get, not a language response, but a acknowledgement and a sense of, just hide a moment. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Hide a moment? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Keep yourself safe. 
LAURA: Keep myself safe. All right. I am going to-- 
MATT: It's welcoming, and it's weirdly, it's familiar, even though you just met it. There's a comfort, like, "Don't worry." 
LAURA: Oh, I love it! Great! I am going to back up and I'm going to say: Take cover! 
MATT: This way? 
LAURA: Out loud to everyone. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So you're going to back up off that field there. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: (skittering) Finish your go? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: I really want to communicate to everyone. (shouts) It's going to help! It's helping! It's good! 
MATT: All righty. Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, I come cautiously off the rock and make my way towards the tiki mug. 
LAURA: I said take cover! 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
LAURA: I said, "Take cover!" 
TRAVIS: Sorry! (shouts) I'm losing a lot of blood! I'll use my movement to back up. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm just going to lean against the rock-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: -- and be like (wails). 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
MATT: All right. It's the creature's turn. The creature is going to flee. It goes into a full movement and dash to what would be 90 feet that direction. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
MATT: It is quite a ways in that direction. I'm not going to reach that far, but we're going to say it's just off to that side. FCG, Laudna, Ashton, Fearne, anything in particular you want to do in this moment? 
MARISHA: I just go: Pâté, let go! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Bail! 
MATT: "Okay!" (whooshes) (flutters) "Thank you for letting me know!" (laughter) 
TALIESIN: The fuck is going on? 
MATT: "I'm very specific and I'm doing exactly what you asked me to do!" 
MARISHA: I know! You're such a good boy! Come here. 
MATT: "I'm just very, what's the word?" 
MARISHA: Obedient. 
TALIESIN: Pliable. 
MATT: "Yeah. Pliable." 
MARISHA: Pliable. 
TALIESIN: I just mutter that. Pliable. 
MARISHA: A little dumb. Come here! 
ASHLEY: Hup, hup, hup, hup. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Listening to Imogen, I'm going to cuddle up against this rock and take cover, whatever that means. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, leaving room for Fearne. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to run over to Chet and pump a 2nd-level Cure Wounds into him. 
MARISHA: Nice! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go hide behind the rock with Laudna and scream out-- 
SAM: 10 points. 
ASHLEY: Hi from Kiki! 
ASHLEY: Hi from Kiki! 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: All right. Imagine Mister goes and hides as well. 
LAURA: My Reiloran hides behind the rock as well. 
LIAM: Also work for poop. 
MATT: (whooshes) 
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah! 
TALIESIN: Hey, y'all got poop! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: All the Mes, you can come out again! 
LAURA: Maybe. 
TALIESIN: They may know. 
MATT: You can look. All of them have, the ones that scattered, they spread out a little bit and they've all now densely circled the top of this toad. As they swarm, they swarm above and are excitedly causing this massive, like a light whirlwind in the air above it. 
LAURA: Does the toad have any teal on its back, too? 
MATT: If you have a look, yeah, there's a few spatters across it. 
SAM: Nice! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Like a car that was parked too long. 
MATT: It rights itself in the direction of the fleeing creature and looks over and takes a huge leap (whooshes) up into the air. (whooshes) A massive, massive arc and then (crashes) lands right behind this fleeing creature. As it hits, it uses his front arms to flip the creature. 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
MATT: You watch as this lizard creature, right at the edge of where the fog takes your vision, you watch it (whooshes) and then vanish off-- 
LAURA: Like that raccoon in the-- 
MARISHA: The raccoon! 
MATT: Yep! Straight up (whooshes) (laughter) 
LAURA: All of its legs. 
MATT: Yep. Just full. And they do. The centrifugal force holds its legs out, full-on, and it vanishes out in the mist before you hear (gentle splash). 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
MARISHA: Wow! 
LAURA: Into the ocean. Into the ocean with you! 
MATT: From there, you hear the heavy (giant footsteps) as this monstrous toad clambers and hops over back to where the rest of you are before it settles in the middle of this arena. I'll give you a drink back. Sorry. 
LAURA: Oh no. It was empty. 
MATT: Oh, there. Thank you. I appreciate your help. 
LIAM: Ribbit. 
SAM: (shouts) Where did the frog go? 
LAURA: It's back. 
MATT: It's back. 
LAURA: It's in the middle of us. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: We move in. Can we move in closer now? 
TALIESIN: Turn around! 
ASHLEY: Tentatively peeking around the rock. 
MARISHA: No, Matt's not even going to entertain it. He's like, "No." 
MATT: Settles here-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: -- and then sits. (whooshes) Its massive legs, its knees framing both sides of it, the other arms settling into place. As it leans forward, it seems to shake a little bit, like it's trying to finish stretching after its recent tussle. 
TALIESIN: Slowly going to start poking my head around the rock. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Start walking over a little bit. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: (rumbling croaks) 
TALIESIN: I think we're good. 
ASHLEY: She told us-- 
LAURA: Hello? 
ASHLEY: -- she told us to say, "Hi from Kiki." 
LAURA: Hi from Kiki. 
MATT: (deeply croaks) You see the eyes blink and it nuzzles the ground a little bit before its mouth opens. 
SAM: Aww! 
MATT: (grunts) And opens its jaw. Now the rest of you can clearly see within this massive toad creature, there are partitions and there are chambers, and you can see framed artwork on the wall. It's like a grandma's cottage 
LAURA: I love it! 
MATT: On the inside of a massive toad. 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: There's little hanging planters that are still rocking from the impact of it landing. 
LIAM: What are the walls made of, the partition walls? 
MATT: It looks like they're made of wood. It's like the interior of a log cabin, like they took the trees from the landscape and built a home within this entity. On the far wall there is a handle, and holding onto the handle in what looks to be a rocking chair, that itself is bolted to the ground so it doesn't slide around, you see this hunched, female turtle humanoid-- 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: In this region, referred to as a galapa. 
TRAVIS: Galapa! 
MARISHA: Galapa! 
MATT: You see this large brown shell that's decorated in hanging ribbons and curios and charms that dangle around from its side. As it sits up, releasing the bar, up off the chair, dusts off the apron and begins to step through the interior, looking out into the little bit of the foggy daylight, the morning brightness. It's still getting brighter as the morning unfolds. Glances out at the rest of you. 
MATT: "Well, good morning to all of you. You say you're here on the behalf of the Kiki?" 
LIAM: Voice of the Tempest, yes. 
MATT: "Right, I heard that name." As she steps forward, you see she's quite elderly. The dark gray skin is very wrinkled with this colorful patchwork dress, like a sundress that's way too small for her frame, that looks like it's been torn and then re-fixed with rope to make it more... It's not an apron that she's wearing; it's part of a dress that's been repaired multiple times. When she smiles, the wrinkles almost crack backward to look like a puppet. They pull in this bright smile where the head almost bisects. The pointed snout curling down past the lower lip, Morla the Ancient One kind of vibe. Gentle, soulful, pale blue eyes that, as soon as they look at you, they seem like they read your essence in but an instant. "Well, you are here at the behest of a trusted friend. So by extension, you are trusted friends." 
TALIESIN: Jivana, right? 
LAURA: Jirana. 
TALIESIN: Jirana, the Shore Shrew? I don't know if that's a nice nickname. I don't know. 
MATT: "Oh-- I've learned to embrace it through the years." 
TALIESIN: I respect that. 
LIAM: Ma'am, do you have a house in your toad? 
MATT: "I do." 
MARISHA: Is the toad named Toriz? 
MATT: "This is Toriz." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
MATT: "Toriz is my companion and my home and my guardian." 
TALIESIN: Do you pay him rent? 
LAURA: He's amazing. 
ASHLEY: I just have so many questions. 
SAM: How many square feet? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Do you have squatter's rights? 
MATT: "We have an arrangement." She tickles the outside of the doorway that she stepped out of, and the toad (grumbles). She's like, "Aw, he's a big softie." 
ASHLEY: What a big boy. 
MATT: "(laughs)" 
ASHLEY: May I pet him? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Sure." 
ASHLEY: I go give scritchies. 
MATT: It's interesting. It's like scratching the rock face of a cliff after a fresh rain with just a little bit of give on the outside. There's that scaly texture. It's very unique. But as you press, it's also warm to the touch. 
ASHLEY: That makes me a little uncomfortable. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm sure you've noticed the change in the world, in everything lately. 
MATT: "It is hard to avoid. Those of us who have been here for some time, you just can sense when change is on the wind." 
TALIESIN: Well. We're Bells Hells, and I'm Ashton of the Hishari, and we need help concerning a particular tree. 
MATT: "There are many trees. Maybe I can be of help. Come in, come in." 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: "It's much warmer inside." 
LAURA: I didn't want to invite ourselves, but I really wanted to go in. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. I'm really into this now. I've given up having any-- Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Just to be safe, I'm a little covered in blood. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is that going to be okay bringing into your abode? 
MATT: "Just a moment." 
TRAVIS: Ah. She steps off to the side and grabs a bucket from the kitchen. (sloshing splash) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That was really satisfying. (shakes water from fur) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay! 
ASHLEY: (shimmying shake) 
MARISHA: Ugh, uh! 
ASHLEY: From head to tail. 
TRAVIS: (poofs fur) (laughter) (lingering laughter) 
LIAM: I see him take a full bucket, and I am in extreme pain, and I just shut up and limp inside. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you're lower than I am. 
MATT: "You look like you've had quite a scuffle. 
ASHLEY: Wasn't bad. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "The Bari Mondolo is a dangerous creature, though it is just living by its essence." 
SAM: What did you say the creature was? 
MATT: "Bari Mondolo." 
TRAVIS: Wow, Bari Mondolo. 
SAM: Barry Manilow? 
TRAVIS: Bari Mondolo. 
TALIESIN: Ruins everything. (laughter) 
LAURA: Bari Mondolo. 
MATT: "It is a child of the reef serpent Esquala." 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MARISHA: What? 
MATT: "Esquala protects the Utu Reef far north of the island, and it lays its eggs at different islands through its lifetime. This is one of its children." 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
SAM: Serpent. 
LAURA: What about those little flying creatures? What are they? 
SAM: The Me's. 
MATT: "Oh, the Dolabos." 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Dolabos. 
LIAM: Dolabos. 
MATT: "They are a beautiful, strange, flighty--" 
MARISHA: Dolabos? 
SAM: Dolabos? 
MATT: Dolabos. 
MARISHA: Dolabos, sorry. 
MATT: "Eternal children of the island." 
LAURA: They are very cute. We're covered in their poop. 
MATT: "I noticed." 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: I noticed! (laughs) We don't need it anymore, right? Now that the-- 
MATT: "That is up to you. The Bari Mondolo is still out there. Do not hate it for its nature. It's still a teenager." 
TALIESIN: This seemed like a good idea at the time. I can't tell anymore. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Teenagers do act out. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: It writes the songs. (chuckling) 
MATT: Asshole. 
TALIESIN: Shit, fuck it. 
TRAVIS: Bari Mondolo. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. (laughs) 
LIAM: Bari. 
TALIESIN: Bari. 
TRAVIS: Reef serpent Esquala. 
LIAM: Is this place full, this land full of creatures this size? 
ASHLEY: Barry Manilows? 
MATT: "Only a few of them. The Bari is one of a handful of creatures that live in this cluster of islands, yes." 
LIAM: My friend and I took to the air yesterday, pretty high up, and we saw something in the air, something larger than your home, even. 
MATT: "That is likely the Cloud Jaws." 
LAURA and SAM: The Cloud Jaws? 
MATT: "They are like a sky whale." 
LAURA: Yeah, that's-- 
TALIESIN: You have sky whales! 
LAURA: That's a really good description. That's what it was. 
SAM: Evil, or--? 
MATT: "No. There are many things that you could call evil based on your perspective, but they just live by their nature." 
TALIESIN: I'll shoot for dangerous. Dangerous? 
TRAVIS: Cloud Jaws? 
SAM: Sky Jaws. 
MATT: "They can be dangerous." 
TALIESIN: But you have to be-- 
MATT: "It's why there aren't any skyships that travel beyond the fog curtain." 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: In that respect-- 
MARISHA: Cloud Jaws. 
MATT: "They like to eat what comes--" 
MARISHA: That's like a sky whale. 
MATT: "-- within close range. But they do not like to get close to the water, so ocean travel is generally safe from them." 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: That's amazing. 
TALIESIN: I kind of want to see one now. 
LAURA: Wow. We're looking for a tree. 
LIAM: Evontra'vir. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Evontra'mir. Tra'vir. 
MATT: "Ah, I--" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Well, this seems like it will be a deeper conversation than I was prepared for, so maybe sit. I'll make some tea." 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: That sounds really good. 
MATT: "This will be a conversation over tea, I think. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
MATT: "Come." She moves over and opens up a small closet on the side. You can see within the closet there's interior ribcage, flesh. The interior is mostly this beautiful cabin, but there's no windows, and certain edges and chambers, you can see the interior of the toad poking through this-- It would be almost disturbing if it wasn't quaint in places. She reaches in and pulls out some stools, sets up a makeshift sitting circle, and moves some furniture over. (furniture scraping) This big old rickety couch that looks like it's about to fall apart gets pushed over. 
TALIESIN: Is there a coat hanger by any chance on the way in? Do I see if there's a coat hanger? 
MATT: Oh yeah, there is no coat hanger. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I was trying to take some of the poop stained stuff off before I sit down. 
LAURA: Oh, I can Prestidigitation. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's just go for it. 
LAURA: I'll clean us up-- 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
LAURA: -- a little bit before we sit down. 
TALIESIN: Wipe the feet, come on in. 
MATT: She goes and takes a little piece of wood and throws it into the fire, the hearth picks up and burns a little brighter for a second, and goes over and sets a little metal cauldron on the side. You can see at the top, there is a little bit of, where the apex of the roof is, it goes to a blowhole, and all the smoke goes up within the inside. You now recall that when it landed, though you weren't quite sure, you thought maybe it was just smoke from the fire, but it actually gives off a little bit of a chimney smoke trail off the top of the toad. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: She goes and sets a little cauldron on a hanger by the fire and starts boiling some water before turning to the rest of you. 
LAURA: So it has just two legs, or does it have two legs and then two front legs? 
MATT: Two legs, and then four front arms. 
TALIESIN: Four arms? 
LIAM: Arms? 
MATT: Smaller arms. 
LIAM: Froggy? 
LAURA: Froggy arms that touch the ground? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Does this hurt him, being in here with all the-- 
MATT: "No, I think it keeps him warm and keeps him company." 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
LAURA: I love it. 
ASHLEY: I do, too. 
LAURA: I wish we could just live in Toriz all the time. 
ASHLEY: Are there more of these, or you made it? You made it? 
MATT: "I have certainly made this my own, but I was not the first to live within Toriz." 
LAURA: Really? 
MATT: "I don't know who the previous denizen was, but Toriz has been alive for many centuries." 
ASHLEY: So all this was already here? 
MATT: "A lot of it was, but I've spruced it up to my particular tastes." 
MARISHA: It's very nice. 
LIAM: Some of the rooms predate you moving in? 
MATT: "I think so. I am but the latest steward of the island." 
SAM: Maybe the prior owner flipped it. 
TALIESIN: I was thinking this might be rent controlled. You just keep passing it off before anyone knows. 
MATT: "Well," she finishes pulling off the heated water and starts pouring into this really intricately kept collection of china that she has in this small cabinet. You can see a lot of the furniture here looks like it's been scavenged or repaired from shipwrecks or maybe purchased from odd folks that came by for trade on this island. They don't have a unified theme to them. They're all pulled from different places, and some of them look like they're carved from driftwood and made over time. 
LAURA: I have a gift to add to your collection. 
MATT: "What is this?" 
LAURA: It's the Taste of Tal'Dorei tankard. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: "Oh my goodness. I have never been to Tal'Dorei. They drink from this?" 
LAURA: Well, at a-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: It's not-- Technically, it's not from Tal'Dorei. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. I think that's what they drink from, because that's, yeah. 
MATT: "Oh." 
LIAM: It's definitely limited edition. 
TALIESIN: We've never been there. 
MATT: "A very kind gift. Unnecessary, but appreciated. Thank you." She pours her own tea into it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Aw! 
MATT: "Well. The Voice, Keyleth, is a wonderful woman with an impressive heart for leadership. She has been bearing many burdens, and I'm sure many more since we last spoke. I hope my words helped her lift the weight she carried many years ago. The fact that she's brought you to me leads me to believe that perhaps there is a burden upon your shoulders, as well?" 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Definitely. 
ASHLEY: She told us you were a specialist on grief and loss. 
MATT: "You could say that." 
LIAM: How did you come to know her? 
MATT: "I think she heard of me. I did not call to her, she found me. I don't know how, but I don't question." 
MARISHA: How did you gain such a reputation for being a grief counselor? 
MATT: "It is a very long story that maybe is too much to make this about myself, with you being such fine guests. But suffice to say, I have lost a lot in my lifetime, and I have lived a very long lifetime. I have seen and witnessed many terrible things, and many wonderful things. And I've seen many wonderful things come out of terrible things. So I guess you could say I have a perspective through these experiences, as well as a comfortable connection with the natural life force of Exandria, that can sometimes help others with similar experiences. And I'm just a very good listener." 
MARISHA: Maybe a simpler question. How long have you been on the Shattered Teeth? 
MATT: "I've been in the Shattered Teeth my entire life." 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
MATT: "Which--" You see she does some midair math with her long turtle claw at the end of the finger. 
TRAVIS: It's hard when you've been around for a while. 
SAM: Sure, sure. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: "120-something years." 
ASHLEY: Wow. Do you have family here, or--? 
MATT: "Not anymore." 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
LAURA: Maybe, maybe. 
SAM: Do you roam all the islands, or just this one, of the Shattered Teeth? 
MATT: "Just this one, now." 
SAM: There are other islands, though. 
MATT: "There are 43 islands that comprise the Shattered Teeth." 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: (spit take) Let's go! Sorry. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I got a t-shirt idea. 
ASHLEY: What?! 
MATT: "They all reside deep within the fog curtain. This is just one of many." She does the math again in her head. "Well, I suppose years from your understanding, it is hard to keep track of in the Shattered Teeth sometimes. I guess by what you would consider an Exandrian year, it would be closer to 400 years, maybe." 
SAM: Oh, wait. 
TALIESIN: Fair. 
SAM: The years here are different? 
MATT: "Well, the spirits of the land have a unique way of keeping time." 
LAURA: So wait, when you say you're 120-something years old, you're actually-- 
MARISHA: 400-some odd years old? 
MATT: "From outside calendars, yes." 
MARISHA: From outside. So different calendars. So the calendar here is roughly-- 
SAM: Is it a calendar difference, or does time move differently? 
MARISHA: She just said it was a calendar difference, unless it's a little bit of both. 
MATT: "I don't know. I do not have a calendar." 
ASHLEY: You said one year, it's like 400 years? 
SAM: She said spirits. (confused murmuring) 
ASHLEY: That's a long time. 
MATT: You get the sense from her that in some ways, she's very wise, and in some others, she's a little confused. When she says the spirits, there's a reverence to the energies of the land. You're not certain that there is clarity on some of these messages, necessarily. But you also get a sense that maybe her own understanding of the passage of time is a little weird. 
TRAVIS: She's got her own story going on. 
SAM: Turtle time. 
TALIESIN: Can you sense the spirits? The spirits of the land? Do you feel them? 
MATT: "Somewhat. Anyone who spends a lot of time alone can hear them, if they listen." 
TALIESIN: Can you hear them in other people? 
MATT: "I do not follow." 
TALIESIN: I was told that I should tell you that I'm a titan of blood, and that you might know something about the Hishari. It's not a long story, to be honest. I think I'm the last survivor, as far as I know, but I don't remember being there. 
MATT: "This is very unique history, I'd say. I do apologize, I do not know much about the Hishari myself. It is a part of history perhaps I have not read about. But you said you are looking for the Tree of Atrophy, yes?" 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MATT: "What is it you seek with this tree? 
SAM: That is a good question. 
TALIESIN: The world is-- The world is changing, and I'm trying to figure out what I mean, what my life means, I don't know, and I-- The earth has started to feel different, and I was told that I would find something in this tree that would clarify. Power, I don't know. I don't know. 
MATT: "Evontra'vir was one of the few surviving civilians of what was previous before the Shattered Teeth. Evontra'vir took all of the sorrow and loss of all that was destroyed in the Calamity upon themself and became the memory of those who have returned to the land. They took root in the island of Kalutha to become this tree, to forever be a memory of the sacrifice and the…the sadness, the emptiness, to be a vessel for the sorrow of others, and to become one of the few worldly windows into the realms of death and beyond." 
SAM: Worldly windows into death? 
TALIESIN: That sounds like exactly what I'm looking for. 
MATT: "Well, it is a moderate journey to the island." 
TRAVIS: You talk about the tree as though it was a person or a living entity. 
MATT: "It was, it is still a living entity, more or less. It was once a Gau Drashari, one of the Druidic peoples that protected Exandria through the Age of Arcanum. For some, when they find, through long life, through epiphanies of their purpose  in what they have to grant to the land, they become something older and more strongly tethered to that purpose. Some, often, this takes the form of a tree." 
TRAVIS: Huh. 
TALIESIN: This happens? Like, this is a thing that happened? 
MATT: "Rarely." 
TALIESIN: But more than once? 
MATT: "More than once." 
ASHLEY: Did Evon choose this? To become a-- 
MATT: "As far as I know, yes. It has been a long time since I have spoken to the tree, (chuckles) but as much as I speak of sorrow, not all sorrow is steeped in despair. That can be a part of it. But part of my own learning of grief came from spending quite some time with this tree myself. Through grief can be beauty in memory. There can be joy in remembering and carrying forth the lessons of those that are no longer here. The tree is between worlds in a strange way. It can see the path sometimes for those who wish to know their death. Knowledge that can be very dangerous for some, or a purpose for others. It is a lot of things. I hope perhaps maybe it is what it is you need for you." 
SAM: What do you need to do to, well, I guess we can talk about it when we get closer, but what do you do to talk to the tree or connect with the tree? Do you need to feel your grief at it, or? 
MATT: "No, you do not have to bring it anything. If you have grief to bring to it, it will be willing to help you. We have different approaches. The tree is honest. Not everyone can handle honesty to such a degree. I am more motherly. I hold those who need it, the tree tells them. We serve similar purposes for different kinds of people. But nevertheless, what other questions do you have? Do you know where the island is, how to get there?" 
SAM: We need to know. Can Toriz swim there, or--? 
MATT: "No, Toriz, it is too far." 
SAM: Or jump? 
MATT: "That would not be great." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Toriz is not the greatest swimmer." 
LIAM: You've been there, so, you know the way? 
MATT: "I took a boat." 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Boat. 
SAM: There's boats here? 
MATT: "There are many boats. When you have this many islands it's how many people travel." 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: "Different factions, not always meeting in the best way, depending on which waters they meet. It's interesting, the islands, they are not stationary." 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "Many islands of The Teeth, they are nomadic, ever-shifting." 
LAURA: Well, how do you ever keep track of where you're going? 
MATT: "You either have to pray to the spirits or whatever gods you follow. Or if you know cartographers, they update the maps every few years." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "They have to; it's always changing." 
SAM: They must have a lot of business. 
MARISHA: Oh yes, you know any cartographers here? 
MATT: "There are no cartographers--" 
MARISHA: Right. No. 
MATT: "-- on the island. But, hold on, there are a lot of shipwrecks that happened on the southern shore of Slival. And I collect things." 
MARISHA: Southern shore? 
MATT: "Yes, hold on." She steps away and goes back to that closet, and you can watch, starts moving things out. Pots and pans falling, ching, ta-ping, ping off to the side. A broom falls and pulls one of many chests and (scraping) drags it out and opens it up, and there's a pile of junk in there. 
LAURA: Awesome. 
MATT: She starts pulling, poring through, and you can see bracelet falls out, a gauntlet hits. You can see a rusted old blade, clatters against the side of the wall. You see broken, empty jars fall and shatter even more. She kicks it off to the side. 
TRAVIS: Oh no, that's terrible. 
LAURA: Hey, Matt. Is it possible to turn off the ember noise? 
MATT: Oh yeah, is it bothering you? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Sorry. 
LAURA: No, it's okay. 
MATT: No worries. Before eventually pulling out a small tattered sheet of thick parchment, and goes, "This I kept because it's the most recent sort of idea of where it might be." 
SAM: A map. 
MATT: "It's not, I do not know how recent it might be." 
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh no! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: I got one! I got one, motherfuckers! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Travis starts foaming at the mouth. 
SAM: That's not 43, that's not 43 islands. 
TRAVIS: No, it's... 
MARISHA: Oh, it's part of a map. 
SAM: There's six. 
TRAVIS: Two and three halves. But it's-- 
SAM: It's something. 
TRAVIS: It's something. 
LAURA: Look at how it shifts. You can see the shifts. 
TRAVIS: Smells real good, my guys. 
MARISHA: Here's us on Slival. 
MATT: "That is why I kept it. This was recovered about 12 years ago." 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
LIAM: Wow. 
ASHLEY: How much would the islands change? 
MATT: "Well, looking at the map, they were in the process of updating from what the roving movement was." 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: Cool. 
LAURA: So the smaller ones can move greater distances. 
TRAVIS: And the red x's? 
MATT: "I--" 
LAURA: Port cities? 
SAM: Ports? 
MATT: "I think those might be where they made landfall. The last one was on the shore on the..." 
LIAM: Very Travis. 
LAURA: Before they were destroyed by the-- 
LIAM: Very Travis with a map and a sentient sword. 
SAM: Is Kalutha on there? 
MATT: "Kalutha, I believe, is the lower right side." 
SAM: Oh great. 
LAURA: That's where we're going, right? 
MARISHA: Fantastic. 
ASHLEY: Is that where we need to go? 
MARISHA: If there were a lot of shipwrecks, there are plenty of ships to be taken at the southern shore. 
TRAVIS: Oh-- 
MATT: "They're all very wrecked, unfortunately." 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: You can see where they were previously. 
MATT: "But--" 
MARISHA: We'll figure it out. 
MATT: "Let's see." 
TRAVIS: Shardborne. 
MATT: "If you know how to repair a boat, there are many trees on the island. You could try to repair it yourselves--" 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's not a problem. 
MATT: "-- if you have the tools." 
MARISHA: He's very, yes, talented. 
TRAVIS: I've also been around quite a while. 
SAM: We can teleport, too. 
LAURA: We can teleport. 
TRAVIS: You don't want to get on a boat? 
SAM: Well, I like boats, but we could just teleport. 
LAURA: That'd probably be a better way-- 
SAM: Rather than fixing a boat with trees. 
TRAVIS: I haven't fixed a boat in 45 years. 
MARISHA: How, you, it'd be so fun, you guys! 
LIAM: How long will it take you, Chet? 
TRAVIS: Depends on the size of the boat, and the shape that she's in. 
LAURA: What's the fastest you've ever a repaired a boat? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I mean it's not about speed, Imogen, it's about quality! 
LAURA: But it kind of is, because it's the end of the world. 
TALIESIN: No, this time it is about speed, it's absolutely about speed. 
TRAVIS: I would have to give you an estimate upon sight of the vessel. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: I mean, for all of us. What do you think? We would probably just need a raft that's 10 feet by 10 feet or something. 
LAURA: Yeah, something like that. Yes, because we're not, we don't have any goats or-- 
TALIESIN: You do the thing where you put a shower head on it and the pressure from the shower actually pushes the whole thing. 
MARISHA: We might as well go check it out, who knows? 
TRAVIS: Some of these move up, while others move down-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, it makes no sense. 
TRAVIS: -- and others move in. 
MARISHA: Why, why, why? 
MATT: "The nature of the destruction of Domunas, the landmass that became The Teeth, was in a tumultuous destruction of the final elemental titans on Exandria." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "The mass of their annihilation left a perpetual churning elemental energy throughout the shattered islands that has never calmed. So they are ever changing, moving. No one knows why, or for what purpose if there is one. But it also makes it difficult for it to be put onto paper. It also makes it difficult for people to want to brave the dangers of the fog curtain and to drag us into external politics,  which is fine by most of us who live here." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: The islands are alive? 
MATT: "I don't know if they're any more alive or less alive than any other place in Exandria. Exandria is alive, in a way." 
LIAM: Right, but the mountain I grew up on doesn't move much. 
MATT: "Maybe it has a little bit more life than others." 
TRAVIS: I'm sure the, all of these islands are just as safe as the one that we landed on. But Evontra'vir, the tree, is there, are there any peoples that protect it or stand watch over it that we would need to be wary of, or introduce ourselves to, or send a note in advance? 
MATT: "Not a note, there are society." (laughs) My god. 
MARISHA: Constant. 
SAM: You won't get a note. 
MATT: (laughs) "The Ossended Host is the largest presence on the island of Kalutha." 
TRAVIS: What is it? 
MARISHA: The Ossended Host. 
MATT: "The Ossended Host." 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: "They were the first inheritors of The Teeth after the sundering. The Host, they're fishing villages and simple people so live with and off the land. Then they also have larger societies and cities like the mighty walls of the city, Revespire, and Ruukvaya. Another bigger island, I believe currently south of here?" 
MARISHA: Ruuk... 
MATT: "Ruukvaya." 
TRAVIS: Revespire. 
MATT: "But they are good people, very protective of their cultures and their lands. So come with an open heart, respect, honesty, and perhaps they will be welcoming." 
SAM: Would you come with us if we went to this other island or are you just sending us on our way? 
MATT: "I, this is my home, and if I am not here, those who might need of me and come to find me, they would not see me and be left to the dangers of this island without our guardianship." 
MARISHA: How often do you get visitors? 
MATT: "I get a few a year, maybe. Some stay for months, some stay for a few weeks, some a few years, depending on what they have to work through, so it varies." 
SAM: Wow. 
LAURA: Do you have anything from the Evontra'vir? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MATT: "I do not think I do." 
LAURA: Anything from that island, perhaps? 
MATT: She starts rummaging through the chest and more trinkets begin to fall. "I do not know. These are just things I have recovered from those who have either given me things as a gift, or for trade for some of my furniture, or I found washed up on the stony beaches. So I unfortunately, I do not know. Why?" 
LAURA: Oh, if we do have to teleport there, it's far easier to succeed with that if we have something from that location, or if we have a very strong description, it would certainly help. 
MATT: "There are many beautiful green trees everywhere around it. There are three big mountains." 
LAURA: Three big mountains, that's good. 
LIAM: Does that map, I didn't get a good look at it. Chet, does the map show that the traveler has been there? 
TRAVIS: Nope, up to where the island used to be, that's a strange stop in the middle of the now ocean up to Shardborne to this elbow and out to the burned edge. But we're supposed to go over here, not hitting the Vermilion Reef, which is a floater of danger, that our ship will definitely avoid. 
MARISHA: It feels bad, right? 
MATT: "You say this teleport is not fully safe?" 
LAURA: Well, eh, I think every time we've tried it, almost, we've almost been ripped into tiny little pieces. Definitely taken quite a bit of damage from it. We get there eventually! 
LIAM: Yeah, it hurts a little sometimes. 
LAURA: But it hurts quite a bit. 
MATT: "Well, you could get a-- If you want to take time to make repairs to boat, you could do that." 
TRAVIS: Sky whale! Sorry. 
LAURA: I know I could sky whale. 
MATT: "You could try flagging down a Wanderman ship, the trade ships that occasionally go through if you want to try and get their attention. That could, I don't know how much time that would take, if you have how many weeks?" 
TALIESIN: We are on a time-- 
SAM: It's a weeks-long journey to the other island? 
MATT: "No, the journey from here, it shouldn't be too much different from where there was on the map, so I think maybe by boat, two to three days." 
TALIESIN: That's not bad. 
LAURA: (mumbling) I think we should just teleport. 
MARISHA: Well, I mean-- 
TALIESIN: We got a few. We've got a while before-- 
SAM: We've never been there. 
TALIESIN: -- the machines can be-- 
MARISHA: We've never been there, and also it seems like magic is even more weird here than it has been in Exandria. 
LAURA: That is true. 
TRAVIS: Sky whale. 
MARISHA: What if we get booped into the middle of the ocean? 
SAM: Where do we-- Oh yeah, because what if we try to teleport to the island, and the island's moved? 
MATT: "If you do try to flag down a Wanderman ship--" 
SAM: Yeah, where would we go to do that? 
MATT: "Go to, there are safer inlets on the northern shore and one to the southeastern shore." 
TRAVIS: Here and here. 
MATT: "Yes." 
TRAVIS: We are somewhere over here, I assume. 
MATT: "Closer to the lake. We're a little bit south of the lake." 
TRAVIS: The little lake or the big one? 
MATT: "The big one." 
TRAVIS: The big lake. 
ASHLEY: So we're pretty close to the middle. 
TRAVIS: So closer to the northern inlet. 
LAURA: Got it. Thanks, Chet. 
MARISHA: I didn't see a lake. 
MATT: "You didn't go far enough." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: "But you can, if you go along the way. I do not know how long it would be for the Wanderman ship to go by. If you do go, they'll likely take you on where you want to go with enough gold into the captain's hand." 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: "But do not flash too much wealth, because you're likely to find yourselves waking up beneath the reefs." 
TALIESIN: That'd be unfortunate for them. 
MATT: "If you want, hmm, there is a more immediate option but it's a bit dangerous." 
SAM: Oh, what's that? 
LAURA: We're always down for a little danger. 
MARISHA: Is it the sky whale? 
TALIESIN: You said the secret word for them. 
MATT: "Oh, no, I would not recommend that." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: "Let me see. Hold on." She starts going through her stuff again. 
TRAVIS: That just means she hasn't tried it, okay. She's young. 
MARISHA: Yes, you know. 
MATT: Goes underneath this large club falls off to the side and she puts it back. "For protection." 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: Pulls out this intricate looking brass compass with gems embedded in it. It's got a crack on the glass, but it still holds there. "(uncertain noise) It--" 
LIAM: We might just be that desperate. 
MATT: "You seem fairly capable." 
SAM: Very. 
TALIESIN: We give off that vibe, yes. 
ASHLEY: Very, very, very capable. 
MATT: "This is the lost compass of the dread Captain Novos." [wooden chair sliding] 
SAM: Who? What? [wooden chair slam] 
TALIESIN: Wow. That happened. 
ASHLEY: The dread captain who? I didn't hear. 
LAURA: Chet is very excited. Lost compass of the dread pirate what? 
ASHLEY: Dread captain? 
MATT: "Novos." 
ASHLEY: Novos? 
MATT: "Now most islands of the Teeth, as you know, are on the move and the wild magics mess with normal navigation tools. So experienced ship captains keep a collection of compasses. Many of them are attuned to different islands." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: "Some of them have collections of dozens if they want to have all of the islands capable. This compass once belonged to Captain Urlu Novos." 
ALL: Urlu Novos. 
MATT: "Urlu, U-R-L-U, Novos, who was a notorious privateer from Wildemount that once terrorized the Host under the Wanderman's banner. His reign of terror was eventually, briefly brought to an end, about a hundred or so years ago, I believe, by a Host ambush. They distributed his and his crew's loot as trinkets and prizes. But it seems that he made some sort of a dark deal and now him and his ship haunt some of the waters--" 
LAURA: (gasps) He's a ghost! 
MARISHA: Ghost ship? 
MATT: " -- seeking to recollect what they lost." 
LAURA: (gasps) Ghost ship! 
MATT: "So curses and pacts that resemble these tales speak to binding compulsory summons when marked objects fall into their realms." 
LAURA: We could call upon the ghost ship. 
MATT: "I would surmise that placing this object within the waters, they would--" 
MARISHA: They'd come up? 
MATT: "Come to try and claim it." 
SAM: A ghost ship would come? 
MARISHA: But they'd be mad at us and they would want their compass back. 
SAM: Can we give it back to them? 
LAURA: We could just talk to them. 
TRAVIS: I take a small block of wood and I start feverishly starting to copy the compass. 
MATT: "Well, taking the ghost ship, the Crimson Abyss. It might be an impossibility. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: "As its existence is reliant on the captain's will and the crew's curse. However, even the most haunted beings play by the rules that bind them. A captain of renown like Novos is open to powerful allies or mutually beneficial arrangements, so." 
TALIESIN: Who cursed him? 
SAM: So we can summon a ghost ship and challenge him to an arm wrestling match or something? Or offer him a bunch of gold, or--? 
MATT: "I have not met him. I do not know. But maybe?" 
TALIESIN: Who cursed the ship? 
MATT: "I do not know. They returned. Either they were cursed or they took a deal." 
LAURA: Like a motorcycle outside. 
SAM: I hope it's a motorcycle. 
ASHLEY: It was coming. 
SAM: Oh, it's gone. 
LIAM: Grog's got gas. 
MATT: "Now--" 
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Sorry. 
MATT: "Exciting as it might be, it is also a very dangerous option. If time is of the essence, maybe it's important. You could also try for your dangerous teleporting as well." 
MARISHA: It's dangerous because of ghost pirates that would come and try to kill us. Is that why? That's why. 
MATT: "I would consider that possibly dangerous. But maybe you don't." 
LAURA: Maybe they would love you. 
MARISHA: I know! 
LAURA: I mean, who's more charming, right? 
MARISHA: Maybe I could get a little pirate wench outfit, you know, and be like, "Ooh!" 
TALIESIN: Maybe just-- 
ASHLEY: Mmm. 
MARISHA: That's as far as my idea goes. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LIAM: What are the odds on teleporting? 
SAM: I mean, they're probably-- 
LAURA: Didn't we get a warning about magic being strange here? Because we talked about teleporting here to begin with. 
TRAVIS: Can I use my Hunter's Bane to just get a feel of this compass she's holding? 
MATT: Oh, you mean the object? 
MARISHA: This place is weird, right? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, the object. 
MATT: Yeah. You can do that. Go ahead and roll for me. Roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier for me. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: Natural wolf prowess. 
TRAVIS: 13. 17. 
MATT: 17. Okay. As you reach out and touch the compass that she's holding, you feel your blood in your veins run cold for an instant then you see flashes of a tumultuous storm. You see a ship with holes blasted in it from cannon fire. You see sea spray over the sides of a listing boat as men scream and you see shadows of other ships surrounding it. You see a bearded dwarf, face scarred, bitter and angry, frothing at the corners. Blood splashed on one half of his face, shouting his fury to the very gods themselves. You see him make some sort of curse to the sky. You don't hear the words, you just see his lips move, as (impact) a bolt catches him in the forehead and he falls to the deck, blood pooling behind him. As he lies there looking up, his mouth curls into a smile. A shadow takes the memory and you pull back from the compass. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Yep. It's a pirate ghost ship. And it would be awesome. 
TALIESIN: Can't believe I'm about to-- 
SAM: It's about a 25% chance of getting there successfully. 
LAURA: That's if the magic is not funky dunky here, because it's-- 
SAM: That's right. 
TALIESIN: I like the 30% chance with the ghost ship, personally, at this point. 
LAURA: I love the idea of a ghost ship. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's five percent more. 
TRAVIS: Plus, if it goes wrong, we just have to work on the ghost ship forever. 
MARISHA: (excited noise) 
LAURA: Oh. Like we'd be forever cursed to be ghosts as well? 
TRAVIS: A dread pirate, you know? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think that's-- 
SAM: Or we have to come up with something that we can offer this dread Captain Novos. 
TRAVIS: Laudna. 
MARISHA: (giggles) 
LAURA: Maybe they want some cookies. 
SAM: I can start baking. 
ASHLEY: Can they eat? 
LAURA: I don't know. 
SAM: I can make ghost cookies. 
TALIESIN: Maybe they just want to be asked what they want. 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LAURA: We'll just ask what he wants. 
ASHLEY: We can all provide many services for them. 
SAM: Oh? What can you provide? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Well. 
LAURA: Ghost orgy. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Have you ever interacted with this dread Captain Novos? 
MATT: "No, I have not. This was actually given to me by an individual that was coming to me for help. They came across it and they felt that they were constantly being chased. So they gave it to me for safekeeping to alleviate them, knowing that I would never leave." 
TRAVIS: Got it. Yeah. 
MARISHA: A ghost ship. 
TRAVIS: So whenever it hits the water. Toot, toot! Goes the steamboat. 
MARISHA: Steamboat Mickey. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LAURA: Toot! Toot! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Awooga. 
LIAM: Has anyone ever encountered this ship and its crew and survived to tell the tale? 
MATT: "I do not know." 
MARISHA: I mean, if the people who dropped off the compass-- 
SAM: That's one. 
MARISHA: It's at least one. 
LAURA: Let's do it. What do we got to lose, you know? 
TRAVIS: Our lives. 
LAURA: We're all going to die anyway. Let's do it. 
MARISHA: It's a little true, right? 
LIAM: Sold. 
MARISHA: Speaking of, Jidana. About the whole-- 
LAURA: Zhudanna? 
ALL: Jirana. 
MARISHA: Sorry. You remind me of this old lady. 
TRAVIS: ♪ My Jirana ♪ 
MARISHA: I'm combining things. 
LIAM: Rhymes with piranha. 
MARISHA: Speaking of this tree that tells you how you die. 
TRAVIS: Can tell you. 
MARISHA: What happens if... you've already died? 
MATT: "I do not know." 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: "It's less that it tells you how you die, but offers the path to the end that you're walking. This tree is uniquely seeded between life and death and its roots reach to the fates of many." 
LAURA: Awesome. 
MATT: "So it can offer guidance in many ways. Just be wary the questions you ask because not all the answers you may have been wanting to hear." 
LIAM: Okay, well. I guess we're going to hail down a ghost ship, yeah? 
LAURA: Let's go do it. 
SAM: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Ashton, you feel okay with this? 
TALIESIN: I am delighted. 
TRAVIS: That was effusive. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: We've been taking a short rest this whole time? 
MATT: Oh, you've had tea and everything. Take a short rest. 
TALIESIN: There was a Titan who died here. Is that what happened to this place? 
MATT: "There were two Titans." 
TALIESIN: Did they have names? 
MATT: "They did. I have to--" She begins to look through her book. As I look up my notes. 
TALIESIN: It's okay. 
MATT: (laughs) ♪ Let's find it here ♪ 
TALIESIN: It's a lot of books in this place considering it's a toad. 
MATT: I know, I know, I know. 
TALIESIN: Very impressive bookshelf. You learn a lot about a person by what they've got on their bookshelf. Some people don't have any books on their bookshelf, that says a lot about them. 
MATT: "Rau'shan, the Emperor of Fire." 
TALIESIN: Rau'shan. 
MATT: "And Ka'Mort, the Empress of Earth." 
TALIESIN: Of Fire, and then what's the other one? 
SAM: Ka'Mort? 
TALIESIN: Empress of Earth. 
MATT: "Ka'Mort." 
SAM: Like Kamordah. 
TALIESIN: Ka'Mort. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: The Empress of Fire? 
MATT: Kamordah, the city where interesting earth and geo-- 
MARISHA: Volcanoes. 
TRAVIS: And Rau'shan. 
MATT: The city was loosely named off this Titan. 
TRAVIS: Rau'shan was the who? 
ASHLEY: The Emperor of Fire. 
MATT: Rau'shan was the Emperor of Fire. 
SAM: No relation to Raishan? 
MATT: No. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Who's that? 
MATT: There are many names in Exandria. Some of them sound similar, because, that happens. 
TALIESIN: Ancient tongues-- 
LAURA: Many names sound similar. 
TALIESIN: Things have roots, even if you don't know them anymore. 
MARISHA: And Ka'Mort was the Empress of what? 
TALIESIN: Earth. 
MARISHA: Oh, okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Want to make sure I got those right. 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: "You have a dangerous journey ahead of you. Just a moment. I dabble in my free time with interesting herbal remedies and things." She goes back to this rack in the back chamber. Reaches up and knocks something over, immediately shatters on the ground. 
TRAVIS: No! 
SAM: Mending. Mending. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'll try to mend it. Sure. 
MATT: The jar mends. Contents are still spilled on the ground. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Aww. 
MATT: She's like, "Eh." 
TALIESIN: You have somewhere to put it now. 
MARISHA: Exactly. Yes. 
TRAVIS: (slurping) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Pulls down a couple of these jars with a red thick material inside. Puts them into a little open piece of material. She's making a little care package, essentially. 
SAM and LAURA: Aww. 
MATT: Puts a couple of small, thick, brackish-looking vials in there, sets them inside. There's a yellowish bottle. You can't tell if the glass is yellow or the interior liquid is yellow. Puts that in there. What looks like an empty vial. But as she sets it down in there, it's giving off a little bit of light in the vicinity. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: Closes it up and comes over. "Who would be the--" 
TRAVIS: Oh yes. No, thank you so, so much. 
MATT: "Sending you off with two of my best reef moss balms." 
TRAVIS: Reef must bombs? 
LIAM: Reef moss bombs. 
TALIESIN: Is that like a donut? 
ASHLEY: ("Hot Cross Buns") ♪ Reef moss bombs ♪ 
MARISHA: I know. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I could do with a reef moss balm right now. 
TRAVIS: Two reef moss balms. 
MATT: "Reef moss balms." 
LIAM: (imitating recorder playing "Hot Cross Buns") 
MATT: A bottle of slickshimmer oil. 
MARISHA: Slickshimmer oil. 
ASHLEY: Slickshimmer oil. 
MATT: "They do not look like the most delicious, but those greenish-yellow bottles, they should help you recover wounds quickly. The balms, slowly." They're greater potions of healing. 
LAURA: Ah! 
MARISHA: How many? 
MATT: Two of those. 
LAURA: Oh, balms. 
TALIESIN: Two greater. 
MATT: Balms. Are the reef moss balms. 
TALIESIN: Two greater. 
MARISHA: Oh, balms? 
MATT: B-A-L-M. 
ALL: Balm. 
MARISHA: I was thinking it's a dope little bath bomb. 
TALIESIN: You throw it and go (whoosh). Oh, it fizzes. 
ASHLEY: (explosion) 
MATT: "That one that looks empty is a vial of cleansing flame." 
LAURA: Was ist das? 
MATT: "The balms you put onto someone who is wounded a bit and over a short period of time it will recover some of their wounds. The slickshimmer oil, when put upon your body for a time, makes you a little easier to deflect certain weapons from your skin. Or to be grabbed, you are a bit slippery." 
MARISHA: Cool. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: "Those brackish potions help you recover health quickly and the vial of cleansing flame, you throw it at somebody and it burns them a little bit but also cleanses them of a number of maladies that might be holding them." 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
SAM: Like a curse or something? 
LIAM: More like Icy Hot. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's totally-- 
TRAVIS: Maladies of a venereal nature. 
MARISHA: It's totally Icy Hot. 
LIAM: "Oh my god it stings! It stings-- oh." 
MARISHA: "Oh, this is nice." 
MATT: That's very much what it is, yeah. (laughs) "Hopefully these will be helpful." 
SAM: These are amazing. Thank you. 
LAURA: Yes, thank you so much. 
SAM: You know, while we've been here, I've baked you a few tea cookies. 
MATT: "Oh my goodness! I do not have bakery goods here very often. It's been decades at least." 
SAM: Oh, well, they're fresh from my stomach. 
MATT: "Very strange, but I appreciate it." 
SAM: Hey, and we're in a stomach right now so it's like double tummy. 
MARISHA: It's very, very meta. 
TRAVIS: Double tum. 
MATT: "Double tummy." 
TALIESIN: Tummies all the way down. 
MATT: "You are extremely funny for a small metal person." 
SAM: Well, thank you. Also, like you, I dabble in therapy and helping people. If I'm being honest, I don't think I'm very good at it. 
MATT: "What makes you say that?" 
SAM: Well, I haven't really helped anybody. I'm good at healing immediate injuries and wounds and that sort of stuff, but I'm not very good at... I'm sort of getting the feeling that I haven't really existed as a person and so I can't really identify with a lot of human feelings. 
MATT: "Is this true?" 
TALIESIN: I mean, there are definite truths in there, yes. 
LAURA: But I mean-- 
SAM: Don't sugarcoat it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. No, it's true. 
LAURA: FCG, you've had a lot-- You experience all the same emotions that we do. 
SAM: I'm starting to. 
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe it just is going to take a little bit more experience. 
TALIESIN: Like riding bike. 
ASHLEY: You freak out sometimes. 
SAM: I do. 
TRAVIS: Fear. 
ASHLEY: That's a real thing. 
TRAVIS: Passion. 
MARISHA: Stress. 
SAM: I just feel like-- 
ASHLEY: Stress. Yeah. 
SAM: You know, when I talk to someone like you, you've lived such a life and you've had so many, as you said, ups and downs that you can share your wisdom and knowledge with people and help them get through what they're going through. I'm starting to realize that I don't have any of those experiences and so it's hard to really-- 
MATT: She reaches forward and this massive, ancient turtle woman cups your head in her massive calloused hands, rings adorning the fingers, She holds your head and looks into your eyes in a way that is welcoming and forgiving in a way that you haven't really felt, especially with somebody that you just met, as she looks at you with this gentle smile. "I can see within you that you carry deep grief as well. I do not think that you are incapable of helping others, but you also have to let others help you, too. Perhaps your friend is not the only one seeking this tree." 
SAM: Oh. Oh, I need the help, too? Oh. Okay. Thank you. 
MATT: "Maybe in time, if you wish, you can come back and we could talk for a bit." 
SAM: Like a session? 
MATT: "If you'd like." 
SAM: That would be wonderful. Yeah. Maybe I'll take the ghost ship back when we're done. They'll probably ferry us back and forth wherever we go, right? 
TRAVIS: Probably. 
SAM: We'll be besties by the end of the journey. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you'll be best mates. 
SAM: They'll love us! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. It's going to be fine. 
SAM: We're weirdos. They're ghosts. We'll get along great. 
TRAVIS: (unconvinced) Mm-hmm. 
SAM: All right, yeah. I'll come back. Thank you. 
MATT: "I've done nothing but tell you things you probably already knew and just wouldn't believe yourself to hear them." 
SAM: I'll remember that. 
TALIESIN: Definitely, we said it several times. Just definitely-- Just glad it took finally. 
SAM: She's so wise. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MATT: "Sometimes the closer you are to a person the harder it is for your words to penetrate their shell." 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
LIAM: Preach. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Very good. 
TRAVIS: What's your secret to such long life? Do you have a tea that you enjoy? Any herbal remedies? I'm just looking to get as much mileage out of this bitch as I can. 
MATT: "You said that out loud. I understand." 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: This bitch. 
SAM: This bitch meaning his body. 
TRAVIS: This vessel. 
MATT: "Oh, I misunderstood." 
SAM: His body. He's not talking about-- 
TRAVIS: I zip the tracksuit. This bitch. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
SAM: Yeah, he doesn't, he would never-- 
LAURA: Chet is about the same age potentially as you are actually. 
SAM: Unless Chet's years are different. Your 400 years is really like 1,200 years or something? 
TRAVIS: No, I think I was-- I think-- I don't know. 
LIAM: I also lost track. Did you just pull gnome skin apart and show wolf fur or pull wolf fur apart and show a gnome chest? 
ASHLEY: Tracksuit. 
LAURA: Or just his tracksuit. 
TRAVIS: Whatever you want, baby. Yeah, just tracksuit. Just velvet. 
TALIESIN: Tracksuit part to show gnome fur. 
TRAVIS: Because I keep it tuned up. 
ASHLEY: Velour. Velour. 
TALIESIN: A lot of it. 
LIAM: Or maybe the chest looks the same with both versions. 
TALIESIN: It kind of doesn't change. 
MARISHA: He is a very hairy man. 
TRAVIS: The wolf requires a high metabolism. 
TALIESIN: Velveteen. 
LIAM and LAURA: (snicker) 
MATT: "Well--" (laughter) 
SAM: Well-- 
MATT: She grabs a small vial off the side of her little herbalism corner and goes-- 
LIAM: Let me show you the back of the toad. 
MATT: Puts this into your hand and closes your fingers. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: Leans in to your ear and goes, "This is for stamina." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM and LIAM: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not a-- It's not normally something I-- 
MATT: She just pats your hand. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TALIESIN: I love her. 
TRAVIS: For the fight. For the physical fight. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's for your fight? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I mean, it can be a little bit-- 
MARISHA: She just gave you a weird pill cocktail you can get at 7-Eleven. (laughter) 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: 12-Hour Energy. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Redline. Okay. 
LIAM: "We never give up on the fight." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Redline. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Were you there when that happened to me in-- No. Never mind. I don't know if you were there in Texas when that happened. 
MATT: "Well, if you do have this teleportation ability and you need to know the place, you've now seen my home. If ever you need to return for guidance, an ear, you know how to find me." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Aw. 
LAURA: Maybe it'll work because you're not on an actual island. Maybe it's different bamfing into Toriz's mouth. 
MATT: "It is a home." 
LAURA: Yeah. Thank you. 
MATT: "Of course. I don't know how Teleport works, so you tell me otherwise." 
LAURA: (laughs) Honestly, we don't either. 
MATT: "Maybe best the ghost ship is done then." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "But good luck. I'm always so bad at saying goodbyes, but--" 
LAURA: Just a see you later then. 
TALIESIN: See you again. 
MATT: "Until the next time you come and visit." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out salt and pepper shakers that I borrowed from the museum heist. 
MATT: Hmm. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: You seem to be a collector as well and I just, I don't know, I just thought you might need to add these to your collection. 
MATT: "Oh. (chuckles) Thank you very much." 
ASHLEY: You're welcome. 
MATT: "You've already brought me many flavors I've missed in some time, so I appreciate that. In my age, it's the simple things and joys that really give meaning to your day. Thank you." 
ASHLEY: Of course. I mean, you'll probably break them immediately, but that's okay. 
TRAVIS and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: "Well, you've already fixed one jar, I can just--" 
ASHLEY: We can just keep fixing it. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
LIAM: What happens to all the stuff when your house jumps? 
MATT: "Oh, it's all hooked and bolted." 
LIAM: Oh wow. 
MATT: She goes and grabs some of the paintings and pulls on it and you see it-- (thuds). 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: "It causes quite a ruckus." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Earthquake-proof. 
LIAM: You just cupboard up the teapot and everything and that all stays wedged in? 
MATT: "Mm-hmm." 
LIAM: This place is so cool. 
TALIESIN: I know, I'm making notes. 
ASHLEY: I love it. Love it. 
MARISHA: It's a dream. 
MATT: She goes, "Well, I mean--" She points to one of the rings on her finger and she takes one of the cups and shatters it on the ground and then puts her hand out and the ring mends it. 
SAM and LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Well, that's great. 
MATT: "I spend a lot of my time fixing." 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: I understand. 
TALIESIN: Good to have a hobby. 
LIAM: Neat trick. 
MATT: "Another gift somebody gave me." 
LAURA: That's a great gift. 
MATT: "It's been very, very helpful. (laughs)" 
ASHLEY: What a wonderful life you've put together for yourself. 
MATT: "I am rather fond of it and I get to meet some of the most interesting people." 
SAM: Well, we'll say hi to Keyleth for you. 
MATT: "Please do." 
SAM: I guess we have a date at the water? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: The shore. 
MARISHA: To the shore. 
TALIESIN: To the shore. 
SAM: Will you point us in the closest direction of the shore? 
MATT: "I could take you there." 
SAM: Great! 
LAURA: Oh! Oh yeah. I'm going to grab hold of something. 
MATT: "Hold tight! There are--" and she points out seven different handles around the chamber. 
LAURA: How convenient. 
TRAVIS: That doesn't seem necessary. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to scoot back to wherever she's sitting and hold on. 
MATT: You all clutch on? 
TRAVIS: No. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Toriz, to the north shore!" And gives a pat pat on one of the walls and you all hear and feel this (low grumbles) (thumping) 
TRAVIS: Oh yes. 
LAURA: You're surfing it. 
TRAVIS: The subway. 
TALIESIN: Wait for it. Wait for it. 
LAURA: Surfing subway. 
MATT: (heavy impact) There's this massive jolt. (laughter) 
MATT: All of you are (smack) to the floor or the furniture holding on. Then it gets lighter. 
LIAM: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: The vomit comet. 
MATT: (rising) (heavy thud) (rising) Up again. 
LAURA: Oh god! I'm going to throw up. 
MATT: The planters are shaking. (heavy thud) (whoosh) A third time. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: (wails) (laughter) 
MATT: She's just going, "(maniacal laughs)" 
SAM: Oh, god! 
MATT: Laughing the whole time like Willy Wonka in the tunnel. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: (heavy thud) One final impact, and you all take a minute. Your hair thrashed, a deep breath. You can see bits of furniture have broken and cracked. She stands up a bit. "We're here," and adjusts some of the sweat on her face. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
TRAVIS: There's furniture sticking it out of my arm. 
SAM: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: (moans) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Chet, you're already bleeding everywhere. 
TRAVIS: It's okay. 
TALIESIN: It's becoming a-- 
TRAVIS: It's okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "We'll stay here behind the tree line and I guess let us know if you need help." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Thank you. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MATT: "Of course. Good luck." 
LAURA: (laughs nervously) 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
MATT: "Toriz! (knocks)" Hits the floor. You see the opposite side where the entry doorway, it's not even-- There aren't doors but you see there's an open doorway where it would lead outside and it's just pitch black. Now you can see the lips from the inside of the mouth curl open. (deep shifting) 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Beyond that, you can immediately see these clusters of trees and these little sand, it's dark black sand and pebble paths that lead to what you can already hear is a nearby breaking shoreline. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: All right, let's go. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hang back-- 
LIAM: Let's go rustle up some ghosts. 
TRAVIS: Let's do it. 
TALIESIN: -- as everyone leaves, just a second. I wanted to wait to ask. How do you grieve if you don't know what was taken from you? 
MATT: "Mm. Often, you don't focus on the loss and try and concentrate on what you've gained since. Maybe answers will come in time. Maybe they won't. And it will never go away." 
TALIESIN: That I've figured out. 
MATT: "But it only weighs as much as you're willing to give it. Perhaps you fill yourself with a happier weight." 
TALIESIN: Well, I guess we'll see how broken I am. Ah. 
MATT: "I'm perpetually surrounded by broken things. Everything can be mended, given time." 
TALIESIN: That could be true. Thanks for FCG, too. Oh god, we'll bring him back. You're going to-- 
MATT: "(laughs) I look forward to it." 
TALIESIN: (sighs) Cool boat! All right. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: As you collect Ashton and begin to step your way towards the fog shrouded shoreline, clutching the odd cracked compass within your grasp, the shadow of the massive toad behind you, its mouth curls to a close. We'll finish the episode there. 
TRAVIS: What the hell? 
TALIESIN: Yay. 
TRAVIS: That was sick. 
MARISHA: That was so dope! 
TALIESIN: Time for ghost pirates now. 
LAURA: We were in a fucking frog! 
MARISHA: It doesn't matter! 
TALIESIN: Yar! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: Super fucking sick. 
MATT: Yeah! 
LIAM: Bye, toad. 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
MATT: (laughs) That was fun. 
LAURA: We should spend the whole rest of the campaign inside the toad. 
SAM: I know. 
TALIESIN: I want to live in a giant toad. 
TRAVIS: It's mouth, a living room?! 
MARISHA: I want to live in a toad! 
MATT: Yeah, dude. She's my favorite Miyazaki NPC. 
TRAVIS: Oh, wow. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Was that like the snail in "Dr. Dolittle"? I'm trying to remember. They lived in a snail shell. 
TRAVIS: So good. 
LAURA: So cool. 
TALIESIN: Or "James and the Giant Peach." This is cooler than a peach. So much cooler than a peach. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Peach was bullshit, though. 
MATT: I haven't thought of that in a long time. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: Love y'all. Thank you so much. 
LAURA: Love you, Matt. 
MATT: Well, we'll pick up there next episode. Thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. 
ASHLEY: No, it's not. 
TALIESIN: If you lick the wall, does it get weirder?
