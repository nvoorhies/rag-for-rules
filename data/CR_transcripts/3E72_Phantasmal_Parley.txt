MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (garbled) We play Dungeons & Dragons. 
MATT: Wow. Our first sponsor for the evening is Warner Bros. Games. 
TRAVIS: Warner Bros. Games! 
MATT: And their new game, Mortal Kombat 1! 
TRAVIS: Mortal Kombat 1! 
MATT: Sam. 
SAM: Mortal Kombat! 
LAURA and ASHLEY: ♪ Do do do ♪ 
SAM: -- 1, is the latest game in the acclaimed Mortal Kombat franchise developed by NetherRealm Studios. You can't look at this. There's secrets. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Stop cheating. 
SAM: In it-- 
MARISHA: What the-- What the fuck am I doing?! 
SAM: In it, discover a reborn-- 
TRAVIS: Stop! 
SAM: -- Mortal Kombat universe created by Fire God Liu Kang, featuring reimagined versions of iconic characters along with a new fighting system, game modes, bone crushing finishing moves, and more! To celebrate Mortal Kombat 1, which launches September 19th-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, nice. 
SAM: -- I thought today we would play a quick game that I'd like to call Mortal or Nortal. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Nortal? 
SAM: Where you win if you correctly identify characters from past Mortal Kombat games. I need two players. Who is going to volunteer? 
MARISHA: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Ashley Johnson. 
SAM: This is not scripted. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do it, I'll do it. 
SAM: Okay, Ashley and who? 
ASHLEY: Because I got called out. 
MARISHA: Me. 
SAM: You just-- 
LAURA: You know it! You know it! 
SAM: You know too much! 
LAURA: Travis is in it. 
MARISHA: I don't know this franchise. Cool, we'll do Travis. 
TRAVIS: No, I'm in it I can't do it. Somebody else. Over there. 
LAURA: I don't know anything about it. 
SAM: Okay, Ashley and Laura. 
MARISHA: You didn't specify people couldn't participate. That's unfair! 
SAM: Okay, here's the rules. I will list some names, you buzz in and tell me which is the real Mortal Kombat character and you will win a point. Now, we don't have buzzers, so to buzz in, you must say: Get over here! 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Or: Finish him! Or: I am Sub-Zero, not Captain Cold! 
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's not a catchphrase. 
TALIESIN: Fake fatality, okay. 
SAM: Okay. Are you ready? 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Round one. Who is the real Mortal Kombat character? Mokap, Creed Aventus, Jovan Musk, or Toy Boy? 
ASHLEY: Get over here! 
SAM: Okay, who is it? 
TRAVIS: Oh, good buzz in. 
ASHLEY: Creed Aventus. 
SAM: Is the real one? 
ASHLEY: Sure. (laughs) 
SAM: Incorrect. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Laura, would you like to steal? 
ASHLEY: Shit, I think I know what it is. 
MATT: I know-- 
LAURA: Get over here! Toy Boy. 
SAM: Incorrect. Those are both men's cologne brands. (laughter) 
SAM: As is Jovan Musk. Mokap is the correct-- 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Dang it, I was going to say that! 
MATT: It's just a dude in a Mokap suit. 
ASHLEY: I was-- 
LAURA: Awesome! 
MATT: It's not awesome. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Round two! (laughter) (laughter) 
SAM: But Mortal Kombat 1 is. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. Round two. (deep) Round two. Here you do that. 
MARISHA: Round two. 
TRAVIS: That was dog shit. 
SAM: Thank you. Now I'll list three-- 
MARISHA: Trivia. 
SAM: Now I'll list three real names. Which of these four is fake? Ready? Nightwolf. Daegon. Afrojack. Meat. 
LAURA: Get over here! 
SAM: What is it? 
LAURA: Daegon. 
SAM: Incorrect. 
LAURA: Ah! 
LIAM: Oh! (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's crazy. 
LIAM: Tricksy. 
ASHLEY: Finish him! 
SAM: Yes, Ashley? 
ASHLEY: Um. (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Meat? (laughter) 
SAM: Incorrect. 
ASHLEY: Dang it, I had a feeling. 
SAM: The answer is Afrojack. He's actually a Dutch DJ and he's 6'10". 
MARISHA: Oh, is he really? Wow. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right. 
SAM: Round three. Someone please get one right. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: He's 6'10"? 
SAM: I will list guest characters from past games or the upcoming MK 1 game. Tell me which one was not a guest character. 
LAURA: Wait, a guest character on what? 
SAM: They have guest characters come in to-- 
TALIESIN: No! 
MARISHA: Like cross-- 
TRAVIS: Previous ones have been like Robocop. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Don't tell them! 
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. 
LAURA: Okay. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I think I actually know this. Okay. 
SAM: Omni-Man. Rambo. Shazam. Skeletor. 
LAURA: Get over here! 
SAM: What is it? 
LAURA: Shazam. 
SAM: No. 
LAURA: Damn it! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (intense groan) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go with-- 
LIAM: You got to buzz in. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Uh, I am Sub-Zero! (laughter) 
SAM: Yes, Ashley. 
ASHLEY: Omni-Man? 
SAM: No! 
MARISHA: He's in the upcoming one. 
LAURA: Is it Rambo? Is it Rambo? 
SAM: No. 
MATT: Ashley, you ruined it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Have you ever seen Skeletor in Mortal Kombat?! 
LAURA: I don't know! 
LIAM: It's Skeletor, you boob! 
LAURA: I mean, the other ones! 
TALIESIN: Skeletor should be in Mortal Kombat. 
LAURA: Skeletor is awesome! All I could picture was Skeletor. 
LIAM: Next time. 
SAM: There was no winner, so I will get the prize. The prize was reading the end of the ad. Moral Kombat 1 launches September 19th on PS 5, Xbox Series S/X, PC, Nintendo Switch, or upgrade to the Premium Edition to start playing today which includes the Kombat Pack 1 featuring Quan Chi, Ermac, and Takeda along with guest characters Peacemaker, Omni-Man, and Homelander. 
LAURA: Oh, it's right there.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. Last we left off, Bells Hells had traversed across Exandria in an instant at the behest of the Voice of the Tempest to one of the many islands that make up the Shattered Teeth. From beyond the fog curtain, they landed upon the island of Slival. Upon wandering through the strange dense forests and black rock cliffs and beaches you encountered strange, flying, frog-like, pixie creatures. You befriended some, and requested a bunch to shit on you. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: That's right. 
MATT: You found out about a guardian upon this island in hopes maybe they could guide you to your individual of interest, The Shore Shrew. 
ALL: (mumbled) Shore Shrew. 
MATT: You, at the request of these creatures lit a massive bonfire at one of the hilltops, which called the attention of a dangerous, sightless beast that began to attack Chetney and the rest of the group. 
TRAVIS: Fucking rude. 
MATT: In defending them and trying to gain control of the battlefield, a massive shadow grew in the sky where a incredibly large, blackened toad creature slammed into the ground and revealed itself to be the living abode of, indeed, Jirana, The Shore Shrew that you were seeking. After managing to knock away the creature of danger, you were invited into her home and answered a number of your questions, presented some possible opportunities to get to your destination, the island of Kalutha. You decided the best route was to take an enchanted compass that belonged to a dread captain who runs a ghost ship. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: After taking a moment to rest, enjoying some tea and some light conversation the toad homestead bounded across the island and has just deposited you on the island shore, the northeastern shore, to find the rest of your journey. So here you have stepped out from the mouth into the midday, fog obscured light. You can hear the ocean waves crashing and can see just beyond the edges of the tree line there, where the water curls up along the beach and then pulls back and away. 
LIAM: Somebody-- 
SAM: We have the-- 
LIAM: Somebody got that compass? 
SAM: -- the compass. 
TRAVIS: I got it. 
SAM: Want to dip it? 
TRAVIS: I've also whittled an exact copy, you know, just in case we need to pull a switcheroo or whatever. 
LAURA: So smart. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You realize-- 
TRAVIS: I sure am. 
TALIESIN: You do realize that when you put your exact copy into the water, it's going to float. Right? 
TRAVIS: Well, yeah. 
LAURA: It's more so if we want to steal the compass back and escape, I think. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I think, how's the weight differential here? I'm sure-- 
TRAVIS: It's a little significant, but, you know, they're ghosts. 
ASHLEY: Like how significant? 
SAM, LAURA, ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: So you know, it's just going to fall through their-- 
MARISHA: That's fair. 
TRAVIS: -- hands. Right? 
TALIESIN: I'll give you that. That's okay. That's okay. 
MARISHA: Also, even if we wanted to steal the compass back isn't their a whole deal that they're like, "Wah-ah, my compass," and they keep following the compass. 
LAURA: Forever. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, unless things get really weird I'm perfectly okay with keeping it. 
SAM: Wait. They follow the compass forever? 
TRAVIS: We're literally making up the rules right now. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's not backed by science or experience. 
LIAM: Those rules are very defined. 
LAURA: The guy who owned the compass previous to Jirana said that he had been chased by them. They were trying to get him because he had it. So he pawned off on her-- 
SAM: So they want it back. 
LAURA: -- and for some reason, they didn't go after her. 
TRAVIS: That's what she's going to say. 
SAM: She's landlocked. 
MARISHA: She's landlocked. 
LIAM: That house is moving. 
MARISHA: They chase it when it's on the water. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Probably hard to catch. 
MARISHA: You got to be in the water. But then, remember, they were also, she also said that he's looking around for all of his lost treasure and that's part of it. 
LAURA: Let's call him up. 
TRAVIS: We also got to keep our eyes out for some beef serpent named Esquala or something, I can't remember. 
LAURA: Beef serpent? 
TRAVIS: Reef serpent. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: With an R. 
ASHLEY: Musk. 
TALIESIN: Reef. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Reef musk bombs ♪ 
TRAVIS: Reef serpent. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, that's something else, I'm sorry. 
TRAVIS: Although, beef serpent's not that bad. Okay, here comes the compass. Is it open or is it a lid to it? 
MATT: This compass, actually, it looks in shape and size like a larger sea navigational compass. It has an additional layer that clasps over it that you can see elements of it both adjust with a magnetic directional point but it doesn't have any numbers scrawled on it. As you know, a number of these compasses are specifically enchanted to lead to a specific location. So it's less about figuring out where you are and more the direction your target is. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
LIAM: Wait-- Oh, ugh. Oh. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: Can I do an investigation, or can I really closely analyze the compass for any initials or notches or pictograms or anything? 
MATT: Certainly. Make an investigation check. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Once we get the ghost ship here, what do we, how do we convince them to do our bidding? Will they just obey us? 
TALIESIN: I think that we'll have to come-- 
TRAVIS: 17. 
TALIESIN: -- to some sort of mutually beneficial-- 
SAM: We have money. We have money, right? 
TALIESIN: They don't want money. Well, I assume. I don't know, maybe ghost money, I don't know. 
SAM: Laudna, what do ghosts like? 
TRAVIS: Booty. 
MARISHA: Closure. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Booty? 
TALIESIN: Who doesn't like closure? 
SAM: It's sad. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: 17 on the compass check. 
MATT: It's definitely weathered. The brass exterior of it has a number of scrapes and gash marks. There's a little crack on the glass, but it seems to still be functioning. 
SAM: (heavy exhale) 
LAURA: (heavy exhale) 
MATT: You don't see any initials on it, but you do see that it looks like it was probably crafted initially to just be a compass and then had elements added to it before the enchantment was placed within. That's as much as you can tell. 
TRAVIS: If we're facing towards the eastern ocean, is that correct? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Facing east. Which way is it pointing from where we are? 
MATT: From where you are, it's pointing in a southeastern direction. 
TRAVIS: Southeastern?! We're down by the Shattered Teeth. Wow. Crazy. 
MARISHA: Maybe he lost it amongst the Shattered Teeth. What if we just follow where the compass is for a little bit? Maybe we'll find the hidden treasure and then we can use that to barter. 
SAM: Follow the compass? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Because the compass isn't-- As our brains indicated, usually is enchanted to a single-- 
MARISHA: Specific location. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's got to be pointing at something. That's fair. Is it pointing at something? Spin around in a circle. 
ASHLEY: Spin around, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Turn around. 
SAM: Can you turn it to something else? 
MATT: It definitely seems locked in a direction. 
LIAM: It stays fixed? 
SAM: But can you move the dial, to select a different direction? 
LAURA: Wait, what? Do you know how compasses work? (laughter) 
SAM: Nope! 
TRAVIS: FCG, normally a compass reads north, so you know which direction you're pointing. 
SAM: But you said it's pointing southeast. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's pointed at a specific enchanted location. 
MARISHA: Above the table, Matt Mercer literally just said it's enchanted to point to a place of interest. 
TRAVIS: A place of import. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That they want. 
LIAM: Let's talk about this. (laughter) 
SAM: All right, fine. 
TALIESIN: What's on the map in that direction? 
MARISHA: That island. I mean, it's where we need to go. 
SAM: Kalutha. 
LAURA: What if we just-- 
LAURA: But how are we going to follow it? We can't swim in the water. 
SAM: They're going to give us a ride. 
TALIESIN: Maybe they want to go there, too. 
TRAVIS: Literally nothing. We're over here somewhere, right? 
SAM: Southeast is-- 
TRAVIS: Southeast is that way. 
TALIESIN: Are you sure? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Because maybe the map's upside down. 
TRAVIS: The words are like this. 
TALIESIN: I'm fucking with you. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What if you do this and do this? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Then this appears. (laughter) 
SAM: Do we have-- We have a pocket dimension, right? We have a hole? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: We have a hole full of dead people, yes. 
TALIESIN: That fucking reminds me, we got to clean that up. 
LAURA: Oh, let's not open that up. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. We've got-- (laughs) 
LAURA: We need them. Wait! 
SAM: Oh, I was supposed to talk to the dead people. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: While we wait, let's call the pirates. While we're waiting for them to arrive-- 
TRAVIS: No, I think they'll show up fast. We put the talking part first. 
LAURA: We should talk to the dead people, then call the dead. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: You think the ghost people will come that fast? 
TRAVIS: Probably. They're ghosts. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
SAM: All right, we'll pull out the dead bodies. But I was going to say, after we call the pirates, why don't we put the compass in the hole because then they can be like, "Where's our compass?" And we can be like: "We don't have it anymore. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (feigned ignorance) 
SAM: It's not on this plane of existence. You can use your magics, but you won't find it. 
TALIESIN: And then what? 
SAM: And we'll only give it to you if you take us to our destination. 
TRAVIS: Oh, FCG, this is dastardly. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: A bit aggressive, but all right. I think that's good. 
SAM: You taught me well, Ashton. 
LAURA: You don't think we can just charm them? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm taking it. 
SAM: We could charm them, too, but-- I don't know. 
LIAM: We're going to summon them and then, with this thing that they're intent on. 
SAM: Yeah, be like: We have it, but we won't give it to you until-- 
LIAM: What if they feel it in their intangible undead bones-- 
SAM: They can't if it's in a different dimension. 
LIAM: But aren't we going to call them with it first? 
SAM: Yeah, we'll call them and then put it away. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: But once they get the call, they're going to be like, "How'd you call? "You got my cell phone." 
SAM: No, we can say we had it and we'll give it back to you, but with our crazy sorcery, it's not here right now. 
TRAVIS: Look, we made an amazing one-for-one replica. We've definitely gotten our eyes on it. 
ASHLEY: We'd just be like-- 
SAM: That's proof that we know what it looks like. 
ASHLEY: -- it's right here. It's right here. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Who's got the red? Who's got the red? (laughter) 
LIAM: Who's got the red? 
TALIESIN: I feel like they're the seeds-- 
LAURA: It's a great idea. 
TALIESIN: -- of a decent plan here. 
LAURA: Let's talk to dead people. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Break out that hole! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right, are we near water or-- 
LAURA: What are we even supposed to ask these dead people? 
SAM: I don't remember who these guys are. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, who did we kill? 
TRAVIS: It's all the Grim Verity that we beat, right? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. 
MATT: The Grim Verity? 
MARISHA: Ratanish and stuff. 
TRAVIS: Or-- 
LAURA and LIAM: No. 
MATT: Ruby Vanguard? 
MARISHA: Paragon's Call. Right? 
LAURA: Ruby Vanguard. 
TALIESIN: Paragon's Call. 
TRAVIS: Whatever the red color's-- 
TALIESIN: There's also General Ratanish is in there, too. 
SAM and LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we were going to talk to him and be like, "What's your plan?" 
TALIESIN: Then we are going to put that body in the ocean and let it go away. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: A proper burial at sea. 
TRAVIS: So they can come back later. 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
SAM: All right, pull them out, Ashton. I'll get my spell ready. 
TALIESIN: Are we near water or anything or-- 
SAM: We're right at the water. 
TALIESIN: All right, all right. 
LIAM: That's where the frog deposited us. 
LAURA: Yes, all right. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to find somewhere flat-- 
LAURA: What was I going to say? 
TALIESIN: -- where the water, the tide's not going to-- 
SAM: I don't know! 
TALIESIN: I assume there's somewhere flat that the tide's not-- 
TRAVIS: Don't have it prepared? 
MATT: There is a stretch of-- 
SAM: I have it prepared. 
MATT: -- darker beach that-- 
LAURA: No, I had something that I was about to say-- 
MATT: -- stretches for about 20 or so feet before it hits the water. 
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah. I don't want to be one of those-- 
MARISHA: Maybe it'll come back. 
TALIESIN: -- terrible videos. All right. 
TRAVIS: You literally forgot what you were about to say? 
TALIESIN: Flatten it out and I'm going to take everything. 
LAURA: Like 10 minutes ago. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take them out. 
MATT: Oh, I see what you mean. For the hole. 
TALIESIN: For the hole. 
MATT: For the hole. 
LIAM: You need a flat surface. 
MATT: You have to search a bit and find a bit of sea-worn rock where it's not a perfectly flat surface, but it's just enough of a flat surface that it bends over and creates the hole. But it takes you about an hour to find the right place for it. 
LAURA: Could we flatten out some sand? 
TALIESIN: I was going to say. We can pound sand or no? 
MATT: (sighs) Sand, unfortunately, is porous. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MATT: It needs a relatively a majority contact with a specific flat material. 
TALIESIN: No, respect. 
MATT: So I'll say you do find a rock that it's been battered by the ocean and up to the point where it has a smooth space, so you can finagle it and make it work. 
TALIESIN: We also have a pair of boots that have never been identified in there. 
SAM: Oh, I can do that as well. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. They were fancy. 
SAM: Oh, can I? 
TALIESIN: So, well, we can wait if we need to. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to open it up. I'm going to pull them out. I'm going to take off as much, all the armor and otherwise, and-- 
SAM: Make them look real sexy. What am I asking these guys? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
LIAM: Oof, they're ripe. 
MARISHA: You have five. 
LAURA: What's your plan? 
SAM: I have five questions. "What's your plan?" 
LIAM: "What were you doing with Imahara?" 
MARISHA: Well, we know that though. 
TRAVIS: "Where's Ludinus?" 
LIAM: But for what? 
MARISHA: He was making weapons for the Paragon's Call. 
SAM: We know where Ludinus is. He's on the moon. 
ASHLEY: Brumestone nullifiers or something like that? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I guess we'll just see if there's something else. 
TRAVIS: Are those items that we got from Jirana in the inventory? 
MARISHA: Let's see what else. 
MATT: They should be. 
TRAVIS: We can add them? Okay. 
LIAM: "Did you like being a member of the Paragon's Call?" 
SAM: "What do they pay?" 
ASHLEY: Maybe you could say like, "What were you having Imahara Joe make explosives for?" I don't know. Or something like that. Did we already know that? 
MARISHA: Well, because they were doing-- 
SAM: They were blowing up the skyships. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
MARISHA: They were blowing up ships. 
MATT: To remind you, dead creatures are not compelled to tell the truth, especially if they identify you as an enemy or a hostile, so-- 
SAM: I'm going to be really sweet to them. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
SAM: Oh, we could put on-- Do we have any Paragon's Call robes? 
LAURA: I could style my hair like my mom. 
TALIESIN: You can just blindfold them. 
SAM: You could. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
SAM: You could be your mom. 
TALIESIN: Never mind, that's better. 
ASHLEY: That's a good idea. 
SAM: That's really cool. 
TALIESIN: I like that. 
SAM: Do we-- 
MARISHA: I can make a Minor Illusion. What if I illusion your mom and puppet her. 
LIAM: A little mom? 
MARISHA: And then you talk. 
SAM: Like you move the mouth and you talk? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: That seems like it'll work. 
LAURA: That's definitely way better than just styling my hair. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
SAM: We just style your hair and put you in some of their robes? 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: What does she wear normally? 
LAURA: Just regular clothes. Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. Not like red? 
LAURA: I don't think she was in red. 
MATT: No, last you saw her-- 
LAURA: She was in a trench. Wasn't she? 
MATT: She was wearing a dark brown trench coat, yeah. 
SAM: Do we have one of them? 
TALIESIN: I do have a-- It's a little much, but it's a sleeveless black trench with a red inter-- 
LAURA: Yeah, let's switch it out. I'll put it on. 
TALIESIN: Into it. (grunts) 
MATT: (chuckles) 
LAURA: Hair in a braid. 
SAM: Laudna, help her with her hair. 
MARISHA: (uncertain murmurs) 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: And then... 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You can stitch a skull into a rat and this is a problem. 
MARISHA: I did, I wasn't around little girls for a long time, but I don't know how to braid, really. 
SAM: Should I do the main guy, General Ratanish, or one of the underlings? I feel like we should practice on one of the underlings. 
LAURA: Underlings first? 
SAM and LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Yeah, that's not a bad idea. You can do a couple of-- 
SAM: I think a couple of folks. 
LIAM: How many do we have? 
LAURA: I don't have any idea what the fuck I'm asking about. 
SAM: That's okay. 
LAURA: It's just like: Hey, it's me. 
TALIESIN: Who are they working for? 
LAURA: What are we doing? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: "I'm your boss. Tell me what my plan is." 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I mean, think about it. 
TRAVIS: "What was I last doing on the moon when you saw me?" 
SAM: All right, I will cast the incantation. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: I will raise the spirits of the dead-- 
TRAVIS: You are so good at this. 
SAM: -- and speak to one of the underlings. Please forgive me for corrupting the fates, Changebringer. I'll cast the spell. 
MATT: Okay, is this someone of the standard, nearby, bruiser types? Is this the druid? Which bodies did you take? 
SAM: Oh! Druid sounds good. They might know some stuff. 
TALIESIN: We took everything that was a problem. 
MATT: Right, but which body are you doing? 
SAM: Druid, I'll do druid. 
TALIESIN: Pull the druid out, I imagine. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: They least know some stuff. 
TALIESIN: I'll take the other. Yeah, I'll drag them-- 
SAM: Oh, let's all hide so she only sees-- 
LAURA: Oh, so it's just me. 
SAM: Druid. I mean, you. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: All righty. So you pull over the druid, its body broken from the impact of plummeting from the sky in its final moments in Bassuras, the jaw open in this agape, terrified final moment expression of pain in the eyes. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. 
MATT: Still wide, if the muscles themselves are lax. Stench already isn't great. But you pull the body out onto the beach and you leave your incantation, and you watch as the mist that's rolling by, some of it seems to swirl a bit and gather before (air sucking) going into the open mouth. The druid's chest expands, the eyes (stiff creaking) look over and lock in with yours, and the jaw twitches, like it's trying to begin to make noise but has no purpose to yet. But the spell has taken hold. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: So you're standing there with me? 
SAM: Well, guess I had to cast the spell and now I'll quietly back away. 
TRAVIS: (wheel squeaking) 
SAM: Turn my attention to Imogen. 
LAURA: I'm going to look at the dead druid. You failed your mission. Where's Thull? 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
SAM: I should have-- 
ASHLEY: Guidance! 
SAM: -- given you some Guidance or something ahead. 
LAURA: Yeah, you really should have. 
SAM: This is why we practice. 
LAURA: 19. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: 19. 
LAURA: Oh wait, no. That's a lie. 21. 
MATT: 21. Okay. 
SAM: You deceived. 
LIAM: You really did deception. 
LAURA: You deceived. (laughter) 
MATT: The eyes-- (stiff creaking) 
ASHLEY: Double deception. 
MATT: -- shift over back to you, and you asked it? 
LAURA: Where is Thull? 
MATT: (dry, raspy gasp) "She remains at the Key." 
SAM: The Key. 
ASHLEY: Remains at the Key. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. Key. 
TRAVIS: Here at the wall. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. In my head, I will say to FCG: What the fuck else am I supposed to be asking about? 
SAM: They told me to ask about Ludinus, what was the plan? 
LAURA: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: Is-- (stammers excitedly) 
SAM: What else were we supposed to ask? 
TRAVIS: Predathos, Predathos. 
SAM: (pigeon coos) Predathos. What-- I don't know. 
MARISHA: Is it gaining strength? 
SAM: Yeah, is it time? I don't know. Timeline? 
LAURA: How many have come over? 
MATT: "I don't know. I saw a hundred or more." 
LAURA: Did you ever speak to Ludinus? 
MATT: "No, just watched him." 
SAM: What about the defenses at ground zero? I don't know why a-- 
LIAM: How much time is left? 
SAM: That's a good one, too. 
ASHLEY: That's a good one. That's a good one. 
SAM: (pigeon coos) (chuckling) 
LIAM: Just New York City pigeons-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hold it, Matt! 
LIAM: -- on this tropical island. 
TRAVIS: Hold that fucking face. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Tears start coming down. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: How much time until we strike? 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) A dead person's confused. 
TRAVIS: (continues laughing) 
LIAM and LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I don't know." 
SAM: Good, good. 
MARISHA: Was that three questions? 
LAURA: No, that was four. 
SAM: That was four. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was four. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: This is going about as well as it could go. 
LAURA: Did-- 
TRAVIS: Predathos. 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: What about Predathos? 
TALIESIN: What happened to-- 
LAURA: What about Predathos? I can't just ask: "So, Predathos-- 
TRAVIS: Is he loose? 
MARISHA: Is he gaining strength? 
TRAVIS: What's Ludinus doing next? 
MARISHA: Is he going to break free? 
SAM: What are Predathos' weaknesses? 
TRAVIS: What were they-- 
LAURA: So anyway, have you talked to Predathos? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Imahara Joe? 
LAURA: What about him? 
SAM: We know that already. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: I guess so, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Why are they blowing up the ships, though? 
MARISHA: Because they're resistance. 
LAURA: Because the ships are going to go attack them. 
MARISHA: We know this. 
TALIESIN: So cast right-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) We know this. 
LAURA: I'm just staring at you in your head. I'm just staring at you. 
MATT: "(choked rasping)" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) We can just leave it at four. 
LAURA: And just let him sit here. 
TRAVIS: What's the greatest threat? 
SAM: To our organization? 
LAURA: What is the greatest threat to our organization? 
MATT: "They've mentioned unity." 
LAURA: Unity. 
MATT: "Keep them scattered. (dry gasp)" (thuds) 
SAM: That was a good one. 
LAURA: That was good, that was good. 
MATT: The spell releases. 
LAURA: Jeez Louise. That was pathetic. 
MARISHA: I didn't get it. 
SAM: I didn't get the first couple words either, but it seemed like unity was-- 
LAURA: They mentioned unity. 
MARISHA: Unity. 
LAURA: They're trying to keep them scattered. 
MARISHA: Scattered? Okay. 
LAURA: So-- 
MARISHA: Is that why we got shunted? 
LAURA: Maybe. Maybe they're trying to cause dissension among the gods, the different-- 
SAM: Or keep the mortals from gathering and organizing, and that's why they're blowing up all these ships and-- 
LIAM: Stopping communication. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. We need to figure out a way to send messages to gather folks, like a chain letter. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: What's a-- 
SAM: You write a letter to one person. If they don't send it to 10, bad luck shall-- 
TRAVIS: Should we ask for a hidden-- 
ASHLEY: They die? 
TRAVIS: -- or secret way to the key? 
LIAM: Send a message? 
TALIESIN: There's some way that they're communicating. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, where's the secret entrance? 
TALIESIN: They have some way around. 
SAM: Oh yeah, do they have a way of communicating? 
TALIESIN: Clearly, they're organized. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, they are, aren't they? 
SAM: All right, if we raise up General Ratanish, why don't we do a little bit better planning on what we're going to ask? 
LAURA: Yeah, we probably should do that. 
MARISHA: Do we have another dead person? 
LAURA: Is there somebody else that-- I didn't think about the fact that why would I be asking the questions if I'm my mom? 
LIAM: Right? You're the boss. 
LAURA: Why am I asking them? 
TRAVIS: Because-- 
SAM: Maybe you can say-- 
TRAVIS: -- you drank a lot last night. 
SAM: Yeah, I was going to say you bonked your head and can't remember some of the details. 
ASHLEY: You're just making sure-- 
TRAVIS: As a good and dutiful soldier, yeah. 
TALIESIN: You're interrogating them. 
ASHLEY: You're testing. You're making sure he's-- 
SAM: Ooh, testing's good. 
TRAVIS: Before you bring them back. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 
TALIESIN: Proves that they know their shit. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Prove you know and then you can go on your merry way to death 
LAURA: Or back to life. 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Or back to life if you do a good job. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Back to death ♪ 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: ♪ Back to reality ♪ 
SAM: All right, we're going to ask them if they have any special means of communication. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LAURA: Yeah, thanks. 
SAM: We're going to ask them if they have any-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, thanks. 
SAM: -- special defenses at ground zero maybe? I don't know. 
LAURA: Sure, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Secret ways in or out. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: How do you get in and out of-- That's all we got. (laughs) 
LAURA: What about our secret entrances? Do you have them guarded? Should I act like I already know about our secret entrances? 
SAM: Yeah, of course. 
LIAM: Or maybe you could fudge it like you've been split off from their forces and are a little out of the loop? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah, that's why you would want to communicate. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Maybe something went wrong and you got shunted. 
LIAM: Right. You've been tied up with the Dawnfather's forces. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Something like that. 
LAURA: Sure. 
LIAM: But better. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Maybe if we ask the greatest threat again and specify unity. Do they mean the gods? Do they mean mortals? 
LAURA: Or I can be like, "Our greatest threat is unity." 
SAM: Clarify. 
LAURA: Clarify. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Unity of what? 
TRAVIS: Expand. 
LIAM: Don't you think-- 
TALIESIN: I would like a number. 
SAM: All right, we got four questions. The fifth question can be just potpourri. 
LAURA: I didn't write them down. 
SAM: I got them. 
LAURA: Okay, you feed them to me. 
TALIESIN: We can also ask what happened to the other two. 
SAM: Other two? 
TALIESIN: The monk and the other one. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: The dirt wizard and the monk. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah. 
SAM: Yeah, that's good. 
LIAM: Yeah, what happened to those two? 
SAM: Great, all right. 
LIAM: The Dwendalian Empire folk sniffing around. 
TRAVIS: Sad sacks of-- 
LIAM: Yeah, terrible. 
TRAVIS: -- allies. 
SAM: I will place my coin on General Ratanish's forehead and imbue in it-- 
LAURA: What am I starting? 
SAM: -- the magic of life, but brief life. 
MATT: Okay. 
MATT: The ruined torso of Ratanish lays sprawled out on this beach, the cold mist blowing through. As you put the coin to the forehead, that mist swirl happens once more and the chest rises. (groaning) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
MATT: (exhales) 
LIAM: Oh, that's right, did you jelly the head? 
TRAVIS: He's pissed even in death. 
TALIESIN: Chest is jelly; the head's fine. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: The eyes like (squelching). You hear the congealed liquid-- 
ALL: (sounds of protest) 
TRAVIS: You don't need to do it! 
MATT: -- straining against the dried eyes. 
TRAVIS: Jeez. 
TALIESIN: I am sitting behind this, just enjoying the view of the back. 
MARISHA: I know, I know. 
LIAM: Stupid, talented voiceover. 
MATT: "(strangled gurgling)" 
LAURA: Congratulations, you fell to a group of weaklings. Luckily, our master is forgiving. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: We can bring you back if you prove yourself. 
ASHLEY: That's good, that's good. 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
ASHLEY: That's good, that's good. 
ALL: You got Guidance. 
SAM: G-g-guidance! 
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry) 
LAURA: Okay, that's 11 plus nine. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LIAM: That's a 12. Eight and four is 12. 
LAURA: 12 plus nine. 
SAM: That's 21! 
LAURA: 21 again. 
MARISHA: Blackjack. 
TRAVIS: Plus five. 
LAURA: Because? 
TRAVIS: Because I'm naked. 
LIAM: Carry the three. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: He's just looking at you. 
SAM: You haven't asked a question yet, so maybe that's okay. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. In your head: What am I asking? 
SAM: Sorry, sorry. So, means of communication that they use. Secret ways of communicating-- (laughter) 
SAM: -- that they use. 
MARISHA: Over long distance. 
LIAM: You've been cut off, right? 
LAURA: Tell me how we communicate. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "The old fashioned way. This solstice has scrambled us all." 
SAM: The old fashioned way? 
LAURA: Yeah, just-- 
TALIESIN: Insight check. 
MARISHA: They don't-- 
LAURA: Yeah, insight check him. I feel like he's lying. 
TALIESIN: No. 
SAM: The old fashioned way is they sleep with each other. 
TALIESIN: Eight. 
MATT: It seems like a dead person answering a question. 
LAURA: Can I Detect Thoughts on a dead person that's being-- 
MATT: There is no conscious brain or mind here. This is a spell that is recalling memories and personality, but it's its own separate conjuration, so no, you cannot. 
TALIESIN: There's technically no one there anymore. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: The house is empty. 
MATT: This is the body remembering an echo of who once occupied it. 
LIAM: These are memberberries. 
MATT: Yes. "'Member a question you ask?" 
LIAM: 'Member Ludinus? 
SAM: We were going to ask them about any secret entrances or defenses. 
LAURA: Tell me how you've protected-- How we've protected our entrances into the Key. 
MATT: "We've manned them as requested, and the moon folk have kept eyes as well." 
SAM: Kept eyes as well. 
LAURA: As well. Is that what you said? Okay. 
LIAM: That's another question. 
LAURA: No! Oh no! Ah! 
ASHLEY: What was the first bit? 
SAM: I didn't catch the first part. 
LAURA: I didn't hear the first part he said, either. 
SAM: God, this spell is the worst. 
TALIESIN: It was, the soldiers have been moved, as you requested. 
LAURA: Oh. Great. Good. 
SAM: That was defenses. We got secret entrances, maybe? Or something about unity, specifically specifying who we're trying to keep un-united? 
LAURA: Goddamn it. 
LIAM: The Empire siblings? 
LAURA: You were in charge of keeping rebellions down, yes? That was a question, shit! Fuck! (laughter) 
MATT: "Partially." (laughter) 
LAURA: Fuck! 
MARISHA: Partially? Is he going to elaborate? No, he's not. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, fucking amazing. There you go. Stare him down, stare him down! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Boil him down! (laughter) 
SAM: Is this "Curb Your Enthusiasm"? 
TRAVIS: Here we go. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: Okay, okay. Shit! 
TRAVIS: A little crab. 
SAM: Then the monk and the wizard. Wait, was that three questions? 
TRAVIS: He didn't even answer. 
ASHLEY: That was three. We have two more. 
SAM: We have two more, so you can still press on about unity or secret entrances, or the monk and the wizard. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: Unity, entrances, monk and the wizard. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Which? 
MARISHA: I agree. 
LAURA: I don't know how to phrase, "Where are our entrances that are secret?" Do you know what I mean? 
TRAVIS: How would Jester phrase it? 
LAURA: I mean, that's fully-- I'm going full Jester. 
SAM: You're trying to get back there as fast as you can. You need to know where the latest secret entrances are. 
TRAVIS: You got separated. 
TALIESIN: That's assuming that they've been changing. It's tense in there. 
LAURA: As you can see, I've been separated-- 
TRAVIS: (fart sound) 
LAURA: -- from our forces. Fuck off. 
SAM: Right. 
LIAM: Your husband made a fart sound! (laughter) (laughter) 
LAURA: Tell me about our entrances into the Key. 
SAM: Please? 
LAURA: Can you? (laughter) 
SAM: She's become Yoda. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (like Yoda) Me want to the secret entrances, tell you? (laughter) (laughter) 
LAURA: This is the worst! 
TRAVIS: (like Yoda) Can you? (laughter) 
LIAM: (like Yoda) Monk and a wizard, do you? 
MATT: "You have many tricks up your sleeve." 
LAURA: Yes, I do. 
MATT: "The main pit entrance is easy." 
LIAM: Main pit entrance? 
MATT: "Otherwise--" Make a deception check again. 
ASHLEY: Still need Guidance? 
LIAM: He's putting two and two together in his dead skull. Come on. Come on. 
LAURA: Fuck, shit, balls, motherfuck, shit. 14. 
MATT: 14? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: "They were closed behind us as a precaution." 
TALIESIN: Insight. 
ASHLEY: Should I insight check him? 
SAM: Yeah, do it, do it, do it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was weird. 
SAM: Ashley's doing it, too. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: Monk and the wizard! 
LIAM: Nothing for me. 
LAURA: Everybody's is balls. 
ASHLEY: 17. 
SAM: What? 
ASHLEY: 17. 
SAM: You have a plus 13 on insight? Holy shit! 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: Oh, a whisper! 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh! Me? 
SAM: Guys, what do we have to plug? 
LAURA: God! 
SAM: What's coming out this week? Mortal Kombat? 
MARISHA: Queen by Midnight. 
TRAVIS: Mortal Kombat one-shot. 
MARISHA: Mortal Kombat one-shot. 
TALIESIN: Play the game, it's great. 
SAM: Queen by Midnight. 
TALIESIN: It's super fun. 
SAM: Queen by Kombat. Mortal Queens. 
LIAM: Mortal Queenbats! 
ASHLEY: I look at you like, get in my head. 
LAURA: I'm in your head. What? 
ASHLEY: He, I don't think, is being truthful. He's being a little sassy with you. 
LAURA: Yeah, I think he knows. 
ASHLEY: Which I feel like you probably picked up on. Okay. 
SAM: Intimidate him! 
MARISHA: Punch him in his dead face! 
ASHLEY: Say, I'm going to kill you! 
SAM: Punch him in his dick. 
TALIESIN: What the hell? What are we-- 
LAURA: Huh? 
TRAVIS: Pull part of your body with your dick, punch it. 
LAURA: I'm going to use my Mage Hand. I'm going to rip the head off of the dead body and bring it up in the air so it's looking at me in the eye. 
MATT: Tongue's kind of (lolling). 
LAURA: What happened to the two, the wizard and the monk? 
MATT: "Probably dead." 
LAURA: Just like you. 
SAM: You did so well. 
LAURA: That was fucking terrible! 
ASHLEY: You did really good. No, no, no, it was great. 
SAM: You did great! If it makes you feel better, why don't you take his head and use it like a skipping stone across the ocean? 
LAURA: I'm going to do that. 
MATT: (laughs) (thudding splashes) 
TRAVIS: Big monster's like-- (roars) (screaming) (laughter) 
MARISHA and LAURA: Don't go in the ocean! 
ASHLEY: Should we do the other one? 
LAURA: God! 
SAM: We're doing more? 
ASHLEY: Do we have another one? 
LAURA: No, don't make me do that again. Somebody else can do it. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to deal with some of this shit, anyway. 
SAM: There's nothing else to glean. 
LAURA: There's nothing-- 
SAM: These are low level punks. 
LAURA: But we do know that there were secret entrances. We just don't have the locations. 
ASHLEY: They closed-- okay. 
MARISHA: We know that there are soldiers and moon folk. 
LAURA: And a hundred strong had come over. 
MARISHA: And a hundred-- 
SAM: Reilorans. 
LAURA: Reilorans had come over. 
TRAVIS: That's the moon folk, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: They communicate the old fashioned way. 
LAURA: That's great. 
ASHLEY: By pigeon, I guess. 
SAM: Uh-huh. Telegraph. 
MARISHA: That Otohan Thull remains at the Malleus Key. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's good info. 
LAURA: That is good info. 
SAM: You did great! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go clean up our mess, if you don't mind. I'm going to bundle up whoever's left and grab the head and walk a little bit down towards the shore, and I'm going to remove the armor, and I'm going to start tossing the meat chunks into the water, and then I'm going to beat the metal parts until they are not recognizable as armor. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to throw them in the water, too. Give them a nice big throw. 
MATT: Got it. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait. 
TALIESIN: What? 
ASHLEY: Can you give me a couple of Ratanish's molars? Just a couple teefies. 
TALIESIN: Happily. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
MATT: Put down a couple of Ratanish molars in your inventory. 
LAURA: I did throw the head into the sea. 
LIAM: How'd you do that? She pulverized-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
TALIESIN: I thought you skipped it, you didn't-- I thought you skipped it down the beach. 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. 
ASHLEY: It's fine. 
MATT: Water's not too-- Well, it's kind of chilly. You can jump out there and grab it, if you want. 
LIAM: Look, it's like 15 feet out floating right over there. 
ASHLEY: I'll go grab it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: It came back in. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: All right, should we call the ghost pirates? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to need my jacket back. 
MARISHA: We call the ghost pirates by taking the compass and sticking it in the water? 
LAURA: Sticking it in the water. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Sure. I don't know anything about the sea. Is this a good place for a boat to land? I guess this is a ghost boat. It doesn't matter. 
TALIESIN: It's not like it's going to run ashore or anything. Let's make sure that we're a bit far-- 
MARISHA: This is a ghost boat. 
LAURA: How do we step on a ghost boat? 
SAM: The boat's real, but the ghosts aren't? 
MARISHA: Correct. 
LIAM: How is everybody feeling at the moment? 
MARISHA: I don't know, I'm just speculating. 
TRAVIS: That's true, that's true. 
SAM: You're an expert! You're dead! 
TRAVIS: Some of us are figgity-fucked up. 
LIAM: Hold up, hold up. Before we start to travel with more dead people, is everyone okay? Do you want to take a couple hours? 
LAURA: We took a short rest in the toad. 
SAM: We did. 
LIAM: Yeah. I'm good, but-- 
SAM: I'm good. 
MARISHA: I don't think I got messed with. 
TRAVIS: I don't think I did. 
TALIESIN: Let's see where I'm at. 
LAURA: I regained my spells from the vial. 
SAM: By the way, does anyone want that, what's it called? 
TALIESIN: We have a bunch of vials. 
SAM: Pearl of Power? 
LAURA: Yeah? 
MARISHA: We had tea. 
SAM: Do you want that? 
MATT: Short rest was inside the toad. 
LAURA: Oh wait, you have to attune to it. 
SAM: Yes, you do. 
TRAVIS: Did I not take it for a reason? I wasn't on watch or anything, right? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: I'll take it. 
LAURA: I think I'm full up on attunement. 
MATT: Go for it. You can do that as well. 
TALIESIN: I've got two rages left, I think. That's pretty good. 
LIAM: I can make flowers twice. 
LAURA: (laughs) So, not so much? 
LIAM: Mm-hm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm all right. I'll live. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: All right, let's dip the dip stick. 
MATT: He's doing his make up short rest here. 
TALIESIN: I assume that our little flat plane is close enough away from the water that we can get to the hole, since I haven't folded it up yet. We can get to the hole and toss the compass in there if we need. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: Chetney's having a sit down. 
TALIESIN: If we need. You're doing this? 
TRAVIS: Compass-- 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: -- of the Dread Captain Novos-- 
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake. 
TRAVIS: -- which is Sovon backwards. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Grant us-- 
LIAM: He cracked the code. 
TRAVIS: -- thy booty. Dip in the water. 
MATT: You place it into the water. Sploosh. You pull it out, and as the water drips off of it, where it hits the water, this renewed thick mist (billowing). 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: Billows out from where it made contact and spills out. You can see it gives this thick layer of low-hanging mist that begins to spread across the beachside in front of you. The fog, at this time of day where it burns back a little bit, you can't see the horizon, but definitely you have a better view of many of the rocks of the inlet. 100, 200, 300 feet out, it begins to close in even further. The temperature noticeably gets colder, and where it was a comfortable maybe low 60s, it almost immediately begins to crawl into the 50s, to the 40s. You begin to see your breath in the air. 
LAURA: Oh, he's got a bag of holding, right? 
TALIESIN: Oh, bag of holding. That's fair. 
TRAVIS: We've got two of them. 
ASHLEY: What happens if we put the portable hole? 
LAURA: We've got two holes! (laughs) 
LIAM: Do I hear anything through the fog with a 29? 
MATT: With a 29? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You hear nothing. 
LIAM: Except Imogen talking about her holes. 
LAURA: Sorry! 
MATT: Other than the adjusting of waves crashing on the shore, and the winds blowing through, you hear nothing. What you see-- 
TRAVIS: Oh boy! 
MATT: -- noiselessly, is a shadowed shape beginning to breach the distant fog bank that obscures and encloses your vision. You begin to see, as it cruises at an angle from the outer portion of what water you can see, the bow of a massive ship. As it begins to cruise up, you can see chains hanging off the side, some thick, like an overgrown moss that seems to cluster up this damaged ship as it continues to push through. You see masts come into view, the sails tattered and hanging in strips, and you see a handful of dark shapes along the bow as it silently approaches. 
SAM: Who's going to talk to these guys? 
TRAVIS: I got it. 
MATT: And closer. 
SAM: Let me give you some sort of a boost. 
LIAM: That was crazy. She said use the compass, and you used the compass, and they just came! 
SAM: I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on you and give you, what's it called? 
MARISHA: Charisma, the charisma one. 
SAM: Yeah, the charisma. Owl's Wisdom? Nope, that's not it. 
MARISHA: No, I think Cat's-- 
LIAM: Meow. 
SAM: Cat's Grace? Nope, that's dexterity. 
MARISHA: Which one do I think it is? 
SAM: Eagle's Splendor? Eagle's Splendor! 
MARISHA: Splendor! That's right. 
SAM: Charisma checks. You get advantage on all charisma. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: How about Guidance? Anybody? Guidance? 
TRAVIS: I get advantage? 
SAM: Advantage on like-- 
MATT: The ship-- 
SAM: -- deception and persuasion. 
MATT: -- curves-- 
LAURA: Yeah, they'll like you. 
MATT: -- along the-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: -- outskirts of the cove that you're at, the beach-- [wooden clattering] 
MATT: -- with the rocks. 
LAURA: Ah! 
ASHLEY: Get Laudna out there, too. [wooden clattering] 
LIAM: Cursed episode. M
MARISHA: I'll stand next to Chetney and take my ball gown and kind of like-- 
ASHLEY: Fix it! 
LAURA: I know! It's bugging-- You have to fix it. 
MARISHA: -- hike it up. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Putting it out? 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Putting out the vibe? 
ASHLEY: Matthew! (laughter) 
MATT: It's fine. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (shudders) 
LAURA: No, no! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It's going to ruin her. 
MATT: I'll fix it. (laughter) 
SAM: Yes! 
LAURA: You're terrible. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's because it's not-- 
LIAM: It's not straight! 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
LIAM: I guess that's right. 
MATT: The ship stops, and you can see mist pouring off the deck and into the water below to meet the mist that has been apparating from the space where you placed the compass. Immediately, about six of the shadowed shapes sploosh into the water. 
MARISHA: Oh, they can swim! 
SAM: Do they make a splash? 
MATT: And they vanish beneath the waves. 
MARISHA: They're ghosts who can swim! 
MATT: Four more (splashing). 
SAM: They all sink and drown. 
TALIESIN: The word you're looking for is-- 
TRAVIS: We can't swim! 
TALIESIN: We're going to be parleying. We're going to be talking. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: This is going to be a negotiation. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Mage Armor on myself, just in casies though. 
TALIESIN: Don't start shit. 
MARISHA: I floof up my hair. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Get the girls out. 
MATT: The water begins to break about 30 or so feet from where you are on the beach. 
ASHLEY: Fruit Roll-Up. 
MATT: The water breaches, and you can see figures walking through the waves. 
TRAVIS: Dope. 
SAM: Cool, cool. 
MATT: The rotted remnants of long-missing skin and flesh now left in thin lines across what is mainly skeletal figures wearing bits of torn leather armor and holding cutlasses and daggers at their sides as they emerge from the water. (splashing) 
LIAM: What the fuck? 
MATT: Four, six, ten of them, all marching up the shore towards you. 
SAM: Are they splashing the water, or they're just cutting through the water? 
MATT: No, the water is splashing. They are physical, skeletal creatures. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Splishes and splashes. 
TALIESIN: Do any of them have a head wound? 
MATT: You can see one of them that looks like it has a part of it was shot with probably a bolt of some kind. 
TALIESIN: Are any of them nicely dressed or anything? 
MATT: They all look pretty ragged. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair. 
LAURA: It was a bolt, though. 
MATT: You can see there are a few other handful of figures that are still on the ship back there. As they approach at a decent march, weapons out. The thick, briny waters spilling through the ribs that are exposed now to the open jaws, draining out of the empty cavities in the skull as they approach. This raspy voice echoes out from the ship beyond. "Take it from them. Leave them bleeding. Whatever they have is ours." 
SAM: We hid it, right? 
TRAVIS and MATT: Yep. 
MATT: I need you to roll initiative. (screaming) 
SAM: This combat is brought to you by WizKids Minis! Join forces with the Mighty Nein! 
TRAVIS: Not what I was expecting! 
LAURA: We didn't even parley! 
LIAM: What happened to the parley? 
TALIESIN: You didn't decide to say anything-- 
LIAM: Just take their haunted shit. 
SAM: Join forces with the Mighty Nein and take on the terrifying Uk'otoa. 
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa. 
SAM: Pre-order this behemoth today. Expand your collection of CR miniatures at wizkids.io. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
SAM: Wizkids.io/crminis or your local game store. WizKids Combat Cam, everybody. 
TALIESIN: Oh, we're going to beach them off so hard. 
SAM: Hey, look, we're back in Dalen's Closet. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: It's very picturesque here. I was picturing the coast of Seattle or something. 
TALIESIN: What? 
SAM: A little more gloomy. 
ASHLEY: Oh, what? 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
LIAM: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Come on, Matt, come on. 
LAURA: Oh, it's huge. Cool! Look at the anchor. 
LIAM: Level up to the WizKids boat. 
TRAVIS: The anchor's like a clawed foot. 
LAURA: That is a cool anchor. 
TRAVIS: A clawed foot! 
LAURA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: It's so rad! 
LAURA: Bring that fog in here! [fog machine beeps] 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Beep. 
LAURA and LIAM: (scatting) 
LIAM: Yeah, here comes the Seattle now. 
SAM: Thank you. I need it. 
TALIESIN: Well. 
MATT: So where are you amongst this beach at the moment? 
TALIESIN: We were a bit back. I mean, yeah. 
MARISHA: I'll be standing next to Chet. 
TRAVIS: About right here. 
MATT: Okay, so you would've been here. Chetney will be here. 
MARISHA: This is going to be great. 
TALIESIN: Where would've the big hole have been? 
MATT: The hole would've been up here, would be closest you would've had. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I would've been probably a couple-- I would've been a couple layers down there. Probably on that one with the little three rock-- 
MATT: Like right there? 
TALIESIN: No, the other way. 
MATT: Here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I will be next to the little stack of rocks. 
MARISHA: Make friendsies. 
MATT: All right, stack of rocks over here. Like that? 
LAURA: Sorry, closer in. 
MATT: There? 
LAURA: Do do do do. It looks like a little stack of rocks from-- Yeah! 
MATT: Oh, I see. Okay. Put you there. FCG? 
SAM: Oh, left of Chetney 10 feet. 
MATT: 10 feet there. 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: Orym? 
LIAM: Orym will stick with Fearne wherever she goes right now. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe we should, so we're not all-- Yeah. Maybe over here? 
MATT: Over here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: In the front or the back? 
ASHLEY: Maybe in the back. 
LIAM: Like over here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Like in this area. 
MATT: Over here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. How do we feel about that? 
LIAM: All right. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Orym's there. Mister out? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Why not? 
LIAM: Oh, boy. 
MATT: Mister there. 
MARISHA: Man, what do we do? 
SAM: Well, they're attacking us, so-- 
LAURA: We probably attack them back. 
ALL: Oh! 
LIAM: It's a lot of them. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: That's a-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: Oh, look at that gnarly one. 
TALIESIN: You have a bunch of-- 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Just reminding FCG. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yep, yep. I had a funny feeling. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: I knew it. 
LAURA: Oh. That's cute. 
TALIESIN: It's actually got a, yeah. 
MARISHA: It's wet. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: What is it? 
ASHLEY: It's poop. 
MARISHA: Feel it. 
MATT: That's horrifying. 
LIAM: Is it like kid slime? 
SAM: It's poop. 
LIAM: You're poop. 
MATT: All righty, so with that, 25 to 20. 
LIAM: 21. 
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, shit, sorry. I'm also 21. 
TRAVIS: Higher dex. 
MARISHA: Or Rollies. 
MATT: It's Orym. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: These things are clearly advancing menacingly? That's the deal here? 
TALIESIN: They sort of-- 
MATT: Ghost pirates don't show up to parley for the item that got taken from them. They take it. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: It's fine. We got a ghost ship. 
SAM: You've got advanced-- 
MARISHA and SAM: Charisma. 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
MARISHA: 16. 
TRAVIS: 15. No, 17. Sorry, so Chet, Laudna. 
TALIESIN: Also, you have Turn Undead and stuff, too, so. 
MATT: Okay. 15 to 10? 
TALIESIN: You're third? 
TRAVIS: 17. So Orym, Ashton, Chet. 
LAURA: 10. 
MATT: All right, so 10 is Imogen. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Where's FCG? 
SAM: I'm at six. 
TRAVIS: Fearne? 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Five. Taking up the rear. 
MATT: All righty. So with that, top of this is Orym. As they are marching forward weapons out. (snarling) 
LIAM: Okay, right off the bat, I'm going to scooch under Fearne's legs and switch her here. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: And say: You're going to light them up, right? I am going to give you an additional five to your AC, as long as you're close. You don't have to stay close, but you have it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll stay close. 
LIAM: Then I'll go to there. 
ASHLEY: Thanks. 
LIAM: I'll actually go and then I'll step in front of her further. Actually, going to scooch out real fast next to FCG. Then I'm going to slice the air towards the one in the lead and test them out. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: So this big tall one in the front. Yeah, I'll cut through the fog, hopefully. Natural 20. 
ASHLEY and MATT: Woo! 
SAM: Nice. 
LIAM: The second one will be a 15. 
MATT: All right, both of those hit. 
LIAM: Okay, so the first one-- 
TALIESIN: I'll be chilling with these ones there. Obviously, not the main course. 
LIAM: Yeah, not the main course. So just 12 for that because I'm not going to juice it up, and then the second one-- 
SAM: ♪ Juice it up ♪ 
LIAM: -- is a 10. So again, just a little exploratory slash at it. As soon as I cut the air like that, I'll hop right back in front of Fearne. 
MATT: Okay, so (slicing) and you duck back. The slices hit. (slicing) You see bones crack and break. One of the arms falls to the side for a bit, but holds on by a tether of some sort of leather strap and it continues to (disjointed shuffling) forward. 
LIAM: Okay. So not super slow or anything, just-- Cool, got it. 
MATT: Yeah. It looks like it took some heavy damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: It's holding on by a thread. 
LIAM: Okay. Next! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, finishing Orym's go. Ashton, you're up. 
TALIESIN: What does 40 feet look like straight into the fray, out of curiosity. 
MATT: 40 feet? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: 20 guys all in a row. 
MATT: 40 will get you about there. 
TALIESIN: Okay, can I get into melee with that one? 
MATT: With that one, you can. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to get into melee with that one and let's see what we got going! I'm going to rage. And, ooh, interesting. 
LAURA: It's so annoying. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: Because you can do so much damage, but-- 
TALIESIN: This will be a lot of fun. Well, I suddenly go a little translucent. So this is going to be fun. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: There's a hole in my head that goes straight through. 
SAM: There's a hole in my head. 
TALIESIN: Let's see. All right, I'm going to take-- I'm going to take a standard swing at this guy. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: 27 to hit. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: All right. Here we go. 
SAM: Come on, Ash. 
LIAM: Get the AoE out. 
TALIESIN: 17 points of damage. 
MATT: 17 points damage on that first hit. Crack! (raspy groan) It looks like it was a heavy hit and it's looking pretty hurt already in one strike. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit it again! 
MATT: Go for it. 
ASHLEY: What am I doing? 
TALIESIN: 15 to hit? 
MATT: 15 just hits. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, 15. Now we know. Cool beans. That's-- Oh wow, that landed. Well, okay. 
SAM: Oh, keep going. 
TALIESIN: 22 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
SAM: Nice! 
MATT: (annihilating crash) Just smashes it onto the ground. The rib cage breaks open. The arm wounds filter out. The weapon skitters a bit to the side. It is lying there in the still wet, mushy bit of the sand, just unmoving. 
TALIESIN: Is is that considered a creature kill? 
MATT: That would be, technically. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I fall into the water, straight down. 
SAM: What? 
MATT: (splash) 
TALIESIN: I show up right between FCG and-- 
SAM: Whoa, cool. 
MATT: And Orym? 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, right there. I come, yeah, I drop back down. 
SAM: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Next! 
LAURA: Awesome. 
MATT: All righty. That's great. 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
SAM: Amazing! 
LAURA: Tight, tight, tight. 
ASHLEY: (rapidly) Tight, tight, tight, tight. 
MATT: "Don't stop until you take what's mine." At the 20 count, you watch as the water begins to swirl. 
LAURA: Oh, no. 
MATT: (soft shifting) In this direction. It's like the beach front itself, a little bit of water there, is beginning to pour into this massive whirlpool. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Cool. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We're not quite in the water, are we? 
MATT: No. This figure over here on the edge of the ship leans forward with this high shrill screaming voice, "You heard the captain! Bring what he wants!" and pulls a moss-covered pistol, like a musket, and leans off to the side, a big blade at the side and-- 
ASHLEY: Mossberg. 
MATT: (gunshot) -- is going to take a shot. 
TRAVIS: Mossberg. 
MATT: Right towards you, because you're right up front, the one who was last seen holding it. Let's see. You are beyond the 60-foot, so it'll be at disadvantage on the shot. But with disadvantage, that'll be a 20 to hit? 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: All righty. It'll make its second strike on you as well. Second one will miss. But you take, ooh! Nine points of cold damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: When you watch, when it fires (gunshot), the muzzle flash is blue flame. (explosion) As it impacts you, ice freezes up along the front of your chest before it cracks as you move your body. 
SAM: Ouch. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: Glance up in pain and look around at the surrounding, and you can now get a better look at a lot of these skeletons as they emerge with these dull, blue burning points of light in their skulls as they emerge. As they step, you see the surface of the water seem to crack, like there's this blanket of freezing energy that's causing the water to slightly crystallize in their presence. 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
TRAVIS: All right. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: That finishes their turn. Chetney, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Sheesh! 
SAM: Come on, Chet. 
TRAVIS: I'm stoked. I will use-- Yeah, I'll use Minor Illusion to conjure a copy of the compass in my hand and I'll hold it up to the captain and I'll say: Call off your men! We know where your compass is! One of our party has gone to another island, but we need your ship to get us there. Take us and we will help you retrieve your item! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake. 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
ASHLEY: You also have Guidance. 
TRAVIS: Advantage. 
ASHLEY: I Guided you earlier. 
SAM: You have advantage on it. 
TALIESIN: Wow, yeah. 
TRAVIS: What's guidance, a d4? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, d4. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
TRAVIS: (excited warbling) 
MARISHA: (excited growls) 
TRAVIS: 13, 17. 18, 19, 20, 21. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: 21. 
TALIESIN: My god, the community theater worked. 
LAURA: That's with advantage? 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: With advantage. The other one was a natural one. 
LAURA: Yikes. 
SAM: Did you roll a one or-- 
MATT: Natural 20. (groaning) 
LAURA: Come on! 
TRAVIS: Plus stuff? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: (deflating tone) 
MATT: "That's fine! We'll find your friend. But we don't leave survivors." 
TRAVIS: They don't leave-- 
TRAVIS and SAM: -- survivors! 
MARISHA, LAURA, and LIAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Well, that's-- 
TRAVIS: That's all right. Your crew can stay here with us. I'll-- (creaking joints) (howling) I'll use my Hybrid Transformation to go wolf mode. 
MATT: You got it. 
TALIESIN: You're hungry like the wolf. You haven't had a sandwich. 
TRAVIS: Because I'm not in melee, I will break over this way, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. 
MATT: Right there. You got it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Let's go, guys. 
MATT: Laudna, you're up. 
LIAM: Let's go casters. 
MARISHA: All right. Looking at their undead bony forms, I crack and dislocate a few of my bones and go into my Form of Dread. 
MATT: (body tearing) Which looks like? 
MARISHA: You know, it's a little halfway between, you know, my tree form and my widow form. 
MATT: Okay, so a merger between the two of them. 
MARISHA: Mirroring them a little bit, too. Maybe I got some barnacles. I don't know. 
MATT: Cool. 
MARISHA: Then I'm going to Fireball them. 
MATT: Okay! 
LAURA: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: That's how it's done! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Just right there? 
ASHLEY: Boosh! 
MARISHA: Yep! 
MATT: You could-- Okay, yeah. So all those right there? (projectile explosion) 
LIAM: ♪ It's AoE ♪ 
MATT: Go ahead and roll for-- 
TALIESIN: Well, okay. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll for damage on that one. 
TRAVIS: Well, okay! 
MATT: That's a fail. Fail. 
LAURA: ♪ Ey oh ey ♪ (laughs) 
TALIESIN: ♪ Eh oh ey ♪ 
MATT: What's the DC? 
LIAM: 10 seconds later. Yep. 
MARISHA: 16. 
MATT: Fail. 
LIAM: That's my dumb joke. 
MATT: Fail. Fail. 
LAURA: Yay. 
MATT: Fail. Jesus, how many eights are they going to roll? 
LIAM: So many eights, Matt. 
MATT: Fail. Success. All right. So all of them failed except for that one tiny guy over there. 
TALIESIN: Some Rosencrantz and Guildenstern shit right there. 
LIAM: (sneering) Meh! 
LAURA: They are going to die. Destroy them. 
MARISHA: 26 fire damage. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: 26 fire damage. (one-by-one death thuds) 
SAM: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
ASHLEY: Let's go! 
MATT: They all just, in this explosion-- 
TRAVIS: Calm the fuck down! 
MATT: You watch the bones scatter out-- 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: -- from the detonation. (explosion) The mist is burned away in a minute before it all begins to roll back in to fill the space and they all crumble into piles of bone and armor under the waves as the ocean begins to almost drag them back out. 
TRAVIS: We also do a "Point Break"-like shock wave, like-- (slow-mo, theatrical explosion) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah, you see the water do that dip and then come back. Yeah, a little mushroom? Then, I don't know, are they immune to fear? 
MATT: They're all destroyed. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Didn't you say one--? 
MATT: There is one, there is one. You're right. 
TRAVIS: There's the little one. 
MARISHA: He's afraid of me. He's scared. 
MATT: Nah. He's immune to frightened, sorry. 
MARISHA: He's immune to fear. That's what I thought. Can I just as a-- 
TALIESIN: Oh no, I'm going to die. 
MARISHA: Shout to the captain in Shadow Cant and say: Sure you don't want to make a deal? 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
ASHLEY: Let's do it. 
LAURA: Yaas! 
SAM: Shadow Cant came in handy. 
MARISHA: For once! 
ASHLEY: Can I Guide her? 
MATT: You got to touch somebody to Guide them and it's your action to do it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: (laughs) But good for trying. 
TRAVIS: It's your action to do it. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Now I know. 
MARISHA: Natural 20! (cheering) 
MATT: For a total of? 
MARISHA: 24. 
MATT: 24. You now glance over and up here, you see the haggard- looking skeletal dwarf with this patchy, awful, mossy beard that hangs down, tucked into this breasted over long jacket. This hat brim that's burning, cleft up top. You can see his eyes are burning, these bright flaming blue balls that (whooshing) out from the front of the face. You see him holding this massive saber up and this gnarled-looking hand cannon in the other hand. Looks back and meets your gaze. "Well, let's have a chat," and he puts his weapons away. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: "The rest, kill them." 
TRAVIS: (groans) You can parley. 
MARISHA: Stick. (laughs) All right. 
MATT: Do you want to move? Or stay put? 
MARISHA: I'll skitter towards that way. I'll skitter that way. 
LAURA: So did he say, "The rest, kill them"-- 
LIAM: Kill us. 
MATT: 30 is there. 
LAURA: -- to us? 
MARISHA: Go back one. 
LAURA: About us? 
MARISHA: Go back one. 
MATT: There you go. 
SAM: He only wants to talk to Laudna. And I don't blame him! 
LAURA: They're parleying, so I shouldn't attack him? Is that what we're saying? 
SAM: They're going to attack us. 
TALIESIN: I think we have a couple more to deal with. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: They're going to get back up. They're not gone. He did not take them away. 
MATT: It is the captain's turn. The captain is holding his action. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: He has his weapons away. 
SAM: But he's doing it in a bitchy way. 
MATT: He's essentially waiting on the ship and doing a slight pacing back and forth as he looks over in your direction and over the rest of the field. He will, as a bonus action, do Command From the Grave. So he commands one crew member within 120 feet. This one here turns, goes into a full move. 30, up to you. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: Hears the captain goes, after shouting, "The rest, kill them," the one looks over (groans), looks over just past you and goes into an unnatural sprint. All of a sudden, this undead strength go through it. Comes charging over the beach. (snarling) Rushing up towards you and it's going to-- 
LAURA: Were you not close enough to attack? 
TRAVIS: Attack of opportunity? 
MATT: You were five feet away from it, so. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: 10 feet, technically. So it's going to take two attacks at you with its longsword. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Imogen, no! 
MATT: That's going to be 11. 
LAURA: Miss! 
LIAM: (gasps) 
MATT: And a 15. 
LAURA: Miss! 
SAM: Imogen, yeah! 
LAURA: It's the Mage Armor. 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
MATT: Your Mage Armor deflects it off to the side. (snarls) Up in front of you right there. That's going to finish the captain's turn. Now it is Imogen's go. 
LAURA: Ugh. I wanted to do something so much cooler than just fucking kill one little skeleton. 
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, that skeleton, anything could happen to that skeleton in the next round. 
TRAVIS: Get on up! 
TALIESIN: Just saying. 
SAM: Get up! 
TRAVIS: Hey Matt, just because I can't see it all, it looks like one person on the deck, one in a crow's nest, and the captain? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: For now. 
SAM: That we can see. 
MATT: That you can see, yeah. 
SAM: Could be more under in the hold. 
TRAVIS: (old sailor voice) More hidden behind the sail is what you're telling me! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: (old sailor voice) There could be more down below decks. 
LAURA: I know. 
MATT: Whatcha thinking, Imogen? 
TRAVIS: On the leeward side. 
SAM: (laughs) 
SAM: On the poop. 
LAURA: What if he attacks Laudna before I can-- 
TALIESIN: Hmm, interesting. 
TRAVIS: I love it when Taliesin says "interesting." 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: Oh shit, never mind. 
TRAVIS: Aw. 
LAURA: The rocks on the ground around me are going to start shaking and they're going to float up and start spinning around my head again. 
LIAM: ♪ Rocks ♪ 
MATT: (whipping wind) 
TALIESIN: ♪ Ah ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA and TRAVIS: ♪ Ah ♪ 
LAURA: And-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ ("Flash") ♪ 
TALIESIN: Thank you for that. 
LAURA: I'm going to bonus action push the skeleton away from me. 
MATT: Okay. Strength save, right? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: That is going to fail. Four. 
LAURA: All right, and then when I do that, two of the meteors are going to slam into him. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: All right, he gets a dex save for those? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) Two saves? Against each one? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: First one's a fail. Second one is also a fail. A four and an eight. 
LAURA: Okay, great. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: So that's 4d6 fire damage. 
MATT: (meteors impacting) 
LAURA: 11, 13... Was that a three? Let's go with that, it was a three. 16 points of fire damage. 
MATT: 16 points of fire damage. Bones splinter off. You can see a portion of where its armor was collapses inward and the metal's dented from the impact and the flames burn up the side. (snarls) It looks hurt, but it's still standing. 
LAURA: (groans) Can I move back and get up onto the rock behind me? 
SAM: Get up! 
MATT: Yes, you can. 
LAURA: How high can I get? Yeah. 
MATT: You can get up there, probably. 
TRAVIS: Does it look like it reacts any kind of way to the fire? 
MATT: It gets hurt by it. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: It doesn't seem like it's resistant to it, if that's what you were trying to ask. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so that finishes your turn, Imogen? 
LAURA: Yes, sir. 
MATT: All righty. So now, the one up here in the crow's nest. 
TRAVIS: Somebody jump in the whirlpool! (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Laudna seems to be walking right towards it. 
TRAVIS: See what happens! 
MARISHA: Well... 
MATT: The one in the crow's nest, as you glance up, you can see it in shadow as it sits up a bit and leans into the edge. This skeleton is blackened. The actual bone itself is a soot color. You can almost see veins of reddish light through it, like it's a molten skeleton in some way. You can see it has this heavy sash over its shoulder and a partially armored breastplate that's only over one shoulder. The skull sits in there, and you can see it has this long leather strap that seems to be embedded in the back of the skull. It dangles down in front as it pulls up this massive heavy crossbow and aims in a sniper shot from above. It's going to use its bonus action sniper to give itself advantage on the next attack, and it's going to-- 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
MATT: -- make two heavy crossbow strikes. 
TRAVIS: Two?! These are never good. 
MATT: Yeah. One of them's going to be at FCG. 
SAM: Bring it. 
MATT: One of them's going to be at you. 
TRAVIS: No! 
MATT: This one at FCG has advantage on the strike. Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Damn! Second one! 
MATT: That's crazy. He didn't even need advantage on it. (laughs) Natural 20 and a natural 19 on an advantage on that shot. I'm getting some good rolls. Let's keep it going. 
SAM: Nice, nice. 
MATT: Then the one against you. That's going to be a 22 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: All righty. Some good rolls there. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: All right, so against you, FCG. 
LIAM: Or made up. 
SAM: It's going to be rough. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: I didn't even see the guy in the crow's nest. 
MATT: Because it's a crit, however-- 
SAM: I will negate the crit by asking. 
MATT: What? 
SAM: I'm just going to ask you to negate the crit. 
MATT: Oh. You can do that? 
SAM: Yeah, I just am. 
TRAVIS: He's asking you on a personal-- 
ASHLEY: As Sam? 
SAM: As a personal favor. 
MATT: Oh, no no. No, that's not going to work. Sorry, no. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Be your best friend! 
MATT: No. (laughter) 
MATT: That's going to be 18 piercing damage. 
LAURA: Oh. No. 
SAM: Doubled? 
MATT: No, 18 piercing damage. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: And 36 cold damage. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Frozen robot. 
MATT: As the crossbow releases-- 
SAM: 54! 
MATT: -- this burst of blueish magical energy scatters off of it, and you-- 
TRAVIS: 54? 
SAM: 54? 
MATT: When the heavy bolt hits FCG, it almost pushes you back five feet and you're almost pinned into the beach itself for a second as you have to (straining)-- 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MATT: -- get yourself back up onto your wheel, and it is through your torso, poking out the back. 
SAM: Oh no, it pierced my metal! Oh schnack! 
TALIESIN: How bad are you? 
TRAVIS: 34 and 18? 
SAM: I'm okay. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Liar. 
MATT: All righty. That finishes their go. 
SAM: It hit you, or it missed you? 
TRAVIS: Oh, you didn't roll damage on me. 
MATT: That's right, and then-- 
TRAVIS: I mean, yes you did. Don't worry about it, keep going. 
MATT: That's cool. (laughter) 
MATT: You take 11 points of piercing damage reduced to five because of your form-- 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to get that guy-- 
MATT: -- and five points of cold damage. 
TRAVIS: Which I take all of. 
TALIESIN: Can I? 
MATT: Yes, you do. Finishing their go. 
SAM: Woof. 
MATT: It now goes to the crew members' turn. 
SAM: But they're dead! 
MATT: All the water (splashing) as the crew members' pieces reattach, and they all get right back up out of the water. 
SAM: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
TALIESIN: That's what you need to deal with. 
TRAVIS: I got to become the captain. 
MARISHA: You got to do that thing, he won't die. 
TRAVIS: You got to talk? 
MARISHA: You have to talk to him. 
SAM: (rapping) You gotta get a got, gotta get a got-- 
TRAVIS: Or we got to reach in and pull his gonads out of his body? 
MATT: They can only move half speed. 
TRAVIS: And then [inaudible]. 
SAM: Is it their-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Is it their action to reform? 
TRAVIS: Get a little pirate jaw. 
MATT: Nope. At the start of their turn, they regain hit points. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
LIAM: Shite. 
ASHLEY: Shit! 
MARISHA: Do they regain all their hit points? 
TRAVIS: It's got to be worth taking that shit. 
TALIESIN: When do you go again? 
SAM: Huh? It's my turn next. 
LAURA: Yeah, there's got to be a way to steer the ship. 
TALIESIN: Oh, well then, yeah. 
SAM: I know, I've just got to get there. 
TRAVIS: Get the wheel! 
LAURA: Yeah, charm him. 
TRAVIS: Then say: Jesus! 
MATT: This one's going to dash with its action. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Take the wheel ♪ 
MATT: To just scoot past. It is going to go past you, Laudna. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: It ignores you, but it remains in combat with you. Actually, this one's going to keep going up to here. 
ASHLEY: Shit, shit, shit. 
MATT: You do get an opportunity attack, if you want to, against the one that goes by. 
MARISHA: Melee? 
MATT: If you want to take it. 
MARISHA: I just punch him? 
LAURA: You haven't gone yet. 
MATT: You can if you want to. 
LIAM: I went first. 
MARISHA: I have negative strength. 
SAM: Punch a ghost! 
TRAVIS: Do it! Who knows what's going to happen? 
SAM: Punch a ghost! 
MATT: What could possibly happen in the middle of a parley with a ghost captain? 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's the thing, I don't want to-- No. 
MATT: Then don't. Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: The question was there. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: You're going to bait me into this. 
LAURA: FCG hasn't gone yet. 
SAM: I'm about to. 
TRAVIS: Should we threaten the cursed item? 
MATT: Those two can't strike. 
TRAVIS: Should we threaten the compass? 
LAURA: No, Laudna's right-- 
MATT: They're swarming in here. 
TRAVIS: Threaten to destroy it? 
TALIESIN: This is going to, if-- 
ASHLEY: Uh! 
TALIESIN: This is going to do it. 
MATT: This one, which can go, is going to rush up to you. 
MARISHA: Are you a werewolf again? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: This one's going to one, two, three, and it's going to dash up to here as well. 
SAM: Why, does she mean something to you? 
MATT: This one's going to run up to the top of the mountain after you, Imogen. 
LAURA: Me? 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: Me? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Why, though? 
LAURA: Sweet little me? 
MATT: That's going to be, two of them are going to attack you twice. The other two are going to attack you twice. 
TALIESIN: Awesome. 
MATT: Rushing up with unnatural speed, slashing at you twice, FCG. That's going to be 20 to hit. 
SAM: Hits. 
MATT: Other one is a natural one. 
LAURA: Ha ha! 
SAM: Misses! 
MATT: All right, so that one is going to be-- 
TRAVIS: Oh man! (screams) 
MATT: Over here. Eight points of slashing damage and one cold. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: The other one's attacking you twice. Natural one. And a natural 20. Wow, getting it back to back. 
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. 
ASHLEY: Jeez! 
MATT: So that will be-- 
LAURA: He's going. I go after all these. 
ASHLEY: So many 20s! 
TRAVIS: Stop it, Matt. Stop. 
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage and six points of cold damage. 
SAM: Ow! 
MATT: Then four against you. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: That'll be 15 to hit. 
TALIESIN: Misses. 
MATT: 14 to hit. 
TALIESIN: (whooshes) 
MATT: 23 to hit. 
TALIESIN: That hits. 
MATT: And a 19 to hit. 
TALIESIN: And that hits. 
MATT: Okay, so for that, you take six points of slashing damage, reduced to three, and two points of cold. 
TALIESIN: So that's five. 
MATT: Five, and then that is going to be 10 points of slashing damage reduced to five and five points of cold. 
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage. 
MATT: There you go. That finishes their go over there. The two that are on you are going to roll for twice, each of them. Actually, only one of them can, so it's going to be 17 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Misses. 
MATT: That's going to be a 24 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Definitely hits. 
MATT: That will be nine points of slashing damage and three points of cold, so four-- 
TRAVIS: Seven? 
MATT: Seven, and the one that rushed up to you, Imogen, two strikes on you. That's going to be 14 to hit. And 12 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Payback for those 20s. 
MATT: The same one, it's climbing up the hill like (snarls) and striking out, and as you dart backward, your Mage Armor is flashing in places as it deflects the blade in its claws as it swipes out at you. It's clambering up the hill on the rock after you and can't seem to get hold, yet. Finishing their go, now it is FCG, with Fearne on deck. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: All right. Surrounded and harried by undead, I assume, creatures, I will take my coin and flip it up into the air above us and mutter a quick prayer. Changebringer, no offense to Laudna, but can you please shine your light and wipe these evil dead souls off the face of this flat planet? I will cast Turn Undead/Destroy Undead. 
MATT: Okay, all right, so what's the DC on this? 
SAM: It is a 15. 
MATT: 15. Starting over here, it's 30 feet, right? 
SAM: 30 feet. 
MATT: Yeah, so over here. That is a success. Wait, hold on. No, they have no wisdom bonus. That is actually just a fail. So he is turned. That one-- 
SAM: Or destroyed. 
MATT: -- also fail. What's the--? They are CR2, technically. 
SAM: Oh. Well, then they're just turned. 
MATT: They're just turned. They're just getting turnt. All right, that guy there. 
SAM: Because wait, what level are we? We're 10. 
MATT: That's a fail. 
TRAVIS: We're 10. 
SAM: Yeah, so it's one or lower. 
MATT: Next one, that's a two. Turn. One behind Laudna. Man, now they're rolling shit. 
SAM: Good. 
LAURA: Good! 
MATT: Turn. 
TRAVIS: Just looking for a ride! 
MATT: The one next to Orym. Natural seven, turn. 
MARISHA: Do I have to roll again? 
MATT: Yes, you do. Man, all of them fail. 
TRAVIS: Affects you, too? 
MATT: They are all currently afraid of you. 
SAM: "A turned creature spends its turn trying to move farther away from you. It can't willingly move to the space--" 
MARISHA: Balance. 
MATT: What's up? 
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one. 
MATT: A natural one. You are also afraid. 
TRAVIS: Of FCG. 
MARISHA: Well, I'm immune to fear. 
MATT: So then don't even worry about it. 
TALIESIN: It just feels weird. 
LAURA: Aren't they immune to fear? Wait, how does that work? 
SAM: It's not fear. 
LAURA: It's Turn Undead. 
SAM: It's turned; it's not fear. 
MATT: That's right. So then it wouldn't-- So Turn Undead here. Yeah, it must spend its turns trying to move as far away as it can. 
TALIESIN: What can cancel that? 
MATT: So it's technically not fear. 
TALIESIN: How do you undo-- If you attack a creature that has been turned, do they have to stop turning, or do they keep turning? 
SAM: There's nothing they can do. 
MATT: It's one minute, or until it takes any damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay, until it takes any damage. 
LAURA: You just have to move away from him. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: "Try to move as far away from me as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the dodge action." So you have to run into the ocean, basically. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. That's what I was doing, anyway. 
TRAVIS: And into the hands of Captain Novos, backwards: Sovon. 
MARISHA: Sovon! 
SAM: Shit. Well-- 
MATT: So even the terrifying divine presence of the Changebringer washes through your undead spirit, and you feel this icy grip in your body that-- 
SAM: What can I do? 
MATT: -- perhaps you are anathema to the gods, and their presence means that you are also pinned for destruction. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: You feel this urge to get the hell away from whatever's behind you as fast as you can. 
MARISHA: Ugh! Gods hate me! 
MATT: So that's your action. 
SAM: That is my action. I'm trying to see, does anything undo Turn Undead? 
MATT: One minute, or until they take damage. 
SAM: But there's no Remove Curse, no Greater Restoration, Dispel Magic? 
MATT: This is one of the drawbacks, one of the few situational drawbacks, of the Hollow One. 
TALIESIN: I got it. 
SAM: Okay. They can't take reactions, so I'm going to use my movement to scoot back five feet. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: That's kind of all I can do. Oh, maybe as a bonus action, I'll sip this here health potion. Will you let me do that for a bonus action? 
MATT: I'll allow it, sure. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's in your hand. 
SAM: Five points. 
MATT: Plus two. 
SAM: Seven points. 
MATT: All right, pass that back over here. All righty. So finishing FCG's go, that brings us to Fearne, with Orym on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right, so this is a little different. So they cannot attack us at this point. 
TALIESIN: No. In fact, if we attack them, that's a problem. 
ASHLEY: If we attack them, they come back to us. Okay, so what I'm going to do, that changes things a bit. 
MATT: There are three over here that were unaffected, and those on the ship that were unaffected. 
LAURA: Yeah, the ones on the ship are really powerful. 
MARISHA: Can you take me with you to the ship? 
TRAVIS: (cooing) To the whirlpool! 
TALIESIN: That creates a problem for me, but okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: We could incapacitate Laudna. 
LAURA: No, no! 
SAM: Otherwise she's just going to keep running into the ocean. 
ASHLEY: All right, so-- 
TALIESIN: We just have to tap her. You just have to tap her. 
MARISHA: It's fine. 
SAM: You're going to get to the boat in one turn. 
ASHLEY: Wait, where is Laudna? 
SAM: What about for the rest of the minute? You're going to jump over the edge of the boat and keep going. 
MARISHA: I'm going to have a lovely conversation! 
SAM: You have to keep moving. 
MARISHA: Oh, I have to keep moving? 
SAM: Yes! You will be running into the ocean forever. 
MARISHA: Unless Fearne, unless someone smacks me? 
LAURA: For a minute. It's not that long. 
TRAVIS: Or up and over through the boat. 
TALIESIN: There's a lot of people who could smack you before your turn, it's okay. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: Can I just dash back and forth? 
MATT: No, it has to be as far away from him as possible. I'm letting you game this enough as it is, so. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you hear that? 
MARISHA: Game it enough? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right! 
MARISHA: What are you talking about? What am I trying to game at all? 
MATT: No, not you. 
SAM: Me! 
TALIESIN: Everyone. 
MATT: People who are-- 
TRAVIS: How basic. 
MATT: -- understanding the-- 
MARISHA: Once again, what the fuck did I do? 
MATT: -- specifics of Turn Undead. 
TRAVIS: You died. 
MATT: Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Okay, I am going to cast Fire Shield on myself. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: So you see wispy flames are wreathing around my body, and it's a bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10, and I'm doing a warm shield instead of a cold shield, so I have resistance to cold damage. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to-- Hang on, let me check something real quick. All right, I'm going to start running to Laudna. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Technically, run over Orym, because Orym can fit under her. 
MATT: Now, in order to get to her, because this area is currently all blocked by skeletons, you could try and leap over them, if you want to try. 
LAURA: It's only a minute. 
ASHLEY: Sure, maybe I'll try a little Mirthful Leap situation. 
MATT: Make a strength check for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: It's a DC 10 on this just to try. Because you have the Mirthful Leap ability, I'll say just a DC 10. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: We'll say an athletics check. 
ASHLEY: Athletics check? Okay. 
MATT: Just-- (grunts) 
ASHLEY: Oh, dang it! It's a nine! 
MATT: Nine? 
ASHLEY: Nine! 
TRAVIS: Nein! 
MATT: So you rush up, leap, and just, you end up kicking off one of the legs and you land there. They're blocking your way as they're all turning around. 
ASHLEY: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me! Okay. Okay, so I took the action of that. Is there any way I can try to move a little bit more? 
MATT: Not through them, unfortunately. You can move five feet this way. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: They blocked the path there with their swarm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: That's what I'm saying. You can incapacitate her. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to hang out there. I'm going to hang out there and I'm going to have Mister start making his way to Laudna. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Makin' his way ♪ 
MATT: All right. (little hoots) 
ASHLEY: And-- 
SAM: (heavy thump) (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's what you get, you cleric bitch! 
ASHLEY: That's what you get! (laughter) 
MATT: Oh, buddy. 
LIAM: 2d6 cold damage. 
MATT: What's Mister doing? 
LIAM: To the elbow. 
TRAVIS: Such a big swing! 
ASHLEY: Okay, Mister-- I could-- 
LAURA: (laughs) Are you okay? 
ASHLEY: I could Dimension Door Laudna. I could Dimension Door you, Laudna, with Mister. 
MATT: You mean the Flame Teleport? 
ASHLEY: Flame Teleport. But that will only be a little bit. 
LAURA: But she'll keep running from where she is. 
LIAM: Dimension Door. 
LAURA: She's going to keep running. 
ASHLEY: Shit! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, she's going to-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, all right. So Mister's going to try to go forward-- 
TRAVIS: Not if you drop her in the whirlpool. 
ASHLEY: -- and shoot some flame seeds at the Captain. 
SAM: That's true. 
MATT: At the Captain? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't know if he-- 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: -- can reach. 
MATT: What's the distance on it? 
ASHLEY: I can't see-- 
TRAVIS: You don't need to breathe, right? 
ASHLEY: It is-- 
MARISHA: I breathe. 
ASHLEY: It is-- 
MARISHA: Slowly, very slowly. (laughs) 
LIAM: One breath. One breath a day. 
ASHLEY: 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet. As he throws his flame seed (flames whooshing), it arcs (splashing) into the ocean water just below deck. 
ASHLEY: All right. All right, all right. 
SAM: Incoming cannon fire, sire. 
ASHLEY: Where is Mister? 
MATT: Mister's over right here, next to Laudna. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Shit. Okay. All right, that's all I can do. 
MARISHA: I'm going to fuck the whole thing up. 
ASHLEY: That's my turn. 
SAM: I know, I thought it was going to just to hurt you or something. 
ASHLEY: That's my turn. 
MATT: That's your turn. All right, finishing up Fearne's go. Orym, you're up. Ashton, you're on deck. 
LIAM: Okay, total chaos everywhere. There's way more powerful people here and problem on the boat. So Orym looks at all the tall people and legs and skeletons and he's going to chance it and he's going to run under Fearne, under this feller here, towards the water. 
MATT: All right. So five, 10, 15. 
LIAM: I will leap that way, which I can go the full 15, the rest of my distance with the boots. So that's my movement. And I'll use my action. Am I on foot still, or am I swimming, at this point? 
MATT: You are about knees deep in the water, so it's difficult terrain from this point forward. 
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to wade in. So that'll get me five, 10, 15. 
MATT: (splashes) The water is freezing cold. It is very, very cold. 
MARISHA: I want to go talk to this guy. 
LAURA: Yeah, but you can't-- 
TRAVIS: Crazy. Okay. I was like, what? It looks so beautiful. 
MARISHA: Can you convincingly grab-- 
LIAM: Action Surge. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
LIAM: Use the bonus action to swing out Seedling and send a vine to the side of the ship, hopefully over that ladder. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
LIAM: And (zooms). 
MATT: Pull yourself forward. 
LIAM: Pull myself to the edge of the ship. So that's a bonus action. 
MATT: Up to the side there. 
LIAM: Oh, I'm down below? Okay. 
MATT: Oh, you want to get up to the very edge? 
LIAM: I was hoping to, yeah. 
MATT: What's the range on that? 
LIAM: It's 30 feet. 
MATT: 30 feet? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, you could definitely get that. 
MARISHA: You don't read your damn spells? 
LIAM: Zhoop. And that was the bonus action. 
MATT: And you are now up onto the ship and you are next to the one that was shouting the very loud, high-pitched shrilly voice. You could see a human skeleton, female with a wild bush of black, curly hair that emanates from this bleached skull. After you attach and land on the side of the ship, the skull (crackles), Just grinning at you with its blue eyes flickering flame. 
LIAM: Okay. Shoot. I bolt. I'm going to start running this way. Five, 10, 15. Up, 20, 25, 30. 
TRAVIS: Yes, let's go! 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Are you going to attack him? 
LIAM: No. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: And then I will use my action to-- 
MATT: Well, you've already used-- So you Action Surged. 
LIAM: I Action Surged. 
MATT: Which gives you an action, which you just used to dash. 
LIAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: There's no movement attached to it? 
LIAM: Oh, it's not a whole other. 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. Wait, rewind then. 
MATT: No, it's just-- 
SAM: (VHS tape rewinding) 
MATT: Yeah, it's not a whole different turn. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not a whole different turn. You're right. 
TRAVIS: From where he is, can Orym tell who the Captain is, at this point? We don't think it's the guy on the deck, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, no, we spotted him. He was the-- 
MATT: He's the one who's been shouting orders from that point. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
MATT: Yeah. And this one over here shouted, speaking about the Captain in the third person. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Did everybody get that? 
LIAM: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: Man overboard! 
LIAM: I might as well. I'm not in the right-- Up to 15. I'm not in the right position. Do I have any more movement? Could I get one more square that way? Or am I out? Am I tapped? 
MATT: Let's see. Five, 10. 
SAM: Well, you fucked up. 
LIAM: Five. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. 
SAM: I fucked up. 
MATT: 35 was your movement? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: It was 30. 
MATT: Just 30. So it was there. 
LIAM: That was movement. Then action to do another 15. 
MATT: Well, then you-- 
TRAVIS: You did the leap, right? 
MATT: The leap, right? Which is 15 feet? 
LIAM: Yeah, that's all part of my movement. 
MATT: Right. So that's all your movement. 
TALIESIN: So it's going to be the question of whether or not I know that, sorry. 
MATT: So it's movement and then it was an action to do the-- 
SAM: Do what you do. 
LIAM: I thought I got only yay far and then I needed to use my action to get even further. That was to get me within reach of using the vine. 
MATT: 30, right. And so then you moved over here for that. 
LIAM: Yeah, and that ended the whole turn. So the next-- 
MATT: Correct, so the Action Surge would get you right there. 
LIAM: Okay, so that's as far as I go. All right. Then I will just lay in. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Oh, let's go! 
LAURA: Yes! 
LIAM: And a one, which I'll reroll. For 17. 
MATT: 17 hits. 
LIAM: Okay, let's make it-- Do they have any weapon in hand? 
MATT: They do, they have a shortsword in one hand and a pistol in the other. 
LIAM: Pistol in the other. Okay. I will make the first a goading attack. So that's a four, eight, a six, 14 plus the-- Total of 22 for the first hit. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: And they have to beat wisdom 17. 
MATT: Goading attack? 
LIAM: Goading him. 
MATT: That's 15. 
LIAM: So fail. And then I'll do disarm attack and try to knock their gun into the water. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: So that's-- Disarming is strength. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Two and six is eight plus-- 17 for the second hit. 
MATT: 21 on the strength. Natural 19. 
LIAM: Okay, so they held onto their gun, they took 17 more points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MATT: So both strikes heavy hits him. You hit the pistol and it knocks it out of their grip and they catch it again in the air. The skeleton, still looking down at you, looks back up past you, over the top and goes, "Captain, looks like we've got boarded by a flea!" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He called you a flea. 
LIAM: I call me a flea. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: That finish your turn? 
LIAM: Yeah, sorry for the lag. I confused my economy. 
MATT: Ashton, you're up. 
TRAVIS: A play. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Question. I know I've seen this spell before. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Did Laudna also do the shift the way the rest of the skeletons did? 
MATT: She was already moving this direction. You watch them all turn around. Make a perception check for me. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Or actually, no. Insight. Make an insight check for me. 
TALIESIN: Come on, baby. 16. 
MATT: 16? You notice them in the (splashes) wave. And you watched it affect Laudna once before. All the skeletons (cracks) turn around and right as Laudna goes, and goes into a skittering run that's different than her normal skittering run. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Well, shit. Okay, I'm going to-- I'm going to gently push through these. I'm going to scooch through these guys straight ahead of me. 
MATT: How? 
TALIESIN: Can I just push through? 
MATT: Unfortunately, you cannot. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: You have to find a way to shove them or move around them. 
TALIESIN: All right, let's go. 
SAM: Could you turn into water again? 
MARISHA: Can you get me to the ship? 
TALIESIN: Let's see. I can't see, hold on. 
MARISHA: Is there anything else we can offer this guy? 
TRAVIS: I mean, either offer him the compass, threaten the compass, or-- 
TALIESIN: If I can go around, I'll do a little hop off that rock to try and-- 
MATT: Here? 
TALIESIN: Not all the way up. I'm going to try and parkour my way around. 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20. 25, 30, 35. 
TALIESIN: And then drop down. Jump down. 
LAURA: Parkour! 
MATT: Jump down. There you go. Okay. 
TALIESIN: And I'm going to-- I'm going to-- Straight palm to the back of the head. Just pop. 
MARISHA: Oh Jesus. 
MATT: Okay, roll. Roll with your strength and proficiency bonus. 
TALIESIN: Well, actually, I have an unarmed strike. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Can I reel in how much damage I do, or is it just the amount of damage I do? 
MATT: It's just the amount of damage you do. 
TALIESIN: Cool beans. 
MATT: You're raging. So I'll say yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, no, no. That's-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: 18 to hit? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Take your eight damage. 
MARISHA: Eight damage, all right. 
MATT: Eight points of bludgeoning damage, as you get palm knocked in the back of the skull. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: That gripping divine fear, that pierced into your spirit, gets knocked from your head, as you shake yourself out of your-- 
MARISHA: I immediately, still in my Form of Dread turn to FCG and go: (growls) 
SAM: Respect the gods! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: And then-- Last question. 
MATT: Yeah? 
TALIESIN: This is not quite 60 feet, is it? Between me and the guy with the crossbow. 
MATT: No, they seem a little further than that. 
TALIESIN: Shit. And I'm out of movement, aren't I? 
MATT: You are at the moment, yeah. 
TALIESIN: And I only have that one. Can I do anything fucking else? Ah! 
MATT: There's a skeleton to the immediate right of you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, but they're all clearly fucking running, right? 
MATT: They are at the moment, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to-- Can I hold? That's not an action. I can't hold one attack. 
MATT: No, unfortunately. 
TALIESIN: Nah, that's a-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I have no more movement. I got nothing more right now. 
MATT: All right. The Captain, glancing over the side there, continues to pace and walk, glances over the shoulder at the shout of the flea that's joined the ship and gives a weird grin. The teeth crack a little bit as the jaw seems to twist into a ghostly smile. 
LIAM: Here come 10 guys that don't look happy. 
MATT: Another bit of the water and the ocean begins to swirl. (swirls) All righty, that brings us to this one on the ship next to you. "Don't worry, Captain, I'll take him!" They're going to use bonus action Captain's Orders. 
LIAM: Bob and weave. 
MATT: This crew member here is going to immediately try to attack you. That's going to be a 21 to hit. 
LIAM: (disappointed noise) 
SAM: Is that me? 
MATT: That's Imogen. 
LAURA: No, it's me. 
MATT: You take six points of slashing damage and three cold. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: And then is going to switch back around after shouting the order and then go into two strikes against you. 
LIAM: Bob and weave, bob and weave! 
MATT: Natural one. A lot of natural ones. Natural 20! That's twice in the same battle I've gotten both back to back. 
LAURA: What the heck? 
MATT: That's crazy. 
LAURA: That's twice he's done that. 
ASHLEY: 20 and a one? 
MATT: Yeah. That's wild. 
ASHLEY: Boy, a lot of 20s tonight. 
TRAVIS: ♪ 20 and one ♪ 
TALIESIN: Damn, damn, damn. 
MATT: All righty. That'll be 14 points of slashing damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: And 12 points of cold damage. 
LIAM: 26 total. Got you, got you. 
MATT: The first one goes wide and right as you are getting your bearings, you duck the first one, bring the shield up and you suddenly can't see it. And then underneath the shield it's crouched down to almost a cockroach lower level. (hisses) 
LIAM: Ah! 
MATT: And carves you up the front with his shortsword. All right, that's going to finish their go. Bringing it to Chetney. 
TRAVIS: (whimpering garble) I mean (snarls) And I'm going to make a beeline for the boat, knowing I'll take attacks of opportunity. 
MATT: That's 10 feet before you get to the difficult terrain. Both then get attacks of opportunity against you. That's going to be an 18. 
TRAVIS: That's my AC. 
MATT: So that does barely hit you. And that's going to be a 12. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful. 
MATT: So one of them does hit you for nine points of slashing damage and six cold. So it'd be five and so-- 
TRAVIS: Five and 11. 
MATT: 11, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Got you, okay. 
MATT: All righty. So that's five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. What's your full movement? 
TRAVIS: It's 35. 
MATT: 35. So it's about as far as you can get right now. Just starting to swim through the water. It's now up to your chest. 
TRAVIS: And am I within 30 feet of the guy up near Orym? Can I eyeball it? 
MATT: They're a little bit outside of 30 feet. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I will continue to swim towards the hull of the ship. I'll keep going. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We're going to board her, aye? 
MATT: 30, 35. 
LAURA: Aye. 
TALIESIN: Aye. 
MATT: I'll say with the five feet in the previous one, that does go into an additional one and you're on the side and that's as far as you got. But you're right there. 
TRAVIS: Cool, cool. 
MATT: Claws out, clung to this exterior of this rotted wood, as your fingers almost sink in because it's soft. 
TRAVIS: Eugh. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: Okay. Oh, fuck. I'm going to start running to the ship, avoiding the whirlpool. 
MATT: Okay, which direction? 
MARISHA: Let's go through the middle of the two whirlpools. 
MATT: All right, five, 10, 15, 20. 25, 30. As you're now wading waist high in the water and now it's turning into difficult terrain. 
MARISHA: I'll dash. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: I'm going to keep up the illusion that I'm still turned from FCG. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: So I'm still running frantically. 
MATT: All right, as you're now running and now swimming into the water-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: -- you glance up off the edge, and you can see the dwarven captain still pacing, but keeping an eye on you. Just patiently watching. 
MARISHA: Just looking at him with fear in my eyes. 
MATT: Okay. Finishing your go. It's now the Captain's go. The Captain is still holding his action because of your-- 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: -- persuasion roll and is going to bonus action Command From the Grave. 
MARISHA: Give me a ride. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I tell him. 
MATT: He is going to command-- 
MARISHA: Please. Super please. 
LAURA: Halp me. 
TRAVIS: Halp. 
MATT: This one. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: Son of a bitch. 
MATT: 20, 25 and leap here to 30. 
TRAVIS: Got to go fast. Clamber up-- oh god. There we go. Stay, buddy. There we go. All right, and it's going to attack you. For natural one. I'm swinging wide this battle. 
TRAVIS: The pendulum is ping ponging. 
MATT: No joke. All righty. That's wild. All right, that's going to finish his go. That brings us back to Imogen. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
TALIESIN: Hmm? Oh yeah. Okay, hold on. 
SAM: You're going to parley. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm trying to think of something good. 
SAM: It's either-- You're better at threatening them. 
LAURA: That's dumb. There's no point in that. Hold on! 
TRAVIS: Are the whirlpools holding in size or does it look like they're growing or shrinking at all, or moving? 
MATT: The whirlpools look like they're staying for the time being. Moving this a little bit closer, now that we're moving down the battlefield. Moving it a little closer to you all. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to look at these two fuckers in front of me. And my eyes are going to flare white and I'm going to say: Back the fuck off! I'm going to cast Shock Flare at 3rd-level. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: So-- 
MATT: Is that a dexterity save for them? 
LAURA: Strength save. 
MATT: Strength save. (laughs) That's a natural two. Two natural twos in a row. 
LAURA: Great. Then they both take 4d6 lightning damage. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
TRAVIS: Dang. That's not bad. 
LAURA: It's not that much. For... 12 points of lightning damage to each of them. 
MATT: (lightning cracks) It blasts outward. This one falls back (thudding) and collapses into a pile of bone at the bottom of the rock hill. 
LAURA: Great. And for my bonus action-- 
SAM: Bone? 
LAURA: My bone-us action. I will use two more meteors and slam them into the skeleton still standing. 
MATT: You got it. So that's a dexterity save? 
LAURA: Yes? 
SIRI: I didn't get that. 
MATT: Are you sure? 
SIRI: Try again. 
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to use a dexterity save. 
MATT: That's a 10, failure. That's going to be a 15. Does that fail? 
LAURA: They both. 
MATT: All right, they fail. 
LAURA: I'm going to stop rolling these dice because I keep getting the same numbers. 14 points of fire damage on that. 
MATT: (impacts) They both get blasted back. One catches the rock. The other one gets thrown off the edge and crumples into a pile of shattered bones and armor. As the other one's pulling itself back up, both meteors (impacts). It goes arcing in the air where its torso pulls apart from the rest of its skeleton, and it falls into two pieces about five feet from each section. 
LAURA: Ugh, they're going to get right back up. 
TALIESIN: You got movement. 
LAURA: I do. I can't do that! It's a spell, Chet. 
TRAVIS: What? 
TALIESIN: I think he just did the move. 
TRAVIS: I'm just saying toot. 
LAURA: Just toot. 
MATT: Psychic toot. (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm going to get up on the high rock. 
SAM: Up on your high horse? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Can you collect the-- Yeah, actually, did we collect the hole or did we leave the hole up there? 
LIAM: Hole is still up there. 
MATT: The hole is up there. As you climb up onto the edge, I will say, make a dexterity saving throw. 
TALIESIN: My fault. 
ASHLEY: Where'd she go? 
SAM: Ah! 
LAURA: That's 18. 
MATT: 18? You get up the edge and whoa! Have to catch yourself. And walk around the edge of a massive hole in the top of the rock. 
LAURA: I'm actually going to just hang down. 
MATT: Okay. So you vanish into it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Which gives you total cover while you're hanging there. 
LAURA: That's great. 
MATT: So there you go. 
SAM: No, Imogen! (laughter) 
LIAM: Like a Broadway trap door. 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: As long as nothing happens. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Idina Menzel. 
LAURA: I'm hanging on. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're right. 
LIAM: Here comes the sniper, yeah? 
LAURA: That's why I was just doing it to the sniper while I was standing up on the rock. 
TRAVIS: It's so bad. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Adele. 
TRAVIS: He can't even make it up to-- 
LAURA, MARISHA, and LIAM: Dazeem. 
TRAVIS: Adele Dazeem. 
MATT: Nah. 
LAURA: It's so awkward. 
MARISHA: It's just so weird. Just watch his brain just like short out. 
TALIESIN: Guys. 
LIAM: It's about to rain. 
MATT: The sniper puts in another large bolt. 
SAM: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: Here we fucking go. 
MATT: Pulls it back, gets down, (cracking) and aims out past everyone-- 
TRAVIS: Achoo! 
MATT: -- to you once more. 
SAM: But I'm just a sweet boy! 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: You sent the entirety of the crew running in a wave of divine-- 
SAM: He doesn't know that. I mean, I guess I did-- 
MATT: It was very visible. 
SAM: -- make a pretty big show of it. 
MATT: It was extremely visible. (laughter) 
MATT: Bonus actions. 
TRAVIS: "Why me?!" 
SAM: There was a speech involved, yeah. 
MATT: Bonus action to the sniper. Gives them advantage. 
TRAVIS: "There was a speech involved." 
MATT: That's going to be a 20 to hit. 
SAM: Hits! 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: I do love how we stand out in the open with a sniper in a nest. There's all these like nice cover. 
LIAM: I'm trying! 
TALIESIN: I got a fucking plan, but. 
MATT: Yeah, there's plenty of cover out there. 
SAM: Do I get half cover from all of his friends? 
MATT: Nope! No, you did not. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Sniper-- 
MATT: That is going to be 12 points of piercing damage. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: That's what I thought. 
MATT: And 14 points of cold damage. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
SAM: I'm down. 
LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Unconscious?! 
SAM: Unconscious. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: You hear once more the (whooshes). The massive bolt streaks through with a high-pitched whine, and FCG gets blasted and tumbles. (thuds) And skids. 
SAM: Does that undo Turn Undead? 
MATT: I'm going to double check the rules. 
LIAM: Laura, help. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
MARISHA: Laura, wait. 
LIAM: Not Imogen, just Laura. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: Should've just taken some fucking cover. Goddamn it. 
SAM: (mumbles) 
TALIESIN: Don't think-- 
MATT: One minute until it takes damage. So yeah. 
SAM: So one minute. 
MATT: Even while you're unconscious, they didn't even see it happen. They're all still running from you. 
SAM: They're running from my god, not from me. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah, okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, very humble. 
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. 
MATT: But you are now laid out. A secondary bolt sticking out of your torso right now. 
TRAVIS: Still don't know how to do this. 
SAM: Did he take more than one shot on me? 
TALIESIN: I am now pointing at that motherfucker. 
MATT: No, the was just one shot. Is going to reload up, and take a secondary shot. 
LIAM: Sum bitch. 
TALIESIN: I am pointing at him. 
MATT: This is going to be at down on the deck because you're now the other immediate threat. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. I thought they were both coming for me. Great. 
MATT: (sarcastic laugh) That's going to be 13. 
LIAM: (grunts) 
MATT: (heavy impact) Splinters the wood. (explosion) Shards of it go flying around you as it sticks about six inches out of the deck. 
LIAM: Taller than me. 
MATT: Yeah. All right, that finishes their go. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
LAURA: FCG's down. 
SAM: I'm down! 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
MATT: Actually, you know what? They're going to step up. 
TRAVIS: Cliff dive? 
MATT: Then (whooshes) 
LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
LIAM: You got bones. 
MATT: Over to the other top there. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
LIAM: Jack Skellington hopping around. 
MATT: Yeah, it succeeds. 
TALIESIN: Motherfucker, I had plans. Now, I got to save your butt. Goddamn it. 
MATT: All righty. Finishing their go, the rest of the crew. (crackling) 
TRAVIS: Oh boy, this is a problem. 
LIAM: (crackly) I'm back, baby. 
TALIESIN: We were-- Ah! 
LAURA: I hate them. 
MATT: 15. They only get up that far. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: They spend half their movement to get there. They're both going to dash with the rest of it. 
LAURA: Great. 
MARISHA: I wish. Of course I havr zero fucking bamf abilities. 
MATT: They both fall into the hole. (laughter) 
MATT: Just (impacts) So you're holding onto the edge, and they go over top and they fall down 10 feet. Both of them taking-- 
MARISHA: Is this into our hole? 
MATT: They both take enough damage to fall in, and then immediately splinter out again. (laughter) 
MARISHA: So wait, can you just? 
TRAVIS: Dominoes! 
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we can--

MARISHA: (laughs) That's pretty good. 
MATT: Oh god. 
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. 
MATT: They're running up behind you, splashing into the water. 
LIAM: Look out, Laudna. 
MATT: These two do run away, getting attack of opportunity from either of you, if you'd like. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take that. Oh no, never mind. 
SAM: If you hit them, they will stop running. 
TALIESIN: That's right. I'm like eh, no. 
LAURA: Let them keep running. We'll hit them when they stop. 
SAM and TRAVIS: Let them. (laugh) 
LAURA: Let them keep running. 
MATT: Both of these guys go running way off to the side. 
LAURA: Let them run. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: (stilted) Let them run.

ASHLEY: Smee. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, fuck, fuck. 
MATT: But it took its action to dash to get there, so it runs up to you. (growls) At your base of you. Finishing their go now, FCG, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
SAM: I'm up? 
MATT: Yep, I need you to make a death saving throw for me, please. 
SAM: All right. Nope. 
TRAVIS: Wow.

TRAVIS: Wow! Wow! 
MATT: All righty. Fearne, your go. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: I'm confident. 
TRAVIS: Don't get bit. 
ASHLEY: Standby. 
SAM: I'm confident. You know why? Because I've got the gods. 
MARISHA: Do want to use my tattoo? 
SAM: I do want to use your tattoo. 
ASHLEY: I'm just wondering. 
SAM: I don't have anything to write on it with. 
ASHLEY: If I'm going to be petty because of what he did to Laudna. 
MARISHA: It's not permanent. 
ASHLEY: I'm not going to be petty. 
SAM: Death is permanent. Wait, are these the deaths? 
MARISHA: Yeah, the dark ones. 
TALIESIN: You can be any petty b-word. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Fearne, what you got? 
ASHLEY: I am going to cast Cure Wounds. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: On this dumbass. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at 2nd-level, maybe? I'm going to do it at 2nd-level. 
MATT: All right, so it's 2d8 plus your wisdom. 
TRAVIS: The question mark. 
MATT: I know. 
SAM: It can be the most basic one. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, I'm going to do-- 
SAM: All I need is one hit point. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to do Cure Wounds at 1st-level. 
SAM: That's fine, that's fine. 
MATT: All right, so 1d8 plus your wisdom. 
LAURA: What if you get hit immediately? 
SAM: She'll have to do it again. 
LIAM: A crossbow hit, it's enough to take out a 2nd-level healer-- 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Okay. 
LIAM: -- so saving's not-- 
ASHLEY: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hang on. Eight points. 
SAM: Amazing. 
MATT: So you come back to consciousness. Two bolts sticking two feet out of your torso.

ASHLEY: Because you-- Look what you did to Laudna! You just threw everything off.

ASHLEY: It's all right, it's all right. 
SAM: Do you want me to be dead again? 
TALIESIN: Can we get them out of the way?

TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: When I was dead, I realized. 
ASHLEY: As a bonus action. 
SAM: I had a lot of gas. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I believe, can I do a 2nd-level bonus action? 
MATT: You've already cast a spell with your action, so you can only do a bonus action that's a cantrip, unfortunately. 
ASHLEY: Got it, okay. Stand by. All right, I'm going to, I'm going to do Caleb's Produce Flame cantrip. I'm going to put my-- 
LIAM: Love that it's an artifact floating in. 
MATT: Is it a bonus action? Oh god. 
ASHLEY: Oh, no, it's not a bonus action. I'm sorry. 
MATT: Put that back on top there, if you don't mind. 
ASHLEY: No, it's not a bonus action. What am I doing? 
MATT: There you go. 
TALIESIN: Anything with this little fucker next to me, so. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to-- If I try to attack the little guy, am I able to also do my movement? I don't know why I'm having such a brain fart. 
MATT: You can move still, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to melee attack the little guy. 
MATT: Well, you've used your action to cast Cure Wounds. 
ASHLEY: What am I doing? Okay. 
MATT: That's okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to keep walking towards the boat. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: And then! 
MATT: 20, 25, the one that ran up to you goes (snarls) and strikes out with-- 
ASHLEY: I have 35 feet of movement. 
MATT: Correct. So move you to about there. All right, so that one's going to attack you. That's going to be a 14 to hit. 
ASHLEY: Does not hit. 
MATT: Does not hit. 
ASHLEY: But because of my fire shield, and if he took a melee attack at me, he takes damage. 
MATT: Ah. 
TALIESIN: Can I do this? 
MATT: Hits you with melee attack. So it has to hit you to take the fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Copy that. I don't understand any of this. All right, and now Mister. Where's Mister?

TALIESIN: He gets shoved one square from forward because the hammer's coming from behind. 
MATT: That's true. 
TALIESIN: The other way. 
MATT: So. 
LIAM: Back of the head. 
MATT: As it's getting the bolt ready for the second shot, you swing your hammer, and as you swing it, partway through, your arms vanish for a moment. From behind, a portal opens, and the hammer crack! Hits the sniper from behind and (shrieking) tumble ass over tea kettle off the side. 
TRAVIS: Damn, that's some good rage, bro.

TALIESIN: I still have some movement, which is disgusting, but true. 15, 20, 25. I can't quite make it, shit. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. (laughs) What a lackluster turn. That was fucking awesome. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and head back to FCG.

LIAM: Doony-mancy. 
LAURA: That's really cool. Doody-mancy. 
MATT: All right. The captain-- 
TALIESIN: If this fucker hadn't gone down, it would've been way worse. 
TRAVIS: You didn't give me a high five. 
TALIESIN: It should've been way crazier. 
MATT: The captain's still pacing and watching. Then gives a nod to the water and the whirlpool-- 
TRAVIS: Oh? 
MATT: -- shifts. 
TRAVIS: Nod? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
ALL: No! 
SAM: Oh, it serves you right! (laughter) 
MATT: Now the water's (whooshes). 
MARISHA: Did he move it? 
TRAVIS: He just moved it. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: So it moves underneath. We'll come to that on your turn. 
TALIESIN: Oh god. 
MATT: It is now the individual's turn. The one that's fighting you on the deck is going to try and dance around to this side. "I know your game!" And is going to attempt to do a shove strike on you. Go ahead and make an athletics check. 
LIAM: Oh good. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Well, let me double- check to make sure if it's athletics or athletics and acrobatics. 
MATT: Keep coming back to this, but I just want to make sure, so I don't get reamed. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, fuck, fuck. Ah! 
SAM: He's pushing you, Orym? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: So you can make athletics or acrobatics, your choice. 
SAM: Oh, you're fine. 
LIAM: I'll do acrobatics, try to dodge. That is a 20. 
MATT: They got a 20 as well. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Well, I will use Zephran Heart. 
MATT: Well, 20 is meet or beat, so you did actually beat it on the first strike. 
LIAM: Oh, then I will not do that. Okay. 
MATT: Frustrated by how you just-- they try and bash you in the side, and you pull up the shield and you both (clashing) your feet slide about an inch, but it's barely any movement. Angrily, is going to spin around with its shortsword and try and stab you over the shield. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: That's pretty hard to do. 
MATT: That is going to be (laughs) 12. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Raise the shield up higher. (shield clangs) 
MATT: (snarls) Is going to now shout over here the captain's orders to the one next to it. This one's going to be like, "Make sure you shoot true." So we'll see whatever that gets to. 
LIAM: It smells real bad. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, that finishes its go. Chetney, you're up. Laudna, your on deck. 
TRAVIS: Oh, can I try-- 
MATT: Actually, beginning your turn, because you're in the water-- 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh? 
MATT: The freezing ice cold waters around you begin to cause your body temperature to drop deeply. 
TRAVIS: (shivers) 
MATT: You take 10 points of cold damage. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: This shit's cold around this boat. 
MARISHA: What? 
TRAVIS: Good thing I've been doing cold plunges every morning before I joined the-- 
MATT: (laughs) All right, now it's still your turn, what do you want to do? 
TRAVIS: Claws in the hull, can I climb up the side and get up onto the deck? 
MATT: 15, 20. 
SAM: Chetney, you're-- 
MATT: 25 gets you right about there. 
TRAVIS: Can I use the rest of my movement to get right over the guy that fell-- 
MATT: Yeah, you can. 
TRAVIS: -- from the crow's nest? 
MATT: Right up next to it. 
LAURA: (laughs deviously) 
TRAVIS: With my action, can I reach down and try and wrestle that big fucking heavy crossbow out of his stupid hands? 
LIAM: Yes! 
MATT: (laughs) Sure. Make an-- 
SAM: Come on. 
MATT: This will be a strength versus strength test. 
TRAVIS: Okay, just a straight-up strength roll? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: He's got no meat on his bones. 
MATT: Now, you are transformed, which means you have an advantage on the strength rolls if I recall. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I do. That's even better. 23! 
MATT: 23. (laughs) He rolled a natural 19. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Plus two, 21. (exclaiming) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: So it's on the ground, (groans). As you clamber up (clunky climbing) onto the ship. It's like, (grunts) getting up, it sees you. It goes and grabs its crossbow and tries to start getting up, as you get your claws onto it. There's a brief tug of war before you-- (rips) 
TRAVIS: Drop it! 
MATT: -- tear it free from its grasp. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Drop it. 
TRAVIS: Could I toss it into the waters over the ship? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I just-- (clunks)

TRAVIS: Ooh! With my bonus action, can I use Blood Curse of Bloated Agony on the guy that Orym is fighting? 
MATT: Yeah, sure.

SAM: Oh!

TALIESIN: Yeah.

MARISHA: I'm going to use Silent Image-- 
LIAM: Herbie doesn't like to make toys. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MARISHA: -- to make the compass again. And then-- (laughs) I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: I'm going to shift it again to look-- (laughs) I'm so sorry. To look like Chetney's possessed sword. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. "So--" 
MARISHA: It's a cursed sword. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's a cursed sword that talks to him. So I figured it would go good with your whole aesthetic. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: The captain pulls forth his saber from his sheath, which you can see, as it hits the air, the moisture clings to it and creates ice crystals along the blade, and he goes, "What's so special about this cursed sword?" Make another persuasion check. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: It's a really good sword? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: You should've given her the charisma buff. 
LIAM: Is the soul of a LARPer in it? 
SAM: I was going to, but then I used the turn to-- 
MARISHA: Okay, that's a little bit better. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: 18? 
MATT: 18, and what's your response to his question? (snarling exhale) 
MARISHA: I'm trying to remember what the fuck his sword does. 
SAM: I don't even know if you know it's cursed. 
LAURA: It's got the soul of a king trapped in it, that's all, right? 
SAM: I know that. 
TALIESIN: I think that's been 
LAURA: But then you said that-- that to everybody. 
TALIESIN: -- made pretty plain. 
LAURA: We all know that. 
SAM: Did I? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you did. 
LAURA: It's got the soul of a king trapped inside of it. 
TALIESIN: You said it out loud. 
LAURA: That's what we know. 
LIAM: Doesn't matter what's true, all that matters is what she says. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Okay, okay. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: The treasure of nobleness. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LIAM: Fucking creeper. (laughter) 
LAURA: You should've seen him today and peeking his head in the dressing room. 
MARISHA: It imbues him. 
MATT: You were putting on makeup. You weren't getting dressed. I just want to specify. (laughter) 
SAM: Aw, you should've seen him earlier when I was taking a shit. 
LIAM: Insight check. 
SAM: He was like-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Hard to read. 
MATT: I felt like it was important to specify. (laughter) 
MATT: It sounded real bad out of context. 
ASHLEY: When he was peeking in in the girls' dressing room. (laughter) 
MATT: Anyway. (whooshes) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Back to the scene. (laughter) (laughter) 
MARISHA: It imbues him with the strength of 100 holy men. It can grant you radiant abilities. The same ones that cause your men to flee. 
MATT: "Show me this blade." That's going to end this turn. 
TRAVIS: Nah, bitch. 
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Imogen. 
LAURA: (buzzes lips) Mm-hmm! 
LIAM: Let's go, 'Mo. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Imo. 
LAURA: I'm going to peek my head up out and come out of the little hole. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: (grunts) Am I within 120 feet of the ship? 
MATT: Maybe. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: I feel like, looking at it-- 
MATT: At a glance, it could be. It's pretty close. 
LIAM: So are they about to get up again? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm coming out of the hole and I'm standing on the rock. 
LAURA: Right. 
TALIESIN: But if you walk, you'll get closer. 
LAURA: Would it take an action to pick up the scarf or is that something I can do as I come up and out? 
MATT: To pick up the scarf? 
LAURA: The scarf off the ground. 
MATT: Oh, the hole you mean? 
LAURA: Yeah, would that take an action or could I just? 
MATT: It's an action, because it's grabbing the lips and taking it and folding it up. 
LAURA: All right. In that case, I'm going to leave the hole on the ground. I'm going to come out and step down. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: I think, once I'm down on this next level, that's 120 feet. Cheez Whiz. 
MATT: Could be. 
LAURA: Cheez Whiz. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Cheez Whiz. 
LAURA: Could I get a little closer then? 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: To where I feel like I would be? 
MATT: As you're leaping down, you can get about there, would be you movement. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I love Cheez Whiz. 
LAURA: God, I love Cheez Whiz. 
ASHLEY: Me too! 
MATT: It's real good. 
LAURA: No, I do not love Cheez Whiz. 
TRAVIS: On a Ritz cracker. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
ASHLEY: The little cracker thing with the red scooper? 
LAURA: -- Twinned Spell. 
LIAM: You know what I like? Cheese. 
TRAVIS: Real cheese? 
LIAM: Real cheese. 
TRAVIS: Get out of here. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: (slicing) Double Lance the sniper and the dude fighting Orym.
MATT: Okay. 120 feet? 
TRAVIS: Dang, from the 120? 
ASHLEY: Yar. 
MATT: That is 85 there, so they're both within range. 
LAURA: Sweet. 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
TALIESIN: Pew, pew. 
LAURA: (blasts) 
ASHLEY: Pew, pew. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So that's saving throw on their end, intelligence saving throw? 
LAURA: Intelligence saving throw. 
MATT: All right. That's a fail. And, ooh, it's pretty good, but that's still going to be a 17. 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: Fail. 
LIAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: So that is 7d6 psychic damage. 
MATT: Ooh. 
LAURA: They both are incapacitated until the start of my next turn. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
MATT: That's great. 
LAURA: Two. 
TALIESIN: Damn. 
LAURA: One, two. Hold on, let me find them. Two, three, four, five, six, seven. Oh! 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's way better. 12, 17, 19, 23, 26, 29 points of psychic damage to both of them. 
MATT: Both of those skeletons, (groans) and crumple to the ground. 
LAURA: (gasps) Yes. 
TALIESIN: How do you kill the dead? 
SAM: Dead forever. 
LAURA: Forever. 
TRAVIS: Who's dead forever? 
LAURA: Both of them. 
ASHLEY: Dang it. 
SAM: Those skeletons who were-- 
LAURA: (crackles) 
MATT: The one that you pulled the crossbow away from and threw it in the water, it starts getting back and (groans) You don't even see what happened. 
TRAVIS: Misses his crossbow. (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah, those of you who are glancing over in the direction, you can see the air between Imogen and the ship ripples, (pulses) rapidly. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
TALIESIN: Pop, pop. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: Sweet. 
TALIESIN: (pops) 
TRAVIS: Sonic boom. (booms) 
TALIESIN: It goes (plops) 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I can't use any more movement, can I? 
MATT: Nah, sorry, that was your movement to get down there, unfortunately. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, yeah, that's what I'll do. 
MATT: Okay. (rattles) 
TRAVIS: That's what I'll do. 
MATT: Top of this turn, that one gets back up, (whooshes) but it's still incapacitated. So technically, incapacitated means it, hmm. 
LAURA: It can't take any actions. 
MATT: It can't take any actions, but it can still get back up and move. 
TRAVIS: Huh. 
MATT: It's like, (grunts) and then it glances to you, you see its blackened skeleton crackling, and you can see, it's the interior of it is almost like a molten bone. 
TRAVIS: (thuds) (laughter) 
MATT: (cracks) 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
MATT: It's not going to move. 
TRAVIS: Does that mean no reactions, either? 
MARISHA: Both. 
LAURA: It can't do anything. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Yep. So finishing that go. (whooshes) The rest of the crew keep running. (scurries) (laughs) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Keep on running ♪ 
MATT: Running back to the ship. Running back to the ship. (scurries) 
TALIESIN: Then they're going to run over the ship. 
MATT: This one here. 
TALIESIN: Off the ship. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Are they swimming? They're swimming, right? 
MATT: They're swimming through. (splashes) Those two go running into the bushes (laughs) over that way. Can't reach them from here, it's fine. These two get back up and start climbing out of the hole, then clamber down. (thuds) 
TALIESIN: Do they have to have-- 
MARISHA: Oh wait, they're climbing out of the hole? 
TALIESIN: -- half their movement? 
MATT: Half their movement to get out, then they dash to get down, which means they can't do-- 
LAURA: Didn't they have to climb out of the hole? The hole is-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: So did you. 
LAURA: Yeah, but I was hanging. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: They weren't, okay. 
MATT: It's not a sheer wall there. You have things in there, they leap up and climb their way up. But it used up a lot of their movement, which is why they had to get up to the top and then dash to even get to you. So they don't even attack you at all. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It's their full round to even try and get to you. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: This one gets up. 
SAM and TRAVIS: (groaning) 
MATT: Is immediately going to go after you, FCG. 
TRAVIS: No. 
SAM: But I'm a sweet-- 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
MATT: Because you are prone, it has advantage. (laughs) Even with advantage, it's a 15 on the first attack. 
SAM: That misses. 
MATT: That misses. The second one with advantage. Man, come on, come on, come on. That's better! 19. 
SAM: Hit. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Hey, I didn't use bonus, though, on my turn, right? 
MATT: That's true, you did not. 
LAURA: Can I--? 
MARISHA: Use it again. Reset it. (laughs) 
MATT: That'd be five points of slashing damage and four cold. 
SAM: I'm down again. 
ASHLEY: No, you're not. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Get your shit together! 
SAM: You should've given me that fucking 2nd-level. 
LAURA: I would realize, was he within five feet of FCG? 
TALIESIN: It wouldn't have fucking mattered. 
SAM: No, it would have. 
LAURA: -- when I ended my turn? 
TALIESIN: No, no, it would not have, because your turn-- 
MATT: Yeah, he was. 
LAURA: He was? Okay. 
TALIESIN: -- still would've never come. It would've just hit you again. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Because this one would've already gotten you. 
SAM: But I would still be alive right now. 
MATT: That finishes their go. 
TALIESIN: You would be down because that fucker would be right on top of you. 
MATT: FCG. 
SAM: What fucker? 
MARISHA: What are you talking about? 
SAM: The fucker-- 
TALIESIN: The one who just killed you again. 
SAM: Yeah, but he just did. I had eight points. 
MARISHA: He would've still been alive. 
SAM: They did nine points of damage. 
MATT: FCG. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm the asshole here. 
MATT: Death save. 
SAM: Ugh, death save. This is an important roll, guys. 
TRAVIS: (burps) 
MARISHA: Aw, jesus. 
SAM: I'm going to do it-- 
MARISHA: Why?! 
SAM: -- with my special rolling device-- 
MATT: What? 
SAM: -- that's been here the entire campaign. 
TRAVIS: What's that smell that just came? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: What? 
TALIESIN: A dice tower? 
SAM: This has always been a transformer. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: It's also a dice tower. 
MARISHA: A dice tower? 
ASHLEY and LAURA: What? 
MATT: Oh my god. 
SAM: Six. 
TRAVIS: What came out? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: What came out? 
LIAM: That's just right! 
MATT: What? 
LIAM: That's just right. 
TRAVIS: You don't drink out of those parts, do you? 
MATT: Back to one failed save. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
MATT: All righty. Fearne, you're up. At the top of your turn-- 
ASHLEY: I also forgot, I know it's too late now, but to know for next time. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: With my enhanced bond when I do an extra d8, when Mister is out I can also do it to restore hit points. So I could've done an extra d8. 
MATT: Well, good thing to know for the future. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Top of your turn, because you are in the water, in the whirlpool. You do start feeling the freezing energy of the darkened ghost ship's dark, cursed magic. You take 10 points of cold damage. 
ASHLEY: I have my fire shields. 
MATT: Which would make it just five. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Your movement is reduced even further. So it's considered difficult terrain, but your speed is halved, which means you can really only move like five feet, this turn. 
ASHLEY: All right, so-- 
MATT: It's like, (water whooshing). The water's pulling you towards the center. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Since I have Mister, I would like to, can I use Fiery Teleportation? 
MATT: You can. 
ASHLEY: All right, so I'm going to use Fiery Teleportation to 15 feet to try to get out of the whirlpool. 
MATT: Okay, so you both move five feet this way, probably, and then-- 
ASHLEY: I'm actually going to move to the side. 
MATT: All right. (crunching impact) 
ASHLEY: Because I feel like I need to. 
MATT: All righty, so a burst of flame and you both (poof) appear 15 feet over to that side. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I guess I wouldn't have known if FCG went down again. 
SAM: Oh yeah, because you're in a whirlpool of hatred. 
TALIESIN: Mm, I don't know, would you? 
ASHLEY: Pop out, I see him laying down again. 
SAM: I was laying down when you went in. (laughter) 
LAURA: Look over at him, you would see. 
MATT: I'll tell you what, make a perception check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: It's not like my body goes limp. 
ASHLEY: I'm feeling really guilty, that's why. 
LIAM: Maybe he's facing a different direction this time. 
MATT: That's okay. 
LIAM: Hope she rolls high. 
ASHLEY: 16. 
MATT: 16. I'll say 15 would've been the DC of just glancing over and hearing the sound of FCG taking another hit, looking behind and seeing the other skeleton (snarls) clawing into him and then hitting him with a blade. 
TALIESIN: I'd be swearing loudly, too. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TALIESIN: There'd be some loud swearing. 
ASHLEY: So I will make my way over there back to FCG. 
MARISHA: ♪ Makin' my way ♪ 
ASHLEY: I was so close to the ship! 
SAM: You don't have to heal me. I'll be fine. Someone else will heal me. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: Ashton can heal me. 
TALIESIN: The thing's going to get right the fuck back up. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm going to pump him up with a 2nd-level Cure Wounds.. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: And, I get extra 3d8. 
ASHLEY: 13. 
SAM: Hey! 
MATT: 13 hit points healing to you, FCG. 
ASHLEY: That wasn't great. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: That finishes my turn. 
MATT: Orym, you're up. 
SAM: Fearne, thank you! 
LIAM: Okay. I get advantage on this-- 
ASHLEY: I felt guilty! 
LIAM: -- anything I do to this character, because it's unconscious, right? 
MATT: On the ground there? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: That one is currently at zero hit points. 
LIAM: I know that, but I've seen these things get back up. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: So, I want to do something to it. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. So I want to make a pushing attack. I want to jam my blade into the deck and then jack rabbit kick it towards that side of the ship with a pushing attack. 
MATT: This side? Okay, yeah. 
LIAM: I'll reroll the one. That is, 21 is the higher. 
MATT: 21, it auto fails. 
LIAM: Auto fail. 
MATT: Like, (whooshes) gets shoved to there. 
LIAM: 15 feet. 
MATT: 15 feet. 
LIAM: I think that's off the ship. 
LAURA: Yes. 
LIAM: That's the thing with fleas, really fucking strong legs. Then I'll turn and approach the other one. I'll get right next to Chet, actually. 
MATT: Right next to Chet? 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: I'll just attack. That is a 15 to hit. 
MATT: 15, just hits. 
LIAM: Just hits, pushing attack. Strength save, 17. 
MATT: Natural 19, I keep getting natural 19s. 
LAURA: It's incapacitated. 
MATT: It's incapacitated. Yeah, you're right, so I'll say that he can't take any actions but I think it still, it saves against things. It doesn't auto fail saves, I don't think. I'll double check. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: ♪ I'll double check ♪ 
LIAM: Regardless, it takes 17 points of damage. 
MATT: Understood. 
TRAVIS: ♪ 17 points of damage ♪ 
MATT: Incapacitate... 
LAURA: Can't take actions or reactions. 
MATT: Correct. So yeah, it can still save. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So that's fine. Okay. So anyway, with that being said. So yeah, anyway, that was a natural 19. 
LIAM: Okay, so it's still on the ship, but I hit it for 17 points-- 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: -- of damage. 
MATT: Which knocks it back down to zero. 
LIAM: For another six seconds. (laughter) 
MATT: All righty. Does that finish your turn? 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm out, tapped. 
MATT: All righty. Ashton, you're up. 
TALIESIN: You think you can handle this? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Go. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to hit that tiny little motherfucker-- 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: -- that's sitting there and I'm going to do a reckless attack, because that's fun for... 29 to hit. 
MATT: Your minimal damage knocks him out. 
TALIESIN: Okay. He's down? 
MATT: (laughs) He's down. Like, you could roll the worst you can possibly roll and he is (thumps). 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go get our shit. I'm going to teleport 60 feet over there to just behind those two skeletons. 
MATT: Right there? 
TALIESIN: Am I within striking distance? 
MATT: Of the one right there, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Now, I'm going to use that second hit on that piece of shit. 
MATT: You got it. 
TALIESIN: The one on the right, that's 25 to hit. 
MATT: 25 to hit, minimum damage, knocks it down. 
TALIESIN: I'm also going to use my push to push him five feet to the left. 
MATT: Crumples in the middle there. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: You got it. 
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to, you're fine, I'm going to hop up and get ready in my next turn to grab the-- 
MATT: Up at the edge? 
TALIESIN: Actually-- 
MATT: Put you right there. 
LIAM: Those fucking skeletons are a pain in the ass. 
LAURA: Yeah, they are. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. 
MATT: Thing about ghost ships. They're a pain in the ass. 
TALIESIN: I don't even have to run. I actually, I end up just teleporting. I'm going to teleport right next to it. Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: (whooshes) Fuck. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Us, one week earlier: Ghost ship! (clapping) Yay! This'll be so cool. 
LAURA: Gosh. 
MATT: Finishing your turn? All right. (intense thumps) Climbing up the side of the boat-- 
LIAM: Ah! 
MATT: -- this. 
LIAM: So fast. 
LAURA: Wow, that was so fast. 
MATT: Their turn was next. But getting up and climbing the side of the boat and getting to the edge gets them their movement and then their action is going to rush forward towards you as a dash and get there and be like, "Captain, what's the plan?" They're going to look back at the captain and the captain puts their hand up like this, still looking at Laudna. 
LAURA: Was that a dash? Is it an action? 
MATT: Yeah, their action was their dash. It was movement and then dash, so they don't-- 
LAURA: But then they can't do it because they're incapacitated. 
LIAM: Up the side of the boat. 
TRAVIS: Until your turn? 
LIAM: No, yeah. 
LAURA: Until my turn, they're-- 
MATT: Oh, until your next turn? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So yeah, they're not going to get there then, you're right. 
LIAM: Fuck off, dead guy. 
MATT: Goes to back there. 
TRAVIS: "Guess I fucked up." That's a monstrous fail. 
MATT: All righty, it's really good. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's-- 
MATT: Thank you for the reminder. All righty, finishing their go. Chetney, then Laudna. 
TRAVIS: I will make-- (deeply) make my way (regular voice) towards Laudna and the captain and I will unsheathe Graz'tchar, the Luminary Blade. 
MATT: Okay. You pull it free and it gleams here from the fog that surrounds it. It gives off its own faint radiant glow and at the back of your mind, you hear, "Old friend, here you draw me forth. Together, we will return to that insidious place in the mountain and destroy the first of many enemies of freedom." 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Not yet, first we kill ghost pirates. I'll come up behind Laudna and hold the-- 
MATT: So dash up to there? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Hold the blade out and I'll say: (deeply) I beg you to reconsider if you want your compass. We ask but a simple journey across the seas. Fuck. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Just give him a little wink. Told you. 
MATT: All right, so that finishes your turn. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Because he is kind of listening, make a persuasion check on your point as well. 
MARISHA: Does it get advantage because, (mumbles)? 
MATT: No, because-- 
MARISHA: (mumbling) Okay. 
MATT: Unfortunately, no, but the DC isn't super high. 
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh. 
SAM: I mean I did cast Enhance Ability on you. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: But you fell unconscious and lost your concentration. (groaning) 
TRAVIS: A natural 17. 
MATT: 17. Looks at you, looks at the blade you're holding, you're holding it a threatening way. He's looking at it like someone who's enjoying their walk through an antique shop and glances back over at you, finishing your turn. Laudna, it's your go. 
MARISHA: (nervous scream) 
MATT: "So you're asking for passage. In trade. You all live, you give me my compass, and this fine weapon." 
TRAVIS: (deeply) What? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Just go: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) What do you mean, sorry? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Compass first, the sword upon arrival. 
MATT: "I've made clear the deal specifications. We end this now, or you all die." 
MARISHA: You know, a girl has to have collateral. Am I really supposed to trust a bunch of pirates? 
MATT: Make one final persuasion check. 
ALL: Come on! 
SAM: Come on. 
LIAM: Laudna. 
SAM: Guidance, Guidance, Guidance. (laughter) 
MATT: Now because of your success, the DC is pretty low right here. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: No argument. 
MATT: I'll set it at a 15 DC. 
ALL: (vocalizing) 
MATT: Oh jeez. 
SAM: (vocalizing) 
MARISHA: 15 or higher? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: (vocalizing) 
LIAM: Girl. 
LAURA: ♪ No, no ♪ 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it was on the... 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: You have a lot of modifiers. 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: Add those modifiers. 
MARISHA: 10. 
MATT: 10 "Collateral doesn't sound right to me. The blade now, the compass after, or I tell them to set loose." 
MARISHA: I look at Chetney. 
TRAVIS: (rapid growls) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (rabidly growls) 
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you. 
LIAM: Get rid of it. 
TRAVIS: I'll flip the blade so I catch the blade. 
MARISHA: Can't get rid of it. 
TRAVIS: I don't say anything about that yet. Yet. 
MATT: (Graz'tchar) "What are you doing?" (laughter) 
MATT: "We are bonded, you and I." 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Don't make this harder than it has to be. 
MATT: "Your whole destiny before you." 
TRAVIS: (deeply) We'll see each other again. Time cannot separate us, death is but a door. (laughter) 
MATT: The captain grasps the handle of the blade and holds it up. 
LIAM: Oh, come on. 
MATT: (Captain) "Accepted." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: As he bows his head, he closes his hand. All the skeletons that have been running away continue to run up onto the ship. The skeletons that are getting back up off the ground stop and snap up into their spaces and look back, no longer aggressive in their stance. The ones that are across the way that reform and eventually begin to return. But they're all casually walking now as the captain gives a horrible ghostly echoing whistle and they all begin to slowly return to the ship. 
TRAVIS: I swipe his head. (thumps) (laughter) 
MATT: And that's where we'll go to break. (groaning) 
ASHLEY: Fun! 
MATT: So we'll come back here in a few minutes and see how the rest of this conversation goes. 
LAURA: Parley! Parley! 
MATT: That was awesome.

Break[]
It is time! Time to wake up... to a new reality. To a blank canvas that I have painted in warmth and peace. In my new era, the choice is yours. Whether to live in quiet serenity... or bloody strife. To dwell in joyous prosperity... or bitter rivalry. You can face each other as sworn enemies... or united as brothers. For the storm is brewing. And soon you will discover... That even in this new era... one constant remains. There is always something worth fighting for. You have chosen to defy peace... then you have chosen war with a god!
(mysterious music) (gentle music) 
LAURA: The Midnight Queen is dead. As the bell tolls for Her Majesty, her succession looms in uncertainty, for with her dying breath, the queen invoked an ancient and deadly contest, compelling the Princesses of Twelvefold to meet in secret and battle one another, until the stroke of midnight reveals the victor, the new Midnight Queen. (fire roars) Erdene, the Gilded Champion; Dr. Lux, the Scholar Supreme; Rosaline, the Oneiromancer; Freya, Blood of the Tower; Hephesta, the Light Breaker; and then there's me, Boss No, the fairest of them all. Who will survive? (horse whinnies) Who will you choose? (dice rattling) Who will be Queen by Midnight? (gentle music) 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. (gasp) Could anything be more perfect? I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. Look at this. Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. You need this? You probably need this. (gasp) Could anything be more perfect? It's the little things in life. This is serioiusly magical. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. (adventurous music) 
TALIESIN: Those that rise from the trenches only to boldly dive into the catacombs of the Fairelands are few and far between. Any investigator, be they soldier or civilian, will eventually find themselves forced to abandon what is right for what must be done. The scars of war are deep and timeless. Those who survive must balance on a delicate thread of ever-fraying purpose, for to stare too deeply into the chasm of the past is to see nothing but a reflection of terror. When retribution crawls from the darkness, our inner fortitude is put to the test. The Circle of Needle & Thread. Assignment #533: Eye for an Eye. 
(tense mysterious music) (ominous music) 
Narrator 2: Where were we? Narrator 1 & 3: Utterly doomed Midst. Narrator 2: Oh, yes, that's right - Narrator 1: We're back! Narrator 2: - Utterly doomed Midst - Narrator 1: Yeah, it's still pretty doomed! Narrator 2: - At pretty much the moment where we last saw it. Well, that's not quite true. Narrator 1: It's a few hours later. Narrator 2: Stationary Hill is not looking so hot at the moment. Narrator 1: Garbage everywhere, flyers for the big sale of Midst strew upon the streets, doors open, broken boxes, crates, carts... Narrator 2: Abacuses, Welcome-to-the-Trust pamphlets. Narrator 1: It would be a nice place if it weren't for the colossally vast, quietly howling and increasingly close vast, terrifying, reality-gnawing tsunami of black fog ocean inbound rapidly. Narrator 3: Oh. that! Narrator 2: Oh, yeah. Narrator 1: It is a spectacularly terrifying scene. Listening to this, it may not seem particularly terrifying. But with the power of your imagination, you too can become very upset. Narrator 2: With our help. (epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music) 
MARISHA: Hey, Critters, it's me, Marisha Ray. I had exactly a minute and a half of free time today, so I thought I'd make a little unboxing video for y'all unpacking everything you get with a Twitch subscription to Critical Role. (bright music) (noises of struggle) Okay. (clicking) Safety third. (clicking) (ethereal voices laughing) What the fuck was that? (excited noises) So the first thing we've got here is our live and professionally moderated chat. Twitch is the only place that you can actually get this. You know, it's a little strange to hold because it's an amorphous concept, but honestly, you can't deny this craftsmanship. It's really well made, and-- Ah! Oh, you can post links in this, too! That's really cool, so yeah. Put that in your chat and click it. Oh yeah, this is cool. This is the ability to watch all of Critical Role's VODs immediately after the live broadcast ends and before they're uploaded to YouTube. Oh, it smells like... ranch? Oh wait. Oh, no, that's me. I had ranch on my salad earlier. Yeah, this smells like nothing. Oh, oh, here we have (grunts) gift subscriptions, which you can either give to a fellow Critter by name or at random using a fancy Twitch algorithm. You can give away a lot of subs with this, which I guess is why it's so heavy for something that's technically non-tangible with a value that's deeply subjective to the consumer. Oh, sick, yeah, I'm so excited to show y'all this part. With a Twitch subscription to Critical Role, you can use all of our incredible custom emotes in chat. We have so many emotes in here. Let's see, we have, oh, Art Dad, super cool. We got Ashley Hype, fun one. Oh, look at Trinket here, he's so-- Oh, oh god. (clattering and crashing) Oh god. (glass breaking) Uh, uh, ah! Broom, broom. Hang on, I can fix this. I can fix this. I'm fixing it! Jerry! Oh god, okay. I'm sorry, Trinket. (machine whirring) Yeah, that'll work. (gasping) I need more glue, this is not going to be enough. (tape stretching) Don't tell Rachel, okay? Okay, please nobody-- (crashing) (clattering) Schapiro, will you cut all this out? (electronic buzzing) 

Part II[]
MATT: Welcome back. As you all look around, the mist still gathering at the base of the cold front that is the ghost ship itself, the Crimson Abyss sitting here beach side as the rest of the skeletal crew slowly gathers to clamber back onboard. The captain still holds the hand out, gathering the crew. What are the rest of you doing? 
TALIESIN: I'm gathering-- 
MARISHA: I wave to everybody from the boat. We're friends now! We're going to go for a little ride! 
TALIESIN: See? Everything's fine. 
SAM: That's great. 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
SAM: No, I'm sorry. I was snippy with you, and that was uncalled for. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. I was just-- 
SAM: You saved my life twice. 
ASHLEY: Well-- 
SAM: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: You're welcome. You have this thing here in this realm called "guilt," and I really felt it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Well, you shouldn't. 
MARISHA: They don't have that in the Fey Realm? 
ASHLEY: Maybe, I've just never really felt it before, but I feel really strongly here for some reason. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it sucks. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Because you make a decision to do something, and then you feel bad in here. 
MARISHA: There are consequences? Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, consequences. Consequences. 
TRAVIS: Boo. 
ASHLEY: That's what it's called. Anyway, get on your wheel. Let's go. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Can you swim? 
SAM: I don't know. I have a propeller attachment. I'll use it as a motorboat. 
MATT: (motor whirring) 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I thought you hold it and put it-- 
LIAM: Plus those little wooden flat feet could be like flippers. 
SAM: Sure, that's a good combo. 
MATT: That's valid. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the hole and the boots. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Steamboat. 
MATT: You all manage to climb back onboard as the crew begins to right itself, gather their materials, weapons recovered. The sniper that had been knocked to the ground and had its crossbow taken, its crossbow is retrieved by one of the other crew members as they clamber onboard and hand it to her. The way they hand it to her, you can see that this female smoldering skeleton holds some station within the crew. You can also, now that you're up close and personal, you can see that there's the blue flame flickering in one socket. The other is just dark and vacant. 
LIAM: The sniper, that is? 
MATT: The sniper, yeah. The human one with the bush of black hair that had the shrill scream that you were combating with awhile begins to shout out commands to the rest of the crew. "Gather up! We're shoving off!" Begins to put their finger in the air as the captain still looks at the blade, makeshift belt loops it around the side, and now has both the saber at one side and the massive sword at the other, which almost drags across the deck of the ship. Looks over and addresses the rest of you, waiting for you all to gather up towards the top of the deck, the poop deck, if you will, where it wants to address. 
MARISHA: (laughs awkwardly) 
MATT: "So--" 
MARISHA: (laughs awkwardly) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Who are you and where are you going?" 
MARISHA: Oh, well, you see, we're Bells Hells, and we're sort of, you know, we're like pirates ourselves, you know? 
MATT: "Right." 
MARISHA: Yes, we've stolen. We've stolen crawlers and we've stolen airships. 
SAM: That's true. 
MARISHA: We were actually gifted an airship, but we-- 
LAURA: We crashed the shit out of it. 
MARISHA: We crashed it! 
TALIESIN: Directly into the face of one of our enemies. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, right in the face. 
MARISHA: Yes. So, you know. 
MATT: "Congratulations." 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "I'm Captain Novos. This is my vessel. This--" and they address over to the second in command and says, this is First Mate Woedders." 
LIAM: Wilders? 
MATT: Woedders. 
LIAM: Woedders. 
TRAVIS: Woedders. 
SAM: Woedders. 
MATT: Points to the smoldering skeleton. "That's our navigator, Cyrillia." 
MARISHA: Cyrillia. 
TRAVIS: Cyrillia. 
MATT: The first mate, Woedders, speaks. "And this is the rest of our crew! Jamal, Odo, Peters, Bruda, Vendallo, the Whitts Twins, Carmilla, Sanjay, and-- Keith?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) One skeleton in the back goes, "I've been with you for a hundred years!" 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: "It's Kyle!" (laughter) 
LIAM: Is that the little guy? 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Kyle! (laughs) 
LIAM: What kind of vibe or attention are we getting from the crew, by the way? 
MATT: A bunch of slightly impatient skeletons are curled around. They're not aggressive at the moment. They seem to be very much tethered to the energy of the captain, and you get the sense that the captain is the central point of power that tethers  the entirety of this crew and the ship's existence. 
SAM: Mm. 
MATT: So, they seem to almost be in an idle holding pattern until the captain gives some sort of directive or through the first mate insinuates an interest. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) We're looking for passage across these waters beyond the Vermilion Reef to the island of Kalutha. 
SAM: Do you need to be a wolf still? 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) I don't trust these motherfuckers. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) They're real stabby. 
MATT: "Kalutha? That can be done. Well, a deal was made. Where's the rest of it?" 
MARISHA: Oh, I thought you said you were going to deliver us first, and then you get your compass. 
MATT: "Blade first." 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, I thought he already gave you the blade. 
MATT: "And then compass after." 
MARISHA: That's what you said. 
MATT: "Aye." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Pirate negotiations! It's the best. 
SAM: After we get there? 
MARISHA: After we get there. 
MATT: "No." 
SAM: Oh, after the blade! 
MATT: "Aye." 
MARISHA: Oh, that's-- 
SAM: That's new. 
MARISHA: Mm, that's not fair! That's semantics! 
MATT: "You also know that I'm bound by my word." 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: Wait, how do I know that? 
MATT: He looks you up and down. "Maybe you haven't done your true research, then. Mm. Well." 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: "You're welcome to step off the boat." 
SAM: We haven't done research. 
MATT: "I'll take both." 
TRAVIS: We haven't done the true research. 
MARISHA: True research. 
MARISHA: Honestly, we sort of-- We didn't really do any research. We just heard about you from another woman and went like, that sounds great, and then-- (clicks tongue) 
SAM: You're bound by your word? Mystically, magically? 
MATT: "Well, when a deal is made." 
ASHLEY: What would happen if you-- Hi. What would happen if you break it? 
MATT: "I don't." 
ASHLEY: I know, but I'm just saying like a for instance. You say you're going to do something, and then you don't do it, do you die more? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "I don't." The eyes-- (flames ignite) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, okay. 
MARISHA: Well, how do we-- 
SAM: I have pretty good insight. Am I-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA and SAM: Do we think he's telling the truth? 
SAM: Insight. 21. I get a whisper! Someone else plug something. 
ASHLEY: WizKids! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Nice! That was good! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You guys, check out the Mortal Kombat one-shot. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Also, Chapter Two of Candela. 
MARISHA: (gasps) Candela, yeah. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: You can do all these things. 
LAURA: Cheez Whiz is pretty good. 
SAM: Matt's mouth right next to your ear is so nice. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) It's so warm. 
LIAM: Like ASMR? 
SAM: You get that every night? 
MARISHA: Are you-- Is this unlocking something in you? 
SAM: Oh my god! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You like whispers? 
SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Ooh, shiver me timbers! 
TALIESIN: New ASMR channel. 
MARISHA: Is this the beginning of our throuple? (laughter) 
MATT: Wow, Sam's been rolling insight-- 
SAM: I don't need you. 
MATT: -- a lot this episode! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Insight check! (desperately) Insight check! (laughter) 
SAM: I don't need redheads. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh my god! Samuel! 
MARISHA: I'll take that as a compliment to Q. (laughs) 
SAM: That's right. 
MATT: "So. Either I get the rest of the deal we made and we're all on our way, or we'll leave you here and take what's ours, anyway." 
SAM: I think we can trust him. At least on this part. 
MARISHA: (uncertainly) Hmm. Okay, well, I just want to say I feel like you duped me a little bit with trying to swap the order and sort of just saying words when clearly my interpretation was, I'll give you the sword, and then we get there, and then you get the compass. But! 
SAM: You just want him to note that you're upset? 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: Okay. (laughs) 
MATT: "Consider it a hard lesson about parleying on the sea." 
MARISHA: Feels more like a hard lesson just about you, but that's fair. At least shake on it. 
SAM: Ew. 
MATT: (dry cracking) Bony fingers curl around your bony fingers. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: (laughs) Cold, clammy flesh meets somewhat damp, frozen bone. 
TRAVIS: Bone-off. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Bone on bone. 
MATT: He holds there for a second. 
SAM: (laughs) The Marisha Ray story. 
LAURA: What's sexier than bone on bone? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We've gone bone on bone in this beach-off. 
MATT: The rest of you hear squeaking, almost like-- 
TRAVIS: Tendon. 
LAURA: Clickety-clacks. 
MATT: Like cold metal pushing against concrete. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Ugh. 
ASHLEY: (shudders) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Chalk. 
TRAVIS: (rusty squeaking) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (creaking) 
MATT: "Now." 
MARISHA: My eyes flare a little as well, just to meet his. 
MATT: "Give me my compass!" 
MARISHA: I pull him close to me. 
MATT: (growls) 
MARISHA: (growls) 
MATT: (snarls) 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: Fine! 
MATT: (growls) 
MARISHA: (growls) 
MATT: (growls) 
MARISHA: (growls) Chetney! 
TRAVIS: (screams) I shrivel back down. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (hyperventilating) (clear throat) 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: (chokes) Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: I take out the compass. Wait, where's the wooden one? Where's my replica? Thanks. It's pretty good, don't you think? You sure you don't want-- 
ASHLEY: Which one is it? 
MARISHA: Give him validation. 
MATT: The dark, smoldering skeleton has walked up behind and snatches the wooden one from your hand and goes-- 
TRAVIS: Ah, ah-- 
MATT: Looking at it with the one burning blue eye and goes, "It's made quite well, Captain." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Thank you! 
MATT: "The craftsmanship is second to none." 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Your first mate-- 
MATT: "Might I take it as a prize?" 
TRAVIS: Excuse me? 
ASHLEY: Wait, whoa. That wasn't part of the deal. 
TRAVIS: I didn't sign it, so it's practically worthless. 
LAURA: They're pirates. That's what they do. 
LIAM: Are we still parked, by the way? 
MATT: At the moment, yeah, still parked. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: How did you lose your compass? 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: Multipass. 
MATT: The captain folds his arms. "We were-- We were known in these parts for being successful at our privateering business. The downside is, you tend to make a few enemies. When all your enemies become friends, sometimes it doesn't end well. But we decided, maybe we weren't done. So here we are, and we've almost found them all." 
LAURA: What happens when you find them all? 
MATT: "I guess we'll find out." 
SAM: What else are you missing, treasure-wise? 
MATT: "The money's not too bad." You can see, now you're close up, the bony grin of the captain. It looks like it's a pale gray bone, but upon closer glance, you can see they're platinum-coated teeth on the inside of this blackened, old, withered bone grin. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MARISHA: He's got a platinum grill? That's sick. 
MATT: Yeah, basically. 
TALIESIN: Into it. 
MATT: "The money, not so much. But there are things that are personal to me. Items, keepsakes, trophies, and my navigation tools are quite a collection." 
TRAVIS: I agree. If you ever wanted to trade up in terms of craftsmanship, you could let me know. 
MATT: Grabs it, and as he pulls it away from you, you can feel this audible sigh of joy across the entire crew and the captain. (satisfied sigh) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yep, yep. 
MARISHA: Sorry, it's still so fresh in my head. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We literally could've done this 20 minutes before without beating the entire crew into the fucking water fives times. 
TRAVIS: That's fair. 
TALIESIN: That's fine, it's fine. 
MARISHA: It took me like three minutes to walk to the damn boat. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "Welcome to the Crimson Abyss. Find what quarters aren't taken. We've got three days' travel to your island." 
MARISHA: Three days. 
TRAVIS: Three days on a ghost ship? Holy shit. 
MARISHA: This is going to be cool. 
LAURA: What guarantee do we have that y'all aren't going to attack us as soon as we make land? 
MATT: "My word." 
SAM: Is there any, not for me, but is there any food and water on this ship for my friends here? 
MATT: "Oh yeah, we have a ghost chef with a bunch of ghost rolls and ghost mice. No, we don't have food! We're fucking dead!" 
TALIESIN: We have stuff in the hole. 
TRAVIS: We have some rations. 
TALIESIN: We're all right. And whatever you're cooking. 
ASHLEY: He can bake. 
SAM: I can bake a little, yeah. 
ASHLEY: We can catch some fish. 
SAM: Oh, we can go fishing. Do you guys have fishing rods and bait? 
MATT: "No." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Nets, perhaps? Or something to-- 
MATT: "No." 
SAM: -- trawl the-- All right. 
LAURA: I think we could probably find a way to catch some fish. 
TRAVIS: Standing this close to him, can I use my Hunter's Bane to get a closer look at, besides the eyes, any areas that are radiating any significance in his existence? 
MATT: Sure, go ahead and I'd say roll investigation or insight. Your choice. 
TRAVIS: I'll do investigation. 
MATT: You can have advantage on this because of your Hunter's Bane. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
MATT: 19. Within what bit of the coat you can see, there's that fierce, burning, blue light in each eye. It tends to flare with points that he's making as he speaks. You see within the shadow of the chest, glancing inside, there's a dull blue glow in the ribcage that almost pulses, not like a heartbeat because it's too slow, but it looks like there's metal in there, too. It looks like there is almost chains that are wrapped around this weird source of light within the chest. 
TRAVIS: Very cool. 
LIAM: The ship appears to just be an old, ancient wooden ship? Is there anything unnatural about-- 
MATT: The ship itself, the wood looks weathered. It looks like this boat would not be seaworthy. You can see holes in the hull. There is an odd pale moss and mold that's grown in places that seeps into every corner where the wood meets metal. The damage that you dealt to the deck of the ship looks like it's repaired itself slightly, but even the repairs bring it to a state of decent (laughs) disrepair. The sails themselves seem to blow with the wind and don't help, but the ship seems to have a will and a thrust of its own, and as now you've made the deal, the ship begins to pull away from the island of Slival. You can see the mist that billows out in front of it, obscuring the path before you, and yet the one who was introduced to you as the navigator, Cyrillia, the sniper with the one burning eye, has clambered back up to one of the crow's nests and produces a spyglass, but seems to look into the mist like it has no obscuration. As the ship begins to push outwards to the ocean and take you on the first leg of your journey, the rest of the crew begins to go about their business back under deck. The captain stands, looking over the edge, taking the seven of you in for a bit. "Not going to lie, maybe it'll be nice to have some new blood, or really even any blood on the ship for a bit. Make friends, stay comfy. Nap, if you want to." 
SAM: If we're going to be here for a couple days, do you need any repairs on the ship? I mean, should we spruce this place up? Make it look homey or colorful? 
MATT: "We like it how it is." 
SAM: What will you get out of this? Is that what you said? 
LIAM: He likes it how it is. 
MATT: "We like it how it is." 
SAM: Oh, how it is. Okay. 
MATT: "You all aren't from around here, are you? 
SAM: Your ghost accent-- 
LIAM: Is there anywhere-- 
MARISHA: It's so thick. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
LIAM: Is there anywhere we're not supposed to go, or do we have free reign to walk the levels of the boat, Captain? 
TRAVIS: Good question. 
MATT: "You can walk where you want on the level right below deck. My quarters are off limits." 
ASHLEY: Where are your quarters? 
TRAVIS and SAM: Okay! 
ASHLEY: I am just-- 
TALIESIN: Already? 
ASHLEY: Calm down, calm down! I'm just getting the lay of the boat. Lay of the land. 
LIAM: Lay of the captain? 
MATT: "The only double doors on the ship." 
ASHLEY: Say again? 
MATT: "They're the only double doors on the ship." 
ASHLEY: The only double doors. 
MARISHA: Three days of asking him what he said. (laughter) 
MATT: Over and over again. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We'll make it two. 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry. (laughter) 
MATT: "Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!" (laughter) 
LIAM: Enunciation is largely about the tongue and lips, and they're gone. 
MATT: Yep. (laughter) 
LAURA: So he's mostly just skeleton? 
MATT: Yeah, in fact, most of the crew is pretty much straight skeletal with little shreds of wispy, dried skin in some places  and hair that's tattered and dangling. 
TRAVIS: Make yourself comfortable. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (mumbled pirate gibberish) (laughter) 
MATT: That one. 
ASHLEY: When did you pass? For real? 
TRAVIS: Gas? 
MATT: "Decades ago. Who can keep count? It's been more fun since I have." 
MARISHA: So you truly do love this life of undeath. 
MATT: "For now. You know, variety is the spice of life. One day, maybe we'll get bored of it. Maybe by the time I find everything that's ours." 
MARISHA: Now that you have your compass, where does it point to? 
MATT: "That wasn't part of our deal." 
MARISHA: Oh, what's wrong? You scared? 
MATT: "No, I'm just private." 
MARISHA: (groans) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) (groans like Marisha) 
TALIESIN: I can't believe no one's actually said this. Do you know what the fuck is going on out there, by the way, with everywhere right now? Have you noticed any of the crazy fucking shit that's going on? Has it affected your shit, what's going on right now? 
MATT: "I have no idea what you're talking about." 
TALIESIN: Holy shit! 
MARISHA: You mentioned that you're bound to the Strife Emperor? 
MATT: "Aye." 
SAM: Who dat? 
MARISHA: Yes, who is that? Is he a god? 
MATT: "Some would call him a god. He's kind of a guiding persona in the pantheon for those who like to get what they want, take what they want." 
MARISHA: Thematic. 
TALIESIN: Been a little distant lately? 
SAM: Do we know who that is? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: Do any of us know Strife Emperor? 
MATT: Make a religion check, if you'd like. 
SAM: How do I have a negative one to religion? 
TALIESIN: I mean, you just discovered it. 
MATT: That's true. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Like a week ago. 
MATT: What'd you get? 
TRAVIS: 21. 
LAURA: 15. 
MATT: 15? 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MATT: Strife Emperor is definitely one of the Betrayer Gods in the pantheon. They are largely a god of tyranny, of conquest. They would sit in the realm of lawful evil. They believe in structure through domination. Those that are in power are there because they deserve it or have earned it by showing their strength, and those who should be bent were made to kneel before them. That's the gist of it. You're uncertain what the detailed influence in this realm is. You have very little personal experience or knowledge of the Shattered Teeth. But you get the sense in the way he talks about the Strife Emperor, it's less about reverie and worship and more like, "Eh. If you've got to pray to something in dark moments, let it be someone I can agree with." 
TRAVIS: Well... 
TALIESIN: That might not be an issue for that long. 
MARISHA: All the gods are a bit under threat at the moment. I don't know if you've felt it. 
MATT: "Been a bit busy." 
LIAM: You bound to these waters around the islands? 
MATT: "For now." 
LAURA: That's what you're going to get out of all your objects? Freedom? 
MATT: "Maybe." 
TALIESIN: What happens if your god disappears? 
MATT: "I don't know." 
TALIESIN: That'll be an interesting day. 
TRAVIS: You know, what we're good at is finding things. Got quite the nose on us, some of us do. So if you have any of these other missing items that, I don't know, are on land, we could be persuaded to perhaps sniff them out.
TALIESIN: You're not getting your sword back. 
TRAVIS: Fucking, don't cut me off at the knees! 
TALIESIN: (cackles) 
SAM: He's right, we're really good at finding stuff. 
MATT: "So am I, obviously." 
ASHLEY: Well... 
LAURA: We sort of helped. 
MARISHA: We called you. 
LAURA: We stuck it in the water. 
MARISHA: We literally went like, bloop! 
MATT: "Right, and I found you when you did. It was really fast. We were right there." 
TRAVIS: The response time was incredible, truly. 
LAURA: Seriously, how'd you get here so fast? 
MATT: "It's part of the deal. I don't fully understand it, but, you know, we're not going to question it." 
ASHLEY: How many more pieces are left? Did you already cover this? 
SAM: He didn't say a number. 
TRAVIS: He's (pirate voice) private. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you're private? 
MATT: "There's been enough questions for a bit. Nice to meet you, Bells Hells. Make yourselves comfortable. If it gets a bit chilly, sorry. Just how it is here. Anyway. I'm going to go below deck, take some time to contemplate." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: He pulls the blade out, looks at it for a bit. "I know, I know. Let's talk." 
TRAVIS: Huh? What? 
SAM: Chetney! 
TALIESIN: I think all of these were very good decisions. 
SAM: Are you okay giving up that blade? 
TRAVIS: I mean, no! 
MARISHA: Sorry, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: I feel like we struck up a rapport. 
MARISHA: Wait, what? 
TRAVIS: I feel like we have struck up a rapport as a group, and so it was my duty, my duty, to exchange something of great value for our shared goals. 
SAM: Seemed like you really liked that sword. 
TRAVIS: Yes, it was a-- Yep! 
SAM: You're not feeling anything strange in your body after giving it up? You're not hurt psychically, or--? 
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm a little fucked up. 
SAM: Oh, I can give you some healing. 
TRAVIS: I'm a little weak. It's a little chilly. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I don't know if you wanted to cook up some-- 
LIAM: Are they paying much attention to us right now? 
TALIESIN: I assume we're short resting at this point. 
MATT: Not at the moment. Some of them are looking out. Most of them are below deck, and there's three, and the first mate, and the navigator. 
LIAM: The captain's gone. 
MATT: Cyrillia is still up there. The captain has gone below deck. It's just the first mate and three other crew members. 
LIAM: I'm sorry, with the captain gone, they're about their duties? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Just a reminder, we also have the reef moss balm. We have two of those. We have the slickshimmer oil and the vial of cleansing flame, which if you haven't looked at that, holy shit. 
MARISHA: That's the one where it gets rid of maladies or something? 
TRAVIS: Kind of. You've got to fuck yourself up to get rid of it. It's pretty dumb. It's a cool item. 
TALIESIN: We have these weird motherfucking boots. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, what do the boots do? 
TRAVIS: We don't know. 
TALIESIN: Go on your feet? I'm not sure. 
SAM: I don't know that I can Identify them. 
TALIESIN: We'll do it tomorrow. 
SAM: No, I mean, I don't know that I can. 
LAURA: What do you mean? 
SAM: Well-- 
LAURA: You've always been able to do that. 
SAM: I know but, you know, there's three attunement slots, and I've got your staff attuned now. 
LAURA: Why? Just un-attune to it. You don't need it right now. 
SAM: Okay, but what if we need to teleport somewhere or something? 
LAURA: In the next three days? 
SAM: What if all these pirates attack us? 
LAURA: We're not going to be able to teleport. Well, shit's weird here in the Shattered Teeth. I don't think we're going to be able to teleport. 
LIAM: How long does it take to zero in? An hour or so? 
SAM: I guess I can just attune and attune. 
LIAM: We got nothing else to do on this boat. 
SAM: Okay. I'll switch attunement, and I will Identify that thing. 
TRAVIS: Famous last words. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I love it. Ooh! 
LAURA: He's been waiting! What does it do? 
TALIESIN: ♪ I've been ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Waiting ♪ 
SAM: They're just Boots of Speed. Just Boots of Speed. Bonus action, click those boots. Liam knows this well. 
TALIESIN: Oh, just Boots of Speed? 
LAURA: They're not Boots of Haste. 
MATT: No. 
SAM: Oh, Boots of Speed. "You can use a bonus action to click your boots together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed. "Any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage. If you click your heels together again, you end this effect. When the boots' property's been used for 10 minutes, that's it for the day." 
TRAVIS: 10 minutes, you can double your speed? 
LAURA: That needs to go to somebody that does not have a good distance. 
SAM: It requires attunement. 
MARISHA: Or one of the fighters. I'm good. 
SAM: Ashton needs to get up close and personal in battle. 
TALIESIN: Oh man. 
TRAVIS: I don't know if you saw that last fight. 
LAURA: You have good teleporting abilities, though. 
TRAVIS: He was fucking hopscotching all over the place. 
LAURA: You're able to jump around. 
TALIESIN: Sometimes. 
ASHLEY: With that, he would be-- 
TRAVIS: Bamfing all over the place. 
TALIESIN: And sometimes-- 
MARISHA: Sometimes. 
TALIESIN: Oh, there are terrible things I could do with that. 
LIAM: What about you? What about a speed wolf? 
SAM: Oh yeah, speed wolf's not a bad idea. 
LAURA: That's the thing, Chet's kind of limited, and he can't ever teleport. 
TRAVIS: I only got 35 feet. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
LIAM: His legs are the shortest of all. 
SAM: Can you do Misty Step or anything? 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
SAM: What about you? You can fly and stuff, can't you? 
LIAM: She's got her leap. 
TALIESIN: Turn into a bird. 
ASHLEY: I can do anything I want. I have a 35 walking speed. I think somebody else-- 
SAM: Orym, no, not you? 
LIAM: I lived that life. 
LAURA: Yeah, he's fast. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: He's fast fast. 
LIAM: I love my flea boots. I'm very partial to them. 
SAM: It's up to you two. 
TRAVIS: I just lost my third. Bye, Graz'tchar. 
LAURA: Oh... 
SAM: Ashton? 
LIAM: I mean, don't give up. 
SAM: Chetney? 
LIAM: You got three days to figure that problem out. 
LAURA: Rollies for it? Arm wrestle? 
TALIESIN: Want to Rollies for it? 
TRAVIS: Sure! 
TALIESIN: Into it. 
SAM: Oh shit, this is a high stakes Rollies. 
ASHLEY: This is high stakes. 
MATT: Best two out of three, or a single roll? 
TRAVIS: Oh, two out of three? 
TALIESIN: Two at the same time? 
MARISHA: Two out of three. 
TRAVIS: Singles for drama. 
LIAM: Prolonged pleasure. 
TRAVIS: 15. 
TALIESIN: 17. (oohing) 
TALIESIN: Second one, second one. New die, new die. 
SAM: One Rollies down. 
TALIESIN: What's the hammer mean? 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
SAM: What a dick. I love it. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
TRAVIS: I know when I'm beat. I know when I'm beat. 
TALIESIN: If we find more stuff, we can chat. 
TRAVIS: I'll just sit over here with my walker. 
SAM: Well, hey! 
TALIESIN: You're just bleeding everywhere. 
TRAVIS: I know! 
SAM: Chetney, do you want the Staff of Dark Odyssey? Then you can control our teleporting, and it also gives you Misty Step. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Don't you need arcane shit to use it? 
SAM: I don't know. 
MARISHA: Well. 
SAM: It just says, oh, "attunement by a spellcaster." Are you a spellcaster? 
LAURA: You can cast spells. 
MARISHA: You can cast spells! 
MATT: He's not a spellcaster. 
TALIESIN: Not a spellcaster. 
TRAVIS: I just have some touch stuff, and Minor Illusion. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god, this is dark. 
TRAVIS: Thanks, though. 
TALIESIN: I am so sorry that I'm taking these. If we find another object-- 
TRAVIS: I'm going to make some roller blades. It's going to be awesome. 
SAM: Wooden roller blades? 
TRAVIS: Yep! (wood clunking) 
TALIESIN: This is mean, this is Vax mean. Yeah, no. 
LAURA: This poor little old man. You should help the poor little old man. 
TRAVIS: Give me your hammer, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. Actually, I'll tell you. What other shit you got? 
SAM: Yeah, what are you unattuning to now? 
TALIESIN: Nothing, I got a free slot. 
SAM: You had a free slot? 
LAURA: Oh, you both have free slots? 
SAM: Oh my god! 
LAURA: They both had free slots. 
LIAM: He's got the rod, but that's not attunement. 
ASHLEY: What if you each wear one boot? 
LIAM: Ha! I like that. 
SAM: A really fast circle. 
TALIESIN: So we have to click them together. 
TRAVIS: I'm good, I'm good. I've got a Butcher's Bib. I've got a scythe, and I got a ring of, you know, don't die. I'm good. 
TALIESIN: A Ring of Don't Die? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Temporal Salvation. 
TALIESIN: Really? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's from-- My ex gave it to me. 
TALIESIN: I thought you were more of a gambling man. That surprises me. 
TRAVIS: Not when you see what this thing does. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, depending on what you wanted to unattune, we could have a conversation about this. 
TRAVIS: I have the scythe, the Butcher's Bib, or the Ring of Temporal Salvation. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to look these things up. We'll have a conversation. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: As we have stated, we have three days, so maybe we can (mutters) get your sword back. 
TRAVIS: What did you say? You stroked out a little there. 
SAM: No, she's speaking the same language as the captain. 
MARISHA: (pirate voice) Maybe we can get your sword back! 
LIAM: Put your lips back on, Laudna. Put your lips back on. 
TRAVIS: It's about time that we had one! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Footsteps, footsteps, footsteps, footsteps. 
ASHLEY: What time is it? 
MATT: Travel for a bit here, it's probably, you stayed overnight, it's mid-afternoon, maybe. 
LIAM: We have no sun. 
MATT: It's hard to tell. 
LIAM: There's nothing to read. 
MATT: You get the sense it's somewhere in the early afternoon, maybe, mid-afternoon. 
LAURA: We stayed overnight, we talked to a person in a toad. 
TRAVIS: It doesn't feel like the marine layer or the haze is caused by the ship or interacting with the ship, it's just moving through the haze. 
MATT: It's thicker around the ship. 
LAURA: So there's no way to tell where we are. 
MATT: You're at the whim of this ship with no concept of what direction you're going or what's nearby. You have maybe a 50- to 100-foot viewing radius around the ship. 
LAURA: Does it go all the way up? Is it above, in the-- 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah? 
MATT: It's a tall mist. 
TRAVIS: Peering over the side, remembering how fucking cold it was right by the ship, is the water interacting strangely, or can we see any aquatic life under the breaks in the water, or as the ship moves? 
MATT: Yeah, as you glance over, you can see in the water occasionally, there's sea life that, you look down, course through, though the sea life that's there is avoiding the ship. The few things you see are curving away from it. It doesn't hold a lot of joy to those denizens of the ocean. 
TRAVIS: That's cool. 
LAURA: Cool. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Ooh, I love that noise. 
MATT: So. 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Well. 
LAURA: Are you going to make a deal? You look like you're about to make a deal. 
TRAVIS: Huh?! 
TALIESIN: What were you going to unattune? 
TRAVIS: Take your pick. I'm an open market. 
TALIESIN: Ring for the boots? 
TRAVIS: You want the ring? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's the only thing that-- vaguely interests me. 
TRAVIS: You got it. 
TALIESIN: That bib is so fucking ugly. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It really is. It's terrible. 
TALIESIN: It's just disgusting. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: I have nice clothes. 
TRAVIS: Ashton, I'm so touched! 
TALIESIN: All right, well, thanks to the ring, I can pull them off of your dead body eventually. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: So, you know, it's just a loan. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Don't tell my bae. 
TALIESIN: Never. 
LIAM: Just got to find you some wings now. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: That'd be fun. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Where's-- Yeah, so Cyrillia is still up in the crow's nest, right? 
MATT: Yeah. But you can climb if you want to address them. 
TALIESIN: I may climb. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: If you're going to go talk to the navigator, maybe get us a map or look at their map and see if you can sort of remember. 
TALIESIN: They don't have a map. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: They're ghosts. 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
SAM: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, in general they have nothing. They want nothing. 
TRAVIS: In general. 
TALIESIN: They need nothing. I mean, they're ghosts. I can't believe this is actually a real ship. I'm a little concerned that we're not falling through the floor. 
MARISHA: It is odd. 
TALIESIN: It is, isn't it? 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
LAURA: Maybe this is one of the items he got back. 
SAM: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LIAM: Anyone want to look in the dark and scary inside? 
SAM: We're going to have to at some point. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Kind of do. 
ASHLEY: We should go see if there's any empty quarters. 
TALIESIN: Well, we got to sleep somewhere, don't we? 
LIAM: Right, got to figure that out. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
LAURA: It's probably going to be colder below deck. What do you think? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's a good question. 
LIAM: Only one way to find out. 
LAURA: ♪ (cheerful humming) ♪ 
MARISHA: Come on! Imogen, come with me. Okay. 
MATT: All right. What are you doing? 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
MATT: Were you doing anything? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to up the-- I was trying to remember the name of the ring really quickly. 
MATT: Ring of Temporal Salvation. 
TALIESIN: Temporal, okay. Yeah, I'm going to go up to the crow's nest. 
LAURA: You're going to get so much shit from Aabria. 
TRAVIS: This is awesome. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: You climb up the mast, past the tattered sails to the upper level where Cyrillia is currently perched and glancing over, seemingly lost in thought. Then hearing you approach, they quickly, (throat clear) spy glass out, looking off in the distance, almost not paying you any mind. 
TALIESIN: Hey! 
MATT: "(grunt of acknowledgement)" 
TALIESIN: I tap the eyes. How'd you get yours? 
MATT: "Carved out. 
TALIESIN: Hm. 
TRAVIS: (mouthed) Carved out?! 
TALIESIN: Lose a bet? 
MATT: "No, I was making a point." 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: Was the point made? 
MATT: "I don't need both to be the best navigator." 
TALIESIN: Point fucking made. Mine was a window. I don't think there was really much of a point. It was a very interesting window. 
MATT: "Looks like the window came with you." 
TALIESIN: (laughs) It kind of did. Well, you know. These things happen. 
MATT: "You make do with what you're given." 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I used to think that. Then one day, pretty recently, I realized that I hadn't been given really very much, and I thought about that and, I don't know, I got real angry. And I just don't know how to stop feeling that. 
MATT: "Anger's good." 
TALIESIN: It is. 
MATT: "It makes things happen." You watch as the little veins of smoldering light in between the bones flare for a second, embers almost burn off. You get the sense now, at this close proximity, this is the skeleton of a fire genasi. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Dope. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. This is all an anger trip, really. Do you ever feel robbed? Like you had a good thing and someone just took it from you? 
MATT: Looks down towards the ship for a second and then covers quickly. 
TALIESIN: I pretend I didn't see that. 
MARISHA: Oh, interesting. 
TALIESIN: I had my first encounter with a god. 
MATT: "Lucky you." 
TALIESIN: Not really. Confirmed a lot of suspicions I had, which is, I don't know. I used to think they just don't notice and, you know, there's a layer of us that drop below the radar. Maybe that's true, but I got one to notice, and it didn't like me. So I'm considering not liking them right back. 
MATT: "Good. Fuck 'em." 
TALIESIN: Oh, I plan to, and we can. Things are changing out there. Even whatever creature that cursed this boat may not be long for this world. The red moon, (sighs) something's going to get released. No one knows what's going to happen. 
MATT: You see when you mention the red moon and the navigator gets this odd turn of the skull, like it's putting pieces together. 
TALIESIN: Can anyone else see past this fog or just you? 
MATT: "Just me." 
TALIESIN: So you're the only one who knows what the moon looks like right now. 
MATT: "I haven't seen it in a long time." 
TALIESIN: It's up there. You should look. 
MATT: "That's why I'm worried." 
TALIESIN: Wait, you can't see it right now? 
MATT: "No. I haven't seen it in weeks. I haven't said anything." 
TALIESIN: (exhales) Things are changing, and no one knows which side of the coin is going to land at this point. 
MATT: "Hmm." 
TALIESIN: So if I were you, and I only say this because I really have an affinity for people who have fucked up their eyes, I'd think about what you have and what it's worth, and is it worth anything? Then, I don't know, from the feeling I get, you've been here a long time. I don't really know if you actually know what real anger is. 
MATT: "You don't know me." 
TALIESIN: Nah, but I know being fucking angry. I start heading down. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I learned a lot there. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
MATT: For those of you going below deck-- 
TALIESIN: Yes! 
MATT: Indeed, the temperature drops dramatically as you go below deck. I mean, your breath was already visible, but below, you're immediately. (shivers) It's cold. You're going to want to bundle up if you have the means of doing so to sleep here with any sort of comfort. It feels like you're walking through a meat locker. But as you go below deck, the first thing that catches you is the sound of a violin. (gasping) 
MARISHA: It's so creepy. I love it. 
MATT: As you pass into this open area, you can see there are some bunks set out and a common area space. You can see one of the skeleton crew who has a little fiddle that they're in the process of-- 
LIAM: Jaunty? 
MATT: -- playing with. Just a gentle, just looking at it. It's just a little off-key. They're tuning it as they go. Some of them are sitting around and having a conversation. There's a table in the corner. It looks like a few are playing some games of chance. You can see on one of the bunks, it's just a pile of bones. (laughs) (laughter) 
MATT: One of them took a nap and went (bones scattering). (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's the way to call it. 
LIAM: He rolled a hundred on the d100. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Well, he went in his sleep, so, you know. 
LIAM: What do you think? Do you think we're going to sleep down here, or--? 
LAURA: Yeah, it's really fucking cold. 
LIAM: Or up top where it's warmer? 
MARISHA: Maybe. 
LAURA: Yeah, I know. 
MARISHA: I mean, it seems like this boat can regenerate. Maybe we can still make a little fire. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I wonder if it's warmer in the hole by a few degrees. 
MARISHA: It might be. 
SAM: That's interesting. 
TRAVIS: Extra-dimensional space. 
MARISHA: It's not a bad idea. 
LIAM: Typically true. 
SAM: Uh-huh. Yep. Holes are warm. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. 
ASHLEY: Cozy. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Comforting. 
SAM: Dark. 
LAURA: Do they-- 
ASHLEY: Dark. 
LIAM: Snug. 
LAURA: Do the skeletons look like they're talking to each other at all? They're just being a normal group? 
MATT: Yeah, they're just being a normal crew. I mean, once you walk in, a few of them look over and watch as you enter. Some of them are quiet, some of them go back to playing their dice games at the table. Seems like normal crew. They're just a bunch of skeletons. 
LAURA: Weird. 
MATT: In a frozen, you know, space internally. They have lanterns that hang and sway, but even the light within them is a pale white light as opposed to a warm flame. 
TRAVIS: Could I go over to one of them, just enjoy the music, and say: Oh, you guys look like a tight-knit crew. What does the captain like? What are his passions? 
MATT: The fiddling stops. (laughs) Most everyone turns and looks to you in the silence. One of them that you saw was pointed out as Bruda, who you can see is a feminine skeleton in presentation, with a jet black scarf that's tied around the skull and two gold rings that are embedded in the bone around where the nose would be. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
MATT: Leans forward. "The captain is looking for his things. That's what he likes." 
TRAVIS: Oh, that makes a lot of sense. I just didn't know if he might appreciate a thank you for the lift, but looking for his things. 
MATT: "He likes manners, yeah." 
TRAVIS: Manners? 
MATT: "Good manners." 
TRAVIS: Oh. Thank you for that information. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "You're welcome." 
ASHLEY: Wait, where are you all from? Because you have a very thick-- You all have the same-- 
TRAVIS: All over, or--? 
ASHLEY: -- kind of an accent. 
MATT: They look each other and another one of them leans forward. "We're a bit smattered around from Wildemount and some of these islands. We sort of came together as a crew over time, but yeah. Well, some days it's hard to remember where we came from." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LIAM: What's the deal with the witch twins? What's the their story? 
MATT: You look over at the Whitts twins and-- 
SAM: This Whitts twins? 
MARISHA: Witch twins. 
LIAM: The witch twins. 
MATT: No, Whitts. 
LIAM: Oh, Whitts! I thought it was witch. Okay. 
MATT: Sorry no. The Whitts twins. They are these two halfling skeletons that are currently in the process-- They are two of the four at the gaming table that have-- You look at the table and there's gold coins, there's piles of teeth, there's, you know, wooden shaved dowels with letters burnt into them. There's a collection of buttons, just whatever random things could be used as ante for different games over and over and over again that don't really serve any monetary purpose beyond just going through the motions of what they did in life. But the two Whitts twins are these nearly identical halfling skeletons that both have one hand between the two of them of cards that are glancing over, looking at the cards and then looking back and trying to listen in to the conversation and such. 
LAURA: Don't y'all ever get bored? 
MATT: There's a stagnant pause and they all look at each other. There's a resounding unified, "No! (echoing)" 
LIAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: I mean, you're playing with buttons and pebbles. It seems a little unfair to not have at least a little coin. The captain doesn't share? 
MATT: They all look at each other. "(laughs)" They all start laughing at once. The first one that you were talking to, Bruda, goes, "Oh, the Captain shares." 
MARISHA: Oh? 
MATT: "The captain's very generous." 
MARISHA: What does he share? 
MATT: "Whatever we take that's not part of his initial belongings." 
MARISHA: Like buttons? 
MATT: There's almost a frustrated resignation to the response. An immediate wave of disinterest comes over them. "Look." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "We're not used to having guests, so I apologize if we're a little awkward." 
TRAVIS: No, no, no, this is good. 
ASHLEY: No, yeah. 
TRAVIS: This is very homey. 
MARISHA: This is great. 
LAURA: We're always a little awkward. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we are. 
SAM: We don't mean to sound judgmental. I think this is great. You guys have a little life down here. 
LIAM: It's our first time on a ghost ship. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: "We've killed a lot of people." 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. Yeah. 
MATT: "Hard to make friends." 
TRAVIS: Are there other ghost ships on the high seas, or any-- 
LIAM: Competition? 
TRAVIS: -- natural enemies you might have? 
SAM: Oh yeah. Or do sea beasts attack you ever? 
LAURA: I was wondering about that, too. 
TRAVIS: Because we will fuck them up! We will throw down! Sorry. 
MATT: "Sea beasts don't bother us, and we've not met another ghost ship, though I've heard tales that they're out there. Maybe we could." Another one sits up. He was the one who was pointed out as Jamal earlier, and goes, "I'd like to meet others. That'd be fun." 
MARISHA: Oh! It must be so lonely. 
TRAVIS: Is that Kyle? (laughs) 
MATT: No, that's Jamal. 
TRAVIS: Oh okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Jamal or Shamal? 
MATT: Jamal. 
MARISHA: Jamal. 
TRAVIS: Shamal? Is that necessary? 
LAURA: Did you say Jamal or Schmal? (laughter) 
MATT: This is the schmal schkeleton. (laughter) 
MATT: Schnap out of it! All right. (laughter) 
LIAM: Orym's inched his way over to the violinist. It's really good. 
MATT: This is the skeleton who's introduced as Sanjay. 
LIAM: Sanjay. 
MATT: Who has human or elven features, or perhaps half-elven, hard to tell. A bleached, white skull that you can see has etchings around where some of the features might be. It looks beautiful, almost like a henna carving into the skull in places that decorate it, and has a piece of straw that hangs out of the mouth, that is bent in the middle and hangs, and is tuning the violin. 
LIAM: Did you play when you were alive? 
MATT: "That's true." 
LIAM: Oh. Do you take requests? 
MATT: "I've never taken a request, ever." 
LIAM: First time? 
MATT: "What are you requesting?" 
LIAM: Have you ever heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? 
MATT: "Who hasn't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? (scoffs)" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: I would take "Beads of Love." 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: If you know it. 
MATT: "I-I-I've never tried to play it on a violin, but I'll give it a shot." 
MARISHA: He's wearing a Scanlan reunion tour t-shirt. (laughter) 
MATT: I didn't even notice. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you're that guy. 
LIAM: What? The best character in the history of Critical Role? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Gotta pull my motherfucking ♪ Carved into his clavicle. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: It takes a minute for Sanjay to get into it, but then it becomes this gentle, airy, fun rendition, it's kind of like "Beads of Love," you can hear the melody in it, but, also, it doesn't quite have the same energy from what you've experienced before, but it's not bad. 
TALIESIN: Ghost violiny version of "Beads of Love." 
LIAM: Nothing lives up to the original. 
ASHLEY: (violin strums) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah, 
LIAM: It's funny because it's naughty. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Mm, I'd love to hear the lyrics sometime. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Is Kyle around? 
MATT: Kyle is the one (laughs) that was napping in a pile. (laughter) 
SAM: Oh. Kyle the pile. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: He had a hard outing. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: He was weary. 
MATT: He just wanted to take a nap. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He got Gallaghered a couple times. 
ASHLEY: I'm so tired. 
TALIESIN: That was some naturally occurring Vicious Mockery. It was just one shot. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: "I've been with you for 100 years!" 
MARISHA: He's the only one who killed somebody, so. Poor guy. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Maybe he earned the nap. 
SAM: Poor guy. 
MARISHA: Poor guy. 
TALIESIN: Poor Kyle. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to float around and see. 
TRAVIS: No, you're not going to steal from Kyle. 
ASHLEY: No. 
SAM: You can steal whatever you want. 
ASHLEY: Just one bone! Just one femur bone. 
SAM: Just steal whatever you want. 
MARISHA: What happened? This is what happens. 
TALIESIN: I was slowly crawling my way downstairs. 
MARISHA: You slowly pick away at them. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I know, just one? 
MATT: What are you doing, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk around and see if I can find the double doors. I'm not going to go in. I just want to see the lay of the ship. 
MATT: Okay, yeah. So as soon as you head down from the deck, the first stairs descend, and they switch back or lead down a hall. The switchback is where you first went that led into this common area, with the cots and such. Then beneath that is the deeper storage hall, the cargo hull. But from the stairs that descend down, the hallway that goes straight leads to the double doors 10 feet later. So you remember walking past them as you all first descended into this open area. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
MATT: So yeah, you know where they are. 
ASHLEY: All right. That's it, I just wanted to know where they were. 
MATT: Okay. Well. 
TALIESIN: Is this where the violin music is coming from? 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Holy shit. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: It's a party. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Who did this? The whole patterning? The one with the-- 
MATT: Oh yeah, the musician? 
TALIESIN: Holy shit, that's cool. 
MATT: "T-Thank you, that's Vendallo." 
TALIESIN: Vendallo? 
MATT: Points over at the game table, and there's one thicker skeleton that, based on the jaw and the brow, it looks to be orcish, half-orcish, holds a presence of strength and an honorable majesty for a skeleton in the room. And has a hand of cards in one hand that's hanging off to the side, and the other is in the process of counting quietly other people's hands in his own way, invested in the tactics of the current game of play. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
TRAVIS: Do they all have a blue glimmer of a sort in their sockets or just some? 
MATT: They do, it's very faint in most of the crew, brighter in the immediate secondhand crew of Cyrillia and Woedders. 
TRAVIS: Cyrillia. 
MATT: The captain is the most vibrant burning flame. 
SAM: Do y'all have cannons on this ship? 
MATT: "N-N-No, no cannons. Even just the pistols that we have here were taken from recent ships. That's a fun recent discovery. Otherwise, we're just used to more of the classic ballista-style assaults." 
SAM: Oh, got it. 
TRAVIS: You've stolen a lot of stuff, I imagine, as you've been killing people, yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is there any stuff you're particularly proud of? Treasure, items? 
SAM: Oh yeah, loot, booty? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, who else you going to brag to? Impress us. 
MATT: (laughs) Make a persuasion check. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're feeling-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Aw, fucking-- (laughs) 
SAM: Come on! 
LIAM: Goddamn it. 
MARISHA: No. 
TRAVIS: Persuasion? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: 12. 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: 12. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: They're crew members, by the way. 
MATT: "The best thing about, uh, finding and keeping delightful things is not letting people know what you have." 
LAURA: Is that true? 
MATT: "Because then they can't try and take it from you." 
ASHLEY: Oh, well, I wouldn't know. 
LAURA: Right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: I-I don't steal. 
ASHLEY: None of us do that. 
SAM: Actually, Fearne's quite an adept pickpocket. 
ASHLEY: Okay, well, we're just coming out with it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Well, I'm just saying. 
MARISHA: Did you just say that out loud? 
SAM: If they're proud of their thieving, maybe a little friendly competition. 
LAURA: Oh, a thieve off? 
ASHLEY: Oh, like a little game? 
SAM: Yeah, maybe in the next 24 hours, maybe if she can swipe something off of you, you would show us some of your booty? 
MATT: They all look at each other a little strangely. "How would you even measure such a competition?" 
SAM: I don't know, I'm pretty sure you'll know it when she shows you something that she's purloined from your person. 
MATT: "Well, our methods of larceny are a bit more upfront and brutal." 
SAM: You don't think you have the skills to pick her pocket? She's just a sweet little deer person. 
MATT: "Maybe Odo." Bruda looks behind, and you can see in the far, far back corner is this tall, thin skeleton-- 
SAM: (like Yoda) Pick her pocket, I can. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: -- who has a dark coat that's tattered just past the knees and a collar that's flipped up a bit, and is just sitting there and is in the process of picking out what looks like seaweed that's bunched into parts of the finger bones. This is one of the back crew that was chasing you down towards the end that fell into the hole. 
TRAVIS: Butthole. 
SAM: We forgive. 
TRAVIS: Yodo? 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: Odo. 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Odo. 
SAM: Odo. (laughs) 
MARISHA: O-D-O? 
LAURA: Oh-doh! 
MATT: O-D-O. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Odo. 
TRAVIS: Odo. 
SAM: Odo. 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What was the orc skeleton's name? 
TALIESIN: Vendallo. 
MATT: That would be Vendallo. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Odo is a good pickpockety-type person? 
MATT: "He is our best pilferer on the crew." 
ASHLEY: Sure, we could give it a go. We also-- Oh, well, you don't drink. I was going to say, we know a really good game called What the Fuck Is Up With That? 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: And we play it when we drink and it's fun, but-- 
MATT: "We don't drink." 
ASHLEY: What do you? 
LAURA: Do you play Rollies? 
SAM: They're Mormons. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "What's Rollies?" 
LAURA: It's where you take your dice and you roll them. 
LIAM: Only the best game ever. 
LAURA: And then you see who wins. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's kind of like War. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: It's really complicated. 
LIAM: It seems simple at first. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: But the more you play it-- 
SAM: It takes a moment to learn. 
LIAM: -- the more the complexity comes out. 
SAM: And a lifetime to master. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You see a handful of the skeletons lean in, intrigued. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
MATT: "W-Where, where-- w-what's Rollies from?" 
LAURA: Just us. 
MARISHA: We're, um, we're game creators. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Stop it. 
TALIESIN: Stop. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: No! 
SAM: We have a game company. 
MARISHA: We have a publishing wing. 
TALIESIN: Drop it, drop it. 
TRAVIS: No, no, "Yes, and." (laughter) 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: (spray bottle) 
MATT: And that was the last anyone saw Bells Hells. (laughter) 
MATT: You can see the table, the ones that are playing cards, games with cards and dice, they're all starting to look over a bit. "Tell us more about this Rollies." 
LAURA: Here, do you need those two dice right there? 
MATT: You see one of the twins glances over. "Uh, uh, you, here." 
LAURA: I'll just telepathically bring it up. 
MATT: They all kind of, "Oh!" 
LAURA: Telepathically, telekinetically. 
SAM: Telekinetically. 
LAURA: Tele, tele, tele. 
TALIESIN: Telephone. 
LIAM: Telemarketing. 
LAURA: Tele. Here, take one of your dice. (laughs) I'll show you how it works. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Okay." 
SAM: Oh, the dice that they have on board here are d20s? 
LAURA: Yeah, of course. 
SAM: Okay. (laughs) How fortunate. 
MATT: Polyhedral is an Exandrian keepsake. 
LAURA: Why not? 
TRAVIS: I got a couple extra. I toss some wooden ones out there. Don't ask where those were. 
LIAM: They're just Ashley's baby teeth dice. 
LAURA: We both roll, and whoever gets a higher one wins. 
MATT: "And then?" 
SAM: That's the beginner level. 
LAURA: And then whoever wins... 
LIAM: Don't knock it. I think you need to play it to fully appreciate. 
MATT: "All right." 
SAM: Rollies! 
LAURA: Oh, I won. That was a 16. Now you have to tell me a secret. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "Double or nothing." 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, yeah, okay. 
LAURA: Sure. 
LIAM: Getting it, they're getting it. 
MARISHA: So two secrets? 
LIAM: What'd you roll? 
TRAVIS: Bruda's a gambler. (laughs) 
MATT: "Two." 
LAURA: Three. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Whoo. 
SAM: Isn't it exciting? 
ASHLEY: It's fun. 
MATT: "Triple or nothing." 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: No, no. 
MATT: Another skeleton's like, "Hold on, Bruda." (Bruda) "No, no, no, I'm getting this roll." (laughter) 
MATT: "I'm getting this Rollies roll." 
SAM: You can do a variation of the game. 
LAURA: Tell me a secret. I won. 
MATT: "I was allergic to cats when I was alive." (laughter) 
LAURA: I'm sorry about that. It must've been hard. 
TALIESIN: Ask him if he was allergic to ghost cats. 
TRAVIS: Can we stop talking about cats? 
MATT: "Now roll!" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Use your mind powers to throw the game. 
MATT: "Eight." 
LAURA: Three, three. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: "I win "Rollies!" 
LAURA: Good job. 
MATT: "Tell me a secret." (laughter) 
LAURA: One time, when I was little, I saw a bug. It was crawling up a set of stairs, and it was-- (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (whispers) I'm dating the dead one over there. 
MATT: "Roll again." (laughter) You now see across the table-- 
TRAVIS: Mainlining Rollies. 
MATT: The other ones are like-- Crew members are putting their cards down a bit and starting to look for other dice and going-- 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: Question, did 20 dead sailors just go--? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Who, me? 
TRAVIS: Who's the lucky one? 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. 
MATT: It took a minute for the eyelines to connect. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Does that mean Vendallo is starting to-- 
MATT: Vendallo's looking a little frustrated. 
MATT: Vendallo's looking frustrated-- 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
MATT: -- that people are starting to pull away from the game that they were in the process of playing. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk by around the table to sit down and have a conversation. While I'm walking, I just want to lightly scan the twins' cards. 
MATT: Okay, make a perception check for me. 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: No, five. 
MATT: You see nothing. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. 
MATT: As soon as you start passing by, they both-- 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MARISHA: Do we get an idea of what they were playing? Do we recognize the game? 
MATT: So there are two different games going on, one you didn't recognize and one you did. Last you saw a game like this, at least, it was Fork of the Storm, which you played at Yios. 
SAM: Fork of the Storm. 
MATT: In the casino there. 
MARISHA: Right. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Though a less fancy presentation. 
TRAVIS: Money! 
MARISHA: Which one was that one? 
TALIESIN: That was the one where you picked three. 
MATT: "Pick up the dice." 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: "Roll!" 
LAURA: Are we going to be stuck doing this? 
SAM: This is three days of Rollies. 
ASHLEY: It's good. Just do it, just roll. 
TALIESIN: This is what happens when you teach a five year old how to play a game. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Four. 
MATT: "Four." 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (gasp) 
SAM: Whoa! This is a double Rollies! 
MATT: "What happens? (laughter) 
SAM: So you-- 
MATT: "What happens?" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh my god! 
SAM: That ends the game for the day. (laughter) 
SAM: That actually ends the game for the day. 
MATT: "No! What happens when they're the same?" 
LAURA: Then you have to find a new partner. That's the part of the rules. 
MATT: "You!" (laughter) 
SAM: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: What happens?! 
MARISHA: What have we done? 
LIAM: We just created an addict. 
MATT: As the gambling chaos begins to take root not even a few hours into your multi-day journey, the beginnings of-- 
LAURA: You would've thought, after this many years, they would've come up with that game themselves. 
SAM: It's a great game! 
MATT: Bonding comes in strange ways. But we'll see where it goes from here, as we'll pull back on the ghost ship, as it pushes into the mists, heading towards what you hope is the destination you requested. And that's where we'll finish tonight's episode. (groaning) 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: No! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: No! 
TRAVIS: That was so great. 
MATT: Pick up there next time. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: Fucking funny. 
ASHLEY: Love it here. 
MATT: It's going to be fun. 
LIAM: "No, again! Now!" 
TRAVIS: "What happens?!" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "What happens?!" (laughs) 
MARISHA: So good! 
MATT: The funny thing about being a ghost crew, they don't socialize a lot. 
TRAVIS: Uh-uh. 
MATT: They get used to repetition. Don't really learn new things very often. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: So you are, you're a breath of fresh air to a bunch of undead murderers. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I love it. 
MARISHA: I love them all! 
MATT: You got days of travel ahead. So we'll see-- 
TALIESIN: I'm so excited. 
MATT: -- where that takes us. 
SAM: So far, the Shattered Teeth is the greatest place in all of Exandria. 
ASHLEY: Let's just stay here. 
MARISHA: (sighs) Campaign Four, Shattered Teeth only. (laughter) 
MATT: Maybe. 
TRAVIS: We have to go back and dissemble the Key. No, no, we don't. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We're good down here. 
MATT: "Did you guys hear that? Gods are dead." 
LAURA: (laughs) Oh. 
MARISHA: Rollies! 
MATT: (laughs) Thank you all so much for joining us. We'll see you next time. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)
