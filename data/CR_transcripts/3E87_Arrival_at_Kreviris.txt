Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
SAM: We play-- 
ALL: (garbled randomness) 
TRAVIS: ♪ (vocalizing) ♪
TALIESIN: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Before we get into tonight's episode-- 
LAURA: That shirt looks really good on you, Matt. 
MATT: Thank you, occasionally, I'll put a collar on. 
LAURA: It's a good color on you. 
ASHLEY: It does, it's a good color. 
LAURA: It's nice. 
MATT: Thanks. 
LAURA: Sorry. (laughter) 
LIAM: Keep complimenting him, then he can't kill us on the moon! 
MATT: Shh! 
ASHLEY: I know, I know. 
MATT: Before we get into our episode tonight, we have-- 
MARISHA: Oh, we're getting paid. 
MATT: -- some announcements. Shh! Beginning with our sponsor-- 
TRAVIS: Shush. 
MATT: -- NordVPN. Sam. 
TRAVIS: NordVPN. 
MATT: Why are you dressed so fancy? 
SAM: It's Oscar season, Matt. So it's time once again for our own awards show: The Academy A-Nords. Maestro. 
MATT: Oh boy. [recorded audience clapping] 
SAM: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: Ladies, gentlemen, and everything in between. It's the internet's night to shine as the stars are out to celebrate NordVPN's Academy A-Nords. And here's your host, Sam Riegel! 
SAM: Hello, hi. Thank you. As we know, NordVPN provides amazing encryption for your internet traffic and hides your IP and physical location. Here to present the first A-Nord is Mr. Mom's own Taliesin Jaffe joined by our dad, Liam O'Brien. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (clap) 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
TALIESIN: Liam, you're looking stunning tonight, and I'm not just saying that because it's on the teleprompter. 
LIAM: (laughs weakly) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: You too, Tal, and I am saying that because of the prompter. (laughter) [recorded laugh track] 
TALIESIN: All kidding aside, the nominees for Easiest to Use VPN that's available on Windows, iOS, Android, and Linux are Angela Bassett-- 
ASHLEY: Tight. 
TALIESIN: -- Daniel Day-Lewis, Greta Gerwig, and... NordVPN. 
LIAM: Hmm.

MARISHA: Mommy's bringing home a present tonight. This is for you. 
SAM: Oh, amazing, amazing. Now please welcome to present the next A-Nord, BAFTA winning actress Laura Bailey and oversized sweater enthusiast, Ashley Johnson. 
ASHLEY: Isn't that the truth? (laughter) 
LAURA: Ashley, one thing NordVPN does so well is encourage good cyber hygiene using unique and complex passwords, backing up your data, and updating your software to prevent cyber attacks and data breaches. Why do you use NordVPN? 
ASHLEY: I am so sorry, Laura, you lost me at hygiene. (laughter)

ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, good job. 
TRAVIS: My head hurts. 
MATT: Well, (laughs) from there, as you may have seen, we have some exciting updates to share around Darrington Press's upcoming high fantasy RPG, Daggerheart. (excited cheering)

TRAVIS: Man, oh man! 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: So all of you will have a chance to dive into the materials and help us all shape the game while it's still in development through your valuable feedback ahead of its release in 2025. We'll also be dropping a ton of video content and resources so that you all can get playing right away, including a quick 101 of the system of Daggerheart, a session zero example, and even a live one-shot with all of us here at the table later that same evening to show you how we hope it's done. Then you can just destroy it all from there. It's-- (laughter) 
MATT: Look, it's important that we build this game with you and not just for you. We want you to try and break this thing end to end. Tell us about it. The more people who get to play the game, the better that we get to make it. So please keep an eye out next week for more information on how to sign up across all of our socials and at darringtonpress.com.

LAURA: Guess what we have? We have something from the Bells Hells collection. (cheering) 
LAURA: Oh, it almost fell. ♪ (triumphant fanfare) ♪ 
SAM: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah! 
LAURA: Okay, in case you can't tell, this is a really awesome kimono duster. It's the Fearne Calloway--

ASHLEY: It's real cool. 
LAURA: The graphics are by Savanna Mayer. It's available in all of our stores. You want to try it on? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll put it on. 
LAURA: I mean, not that you haven't tried it on before, but. 
TALIESIN: I've been wearing mine all the time. I love it. 
TRAVIS: Pretending you're-- 
ASHLEY: I mean-- 
MARISHA: You can make it comfy-- 
SAM: It's so cool. 
MARISHA: -- at home or you can dress it up. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you can dress it up, you can dress it down. 
LAURA: Ashley wore it, you put on like a harness with it. 
ASHLEY: My little harness over. 
LAURA: It looks so freaking cool. 
ASHLEY: Look at how cute it is. 
LAURA: Anyway. 
SAM: It's very cute. 
LAURA: Check it out. 
MARISHA and SAM: I love it.

ASHLEY: It is. 
LAURA: A Fearne Calloway Art Nouveau T-shirt. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful. 
ASHLEY: I love it. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
LAURA: It's a little wrinkly, because I had it, I've been sitting on it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It's kind of warm. 
LAURA: Art is by Alexa Rockman. 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
MATT: Every T-shirt sat on by Laura Bailey. 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: Oh no. 
LIAM: No, we're not making that promise. 
ASHLEY: I'll buy it, I'll buy them all. (laughter) 
LAURA: It's available in the US, the UK, the EU, and the CA. 
TRAVIS: "The CA." (laughs)

TRAVIS: Canadia. 
LAURA: Is it just CA? 
MATT: That's the one. 
LAURA: Ta-da! I'm done. 
MARISHA: I just want to say-- 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: -- for any of our clearance merch, stuff that we need to move, we could do a livestream where we're just moving shirts through you and you just sit on them all. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we roll on them. 
SAM: Oh! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: We just roll on them. 
LAURA: Marisha! 
ASHLEY: Everything is Content. 
TALIESIN: What are you doing? 
MARISHA: I'm just saying. 
TRAVIS: We rub them on our-- 
MARISHA: I bet it would work. 
ASHLEY: Shake a little tail, move some merch? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We could do a little jig on some merch. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Thank you, Laura. 
SAM: (laughs) Gross. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Please edit that out. 
TRAVIS: Couldn't see my feet. 
LAURA: Okay, bye. (laughter) 
MATT: Liam, you got an announcement. 
LIAM: Yeah, let's talk about books instead of that. (laughter) Our next official Critical Role novel, "What Doesn't Break," is coming in October, the perfect month. This prequel dives into the unexplored years before Laudna joins up with Bells Hells. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: Well, hell. 
LIAM: It is written by bestselling author Cassandra Khaw with cover designed by Matt Hubel and an audiobook version narrated by the one and only Robbie Daymond. 
SAM: Oh, he's so cool. (moans of awe) 
LIAM: So silky smooth. You can pre-order your copy now, unlike me, at-- 
ASHLEY: So smooth. 
LIAM: -- criticalrolebooks.com to celebrate. 
TRAVIS: Dot com. Dot com! 
LIAM: There's one more piece to this. Our friends at Random House Worlds are running a sweepstake over on criticalrolebooks.com. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Sweepstakes! 
LIAM: You can enter for a chance to win a copy of the book and some extra Laudna goodies from the Crit Role shop. 
MATT and MARISHA: Ooh. 
SAM: Nice! 
LAURA: What kind of goodies? 
SAM: Dead rats. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Love a good-- 
LIAM: That Marisha has sat on. (laughter) 
MATT: A lot of them tied in. 
ASHLEY: Did you guys watch that? 
SAM: They were alive, and then she sat on them. 
MARISHA: Y'all, if Amouranth can sell farts in a jar-- 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: No. Why? 
MARISHA: -- we can sell-- 
LAURA: We talked about this. 
MARISHA: -- satted on T-shirts. 
ASHLEY: Sat on shirts. 
SAM: Ugh, gross. 
ASHLEY: I'm loving where this is going. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Ashley gets it. 
SAM: That kimono makes you so into everything. 
ASHLEY: Listen. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You're not even-- 
LIAM: They all sold out. Ashley bought them all. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What are we-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. Thank you, before he-- 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LIAM: Look! 
TALIESIN: I was wondering when that was coming. 
LAURA: Look it! 
LIAM: I'm so good at announcements. 
TALIESIN: It was right there. 
ASHLEY: I love the cover! 
MARISHA: I know. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's beautiful. 
LIAM: Iconic dead woman. 
MARISHA: Look at the shadow. 
LAURA: Look at the back. 
ASHLEY: Oh, look at that! That actually would be a really cool tattoo. 
TRAVIS: Show the spine, show the spine! 
LAURA, MATT, and SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: I've been debating a Pâté tattoo. 
MATT: That would be the one. 
SAM: We could all get one. 
ASHLEY: Dang it! 
TALIESIN: I'll take my copy back. 
ASHLEY: Pâté would be such a good tattoo. 
MARISHA: I know! I've seen some cute ones out in the wild. They're always super cute. 
LAURA: We still have to get a group tattoo. 
MARISHA: We do! 
MATT: I know. We're behind on a few. 
LAURA: I know! 
MATT: We'll talk after today's game. 
TALIESIN: Yes, yes. 
ASHLEY: Have you guys ever seen grocery store sweepstakes? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Wait, like where you run through? 
LAURA: Tell me more. 
TRAVIS: We're about to play a game! 
MATT: Oh yeah, oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: I know, I just was thinking about it and I had to say it out loud, I'm sorry. 
MATT: No, I appreciate that, Ashley. 
MARISHA: Go to the beef and cleaning supplies. 
LAURA: Wait, I have to know the context. 
LIAM: Is it a tattoo pitch? 
ASHLEY: No, because we said sweepstakes and my brain-- 
MATT: Hey y'all. 
TALIESIN: During the break! 
MATT: I believe that concludes our announcements. 
ASHLEY: Supermarket Sweepstakes! Thank you. 
MATT: So let's go ahead and jump into--

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off: Bells Hells, upon arriving here on the red moon Ruidus, you found a handful of allies and tidbits of information that promised the existence of the Volition, the-- Having issues over here? 
SAM: She's-- 
MARISHA: First, I had-- 
SAM: She's snooping, she's spying on everybody else's stats. 
MARISHA: I pulled up D&D Beyond and gave me Fresh Cut Grass'. Then I reloaded it-- 
TRAVIS: The character sheet. 
MARISHA: -- and now I have Fearne's. So I don't know why it's happening-- 
MATT: Well, if you keep reloading, it'll eventually get there, I think. 
MARISHA: Oh, there's me. 
TRAVIS: Laudna. 
MATT: Random character generator. 
MARISHA: Why the fuck? It's fine, I got it. We're cool, we're cool. We're good, good, good, good, good. 
LIAM: Immersed. 
MATT: There are rumors of a group called the Volition that is a rebellious troop, a network that's been working against the Kreviris Imperium. You've been seeking out allies, made a few, discovered a few enemies, had a brief run in with Otohan Thull, and escaped before heading into the nearby subterranean regions of the moon. You found within there an odd ancient portal that lead to a portion of Exandria below, and also the lake in which resides some sort of a shadowed entity that tried to drag you to a watery grave. Managing to battle that away and return to the moon promptly after leaving some messages to the Voice of the Tempest, you trudged back to the surface and began to walk on foot after a night's rest, through the storms as they come and go. Until eventually some of the storm begins to break ahead, and you can see the cleft valley of a mountain range above and ahead of you, where you can see the signs of the capital city, Kreviris, before you. So as we jump in, you have a little bit of travel still before you reach the city. The means of arrival, of course, is up to you. But for the remaining leg of your journey, I need someone to roll a d20 for me. 
SAM: I think Taliesin went last. 
MARISHA: I think it left off on me. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh yeah? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was last time. You know why? Because it was awesome. 
LIAM: I like that confidence. 
MARISHA: Six. Nothing's changed since last game. Rolling great, rolling great. 
TRAVIS: Is that the Laudna die? 
MARISHA: No. 
TALIESIN: Maybe it's time for a full purge? 
LAURA: I'm going to re-up by the way, I'm just going to, (clicks tongue) Mage Armor myself. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: From the six? (laughs) 
MATT: The brief break in the medium powered dust storm is short-lived. As the heavy winds begin to swallow your vision of the city ahead, until eventually, not far beyond your visual range, you can't see more than maybe 30 feet ahead of you. You can hear the heavy wind blowing by. You have to cover your mouth, you have to cover your eyes best you can, as you all push forward in what you hope is the direction that you had originally saw before it was taken from you. Because we're this close and because you're on the surface here, I'm going to have everyone roll a group stealth check for me, please. 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say actually I can take Pass Without a Trace if we're going through here. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah? 
TALIESIN: Yes, please. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I would've done it anyways. I'm fucked. 
LIAM: We're in a storm trying to hide from-- 
LAURA: Wait, so you're casting it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You have some dramatic-ass rolls. 
TALIESIN: Save your spells. 
LAURA: Ah, motherfuck. 
LIAM: Who cares? 
MARISHA: I feel like if I give it a nice spin that maybe it won't fuck me. 
LIAM: Do we have Pass Without a Trace? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Thank god because I have disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Zunes. 
LIAM: Can we see the city anymore? 
SAM: Zunes. (laughs) 
MATT: The dust storm has swallowed that visual. 
TRAVIS: Good ref. 
MATT: All right, off to the side here. 
TRAVIS: 36. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: 27. 
SAM: 15. 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: 17. 
LIAM: 22. 
TALIESIN: 22. 
MATT: Okay. Continuing to push forward for the better part of the next hour or so, doing your best to stay low to the ground, you cast your spell to keep the shadows near and the sound itself muffled as much as needed over the resurging anger of the dust storm around you. Now the challenge with Pass Without a Trace is it darkens shadows and muffles sound but it doesn't hide all senses. There's a brief period where you're stepping past the somewhat broken rocky topography in the direction where you've been pushing. Past a pseudo-cliff face and some other outcroppings, you feel a faint rumble. 
SAM: Oh, it's a bane worm. (low rumbling) 
LAURA: Oh no. 
SAM: (like Bane) Oh. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: What do you do? 
ASHLEY: Quiet, quiet, quiet. 
TRAVIS: Freeze. 
LAURA: Yeah, "Tremors," "Tremors" rule, freeze. 
LIAM: We're on a rocky outcropping now or near one? 
MATT: There's just rocky parts of broken terrain. 
LAURA: There's rock coming out of the ground? 
MATT: There's protrusions and risen sections of platform. 
LAURA: Is this like "Tremors?" Should we get to the rock or stand on the ground? 
TRAVIS: A good question would be how far is the rock? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the question. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: About 20, 25 feet from where you guys are currently. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (nervous laugh) 
SAM: Can we fly? 
TRAVIS: Hands in the air if you want to run for the rock. Oh really, we're all ballsy? 
LAURA: Yeah, let's run to the rock. 
TALIESIN: On count of three. 
SAM: I'm going to Sympathetically Bond with one, two, three, four. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I am the slowest, but okay. 
SAM: Shit. 
ASHLEY: Are you still? 
TALIESIN: I'm fucked, yeah. 
SAM: I thought you have a 40-foot running speed, don't you? 
TALIESIN: Not anymore. 
LAURA: Oh, because he's exhausted. 
TALIESIN: I have disadvantage on ability checks and a 20-foot running speed. 
SAM: Then one, two, three, four. Sorry. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: No, but you just-- 
ASHLEY: Are you-- I'm-- 
MARISHA: There's no method to any of that. 
TALIESIN: Nah. 
MARISHA: It's insane. 
ASHLEY: -- a dire wolf, I think, holding Ashton. 
MATT: Right. 
LAURA: Can I only do this to myself? 
MATT: So you all bolt for the nearest rock. 
TRAVIS: (frantic scampering) 
MATT: (dramatic whoosh) You all go into a sprint, kicking off dust as you go, pushing through the storm to where you recall it was and you can just see the basic dark shadow outline of where it still stands amidst the swirling of wind and dust around you. 
TRAVIS: God, I hope it can't eat rock. 
MATT: You all dart and clamber onto it. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (nervous giggle) 
MATT: And you stop and look back. 
TRAVIS: Total freeze. [wind blowing] 
MATT: Nothing. [wind blowing] 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: (whispering) I know we haven't come across a bane worm yet, but it feels like that was the start of one, right? 
SAM: It's baney. 
ASHLEY: Woof. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: A Blaine, a David Blaine worm. 
LAURA: Do we hear any rumbles? Do we see the ground shaking at all? 
MATT: Make a perception check for me, with disadvantage in the dust storm. 
LAURA: Aw, lousy, bwah. 
LIAM: I got 28. 
LAURA: I got nine. 
MATT: Okay. 28. (laughs) Yeah, not seeing much out there, unfortunately, Imogen. But you glancing past, it's less what you see. 
LAURA: I need some glasses. 
MATT: At first, it's what you hear. You hear, through the dust storm, a little (cute chitters). 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: (cute chitters) And you see this tiny little movement in the dust. Like something, like a creature is emerging from the dust and kicking up a little bit in the storm. 
LAURA: It's definitely bane worms. 
LIAM: Wait for it. 
LAURA: Don't. 
ASHLEY: Can I-- Since I'm still a dire wolf, can I use-- 
LAURA: You're a dire wolf still, you are? 
TALIESIN and LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. (pants) Can I use a keen hearing and smell and see if I can (sniffs)? 
MATT: Okay, yeah, so roll a perception check. 
ASHLEY: Some wolf sniffings. 
MATT: Using your perception. 
TRAVIS: I like you like that. 
SAM: Oh, that's right. 
ASHLEY: (growls) 
MATT: But you do not have disadvantage because it gives you advantage. 
SAM: You guys can have wolf sex. 
MATT: So it's just a straight roll. 
ASHLEY: It's a straight roll, okay. 
SAM: Oh god. So hot. 
LIAM: I'm a real quiet little guy. 
ASHLEY: It's cocked. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
LAURA: Your damn-- 
ASHLEY: I know, I know. Okay, perception? 23. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
MATT: 23, okay. You pick up on this as well, you hear the sound (purrs, cute chitters) and you glance over and can see this movement in the dust kicks up a little bit. (rustles) And then (swoosh, thud). You see this, almost like a tadpole it looks like, a basketball-sized tadpole thing that plops out and starts rubbing on its back in the dust and kicking up this little dust storm on itself there. 
LAURA: It's an angler fish. 
LIAM: Tadpole as in smooth? Or is it furry, with my 27 perception? 
MATT: You can see, it has a little bit of fur texture at the edges and then some scale elements. 
LIAM: Scale elements. 
MATT: You can see it definitely has, basically how it emerged, it looks like it has a burrowing locomotion. 
LIAM: That's a big maggot. 
TRAVIS: Who's got something they can throw at it? 
SAM: I can talk to it. 
LIAM: Why do you want to do that? 
LAURA: Ooh, I have an idea. Can I use Catapult? Are there any rocks around? 
MATT: There's plenty of rocks around you. Everything is rocks. 
TRAVIS: Don't throw the one we're on. 
LAURA: No, no, no, I know. 
MARISHA: Ball bearing. 
LAURA: I wanted to Catapult a rock that's like 60 feet away from me. And that way and send it over and hit it onto the tadpole. 
SAM: Nice. Onto the tadpole? 
LAURA: Well, next to the tadpole. 
MATT: Okay. You (swoosh) send it off into the storm, the wind blowing against it, but the rock has enough strength behind it where it carves over at a slight arc to it. It (thud) hits the ground and the creature (inquisitive chitter), (rumbles) and digs back under the ground. 
MARISHA: Do you remember? 
TRAVIS: When it jumped and flopped, was there space between the ground and where it jumped? 
SAM: ♪ The time ♪ 
MATT: It arced a few feet in the air before it hit the ground and (thuds) and was rubbing on the ground getting itself all dusty. 
MARISHA: Do you remember-- 
ASHLEY: Little squish. 
MARISHA: That fairy that we saw? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: 100%, yeah. 
MARISHA: In the forest? 
TALIESIN: I will never forget. 
LAURA: It's an angler fish. 
TRAVIS: Then it turned into the lure. 
MARISHA: Yes, it was a lure. I'm getting that vibe. 
LAURA: Yeah, but then what if it's actually just an innocent little creature and we're all convinced it's a lure. 
TRAVIS: Six-ton smush the chinchilla. 
LAURA: Now a bane worm is going to eat the teeny little cutie grub. 
SAM: Better him than us. 
MARISHA: Circle of life. 
SAM: I'm going to cast Speak with Animals using my Communicator's Gift and I will whisper-shout: Hey, you cutie, little cutie, are you hurt, are you okay? 
MATT: As you whisper-shout, as the creature (rumbles) into the ground, you watch it Bugs Bunny burrowing. The ground (rumbles) leaves a little path as it goes around in a circle before it breaks a little bit and you can see this one little central eye that opens in the top of its smooth head. It goes (chitters). It doesn't speak, which leads you to believe it's probably not an animal, necessarily or a beast. 
SAM: I communicate. 
LAURA: It's a tongue. 
SAM: I convey this to my friends. 
LIAM: But it's over here staring at us now, right? 
LAURA: Oh shit, and now-- 
MATT: It's in the direction, yeah. It's about 15 feet away. 
LAURA: It's probably symbiotic. What if all the creatures here have symbiotic relationships with another one? 
TALIESIN: Psychic vibration. 
SAM: Or it could be a periscope thing, too. 
LIAM: Or it could be one of 100 babies. It could have a lot of siblings. 
TRAVIS: The fact this thing can't talk is disturbing. 
TALIESIN: I am keeping an eye on this shit. 
SAM: Okay, why don't we prepare attacks? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: And just go get it. 
LIAM: Or we could just-- 
TALIESIN: Walk away. 
LIAM: Sit on this rock and wait. 
SAM: Walk away, what do you mean? 
LAURA: For how long? 
SAM: I think the second we step on sand, we get eaten by banes. 
LIAM: More than three minutes! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's going to pass. It's going to pass. 
SAM: It'll pass? Okay. 
LIAM: Maybe. 
TRAVIS: What if it's like a polar bear and it never sees food, so it is as patient as the day is long? 
LAURA: It just chills. 
TRAVIS: It will be here as long as we are. 
ASHLEY: Well, that's a possibility. 
TRAVIS: Did you know that? (Texan accent) If you see a polar bear from two miles, it won't stop until it comes to eat your ass. (laughter) 
LIAM: Fjord? 
MARISHA: Some Texas shit. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Where did that even come from? 
TRAVIS: What kind of animal could you beat in a fight? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs) 
SAM: A poodle? (laughter) 
MARISHA: I agree, let's wait a few more minutes. Let's not provoke. 
LIAM: If it's a bane worm, it's as big as an arena and it doesn't matter if you throw a ball bearing 80 feet away, it's going to run us down. 
SAM: What's on the other side of these rocks? 
MATT: (cute chitters) Maybe we can climb over. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: What is it looking at? 
LAURA: It's still looking at us. 
MATT: (cute chitters) 
ASHLEY: Should we give it food or something? Hey, hey, do we still have a body? 
TRAVIS: Oh, we do. 
SAM: We have a head. 
ASHLEY: Should we throw out a body? 
LAURA: Throw the body out onto the ground. Throw the body on the ground. 
SAM: We can't. 
ASHLEY: Far, far. 
LAURA: ♪ Throw the bodies on the ground ♪ 
SAM: ♪ Throw the body ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Let the bodies hit the floor ♪ 
SAM: Okay, we're going to start tossing body parts. 
TRAVIS: I'll toss out a chunk of an arm, I'm not wasting a head. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's start small. 
LIAM: Of Edmuda or somebody else? 
LAURA: No, it's not Edmuda. 
LIAM: Because there's been a lot of bodies in there. 
LAURA: No, it's not the hole. It's the Bag of Holding. 
TRAVIS: It was the berserker guy, yeah. 
SAM: Do we have dead bodies in all of our bags? 
TRAVIS: Some things are constant through the campaign. 
TALIESIN: This is a perfect example of how this is useful. 
ASHLEY: You never know what you're going to need. 
TRAVIS: It's not slough material yet, it hasn't even been a day. 
ASHLEY: No. 
LIAM: (growled) Berserker. 
MATT: It does smell a little on the inside, though. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, throw the meat, Chet. 
MATT: So you're throwing an arm over there? 
TRAVIS: An elbow to hand. 
MATT: Okay. (swoosh, thuds) (cute chitters, rumbles) It burrows beneath. 
SAM: Did it take it with? 
MATT: No, it threw it over and it burrowed beneath. 
MARISHA: It's informing its superior. 
MATT: (skittering) (screaming) 
MATT: You watch as about close to 10 of these creatures suddenly start (skittering). 
LAURA: Not minors, miners! 
MATT: Like a feeding frenzy. You watch the arm get pulled apart and tossed before they catch the final bits and they wrestle and argue over it before they all (rumbles) eventually separate and dust off and then vanish beneath the surface. 
SAM: Sand piranhas? 
ASHLEY: Well, that was-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: That was gross. 
MARISHA: That's awesome. 
TRAVIS: What the fuck? 
LAURA: How do we get off this rock, then? What if there's so many more of them? 
SAM: How many body parts do we have? Maybe we could just-- 
ASHLEY: The floor is lava! 
SAM: Throw a bunch and then run the other way. 
LAURA: Book it. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Who has big area of effect stuff? Like Cone of Cold or stuff. 
LAURA: Oh, me. 
TRAVIS: That would be good. Just calling it out there. 
LAURA: I have some spells! 
TRAVIS: Let's go! (laughter) 
MARISHA: How long does Telekinesis laugh-- last? 
LIAM: Last laugh. 
LAURA: Ha ha ha ha ha. Telekinesis-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, Matt. 
LAURA: -- can last up to 10 minutes. 
MATT: It's going to be a good night. 
MARISHA: Can you just Professor X us and we levitate this rock that we're on and we all go rock-zooming away? 
LAURA: Oh god. 
ASHLEY: Rock-zooming? 
LIAM: I have a wild idea. 
LAURA: It's like-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah? 
MARISHA: Rock-sledding? 
LIAM: We shut the fuck up and take-- 
LAURA: That is actually a really great idea. 
LIAM: -- a short rest. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That is a good idea. 
SAM: Wait, what are we doing? 
MARISHA: Thank you! 
SAM: We're becoming rocks? 
LAURA: Yes! 
SAM: Is that a thing? 
LAURA: That is a fucking awesome idea. I'm going to cast Telekinesis. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind, okay. 
TRAVIS: That's office take right there. 
TALIESIN: I was listening to you. 
LAURA: The rock that we're sitting on, this boulder, I'm going to focus everything that I can and try to raise this boulder up into the ground. 
MATT: Okay, okay! 
ASHLEY: Huh? 
TALIESIN: I swear I was listening. 
LAURA: Everybody hold on. 
SAM: I'm going to give you an extra d6. I don't know, is this a roll that you have to do? 
LAURA: No, but thank you, I'll take it. 
SAM: I'm giving you a d6. 
MATT: Now, you can move an object that's up to 1,000 pounds in weight. 
SAM: Damn! 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: So how many people are on this rock and how big is the rock? 
TRAVIS: I'm on there. 
LAURA: But we're all little! Think about how many teeny people we have. 
SAM: Like 450, well, he's probably pretty heavy. We're probably 550 together. 
LAURA: How much do you weigh? 
SAM: 600 together. 
LAURA: 175, something like that? 
TALIESIN: I would say with the stone, because it's not stone all the way through. 
LAURA: 200? 
TALIESIN: So it's probably 190 to 200. Well, yeah, 200 at least. 
LIAM: Is Letters lightweight alloy or super heavy? 
MATT: Your new arm is probably a good 60 pounds on its own. 
SAM: I've been described as heavy when Fearne has carried me in the past. 
ASHLEY: But I've been able to carry you. 
TALIESIN: The rock is a little foamy. 
MATT: I guess it's a little porous. 
TALIESIN: But also the solid glass. Yeah, so 250. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Laudna is 100 pounds wet. 
TALIESIN: Call it 250. Quarter of a ton. 
SAM: You weigh a quarter of a ton? 
TALIESIN: 250 pounds. 
SAM: That is not a quarter of a ton. 
MATT: That's an eighth of a ton. 
TALIESIN: An eighth of a ton, thank you, math. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Math ♪ 
LAURA: Then all the rest of us are pretty light because-- 
ASHLEY: We've got teeny. 
TALIESIN: I'm William Howard Taft in my head. 
TRAVIS: I weigh 600 pounds. 
LAURA: Chet. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's all wood. 
SAM: All wood. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so I'll say it's possible, but it'll be a series of checks to maintain your magical will. 
SAM: Of course. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: To coast, okay? 
TALIESIN: Guidance, Guidance, anyone? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I do Guidance in the dire wolf form? 
TALIESIN: Well, you can turn back from the dire wolf. 
MATT: Your dire wolf form is pretty heavy. 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to change back. 
LIAM: Orym's going to sit crisscross apple sauce-- 
LAURA: Oh right, you're probably lighter. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: -- on the stone with his blade in his lap and wait until the mayhem begins. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm on the other side of it waiting for mayhem as well. 
LAURA: No mayhem, this is-- 
SAM: I'm going to use my propeller arm to take a couple pounds off me. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Good idea. 
MATT: Beautiful. 
SAM: (propellor whirs) 
TRAVIS: Amazing, just negate your weight. You just barely dip. 
MATT: As you all cluster up in this one section of the rock, you use your mind to reach into it and find where the elements of shale that surround the base of you are most capable of being pierced and pulled away from the main portion of the rock around you. It takes a few minutes of concentration to get your mind dug in there like wedges and then (crackle) pull it free. You feel it shift and lift up and as it does, you feel the faint cracking of it in places. It holds, but this is fragile stone. You don't want to rock it too much. But you do indeed all feel your troop (whoosh) lift up. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MARISHA: This is cool! 
LAURA: I'm going to float it the direction that we want to go. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Reserving my opinion until the end. 
MATT: Begins to shift out into the storm and as the wind's buffeting it now, you can feel it almost rock a little bit as it moves. 
LAURA: Oh right, there's a storm. 
MATT: But you continue to push forward. 
LAURA: What about those little creatures? Are they-- 
SAM: Should we throw some body parts the other way? 
LAURA: Yeah, throw them-- 
ASHLEY: Opposite? 
LAURA: Away from us, away from us. 
TRAVIS: I get out the other quarter arm, but I will go to work on some digits so I get little SeaWorld offerings. 
LAURA: But we don't want them to follow us as a trail. 
TALIESIN: Don't make a fucking breadcrumb trail. 
LAURA: A what? 
TALIESIN: Don't make a trail of breadcrumbs for them. 
TRAVIS: We don't want to feed the ducks? 
LAURA: I thought he said something else. 
MARISHA: I thought he said, "come trail." 
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I heard. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Chemtrail? 
MARISHA: Was that not? 
TRAVIS: Chemtrail? 
TALIESIN: I hate y'all. All right, carry on. 
LIAM: That is different. 
LAURA: Yeah, but it needs to be chucked far away. 
SAM: Who's got a good arm? 
TRAVIS: I do. 
LAURA: Chet. 
TRAVIS: I'm throwing them far. 
SAM: Do it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Maybe do a baseball situation. 
SAM: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: It's fine. 
ASHLEY: Shoot it out of the park. 
TRAVIS: They're fingers. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: No, I like that idea. 
MATT: It gets picked up in the wind. 
ASHLEY: It's an option. 
TALIESIN: It'll just be a spray ray. 
LAURA: Right back to us? 
TRAVIS: It comes back the direction we're going? Oh shit. (laughs) 
LAURA: Wait, is the wind blowing against us, or is it--? 
MATT: It's blowing towards and off to the side. So as Chet throws it, it (swoosh). 
LAURA: Go with the wind, Chet, go with the wind. 
SAM: Have Ashton bash it. 
LIAM: The hot dogs. 
TRAVIS: It's going into the wind and it is coming back. 
SAM: But if he bashes it real hard, it could go farther. 
TALIESIN: This thing is literally shaped like a meat tenderizer. It's going to turn it into a spray. 
SAM: I think it's going to work. 
TRAVIS: Just for the visual. Are you ready? 
LAURA: So dumb. 
TALIESIN: Fine. 
TRAVIS: (whooshes) 
MATT: Wham. Now, the momentum of having to shift your weight and swing at this does cause the rock to slightly tilt. 
ASHLEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
MATT: Could you roll a d20 and add your charisma modifier to it for me, Laura? 
ASHLEY: Guidance! 
TRAVIS: Our fates are in your hands. 
MATT: You don't have Guidance on this. 
LAURA: Oh, ha ha ha. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's good. 
LAURA: (tongue waggles) 
ASHLEY: That was good. 
LAURA: 29! 
MATT: 29? 
LAURA: No wait, that's the saving throw. 24! 
MATT: 24 is great. 
TALIESIN: Great. 
MATT: You hold it together and keep it right as you (thwack) hit the finger. (flutters) (frenzied chittering) 
TRAVIS: I think we're okay to just keep going. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: (noises) (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I don't like these things. 
MATT: This lasts for 10 minutes. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. That's not that long. 
MATT: So you continue to push forward. 
LAURA: If I really focus, can I speed myself up? 
MATT: (laughs) You're on the cusp of the spell's ability. So you're cruising at a steady normal pace. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It can move 30 feet in any direction per round. 
LAURA: Okay! 
MATT: So you're moving 30 feet, 30 feet, 30 feet, 30 feet at a time. 
LIAM: I'm just Gusting, perpetually Gusting knowing it's doing nothing. 
MATT: But hey, it all helps in some small way. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: But it continues to push on until you're far enough away where you cannot see the outline of the rock where you have briefly hidden. 
TRAVIS: The rock. 
MATT: Two minutes, three minutes of pushing on, you're getting in some fair distance on this, occasionally it (rustles) begins to pick up and wind hits it underneath and it starts to sailboat a little bit to one side. Make another d20 roll with plus five or plus your charisma, I think it's five. 
LAURA: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
LAURA: Oh wait, no, 20. 
MATT: 20, you keep it held and eventually right it a bit, it over corrects a little bit and you all pucker and then eventually get it right back to a standard setting and continue to push forward. 
TRAVIS: You're doing such a good job, but maybe we should try and land gently just in case something goes wrong, because a hard landing would be like ringing the dinger bell. 
LAURA: You're right. Can I set us down once I feel like I got a minute left? Yeah. 
MATT: Sure, all right. So I'd say you have about six minutes left of the spell. For every two minutes, you're going to roll. 
LAURA: Okay, great. 
MATT: So now we go six minutes into it with four minutes left. The wind's still buffeting it, roll another d20 for me. 
SAM: You got a d6. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: It's not going to do much. 
SAM: It better. 
LAURA: Nine. 
MARISHA: Nine? 
LIAM: She rolled a two. 
ASHLEY: That's good, that was enough. 
MATT: The DC on this has been 10 each time, it's not been a hard DC. 
LAURA: I like extremes. 
MATT: But that's okay. 
ASHLEY: Wait, but you also have Guidance that you didn't use. 
LAURA: No, I didn't, I used the six. 
ASHLEY: No, you used the six, you didn't use the four. Because I Guided her, but she didn't use it. 
MATT: Guidance lasts for, I believe a minute for use. 
ASHLEY: Guidance? (laughter) 
LIAM: It doesn't last very long. 
ASHLEY: Because she didn't use it last time. 
MATT: Guidance lasts for one minute. I will say because in this instance, having to maintain concentration, I will allow it. So go ahead and roll. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Boring. 
MARISHA: You can make it. 
LAURA: 11? 
MARISHA: Yes! You made it. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: 11 was enough to pull this up. (laughter) 
MATT: You push into the eight minutes of it. Barely holding on, the rock is starting to-- 
TRAVIS: Park this sucker. 
MATT: Now with each progressive point of this, especially with the low roll of last time, the rock is starting to crack and the edge starts to chip and fall off down below. 
LAURA: Is there any reaction as little parts of rocks are falling to the ground? Do we see any creatures coming-- 
TRAVIS: Or hear any (scurrying) activity beneath us? 
MATT: Not at the moment, no. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. Great, I'm going to very gently set the rock down on the ground. 
MATT: Okay. (thudding) It almost immediately crumbles into three pieces as it lands, cracking and sundering as it hits. But you all step back onto the dusty ground. 
LAURA: We've got like a minute left? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Should I try to lift everybody and move them farther away off the rock, so we're farther away from this big rumble? 
SAM: Can you do that? 
LAURA: I've got a minute left, I'm going to try to move as many people as I can, one by one farther away from this big stone. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Might want to start with either-- 
LAURA: And gently set down. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got a lot of HP even though I'm kind of useless, so feel free to throw me first. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I did not. 
MATT: So you can move them up to 60 feet. 
LAURA: Okay, great, I'm going to move everybody 60 feet away from this big boulder. 
MATT: Okay. So as it sits now, you've all managed to get to the periphery, likely of their awareness. The storm's still swirling around you. You can all attempt one more group stealth check to see if you can avoid them entirely. 
TALIESIN: Still up. 
TRAVIS: Do we still have? 
MATT: Now, here's the thing. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, here's the thing! 
MATT: Pass Without a Trace, you gathered, didn't quite have an effect as this was-- 
ASHLEY: He did it, they did it. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
ASHLEY: I'm blaming it on Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Well, I mean also mine is technically Merge With Stone. So I don't know if that helps us or not. 
ASHLEY: That's a different flair? 
TALIESIN: I'll take whatever you say; I'm not going to argue it. 
TALIESIN: Look at the appeal, I love the appeal. 
SAM: It's a different spell when I cast it. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It literally says, I'm just saying, it literally says, "Merge With Stone" on the page. But I'm taking what I-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: When Ashton does it, it hits different. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm just a slave to the words. 
ASHLEY: "I'm just reading what's on the page, I don't know what to tell you." 
TALIESIN: I literally am just reading what's on the page. 
LIAM: "It says I'm pretty baller." (laughter) 
TALIESIN: But I'm easy. 
MATT: That's what Merge With Stone says, but what does-- 
TALIESIN: "You can cast Pass Without a Trace once per long rest." Yeah, but it's called Merge With Stone. 
LIAM: So it's the stats. 
TALIESIN: But I'm fine with whatever. 
MATT: But you were-- Okay, you know what. 
SAM: "I'm fine for whatever." 
TRAVIS: "I'm fine, whatever." 
SAM: "I won't be fine if--" 
MATT: No, you know what? Because that is the nature of your physical ability, and you're concentrating on this instance, I'll allow it. (cheering) 
TALIESIN: If you burn a shadow hide later, I totally respect that, just saying. 
MATT: Oh, don't worry, I'm noting it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: So everyone make a group stealth check, please. 
LAURA: God, drat, fucking piece of-- 
TRAVIS: 31. 
TALIESIN: I hate this. 
SAM: With the Pass Without a Trace? 
LAURA: ♪ With the Pass Without a Trace ♪ 
MATT: So-- 
MARISHA: 21. 
MATT: 21. 
SAM and LAURA: That's great. 
MARISHA: I know, I rolled a four and a five with advantage. 
SAM: 29. 
MATT: 29. 
LAURA: We had advantage? 
ASHLEY: 31! 
LAURA: You had advantage. 
MARISHA: When I sucked in-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: 31. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: (whispered) 16. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: 25. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: 22. 
MATT: Okay. A tense few minutes pass as you begin to step as gingerly as you can. The element of elven-- not elven-- earth magic that you feel emanate from Ashton as you progress makes the dusty and rocky ground almost feel like you're stepping on sponge. Just preventing most of the vibration of your footfalls as you move. It's odd, but it also gives you a sense of comfort in knowing this is the best chance you have. Move on for about five more minutes, gingerly, from foot to foot before you begin to feel like there's a pretty good chance that you've managed to escape the hunting radius of whatever those entities were. 
MARISHA: Can we still see the city skyline in the distance? 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: Is it stormy? 
MATT: The storm has completely enveloped. You can only really see about 30, 40 feet ahead of you. 
TRAVIS: You know what would've helped us see the city outline better? If you rolled better. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MARISHA: You know, my rolls are reliable. 
LIAM: Do we even know what direction we're walking in? 
MATT: Yeah, you're keeping the best you can. Who is helming this? 
LIAM: In a survival sense? 
MATT: In a survival sense, yeah. 
LAURA: In a survival sense, I could do it maybe. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll survival for me. 
SAM: I got a plus four. 
LAURA: Oh, you got a great one, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I will try. 
MATT: Whichever one of you wants to try and ensure that you can ascertain the same direction you were traveling in the midst of this storm. 
TALIESIN: Ain't me. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I know where to go. 
MATT: All right, Fearne, roll survival for me. 
TRAVIS: One. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: 13. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It's okay, give me like two seconds. I'll figure this out. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so Fearne begins to guide you through the storm. 
MARISHA: 13. 
ASHLEY: 13. 
MATT: Another hour passes of pushing through this incredibly dense, dusty windswept space. 
TRAVIS: In a fucking circle. 
MATT: You're not sure how close or how far you are from your destination. I need somebody else to roll a d20 for that hour. 
SAM: That's me. 
TRAVIS: FCG. 
LIAM: Samuel! 
SAM: (beeping) I program my circuits. 
TRAVIS: Big money, no whammies! 
SAM: Flip a Changebringer coin and I got-- What am I rolling? 
MATT: You flip your coin? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: (fluttering) 
SAM: (yells) Oh no! (tongue trilling) 
MATT: (laughs) (catches) 
SAM: I'll go after it. Just a straight roll? 
MATT: Just a straight roll. 
SAM: 18. 
MATT: 18, all right. The storm begins to subside and right as it does, another strange glow of the surrounding landscape. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
MATT: The entirety of Ruidus begins to brighten up and flare. (flaring) 
TALIESIN: Ruidusborn chill. 
MATT: As it goes off, you all feel that same passing wave of energy. The two Ruidusborn, you both get your 15 temporary hit points. 
LAURA: Sweet, on top of the other ones? 
MATT: No, they would just fill back up. 
LAURA: Fuck, okay. 
MATT: They don't-- 
LAURA: Stack? 
MATT: They don't stack. 
LAURA: That's good, though, for everybody that's been on the moon. 
TRAVIS: Don't act too excited. 
MARISHA: I do, instinctually, and nervously grab Imogen's hand right before this is about to happen. 
LAURA: Yeah, I hug her. 
MATT: She does drift up a little bit. Just instinctually as the energy drifts off the surface of Ruidus, you go with it like you've been caught, like a sail catching wind for a moment. You get lifted up and Laudna holds you anchored before pulling you back down as you hold on to her. 
TRAVIS: Do I feel any wolfy desires in this flash? 
LAURA: Doesn't fucking matter. 
MATT: I'm sorry, I didn't-- 
LAURA: No, no. (laughter) 
MATT: As you cling to her for, I'm sorry. I didn't hear that. 
TRAVIS: Do I feel any wolfy urges in this flash? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Fearne float, too, or just Imogen? 
MATT: You do feel that spirit wolf element that you were granted in your brief time in Aeshanadoor still acting as a protector and guide here. There's a part of you that's ever shielded on the inside. Ever since that one moment that an element of the moon itself seemed to acknowledge your existence and began to set you on dangerous transformations beyond the normal lunar cycle. But that spirit holds itself at bay. 
LIAM: Do we have eyes on the city again? 
MATT: Storm breaks away and you do have eyes on the city. 
SAM: Oh, thank god. 
MATT: You've gone a little bit off course. 
ASHLEY: I really thought I had it, I'm sorry. 
LAURA: No, it's fine. 
ASHLEY: I really thought-- I'm sorry. 
LAURA: That wind is strong, it's hard, it's impossible. 
MATT: It just added another hour of travel. It didn't send you back, but it didn't send you towards it either. 
ASHLEY: This is a whole new-- You know. 
SAM: It's a scenic route, it's fine. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: It was not a disaster. 
LAURA: Look at everything we saw in that hour. 
ASHLEY: We saw so much sand. 
MARISHA: So many granules of dust. 
ASHLEY: So many. 
TRAVIS: With the visibility back, any milestones, markers, outposts, anything in between here and the city that's starting to show where it didn't before? Any sense of life, movement, anything. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TALIESIN: Topography. 
SAM: Also, Imogen, should we try to reach out and contact the Volition? 
LAURA: Well, because we have no-- Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Oh, 19. 
LAURA: We have no concept of where their headquarters are, right? 
SAM: We were told it was en route to the city. 
LAURA: It was near the city, but that's pretty much all we have? 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Should we reach out to Ira? 
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I don't know. 
LAURA: What if he's just chilling with the Volition? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Could be. 
SAM: But what if he's sitting in right next to the right hand of Ludinus? 
TALIESIN: Why would he be doing that? 
SAM: He goes where it benefits him, right? 
LAURA: This is true. 
TRAVIS: Let's do it, reach out. 
SAM: To Ira? 
TRAVIS: Ira, yeah. 
SAM: You want to do it or me? 
TRAVIS: He was an ally for a minute. 
LAURA: Either/or. 
MATT: You rolled a 19, you said? 
TRAVIS: I did. 
SAM: Just, "Where are you, what's going on? We're on the moon." Should we tell him we're on the moon? I guess he would know. 
TALIESIN: You tell him we're on the moon. 
LAURA: Sound enticing, he likes enticing. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's good, yeah. 
SAM: All right, I will focus, grip my coin and I will cast Sending on Ira Widogast. (laughter) 
SAM: That's his name, right? 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Dani's nose just bled. 
MATT: I know. (laughter) 
MATT: Focusing on your coin in hand. It's like there's a slight haze between you and the Changebringer in this moment and it takes you a little additional effort than you're used to to establish that connection before you feel that divine tether come to you. As it does, she takes and sends it out, though, itself taking longer to find purchase and its destination than you expect. But indeed, it does find the essence of Ira Wendagoth. What would you like to say? 
SAM: Bells Hells here, on the moon with you. We've got information and treasure. 
LAURA: So enticing, that's good. 
SAM: And plans, so many plans. 
MARISHA: Tell him I said hi. 
SAM: Laudna says hi. Where can we find you? 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: "Oh my." 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
MATT: "You've finally come along. Welcome to the crimson land of the strange and beautiful." 
SAM: You're wasting words. 
MARISHA: And now he's getting poetic? Jesus. (laughter) 
MATT: "I've been busy watching, learning." (groaning) 
LAURA: He's going to make you waste another spell. 
SAM: That's all right. 
LAURA: He knows it, he knows it. 
SAM: It's all right, he's a friend, you waste spells for friends. In relation to Kreviris, whereabouts might we find you? Please be specific and brief. (laughter) 
SAM: That we may speak more in person. Laudna still says hi. (laughter) 
MATT: "But where's the fun in that?" (groaning) 
MARISHA: Fucking fey. 
MATT: "I'm very interested to talk, but I want to see how interested you are to find me." 
LAURA: This dick. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: What a tease. 
SAM: Am I going to burn another or that's it? 
ALL: No. 
SAM: That's it, that's it. 
TALIESIN: We've been given our answer. 
SAM: When we heard his voice, was there anything in the background? Any sounds? I don't think it works like that, does it? 
TRAVIS: That's the L line! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah! He's in a Starbucks! 
TALIESIN: What did he sound like? 
MATT: Somebody's watching "The Price is Right" in the back. (laughter) 
LAURA: "Fresh fish!" 
TRAVIS: It's the clock at City Hall. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: Get your cockles. 
TRAVIS: Clung! 
SAM: Bing-bong, now arriving at Times Square. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Got him! 
ASHLEY: "If you see something, say something." (laughter) 
MARISHA: Mind the gap. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Okay, you going to reach out to? 
LAURA: Zhesh? 
SAM: Zhesh. 
LAURA: I tried before. She seemed very unwilling to talk, but-- 
SAM: But now we could say something like, "We killed the Willmaster Elzmodius." 
LAURA: Elmuda? 
SAM: Elmuda. 
LIAM: That's very different. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, big-- 
TRAVIS: I think you go with that one. 
SAM: Elmuda. 
TRAVIS: Go with that messaging. 
SAM: "We met and dispatched the Willmaster. We feel we have earned the right to an audience with you." 
TALIESIN: Where did this aggressive--? 
SAM: "Now, give it to us." 
LAURA: You do it, you do it. 
TALIESIN: Were you this aggressive? 
SAM: I need to wash my hands. (laughter) 
SAM: I feel dirty. 
ASHLEY: But how do we know for sure that-- 
LIAM: Letters, how's your mood right now? 
SAM: Real bad! 
LAURA: Is it? 
LIAM: Show me on the puzzle. 
LAURA: You're super stressed, how are you feeling? 
MARISHA: He's been stressed for like three days. 
TRAVIS: Use your toy. 
LAURA: How does he reset stress? 
TALIESIN: Sleep. 
SAM: You don't know. 
LAURA: You attack things? 
SAM: I'm around here. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh no. 
LIAM: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
SAM: You know. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Highway to the ♪ 
LAURA: We need to install an actual meter on the outside of his-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ Danger zone ♪ 
SAM: I could do that. 
LAURA: That'd be great, and then we can all be aware of when you're about to blow. 
TALIESIN: Like a radio. 
SAM: That's a great idea. I'm going to write that down so I remember. Like a mood ring. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that is a really good idea. 
LAURA: Oh, it's turning red. 
ASHLEY: Mood rings? 
MARISHA: He's real angies! 
LAURA: He's in love! All right. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What if Edmuda is friends with Zhesh, and what if they're going to be mad that-- 
TRAVIS: No. 
SAM: Zhesh is anti-Edmuda, I think. 
ASHLEY: They are? We're sure about this? 
SAM: Yeah, I think so, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MARISHA: Zhesh was with the rebellion, the resistance. 
TRAVIS: Short of having bad intel, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Edmuda was not. Okay, okay, that's right. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
MATT: Yes. While this is transpiring, don't want to forget you. 
SAM: Oh, sorry, sorry, Travis, sorry. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: If you had a more interesting storyline, maybe I wouldn't-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Just real quick. What I wrote down was Zhesh reformed Reiloran shriek friends-- 
LIAM: Shrike. 
MARISHA: Shrike. Fuck, I keep doing that. Shrike friends with the Volition glass trader. Volition headquarters are outside Kreviris somewhere. That's all I got. 
SAM: Thanks. 
MATT: While they're figuring this out, you're glancing past and getting as much detail as you can on what bit of the skyline you can see. There are structured outposts along the mountain range that surrounds the city. You can see from the inside, there's numerous very tall, thin spires that have connecting cables or banners, you can't really tell. From this distance, there's still another hour or so of travel before you begin to reach the outskirts of it. But you can see there's, as much as it's nestled in there, there are maybe two dozen very fine, tall points, like very thin towers that seem to be emerging. 
TRAVIS: Those tall, thin points, do the banners look like they stretch from top to top, or from the top down to a point near the bottom somewhere? 
MATT: Multitudes. 
TRAVIS: Criss-crossing in all directions? 
MATT: Yeah, it's a whole series of connections. Like an odd bit of ship sail. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: You know, rope system rigging, but across this tall, thin skyline above the city. 
TRAVIS: Cool. Okay. 
MARISHA: This is an outpost, you said? 
TRAVIS: No, this is in the city. You can see a dozen tall, thin spires with ropes or banners. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
SAM: In or on the edge of? You can't tell. 
MATT: All throughout the inside. 
SAM: Throughout the inside? Oh, cool. 
LIAM: You know, if we could arrange some sort of meeting spot, you could tell Zhesh that we have Elmunda's body as a show of-- 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Oh! Did-- Yeah. 
LIAM: To prove things. 
ASHLEY: We've still got pieces of-- 
LAURA: We have Edmuda. 
LIAM: Well, they probably-- 
TRAVIS: No hands. 
LIAM: -- suffocated in the hole. 
TRAVIS: Hands are gone. 
LAURA: We haven't been able to open it up. Is Edmuda still alive in there? 
LIAM: No, no 
TALIESIN: Probably not. 
LAURA: They wouldn't have been, right? 
LIAM: She would've run out of air. 
TALIESIN: A long time ago. 
MATT: The arms that you threw were from the juggernaut, I believe. 
TRAVIS: They were from the juggernaut, that's right. 
MATT: Edmuda, you guys don't have a corpse of. 
LAURA: We don't? Why? 
TRAVIS: It's in the hole, but-- The last place we saw it-- 
TALIESIN: we don't know. 
TRAVIS: -- was in the hole. 
MATT: The last place you saw it was in the hole. 
TALIESIN: We don't know we don't have it. 
LIAM: That's above the table knowledge though. 
MATT: Correct, that's valid. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
TRAVIS: Just to put it to sleep, the outposts that were up on the rocky hillside or mountainous areas, how far away, like far? 
LIAM: It's a big pile of black pudding. 
MATT: It's an hour just walking to the city itself. It's probably a good two hours to climb, get along the outer edges and climb up to where they are, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Got it, got it, got it, okay. 
LAURA: Okay. I'll try to send a-- 
SAM: Yeah, I mean I think it's-- 
LAURA: Send to Zhesh? 
SAM: This body of Edmuda is really going to be the thing that makes this happen for us. 
LAURA: That's going to be the thing. 
ASHLEY: Yes, you're right. You're right. 
TRAVIS: Just to toss it out there, because we've never been to a city like this and we only moved through the farm, is there any point to hitting an outpost? 
SAM: What does that mean? 
TRAVIS: There's an outpost, an early warning area that's away from the city. It's two hours, not in the direction of the city, but out there, but we could figure out what the guards are like, what kind of defenses they have, what kind of capabilities might we see at the main city? Do they have anything stashed in an outpost that's got less people on it than a city wall? 
SAM: Sure! That's great! 
TALIESIN: You're actually going to-- 
SAM: We still would make-- Oh sorry. 
TALIESIN: -- a foreign city. Just figuring out how not to insult every person that we come across. 
LAURA: Won't we be so obvious if we go into Kreviris, anyway? 
TALIESIN: No, it's a big city and there's weird people from the surface all over right now. I bet they're getting used to the weird. How would they even know that-- 
LAURA: One from another? 
TALIESIN: And that we're particularly unusual. 
TRAVIS: One thing we're missing is, is there-- 
LAURA: Yes, Fearne, you have a question? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is there a code word that people say when they see each other, or a greeting, or a handshake-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- or a medallion that we could take off somebody, and say we came from Outpost blah-blah-blah, under the command of Mike Shinoda. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good idea. 
TALIESIN: One more meeting with a smaller group to make sure-- 
SAM: ♪ M-M-M-Mike ♪ 
SAM, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: ♪ Shinoda ♪ 
TALIESIN: -- we don't stick out too much. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: I'm all right with that, yeah. 
SAM: Either way, though-- 
LAURA: We should contact Zhesh. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because they might have-- The Volition might know how to get around as well. 
LAURA: All right. I'm going to Send a message. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'll do it. Zhesh! (laughter) (moist worm gurgling) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Who's counting? 
TRAVIS: I got it. Nope. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: He's got it. 
LAURA: You didn't trust us before. Maybe the dispatching of Edmuda will convince you. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LAURA: We need to find the Volition. 
SAM: Where are you? 
LIAM: Six more. 
LAURA: We're here to help. 
ASHLEY: Good one. 
LAURA: Outside Kreviris. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
SAM: Clutch grammar. 
TRAVIS: Nice use of the last six. Yes. 
ASHLEY: She's so good at it. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check for me. 
MARISHA: Come on, come on! 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: Ow. 
SAM: Guidance? 
LAURA: Sorry. 
TALIESIN: Big 20. 
ASHLEY: I was going to say it. 
SAM: Can't retroactively Guidance her. 
LAURA: Okay. 20. 
SAM: Hey! 
MATT: 20. You begin to think that maybe they didn't hear you, or they're ignoring you. There's a brief period where there's no response. 
ASHLEY: This bitch. 
MATT: Until eventually, they do come back. "Look. If you must talk, find me in the Jagged Edge." 
SAM: I love that movie. 
MATT: "Within The Clutch." 
LAURA: Within The Clutch? 
SAM: Jagged Edge, Clutch. We have a location. 
ASHLEY: "Jagged Little Pill." 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, yes. 
ASHLEY: Jagged Edge. 
MATT: "Tell Jidoh that--" 
SAM: Jidoh. 
LIAM: Judo. 
MATT: "-- you are of the Vanguard and looking for a contract." 
LAURA: A contract? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. 
LAURA: I like that we're all writing it down. 
SAM: Yep. 
LAURA: Just in case. 
ASHLEY: Just in case, just in case. 
LAURA: We all forget. 
MATT: You can cross reference spelling, it's great. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Judo. 
TRAVIS: I'm drawing feet. 
LAURA: Jidoh. 
SAM: Judo. 
LAURA: I heard Jidoh. Which one is it? 
MATT: Jidoh. 
ASHLEY: Jidoh. 
SAM: Jidoh. 
LIAM and LAURA: Jidoh. 
TRAVIS: Dono. 
MARISHA: That didn't clarify anything. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Which one is a Jidoh? 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Okay, and The Clutch. That seems like a neighborhood in Kreviris probably, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. Jagged Edge within The Clutch. 
SAM: Great movie. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: Are you heading towards one of the-- 
TRAVIS: Towards the city, or towards an outpost? Outpost is a diversion, but if it's smaller, we could either try and blend in, we could-- 
SAM: Learn some information. 
TRAVIS: -- observe, or we could hit them, take their stuff. 
MARISHA: I like the outpost idea. 
LIAM: I think it's better to start small, yeah. 
MARISHA: I agree. 
TALIESIN: What's the ball? 
MARISHA: Oh! (anxious grunt) 
LAURA: (moans) 
MATT: Nothing. 
MARISHA: Nothing. 
TALIESIN: When we get closer to the outpost, that might not be a bad idea. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good idea. 
SAM: Yeah, let's swing by an outpost. 
TALIESIN: I agree. Also, we don't really know what the Jagged Edge is yet. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: Y'all want to swing by an outpost? 
MARISHA: We took off our uniforms, right, our Vanguard uniforms? 
TRAVIS: Verity stuff? 
TALIESIN: I thought we were still wearing them. 
LIAM: Get a Blizzard at an outpost. 
SAM: We took them off for some reason, but we can put them back on. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, Vanguard. Yeah. 
MATT: Up to you. 
SAM: Let's put them back on. 
ASHLEY: If we do go to the outpost, what if they alert the city? What if something bad happens? 
SAM: That's true, but maybe we can send in our stealthiest, wealthiest invisible people? 
TALIESIN: We could also attempt to blend in and try and see what happens. 
LAURA: Be new members of the Vanguard coming through. 
LIAM: We're all in disguise. 
TRAVIS: I think the answer to both of those, is if it's going to go bad, it would be better to be bad at an outpost than the main city. 
ASHLEY: Than in the big-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So let's-- Yeah. 
MARISHA: You haven't tried your little summoning of a Reiloran yet, right? 
LAURA: No, I have not. 
MARISHA: To be an escort? 
LAURA: No, because-- 
TRAVIS: It could be from the-- 
LAURA: I think back on it, yeah. I've had Imperium. One's Imperium, yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, the Kreviris Imperium, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, and I've had Vanguard ones. I mean, fuck me running, Volition ones. 
LIAM: You're so fast, though. 
ASHLEY: I could make myself look like one. 
LAURA: A Reiloran? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: No, really? 
SAM: You have-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, so I've been playing around at night. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Well. 
ASHLEY: Just trying to-- 
LIAM: It's healthy. 
ASHLEY: -- see if I could look, practice my magic. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Sometimes I can look a little different. I think I could look like it. 
SAM: But why would you want to? You're so beautiful. 
ASHLEY: I know, but I'm just saying, if I wanted to look different. 
TRAVIS: "I know." 
MARISHA: "I know." 
ASHLEY: It'd be great. We could use it. 
LAURA: That's exciting! 
ASHLEY: I don't know, just in case. 
LAURA: Yeah, you could be guiding us-- 
SAM: Just you, or other people as well? 
LAURA: -- because most of them have a-- 
TRAVIS: Reiloran. 
ASHLEY: I'm pretty sure it's just myself. 
SAM: Okay, that's amazing! 
TRAVIS: That's infinitely less suspicious. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, in case we need it. I mean, I know you can also summon one, but maybe we can have, if there's more. 
SAM: Yeah, of course. 
ASHLEY: You know. 
LAURA: But, here's my question. 
ASHLEY: Oh, but then it might get pissed. 
LAURA: Well, most of the Reiloran, not to be a naysayer. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, let's do it. We got to break it, we got to see what-- 
LAURA: Most of the Reiloran speak telepathically to each other, they don't use their mouths. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's going to try to do that to me, and I'm going to be like-- 
LIAM: A question for you. 
LAURA: Just stare at him. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm not talking to you. 
LAURA: I've got a broken transponder right now. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LAURA: What? 
LIAM: When someone speaks to you in that way, are you completely zeroed in on where it came from? Like if these three were Reiloran-- 
TALIESIN: You're nuts! 
LIAM: -- and one of them spoke, would you know which one it was coming from? 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Could you speak for Fearne? 
MARISHA: A little mental ventriloquism? 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: Ooh! Sneaky sneaks! Would I know the answer to that? 
SAM: Because you'll be able to hear their thoughts. 
TALIESIN: The Muppet gambit, big fan. 
LAURA: But if they're trying to talk-- 
SAM: If they direct it at Fearne-- 
ASHLEY: I could just be like-- 
SAM: -- but then you could open your mind and hear their thoughts in general. 
LAURA: Direction? 
TALIESIN: I can even be-- 
LIAM: You just look wise. 
TALIESIN: -- in her voice? 
LAURA: What if we're telepathically bonded? 
ASHLEY: I'll just look wise. 
SAM: Matt's going to tell us the answer. 
MARISHA: Matt's going to tell us it's wrong. 
MATT: In your experience, if it's an entity that you're familiar with their essence, you can recognize their essence. Otherwise, it is directionless until the source makes itself known, or it's a strong enough connection that you cannot deny what it is. But the brief conversations you've had with Reilorans in the past and since you've arrived here, it's only because the only real signature is they're there and looking at you when they talk. Otherwise, you're not sure you'd be able to tell where the source was. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: So as long as we stay away from them. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, just give them the nod. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, and I could be like, you know. 
LAURA: I'll be like: Penis. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Penis! 
TALIESIN: Also, as long as it's not someone that's met us. Because then they know your brain voice. 
LAURA: Right, right. If somebody's met us, then we're in for a fight anyway. 
LIAM: Just stroke your chin a lot, tap your head. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA and LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Just stare at people. 
LIAM: All the stuff Imogen does whenever she speaks in people's minds. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I do. 
SAM: Every once in a while, just say: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Well wait, let's see your disguise. Let's see how good it is. 
LAURA: Unless it's going to use it up. 
SAM: Well, that's going to waste a spell slot then. 
ASHLEY: Let me see, let me see. Let me see, let me see. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's true. 
LIAM: Is it effortless? 
ASHLEY: I mean, for me it is. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: For me, it's just-- 
LIAM: We know, Ashley. 
ASHLEY: Okay. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Let's see. It lasts for an hour. 
TRAVIS: I don't know why. 
ASHLEY: It lasts for an hour, so I would have to-- 
LAURA: Do it before we get-- 
ASHLEY: I think it lasts for an hour, I don't know. I just have a hunch. 
LAURA: Just got an idea. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: How far away from the outpost are we? 
MATT: You have a little under two hours of travel, and it's climbing up the side of this smaller mountain. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: It's a hike, switchback up there, and you'll be doing it out in the open. 
LAURA: Oh, the hike? 
MATT: There's no-- 
TRAVIS: Cover? 
MATT: -- forest cover. I mean, the switchback on the mountain will be protected, but at a certain point-- 
TRAVIS: We also look like Vanguard. 
MATT: -- you will become visible. 
TRAVIS: Approaching an outpost? 
MARISHA: We put on our uniforms again. 
TALIESIN: I think it's weirder to be from Exandria and not Vanguard than it is to be-- 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: Plus, maybe nine times out of 10, people just see a group of Vanguard with Reiloran from a distance and go: Checks out, and don't even stop. So, hopefully. 
LAURA: Maybe, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: How many times can you do it? 
ASHLEY: Let's see. 
TRAVIS: Did we see what the caravan looked like? Did we see the thing they were on? 
LAURA: You can always re-up it. Was it carts, or-- 
ASHLEY: I could just keep re-upping it. 
MATT: The two people that saw them and got a good look at them can describe that information. But the carts themselves are not too dissimilar to Exandrian carts. They're a bit closer to the ground. The wheels are at an angle. They were being pulled by the-- 
TRAVIS: Bloody buffalo. 
MATT: Yes, the wuukors. 
TRAVIS: Make it work. 
MATT: There it is. 
LIAM: Also, sorry, just spitballing. Chet? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Master craftsman. 
SAM: MC! 
TRAVIS: Legendary. 
LIAM: Legendary with wood. How's your mask making? 
TRAVIS: It's pretty good. 
LIAM: Could you craft a handful of curved "Dark Crystal" masks for all of us? 
TRAVIS: It would take time. 
LAURA: Plus, how much wood do you have? 
TRAVIS: Not enough. Not like that. 
LAURA: Not like this. 
SAM: Do you need this? I pull out a giant redwood. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: I don't have it. 
TRAVIS: The whole thing? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Those are protected! 
SAM: That would be amazing. 
TRAVIS: I just jump on it. (laughter) 
LIAM: Not here, they're everywhere! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: With time, I could do that. And supplies. 
MARISHA: It's a good idea. 
TRAVIS: Also, if we kill enough people, I could just take their faces and (gooey smack). 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: I could do that, too. 
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
LIAM: I wouldn't. 
MARISHA: Little flesh mask? 
ASHLEY: Sounds glamorous. 
MARISHA: It's great! 
TRAVIS: Little Hannibal? 
ASHLEY: Little Hannibal sitch? 
SAM: What if we gave you all of the toys that you've whittled us, and you used-- 
LAURA: No way, it's too precious. 
SAM: Well, you could use that wood. 
MARISHA: I am not giving up Sashimi. 
TRAVIS: I don't have glue, I definitely don't have nails. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: How do nails work into a mask? Never mind, don't want to know. Let's just, it's a good idea. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's keep-- 
LAURA: Let's go. 
SAM: To the outpost! 
MARISHA: We're having this conversation while we're walking. 
MATT: Trudging up the side of the mountain, as the gradual ascent begins to become more-- 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Aw! Ropey! 
MARISHA: I love him. 
LAURA: Ropey lives! 
ASHLEY: (goofy Ropey noises) 
MATT: (Ropey) "I'll be back!" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: He totally has googly eyes. 
LIAM: He's got Groucho eyebrows. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Aww. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I think the reference they were using in the office was Clippy. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: (Ropey) "It seems you're trying to strangle a person!" (laughter) 
MATT: Climbing up, there is no driven path that you can see, so it's a bit of a climb, and a bit of a walk, and finding your way up the best you can. Who's guiding the path upward? 
SAM: You. 
ASHLEY: Why me? 
SAM: Well, because it was me last time, so I think it's-- 
TRAVIS: Big survival, let's go. 
LAURA: Oh, is this the 20? 
ASHLEY: This is the 20? 
LAURA: This is the big 20, or the survival check? 
MATT: This is the survival check to find the best route up to the top. 
LAURA: I will assist you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm going to try to make sure we're not surprised. 
MATT: Sure. 
LIAM: Looking and listening for strangers. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: Did you roll with advantage? 
ASHLEY: Oh, no, I didn't. I forgot. Shit. 
SAM: Jesus. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
ASHLEY: That's cocked. 
SAM: Also cocked. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, that's-- 
MATT: Six dice rolls to get the-- 
ASHLEY: I know, I'm sorry! I just like this dice a lot. 
TRAVIS: With one hand. 
MATT: No, it's all good. 
ASHLEY: I've lost so many, this is the only other one I like. 
MATT: No, it's okay. I ain't hating. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: You want to get the one you want. 
TRAVIS: Out of all of that, that's the only other one you like? 
LAURA: Listen. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Okay. What the fuck was I just doing? (laughter) 
MATT: Survival check. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Thank you. Okay, so-- 
MATT: I love you so much. 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: COVID fucked up my brain. Okay. 
MATT: As did we all. 
ASHLEY: I have something to blame it on. 
TRAVIS: I spit that everywhere. 
MARISHA: That's the first time you've ever said that. 
ASHLEY: I know! 
MARISHA: It's COVID, I don't know. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It's COVID. Okay. Fuck. 24. 
LAURA: 27. 
SAM: She had it in 2016. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It was 15-- 
LAURA: It was 18 with your advantage. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it was! Okay, 27. Oh yeah, you're right. Okay, 27. 
MATT: 27. 
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise, I'm so sorry. 
MATT: Quickly, you find the most direct route you can that involves the least amount of dangerous rock climbing. Thankfully, you have a rock person, so even the few bits that are challenging you have between you, and now-- did you leave behind one of the two rods or did you take them both? 
MARISHA: No, we took them both. 
TALIESIN: We took them both. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So yeah. Between these rods and that-- 
LAURA: Oh, we could just-- 
MATT: -- climbing is not a huge challenge. 
ASHLEY: I know exactly where to go. 
MATT: But for this hour of travel, let's see how the weather and such occurs. Someone roll a d20 for me. 
LAURA: That's you. 
ASHLEY: Just go for it. 
LAURA: You don't want to do it? 
SAM: You can do it, Laudna. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Jeez. 
LAURA: It's your turn! 
SAM: She rolls so bad. 
ASHLEY: But I hate rolling it because I feel like I always roll something. 
TRAVIS: No no, you're going to be fine. It's going to be fine. 
TALIESIN: We all roll something. 
LAURA: It's going to be great. 
MATT: Yes, someone's going to roll something. 
TRAVIS: We'll get into it in five rolls. 
ASHLEY: 15. 
LAURA: Mm! 
MATT: 15. 
SAM: Hey! 
MATT: Yeah. The sky remains clear. As you begin to reach the summit of this surrounding range of broken mountains, the city of Kreviris is now even more visible off to the side. The rest of you can see these top spires that you had made out at a distance. There are, you know, a smattering of them, about three dozen across this surface. The city seems smaller than you expected. For being the central civilization here, it's probably half the size of Jrusar. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: As far as the number of surface of buildings, but you can see amongst these towers, beneath them are these masses of structures around them. You see these buildings that are carved from stone with round window and doorway portholes, as well as other half-domed exits and entrances. They are put together like egg clusters almost, the way they're amassed in sections and chunks. 
LAURA: I don't like it. 
SAM: (shudders) 
MARISHA: That's really creepy. 
LIAM: Kreviris in the distance, you're saying? 
MATT: Yes, it's looking down over the edge. You can see a little more of the city from this vantage point. You also see the outpost tower that you are currently working towards. It's not terribly massive, but somewhat rock carved rising tower. Maybe about 40, 35 feet tall. Simple. You can see there are a number of windows built into it. There's an entryway and stairs, and there are two figures standing on the top looking down at all of you, and one that is already bee lining to walk in your direction. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. You've already turned yourself? You've turned yourself into-- 
SAM: It's a nice time. It's time. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll turn myself. 
LAURA: Yes, yes. 
ASHLEY: Do that before-- 
LIAM: Turn away and sneeze. 
ASHLEY: Disguise Self, I'm going to turn. Should I look like one of the Imperium, or should I just do a regular-- 
LAURA: An Imperium. 
ASHLEY: Imperium, okay. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. Okay. 
SAM: Oh, you know what? No. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: Misguidance! 
SAM: Enhance Ability. 
LAURA: Mm! 
SAM: Enhance Ability. 
ASHLEY: Nice, nice. 
SAM: You have advantage on charisma stuff. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
LAURA: Even better. 
MATT: Okay. So as you all begin to clamber over the edge of the rock, you transform yourself and you're taking on the form of--? 
ASHLEY: An Imperium Reiloran. 
MATT: Okay, so similar garb that you saw that the Willmaster was wearing. The same intense, almost dark shark eyes. The heavy bone cleft on the skull protruding out back. You step before the rest of the crew that's walking with you in your Vanguard outfits. You can see now the figure that's approaching has a huge shawl of wrapped material over their shoulders. It looks leather, like the color itself blasted of any color, but dusty, brown and red. You can see it quickly or thickly wrapped around the shoulders and hides the left arm. They're very tall and they're not Reiloran. This being, you haven't seen a figure like this before. Maybe about eight feet tall, very thin. From what you can see, the lower half of the body, aside from the leather looking chest plate and torn pants that stop at the knee, the rest of the legs below are bright gray fur and these clawed-like feet that dig in with each step. 
TRAVIS: Bipedal? 
MATT: Bipedal. The head has similar material to the shawl and cloak that it has. Goes over the head, and there are these goggles that are set up on the forehead. You can see this being, it's humanoid, but it's furred on the edges, that same gray and white fur coloration. Best way I can describe it is it's a Sasquatch-esque type entity as it lumbers towards you all and you can see in its one exposed hand, it looks like there's some sort of, you've not seen an object like this before. It looks almost like a crossbow, but the end of it has a bit of that glass affixed to it and upward hooked arc. As it begins to step forward, it holds it at a calm angle at its side. Just letting you know that it's at the ready. It doesn't seem to make any sort of statement or say anything, it stands in-- 
TRAVIS: So far so good. Keep the ruse up. 
SAM: We're all together, right? 
LAURA: We're all together, but we haven't decided what we're going to fucking say when we got here. 
TRAVIS: That's why I was asking about the caravan. Maybe our caravan broke down. We came to the nearest outpost. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good-- 
LAURA: Sure, I'm going to stand behind, directly behind Fearne and think to the guy. 
SAM: Yeah, like new recruits or something. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Their names we have, Elmuda and everything else. 
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. New recruits for the Vanguard. Our caravan broke down. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yours was the nearest outpost. 
SAM: Talk with your hands, too. 
LAURA: No, don't do that. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That was the fighting back a toot face. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's one of these. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yep. 
TALIESIN: That was exactly what was in my head, damn it. 
MATT: Fearne, I need you to make a deception check for me. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
SAM: That's good. It's charisma, you got advantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Do a persuasion. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. Oh, that's good! 
TRAVIS: You have advantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 21. 
MATT: Okay. You hear in your voice as it looks towards you, cocks an eye a little closed and goes, "Well, I don't know why you'd bring recruits up here to our outskirt locale unless they're assigned here, but whatever we can do to help, you just let us know." The figure puts their hand up underneath and you see the clawed fingertips run some of the snot from under its nose. 
LAURA: As you were. (laughter) 
MATT: "All right." Rests it onto its shoulder and turns around and starts walking back towards the tower, and shouts out, "They're fine." 
SAM: Oh, with his voice? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
TRAVIS: You're fine, or-- 
LAURA: They're fine, they're fine. 
SAM: So from where we are sitting, do we see other folk up there? 
MATT: You see two figures on the top of the tower. 
SAM: Two, okay. 
MATT: They're still sitting and watching. 
SAM: Are they the same type of creature? 
MATT: It's hard to tell. They're both wearing the same head covering that both shades with, but they both have goggles over their eyes. Actually one of them probably has it up. One of them looks to be bormodo, though a little more of a militaristic energy to them. You can see they have this long, some sort of a ranged weapon. 
TRAVIS: Ah, didn't pack out our supplies very well. Do you guys have any water we can have? 
MATT: As you approach, the first figure is walking alongside you. "I'm sure we could work something out here." Looks back to you and kind of. 
MARISHA: Shit, he's talking to you. 
LAURA: What do you want? I say from her head, I say: What do you want from me? 
TRAVIS: Are you not hearing anything? 
LAURA: No because he's focusing on her! 
MATT: "Well, I want to make sure I get everything straight on this about what your commanding officer is so I can ensure that you and your troop have been properly put into our records." 
LAURA: You don't recognize the Willmaster? 
MATT: "I..." Make a deception check. 
SAM: The Willmaster?! 
TALIESIN: Just going for it? All right. 
LIAM: I don't know how you should-- 
ASHLEY: Oh god. Is this advantage again? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: I could. 
ASHLEY: Nice. That's cocked. That's cocked. 
SAM: 21. 
LIAM: What the shit? 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. I know, I'm sorry. 
LIAM: It was crooked and it wasn't even leaning into anything. 
ASHLEY: 22. 
MATT: 22. 
TALIESIN: The cage die. 
MATT: "My apologies. Don't get a lot of Willmasters or Will-anybody up this side of the range. We have-- By all means." He looks confused and steps back a bit and sets the weapon to the side and steps inside the tower and pushes past. You can see now the door, it doesn't close. There's a heavy curtain that's split in the middle and he pushes it aside as he heads. 
TRAVIS: I stay right on his heels. Going in, looking around, looking around. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Casual looking, looking the fuck around. 
MATT: Okay. You come inside. Two things you notice. On the inside, there are these glass lanterns hanging that are lowly lit, but as soon as you and this figure step in, they brighten by proximity and flicker slightly to light the inside. You can see there's the open window that looks off to this edge. You can see there's a staircase that spirals up to the next level above in the tower. It's relatively simply furnished. There's a handful of chairs and stools set around the space. You can see there's a what you expect to be a barrel, but the material doesn't appear to be wooden. It's almost lopsided, like it melted a little in the sun. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: But the figure walks over and reaches inside and pulls out some sort of dried, scratchy looking material and starts gnawing on it before sitting back on the stool. Looks back at you. "I don't know what else you want." 
TRAVIS: Just water. The barrel? 
MATT: "Over--" and he points to a, there's another glass jug that's right next to it that looks like it's partially embedded in the ground. Like you can only see the top half of it. The jug has a screw top that comes off and. 
TRAVIS: I'll go over, try and-- 
MATT: It's easy to pull free. 
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: There's a-- 
SAM: Hit it with a spoon. 
MATT: There's a bone-carved ladle that's resting inside of it, and you can immediately hear the sloshing as you move it around inside this, you have to scoop the water out for your own use. 
TRAVIS: It is water? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay, great. 
MATT: It's liquid, at least. 
TRAVIS: Has it been pretty dead around here lately? 
MATT: "No, there's been a lot of business, lot of folks going in and out." What are the rest of you doing? 
TALIESIN: I want to-- 
LIAM: I want to check-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead. 
LIAM: No, go for it. 
TALIESIN: I want to see if there's a place to get a view. I want to see the city. 
MATT: You can go towards the edge of the mountain range a little ways off from the tower, or there's the top of the tower, too. 
TALIESIN: I was thinking about going to the top of the tower. 
MARISHA: I'll join Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I don't want to be looked at too closely. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to stand next to Fearne and pretend like I'm her right hand. 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
MARISHA: If we go up to the top of the tower, are people going to be like, "Where the fuck you going?" Or is it pretty easy to just wander up? 
MATT: I mean, it's easy to wander up. There's a staircase that leads up further above. 
TRAVIS: Two bodies up there, right? 
MATT: You saw two figures up there. 
TRAVIS: Three total, so far, that we've seen? Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to wrap myself up pretty tightly. Goggles. Try and cover as much as my face as I can and look like I'm the bitchy member of the group. I'm like (sighs). 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Just don't talk to me. 
LAURA: Traci? 
TALIESIN: I'm not-- 
MARISHA: Yes. Traci's back, baybee! 
TALIESIN: I'm preparing for terrible dust up there and yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Also, when he came out, his general appearance, anything different or that stood out uniquely from the other Vanguard that we've seen up here? Anything different from the kind of stuff we are wearing? Vestments? 
MATT: Yeah, they're not wearing Vanguard vestments. They're just wearing survival vestments with heavy-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. 
MATT: -- dust blown cloaks. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Okay. 
MATT: Slightly more of a militaristic look, but it's all definitely weathered. So these folk-- They definitely feel like the kind of individuals that would be set on the outskirts to keep watch for an extended part of their lives. 
TRAVIS: Got it, yeah. 
MATT: They're all appear a little crusty. 
TRAVIS: Siberia. 
MATT: Yeah. So as you're sitting there, just looking at you still chewing. 
LIAM: It is been hard out there for us. How do you do it as long as you have? 
MATT: "That's how it's always been. Sorry we're not as soft." 
TRAVIS: But, I tell you-- 
LIAM: We're learning. We're learning. Trying to fit in. 
TRAVIS: Soft is right, though. Cut myself all the time. I'm a little further up there in years. Oh. Oh. But my knees and my back are just, they're killing me. Especially with these flares. 
MATT: Glances back to you and goes-- 
ASHLEY: Do I hear anything? 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: Do I hear anything? 
MATT: Are you listening into his mind? (laughs) 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Are you using Detect Thoughts? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm! 
MATT: Okay. Detect Thoughts, you come in partially into it and you hear. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Really think they're going to be of use? Some of them appear to be a little--" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "-- a little plump, ready to fall or fall dead any minute." 
MARISHA: "A little plump," is that what he said? 
LIAM: Excuse me? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: I'll say-- 
LIAM: With these cakes? 
ASHLEY: I just, since I can feel him looking at me. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: So I'll do a-- 
MATT: It's enticing to many. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: These Dreamers, they don't know what they're in for. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! Ooh! 
MATT: He responds and he nods for a second. "I don't know what all that business is, but I could use less drier time, so whatever it takes. Take them below." 
LAURA: We will. We'll make use. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "Can I get you anything? You seem a little off kilter." 
LAURA: No, I'm just sick of these Dreamers. 
TRAVIS: I'll finish with my-- 
ASHLEY: I'm going to sit down and act like I'm meditating or something, so he stops talking to me. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Put your headphones on? 
LIAM: Yeah, put earbuds. 
LAURA: You're like, "Oh." 
ASHLEY: Yeah, put my headphones on. 
LAURA: Where's my phone? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm going to go over with my propeller hand and start blowing a fan at her. 
TRAVIS: Thanks for the water. That really fills the old pouch. 
SAM: (fan whirring) 
TRAVIS: I'll start heading back towards the exit of the hut. As I'm scanning, any weapons, gems, any panes of glass, anything that could be used as a communication device, anything like that? 
MATT: Make a perception check. He does exit, by the way. After you sit down, he gets up and starts heading back out of the tower for his-- 
LIAM: Are we alone now? Temporarily. 
MATT: Temporarily in this room, you're alone. 
SAM: If we're alone now, I'm going to start ritually casting a spell. 
LAURA: Yes, please. 
SAM: I didn't realize I could cast it ritually. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
SAM: It'll take 11 minutes. 
LAURA: I don't want to waste another fucking 5th-level. I used one already on-- 
SAM: I know. I'm ritually casting Telepathic Bond. 
ASHLEY: I could feel he was talking in my head. He just kept looking at me. 
TRAVIS: 16 for the inside of the bottom of this tower. 
MATT: 16? You can see there are the lanterns that are there and the surface of them is a rough glass texture to the outside, and they're still brightly glowing in your presence. There's no other weapons in this base floor. This seems like a general entryway. Other than a sitting and conversational space, it's fairly empty. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll keep moving out since I don't want to give off too strong of a vibe. 
LIAM: The Sasquatch- looking fella left the door that we entered? 
MATT: Yeah, he went out through the curtains to the exterior from where you entered. 
LAURA: How long have we been traveling since we came up from underground? 
MATT: Let's see. That would be, I'd say it's probably been about almost two to three hours since we started, which was about an hour since you left from underground. So about four hours since you left. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Which means you probably have two more hours on the-- 
LAURA: We cast the mind one as soon as we came up from underground. 
MATT: Right, yeah, so it would be-- 
LAURA: So it would be four hours left. 
MATT: Four hours left, yeah. Okay. Meanwhile-- 
SAM: Four hours left in what? 
LAURA: Mind Shield. 
MATT: The two of you step up to the second floor. 
MARISHA: As we are a minute by ourselves, as we head up the tower, I'm going to tell Pâté to go invisible. 
MATT: Okay. (whooshes) (softly) "Don't worry." 
MARISHA: (shushes) 
MATT: You come up to a second portion of the tower. This looks like a middle floor that has three window portholes on the sides of it you saw from a distance. As you get to the second area, there are two tables set and three figures that are sitting. 
TRAVIS: Six total. 
MATT: Three Reilora, all at these various chairs, are looking at each other before they all look over towards you. 
TALIESIN: Us or just-- 
MATT: I mean, you right behind her, but you're probably the first one to emerge and glance over in your direction, and one of them goes into your mind. "Welcome." 
MARISHA: I can talk back, right? 
MATT: Give it a shot. 
MARISHA: Good to be here. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I just keep going. 
MATT: They just watch as you pass by, heads slowly turning, acknowledging you as you continue onward. They slowly look back at each other in silence. 
LAURA: That'll be a very quiet city. 
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see. 
TRAVIS: Can I follow the guy that gave the water outside of the lower floor of the tower? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I run up and go: Excuse me, one more thing. 
MATT: "Hmm?" 
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to bother you. Listen, I'm really trying to impress the Willmaster, but I'm doing this for my family. You look like you would make your parents very proud. I've forgotten the name of this outpost and if I don't tell the Willmaster, they're not going to let me join. Could you remind me of the name? 
MATT: "Tyran A." 
TRAVIS: Tyran A? Oh, that's right. Tyran A. Thank you so much. You're very kind. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I'll walk off a little bit. 
MARISHA: In the outpost, is there-- 
MATT: Make a deception check for me. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
LAURA: I have Detect Thoughts up on that guy still. 
MATT: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: 15. 
MATT: Okay. They watch you walk off and you see him straddle up to a sitting rock at the edge of that cliff and he sits up on it, and starts looking off over, keeping an eye. Occasionally, he'll pull out a weird spy glass thing, and look off in the distance as you head back to the tower. 
TRAVIS: I'll show him my back. Just unassuming, waiting for the rest. 
MATT: All right. The two of you get all the way to the top and there, this is an open, a half-crenelated, it's a somewhat sawtooth pattern to the top of the tower, to give an area as to either look hidden or to take protection if you were to get into a firefight. But the two figures that were up there originally are sitting up there, almost like they were waiting for you to arrive. 
ASHLEY: Uh oh. 
MATT: You see one of them looks very much like the first figure that came to you, though female. You can see her, she has these curved tusks. One of them goes straight and one curves back into the cheek where it's pushed into the skin a little bit. She has her goggles up, and has what looks to be an Exandrian firearm across her lap. 
SAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: Ugh! Fucking Percy! 
MARISHA: Guns have made it to the moon. 
TALIESIN: (Percy) Okay, I wasn't sure it was actually going to get to the moon, but that is pretty impressive. I mean, it's terrible. 
TRAVIS: That's some "for all mankind" shit right there. 
TALIESIN: Rolling to identify if it's actually a Whitestone build. No, never mind, carry on. (laughter) 
MATT: The other one you see is this crotchety, somewhat grinning looking bormodo, who is sitting on the opposite side. Same head garb with the hood up, the odd, solid hillside-like person outline that they keep here. As the dust is blowing by, their goggles are still on, brightly, and they have that, you know, cherub-like cheeks pressed and folded beneath it. The mouth is half-cocked into a grin, and they themselves have another one of those crystal-pointed handheld devices that the first gentleman had. They're looking over as you step up, like they're waiting. The female furred figure with the tusks looks at both of you while the bormodo goes, "Heh, heh. Hi. Hi, hi." 
TALIESIN: Hey. 
MARISHA: Hello. 
TALIESIN: Just up here for the view, if that's okay. 
MARISHA: Had to get some fresh air from all this dust. Ugh, it's exhausting. 
MATT: "Very fresh." 
MARISHA: Ugh, I walk past and lean over the edge of the crenelated parapet and slump, looking outward, not interested. 
MATT: "W-why are you here?" 
TALIESIN: Well, how here do you mean? Why are we here, right here? Or why are we? I don't know, it's weird to say I've never been on the moon before, but it's not your moon. This is a lot to look at. 
MARISHA: While Ashton distracts them, I'm going to talk to Pâté and tell him to go do a little scout of the surrounding area-- 
MATT: (wings flapping) 
MARISHA: -- and look through his eyes while I-- 
TALIESIN: Sorry, this must be boring for you, but, yeah, I've never seen the city before. 
MATT: "What's it like?" 
TALIESIN: Oh, down where I come from? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
TALIESIN: I'll make you a deal. You ask me a question, I'll ask you a question. We can go back and forth. 
MATT: He looks over towards the other figure, and you see the furred woman, arms crossed at this point now, with a rifle across her lap, goes, "I'd be careful." 
TALIESIN: You don't like the question, you don't have to answer it. Ditto on my end, too. 
MATT: (Bormodo) "(excited noise) Okay. Okay." 
LAURA: Ugh. 
SAM: I like him. 
TALIESIN: You can go first. 
MATT: "What's a strawberry taste like?" 
TALIESIN: (sighs) It's-- 
SAM: Chicken. 
TALIESIN: It's almost like, have you ever had sugar? I don't know what's sweet out here. It's very, very sweet, and it bursts with water. If you cook them, they become really syrupy and it's just, oh, it's so good. It's very sweet. Just like a sponge of sugar. 
MATT: "(understanding noise)" 
TALIESIN: You can never get enough of them. They're only around certain times, but they're really good. 
MATT: You can see this drool is slowly dripping off the side of its somewhat pulled-in chin. 
TALIESIN: How do you know what a strawberry is? 
MATT: "I've seen them when I sleep." 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's right. Well, hopefully, that'll get fixed. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
TALIESIN: They're worth it. Do you spend much time in the city? So if I ask a question about the city, you might know? Or are you just up here all the time? 
MATT: "I only go for provisions. I spend most of my time here." 
TALIESIN: Oh, so you wouldn't know like--? I've never been here. What's the best bar or food in the city? You know, these strawberries are great, but if I wanted a really-- 
MATT: "That's your second question. I get to ask now." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead. 
MATT: "What's a blueberry taste like?" (laughter) 
MATT: As we come to-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I can keep that up. 
MATT: You are currently ritually casting, and what are you casting? 
SAM: Telepathic Bond, which I've only just now realized I could've been casting ritually every single day of this campaign. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh? 
SAM: Uh-huh. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Well, better late than never. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Ja, you have to know which ones you can ritually cast. It's very useful. 
LAURA: Very important. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: But I'm-- I'm sure the ritual has verbal and somatic and all these components, so I'm trying to make it look like I'm doing a-- 
LAURA: Beep, bop, boop. 
SAM: Yeah, a power down, power up-- 
MATT: Okay. 10-minute ritual casting. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: So we'll say from that point, we're about halfway through the casting. 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: You are searching around through Pâté. What are you looking for? 
MARISHA: I would love to look for, (sighs) if there's any groupings of armaments, if I can tell vivid pathways through the outposts and into the city. Can I get an idea of machines of war? Just start to try and get a beat on what they have. 
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for Pâté's perception. 
MARISHA: It is through Pâté. 
SAM: (sighs) This fucking guy. 
MARISHA: I know. Do I get advantage, since I have an advantage on abilities checks with this? 
MATT: Technically, it is your perception; I'll allow it. 
MARISHA: It's my perception, but through his eyes, so I have to roll-- 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: -- for his charisma. 
MATT: Oh yeah, so in this instance, I would say probably no, then. 
MARISHA: (sighs) But what if it's a stone thing? It's part of my stone shape thing. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's stone stuff. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Oh, you-- 
TALIESIN: Do you have the stones for it? 
MARISHA: Come on. Come on, Pâté. (laughs) It was almost a natural 20, too. 10! 
MATT: 10, okay. From this high up, you know, there's faint details. What he does pick out, the immediate thing he notices, is beyond the cliff edge beyond the tower, there is a massive, smooth funnel that leads outward and you begin to pick up details around this mountain range that surrounds the city. There are multiple other outposts that keep watching different positions, but beneath each of these, another one of these massive funnels opens up and comes to a stop as it curves down the mountain range, like a massive horn. 
MARISHA: Like a horn? 
ASHLEY: (deep horn sound) 
TRAVIS: That sounds like-- 
LIAM: ♪ Ricola ♪ 
MATT: Hope you never find out. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: ♪ (jaunty melody) ♪ 
MARISHA: But it's carved into the ground? 
MATT: Carved or built into it, yeah. 
LIAM: Cool. 
ASHLEY: ♪ (jaunty tune) ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: You hear ringing through the surrounding echo. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
MATT: Glancing out into the city, you can see numerous winding, tangled streets. This city, for as refined as you maybe expect aspects of a society that's been doing dealings with Ludinus and the like, the surface of this Kreviris is fairly empty and the structures and makeup of the city itself looks kind of dilapidated, or at least has suffered the elements for a long time, that a lot of its fine details have worn off or it just, elements of it almost remind you of Bassuras in an odd way. The fact that it looks like it is in disrepair and you don't see a bustling series of open thoroughfares and central streets. You do see figures moving through, but sparingly. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: That's as much as Pâté can make out, but. 
SAM: (like Pâté) Ooh. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Don't worry, I got it all right here." 
MARISHA: Can I have him focus in a little bit more, if we have a little bit of time, to see if he can specifically seek out passages or entrances to underground thoroughfares? 
MATT: "I'll go ahead and see what I can do!" 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: He continues to glide off. Meanwhile, we come back to the top of this tower. 
TALIESIN: Not nearly as sweet, but it kind of, it helps. You can have a lot of them and they burst really quick. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
TALIESIN: Your friend is happy to help if you can answer. She can answer any of these questions. Like, I really want to find some good drink while I'm there. I love it here so far. Well, it's been a bad day, I need a drink, and I want to find something real good. 
MATT: "Spreaky's Drip." 
TALIESIN: Spreaky's Drip? Good name! Do you know what neighborhood it is? I know I already look weird, but I want to blend in. 
MATT: "On this side of The Clutch." 
TALIESIN: This side? What's The Clutch? 
MATT: "Right on the edge of The Clutch and The Crumble below, you'll find the Drip. (laughs)" 
TALIESIN: Oh, between The Clutch and The Crumble. I appreciate that. One more question you ask, I give you one more? 
MATT: "What's an apple taste like?" 
TALIESIN: I thought you were going to go raspberry. That's impressive. Oh, I love apples. They're very-- 
MATT: While this is happening-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Carry on. 
LIAM: I wanted to wander out after the Sasquatch- looking individual, and sidle up. Not get the jump on him or anything, just walk up and stare in the direction that they're staring. Then: Can I ask, they told us when we got here to keep our head on the swivel. The Attrition, I think? Jump on you from out of nowhere. Do they make it in this far? 
MATT: Looks over the shoulder towards you. "You'll know when they come, or maybe you won't." He points out and you can see along the mountain range, there's one section of the hill that points that direction. You can see it, it's blackened and crumbled. You can see there's ruins of what looks to have been an outpost at one time. 
LIAM: How'd they do that? 
MATT: "They were everywhere." 
LIAM: I'm a little green on the battlefield. How do you know when they're coming? 
MATT: "From what I've been told, it's just kind of a gut feeling." Make a deception check. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: (squeaking metal) 
SAM: You poked the bear. 
LIAM: I'm literally green. Heh. 20. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Dirty 20? 
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled a 19. 
MATT: Looks you up and down, (spits) spits on the ground. "Just keep your wits about you and if you hear something loud and dangerous, you run." 
LIAM: I can do that. 
MATT: "Why are you here?" 
LIAM: Well, I was having dreams back home and I met this other lady. She was having them, too, so yeah, we came together. Met more. 
MATT: "Welcome to the hell hole." 
LIAM: Feeling more and more like that every day. How's that work? I look at his device. 
MATT: Hides it under the cloak. "I don't know, how's that work?" He looks over at your sheathed weapon. 
LIAM: Stick people with it. 
MATT: "It's real tiny." 
LIAM: Oh my. Anything bigger, I kind of can't lift it. They told me to start small. 
MATT: "Vanguard be accepting anybody these days." Sits back in his chair and shifts his focus away from you. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: While this is happening, you are now about seven minutes into this ritual. 
SAM: (vocalizing) 
MATT: As two of the Reilora from the mid floor begin to descend the steps. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Fearne. 
LAURA: Should you get up and go? Should she step outside? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to go outside. 
SAM: You're just going to walk away. (laughter) 
MATT: You hear in your head, "Willmaster, we were not aware we would be having an appearance of any of the Will. What do you require of us?" 
SAM: In her head or in Imogen's head? 
MATT: No, in Fearne's head. (laughter) 
LAURA: I look at you and say: What, what is it? What are they saying? 
ASHLEY: Can I talk to you? 
LAURA: Yeah, you can talk to me. I'm in your head. 
ASHLEY: They wanted to know-- 
MATT: "Willmaster." 
ASHLEY: What? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Did you forget? 
ASHLEY: No, I didn't! 
LAURA: What do they want? 
ASHLEY: He's talking to me at the same time I'm trying to talk to you, so-- 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't move and put your hands down. 
MATT: They both look at each other and narrow their eyes a little bit. 
ASHLEY: What they should do. Like if they had anything for them to do, because they were like, "Willmaster." 
LAURA: Look at them, look at them. (laughter) 
LAURA: I need nothing from you. Go about your business. 
MATT: Make a deception check. (groaning) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I still have advantage, right? Ooh, that's a natural 20! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
LIAM: Roll it again, get another one, get another one. (laughter) 
SAM: Was that the first roll? 
ASHLEY: That was the first roll. 
SAM: Good, because you don't have advantage anymore. 
ASHLEY: Oh, phew! 
SAM: I believe when-- 
ASHLEY: So that's a 23. 
SAM: Do you need to concentrate to ritually cast something? 
MATT: I believe so. 
SAM: Yeah, but it doesn't matter, that was your first roll. 
ASHLEY: That was 23. 
MATT: 23. 
TRAVIS: Oh, golly! Golly! 
MATT: "My mistake. Please, give our appreciation to the Will. Should they be looking for more aid on the ground, we're ever eager to be relocated. Please." 
TRAVIS: That's clutch. 
MARISHA: Yeah, 100%. 
MATT: One of them look at each other and begin to back up the tower once more. Kind of somewhat sheepishly. 
LAURA: Phew. 
ASHLEY: Phew. 
LAURA: In their heads. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
MATT: You finish the ritual. 
SAM: Then, let's see. Do they have to be near me for this to activate? 
TALIESIN: We're not that far. 
SAM: That's true. Everyone has to be within 30 feet. So I'm going to make a quick loop around the tower and try to activate our mental bond, if they're-- How tall is the tower? 
MATT: I'll say you can gather everybody from a distance to know where they are and let it effect. 
SAM: Hey, hey, we're online, we're online, we can talk to each other in our heads. 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
LIAM: Oh my god, you could have been ritually casting? 
SAM: I just figured out how to do this spell today. 
TRAVIS: But if you cast another concentration spell, does it break it? 
SAM: No. It works for eight hours now. 
MATT: It lasts-- 
MARISHA and LIAM: Oh, holy shit! 
SAM: It's a 5th-level spell. So I've only had 5th-level spells for the last-- 
MATT: It lasts for an hour. 
SAM: Three levels. 
LAURA: It lasts for an hour? 
SAM: Oh, it lasts for an hour. 
MATT: Telepathic Bond, it says here it's one hour. 
LAURA: Oh, really? 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh fuck, really? 
SAM: Oh, you're right. 
LAURA: We totally used it like it was eight hours last time. 
SAM: We did, but you know-- 
MATT: You could have been ritual casting it this whole time! 
SAM: The whole time. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Clutch. 
SAM: Yeah, can you keep ritually casting it all day long like unlimited times? 
TRAVIS: With 10 minutes to cast it. 
MATT: Yeah, but you have to have 10 minutes to do it. 
SAM: Cool. 
LAURA: Rituals are awesome. 
MATT: It costs materials each time you do it, depending on the spell. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Two eggshells. 
LAURA: Great, from different kinds of creatures? 
MATT: So you're going to have to go to a grocer. Yeah. 
SAM: I have some eggshells from my baking materials. 
MATT: That's true, you would. 
SAM: But I probably need some more. 
LIAM: Caleb's eyes have rolled backward into his head, out his mouth, and across the desert. (laughter) 
SAM: I'll use them as eggshells. 
MATT: Perfect. 
TRAVIS: Chetney's out front collecting the guys' intestines like a power cord. I couldn't help myself. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: He looked at me too funny. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (gnawing) 
SAM: So have we gleaned-- in their heads: Have we gleaned as much as we're going to glean from this gleanage? Should we get the-- 
TALIESIN: I was going to ask my last question, then I'm out. 
SAM: Oh yeah, ask one more question, and let's get out of here. 
MARISHA: Pâté was doing one more focused. 
TALIESIN: Crisp, little sour, grape baked in a pie. But anything I should do? I don't want to embarrass myself down there, and I want to come back. I know that's weird. I can see how this can get old. Like how do I not just piss everybody off? I tend to piss a lot of people off. 
MATT: "Don't talk." 
TALIESIN: That's hard. Anything else? 
MATT: "No, that's the question. My turn." 
TALIESIN: Actually, there, I've got to go. But tell you what, if I'm back down this way, which the way things are looking, I will be, I'm going to figure out how to get some fucking fruit up here. 
MATT: "Please." 
TALIESIN: (sighs) 
MATT: "What?" 
TALIESIN: I'm already heading down. 
MATT: "Wha-- What's a pear taste like?" "A pear?!" (laughter) 
LAURA: Just staring up. (laughter) 
LIAM: We all hear that throughout the tower. 
MATT: You head back down and there's the three Reilora in the middle area. They're now diligently looking out the windows. They're now very intently looking and holding their post. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I want to head down with Ashton, but did Pâté find anything? Passageways underground? Entrances? 
MATT: Roll another perception check for Pâté. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: Come on, familiar. 
ASHLEY: Come on, Patty. 
LIAM: Roll high. 
LAURA: This is it, this is the one. 
MARISHA: This is the one. 
TRAVIS: Pâté! 
LIAM: Pate. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
ASHLEY: Patty T! 
MARISHA: Patty T! 
TALIESIN: It works on the real one. 
MARISHA: 11. 
SAM: Yep, that'll do it. 
LIAM: That sounds like Pâté. 
MATT: "There ain't no ways underground, sorry. You want me to keep looking, or come on back?" 
MARISHA: Come on back. 
MATT: "Okay. Hey, where are you?" 
MARISHA: Where I fucking left you in the tower. I'm heading downstairs because I can't wait for you alone with these weirdos. 
MATT: "Okay!" He's making his way in. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: You all-- 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: ♪ Makin' my way ♪ 
MATT: You all slowly gather back towards the base of the tower. For the time being, from what you can tell, you haven't been sussed out. What are you doing? 
MARISHA: I-- 
TALIESIN: Gather up and-- 
LAURA: Could I have used the time that we were here to put my circlet back on? I took it off because-- because. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Now Otohan can track us, and if this spell goes away, which it will in four hours, and we don't have another scroll, I want to not be able to be tracked. 
MATT: Okay. Yeah, I'll say you can take the time here as you were sitting about talking, setting up this ritual spell, more of a short rest to attune it. So I'd say you can definitely put it on you, but to attune it, you need a little more of a break. 
LAURA: Got it. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Saddle up. 
LIAM: We're all bonded, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: We are. 
LIAM: So in the head: Is there anything else we want to try to unravel here? 
TALIESIN: We got a lot. I've got a place to drink in the city. I've also got a bit more of an idea of what the Jagged Edge is. 
TRAVIS: We can remember it's the Will. 
TALIESIN: The Clutch. 
TRAVIS: This place was called Tyran A, like Tyran dash A? Or like Tyran-- 
MATT: Like T-Y-R-A-N. Tyran A. 
TRAVIS: Just the letter A? Cool. 
MARISHA: I tell everybody: I was able to see there's these outposts. A lot of them scattered all up and down the edges, and they each have these giant war horns carved into the rock out. It didn't look like much of the population was above the city. Kind of looks like the city could get blown off the face of the moon with one big gust. It's pretty raggedy. But I'd be willing to bet most of the population is underground. 
LIAM: If they need war horns, at least we know that every single thought isn't just thunk across the distance every second of the day. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
LIAM: To have need of that. 
TALIESIN: I get the feeling thoughts are more like needles in haystacks, at this point. You got to know what you're looking for. You got to be looking for it, otherwise, kind of like you, it's just noise. 
LAURA: Yeah, unless you're someone like Ludinus who can project like he did all over Exandria. 
MARISHA: I look at the Treshi scry ball. 
MATT: Nothing. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Should we head into-- 
SAM: The city? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Boy, next time we come here we have to bring a fuck ton of food, because, boy, dreams apparently have made everybody really weird about food. 
MARISHA: It's true! They've all asked about food. 
LAURA: I don't know. 
LIAM: We bought our way through any place with some produce. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Next time. 
LAURA: That's a good thing to know, actually. 
TALIESIN: Fill that fucking bag. 
LAURA: I-I-I don't know if what we're doing here, Fearne, is going to keep being a good idea because-- 
ASHLEY: I know, that last one really scared me. 
LAURA: Really when they're looking at you, I'm like: Are they talking to her? I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're already. 
ASHLEY: I almost just talked out loud because I got scared. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I was like, shit, I don't know if she's hearing. 
SAM: It worked. 
ASHLEY: It did work. 
SAM: If we were telepahthically bonded-- 
LAURA: Telepahthically. 
SAM: Telepahthically bonded it would've been much easier. 
ASHLEY: Telepahthically. 
LAURA: That's true, that's true. Maybe it'll be fine now. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: But hey, you got to figure out what's wrong with it in front of six people rather than-- 
LAURA: Probably like 15 minutes, 
MATT: Like 20 or so minutes from this point. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Should I keep it up? 
MARISHA: Well. 
LAURA: Yeah. Why not? 
MARISHA: Let's all circle around Fearne like we're her guards. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Great idea, great idea, great idea. 
LAURA: All right, and we head to Kreviris. How far away is it? 
MARISHA: Try to find this bar? 
MATT: You're right on the edge of this mountain range and you can see where this cleft valley where the majority of the city sits near where those horns were, you did also see there were walkways that went deep into the mountain range and led it straight into the city. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'll guide people from what I saw, I guess. 
LIAM: Does that mean we're going to be zigzagging between more of these towers the entire way? 
LAURA: I think the towers go around the city, right? 
MATT: Yeah, a ring around the tower. 
MARISHA: Could I get some sort of a gauge of distance between tower versus tower? 
MATT: There may be about a quarter mile to a half mile between each one. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay, and we're going like this from the tower down to the city. 
MATT: Down into the city itself. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Did we notice, is there one big gate for the city or are there several little gates for the city? 
MATT: From what you can tell, there's only really one major entrance to the city. That's the opening of the valley. The rest of it is completely ringed in this mountain range where all these, it is all built into this Helm's Deep-esque-- 
LIAM: Martian Helm's Deep? 
MATT: You know? Yep. 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: Sunken into this space. 
TALIESIN: I think it's going to be very apparent what the Jagged Edge and what The Clutch is. That's my-- 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Very apparent. 
TRAVIS: We go. 
SAM: Yeah, let's go in. 
LAURA: Yep, yep, yep. 
MATT: Descending deeper into the city as the light begins to shift through the afternoon, you can sense the bit of sunlight that comes around here to lighten the space and the bright glow of Exandria ever locked and present above begins to darken as one of the nearby storms begins to threaten the horizon. Uncertain if it's going to hit the city or passed by enough to darken the space like it's having a slight brown out, but heading down, you can start seeing more of the people of the village leaping from tower strand to edge walkway. You can see now where all these various towers are, there are rooftop platforms that almost set among these, these tall spires that mark probably no wider than maybe 10 feet at certain points. These platforms themselves have rope bridges, some sort of rope-like material bridges attaching them. Those cables that you saw connecting, they're long strips of this leather-like material. Some of them look like they were colored once and the color has been stripped through time and storm. But this is an odd rope climb network of an upper portion of the city that sets a level of shade over the main bottom street-level portion where all of the majority of living spaces, buildings, structures, and presumably businesses are all jammed together like these odd pod clusters. You know, ominous sense of silence begins to break with the sound of laughter and some conversation from the street below. Still silent in comparison to a bustling city, but signs that not all the populace sits in quiet, mind-linked conversation. You glance down and see in the nearest alcove there is what looks like a mud pit and a number of small creatures being kept there. You hear the laughter again. It looks like a cluster of small children hiding in the shadow, laughing and currently petting or brushing one of these small shaded creatures. Now this is the nearest approach as you conjecture on how best to step foot into the core of Kreviris, we're going to take a break. 
TRAVIS: Oh man! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: We're at the gates. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LAURA: There's like no guards? There's no guards blocking the entrance? It's just like-- 
MATT: Well, you guys are coming down from the outpost. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, we're-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: Right now. The main entryway you haven't gotten a good look at because you dodged it to go up into the mountain range. 
LAURA: Got it. 
LIAM: Bish have that scry ball on speed dial. 
MARISHA: I was already thinking it. I'll probably be annoying at the amount of times that I say "I look at the scry ball." 
TRAVIS: Good. 
ASHLEY: Do it. 
MATT: That's fine. 
TALIESIN: Uses a widget, as a fidget spinner. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Like doing the-- 
TRAVIS: Doing the "Labyrinth" roll? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the Bowie. 
MATT: Yep. Well, take this break to figure out what your plans are when you step in because you're just about there. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: You've skirted some pretty interesting possible danger. I like that. But yeah, we'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll see you shortly.

LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Oh my gosh, it's so amazing. Style should never be a dump stat, Darling. You need this? You probably need this. This is pretty badass. Oooh, look at this. Look at the details, oooh. Oooh, so comfy cozy. I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
TALIESIN: Catastrophe lies at the edge of the Vastchasm for any circle daring enough to tempt fate, though when stakes are high, great risk is a calculation worth taking. A long lost and dangerous relic has surfaced from the depths of time. The assignment we've handed to our investigators is simple: Parley with the dealer, recover the artifact, and return to the Pharos. But a circle is at its most vulnerable when a threat is underestimated. And for those lucky enough to return home, Serenity awaits. The Circle of the Crimson Mirror: Assignment #4149, Seeking Serenity. 
Oh hey, it's us. Your friendly neighborhood ambiguous shadowy weirdos here to say cryptic things at you as usual. Are you ready for the third and final season of Midst? We certainly are. Some of you have been waiting a very long time. Good news: the wait is almost over. Midst, man. What the heck? A lot of questionable characters doing incredibly problematic things to each other in a series of increasingly insane escalating circumstances while struggling to follow their warped moral compasses and do what they think is hopefully the right thing. Can the Trust get… worse somehow? Can Phineas get less worse? How much longer can Lark outrun her past? Are there any objectively good guys in this story? Other than Moc Weepe. How can any of these threads possibly be resolved with only one more season to go? And we STILL don't even know what happened with that dang moon. Are we ever gonna get some ANSWERS? Yes. As a matter of fact… we will. The third and final season of Midst unfolds February 14th. Listen to the pure sound experience anywhere you stream podcasts or watch illustrated video episodes on the Critical Role YouTube channel. In the meantime, you can follow us at @midstpodcast or join the Fold on Midst.co to get early access to episodes, behind the scenes bonus content music downloads, digital artwork, and more. Everything's been leading to this. We'll be with you to the end. Do you Trust us?

JESTER: Oh hey, everyone. It's me, Jester. So the Traveler and I were going to tell you guys all about subscribing to Twitch, but, um, (giggles) it sort of seems like he's not really here right now, which is so stupid. Traveler? Traveler?! Artie! (grunts) You know what, it's fine. I can do it by myself, with myself. (laughs) I Invoke Duplicity. DUPLICATE: Oh, hello, Jester. JESTER: Hi, Jester. Okay, so what we're going to do today is tell the people at home all about the good stuff they get when subscribing to Twitch. DUPLICATE: Oh, I don't know what Twitch is, but that sounds good, let's go. JESTER: No, that's perfect, because this works for you, too, then. Okay so, there's a professionally moderated live chat. DUPLICATE: Ooh! JESTER: And if you subscribe, you can post the links in the chat. DUPLICATE: (gasps) Like a link to a cool hamster video? JESTER: Exactly like that! So what we do here is tell, like, really cool stories, right? And sometimes, like, crazy shit happens when we're telling those stories, and people that subscribe get special emotes so you can express how you feel. DUPLICATE: What if you live on the side of Exandria where it's really late, and you're like, "I'm just going to close my eyes for a few seconds," and then it's two hours, and the music is playing, and you're like, "Oh no, I missed the whole show!" JESTER: Oh no, that's a great question. Well, if you subscribe to Twitch, then you can just watch all of our VODs as soon as the live broadcast ends. So cool, right? DUPLICATE: So cool. JESTER: I know. Another really cool thing is you can gift subscriptions to people. Like, I could buy a subscription for you, duplicate Jester, and for other p-- What are you doing? DUPLICATE: Look what I found. JESTER: Oh my gosh, paint brushes. DUPLICATE: I could draw a dick. Oh, well, technically, technically that might break Twitch's Terms of Service, so. But there's no rule against, like, drawing chubby little snakes. DUPLICATE: (giggles) Yeah, or a really long balloon sword. JESTER: Yeah, or like a really thick rope, with like, two honking knots at the end of it. DUPLICATE: Cucumber, with two tomatoes. JESTER: Yeah! A banana, you know, sitting next to an onion and an avocado. DUPLICATE: Like a mushroom, with like a little cap on it. JESTER: A wiener dog, with just two feet. DUPLICATE: Yeah. JESTER: Artie, where are you? DUPLICATE: Should we go look for him? JESTER: Yeah, sure, why not. Oh, don't forget to subscribe to Critical Role. Okay, let's go! DUPLICATE: Okay! [whimsical music] 

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back, as I hit the microphone. Welcome back. 
TRAVIS: (cartoon boing) (laughing) 
MATT: (microphone feedback) All right. Descending into the shaded interior of the main streets of the village, you head down the stone steps that eventually break into this side alley, where many of the towering clustered structures basically block out the majority of the sky above you other than the winding alleyways that push through beneath. As soon as you begin to step down, you can hear that giggling again by that little mud patch that was situated. You see these two smaller kids that are looking from the side at the rest of you. 
LAURA: What do the children look like? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: One of them you can see it looks like a young Reilora, about waist high. The other looks to be a-- You can only assume it's a Bormodo because of the rounder shape. So the two of them together have a Mario and Luigi visual aesthetic. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
MATT: As they're both looking off to the side. 
SAM: I'll go up to them. 
MATT: As you approach, they both (nervous whimper), and start to walk back a bit before the Bormodo begins to run off, but the Reilora grabs the collar and keeps him from going and pulls him back in. 
SAM: Smiley Moon to ya. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Hi. We're new around here. 
MATT: They look at each other. 
SAM: Are you playing a game? 
MATT: The Reilora looks up with a big smile. You can see the wide, dark eyes looking towards you, and a smile, and you can see the small layers of serrated teeth on the inside of the mouth as it puts its hand up. "We were washing the ryndons." 
SAM: The ryndons? Do we know what that is? 
LIAM: We haven't heard that before. 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: What's a ryndon? 
MATT: "These are the ryndons," and points over. You can see there are these hog-like creatures that have these mole-like hands. You see now there's these weird dug alcoves in the side where that mud pit is. 
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness! 
MATT: You can see there's two of them laying in it and rolling and cooling themselves off in this muck in the shade. One of them was one of the ones they were brushing. You can see they have these thick, mud crusted layers of long fur that goes over their bodies. They look like moles, but with the snub, hog-like nose with tusks. 
SAM: Do they like being cleaned? 
MATT: "No. They like to be brushed. That's how you clean them." 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: Are they your pets? 
MATT: "No, they just live here." 
LIAM: In your head, Fearne, I say: That'd be a good look for you, Fearnie. 
ASHLEY: Oh, good-- Yeah. 
SAM: Oh, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I should take that look sometime. 
MATT: The young Bormodo, the masculine features give you the sense it's a young boy. He's just wide-eyed, staring, not making any noise. The Reilora child elbow him in the side, and be like, "Say something." (Bormodo child) "Hi." 
SAM: That's the Reiloran? 
MATT: The Reiloran's been talking to you. 
SAM: Oh! Oh. 
MATT: This is the Bormodo. 
SAM: Has the Reiloran kid been talking with his voice? 
MATT: With her voice. 
SAM: Oh, her voice. 
MATT: With her actual mouth, yes. 
SAM: Okay. Hi to you, as well. 
ASHLEY: What are your names? 
MATT: "I am Asha, this is Kelito." 
ASHLEY: Asha and Kelito. 
MATT: "Hi." 
LAURA: Aisha, or Asha? 
MATT: "Asha." 
LAURA: Asha. 
ASHLEY: Asha. Asha and Kelito. 
MATT: The boy, Kelito goes, "Is it true that you are the Dreamers?" 
SAM: They are Dreamers. I'm actually just a dream helper, but yeah, they're Dreamers all right. 
MATT: "You're made of metal." 
SAM: I am made of metal, yeah. 
MATT: "Wow." 
ASHLEY: Turn your lights on for them. 
SAM: Oh yeah, I'll cast Light, and turn on my lights. 
MATT: They both go (yelps) and scatter off a little bit, and they start giggling. 
ASHLEY: It's all right. 
MATT: Pushing each other over for a little bit. 
SAM: Yeah, you can touch me if you want. 
MATT: The Reiloran reaches out with the clawed fingers and (nails screech) 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) scrapes a little bit. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
MATT: "Very cool." 
LIAM: We're all kind of new, and super shy. Is this your home? 
MATT: "Yeah. We live here in The Clutch." 
SAM: The Clutch! That's this neighborhood here-- 
LAURA: The whole thing. 
SAM: -- or just the whole outer area of the city? 
MATT: "The Clutch is all of this." As they point out, you can see all the various buildings that are clustered like groups of eggs. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: What's it like? What do you do around here? 
MATT: "Right now, we find games to play and we try and stay out of the open areas when the storms come and the hunters come from the storm shadows. Then we need to stay out of the way with the newcomers. When the Imperium comes by, we have to just not say or do anything." 
ASHLEY: Do you-- 
TALIESIN: That's pretty smart. 
ASHLEY: You all go underground, right? Areas where you can-- 
MATT: "No, we're not allowed to." 
ASHLEY: You're not allowed to? 
LAURA: Is it something you can only do when you're an adult, or? 
MATT: "No, we are Clutch folk." 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh, Clutch folk are not allowed? 
MATT: The little boy goes, "Well, our family's not important enough." 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Well that doesn't seem very fair, does it? 
MARISHA: Caste system. 
SAM: Is the part down below called The Crumble, is that what it's called? 
MATT: "No, no. This here? There's The Clutch, and there is The Banners," and he points up to all the towers, "Then there is, down below here--" Let me get the actual build up here. Down below is called Vaterra Kreviris. All of the above is the Caeluma Kreviris." 
SAM: Caeluma. 
LIAM: Caeluma Kreviris. The the lower was what again? 
LAURA: Vaterra. 
LIAM: Vaterra. 
MATT: "But don't go into The Crumbles." 
ASHLEY: How come? 
LAURA: It's dangerous? 
MATT: "The Crumbles are the big cracks. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
SAM: The big cracks? 
MATT: "It's where the rougher folk live." 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Wittle buddies. 
LAURA: I'm going to pull out a couple of the Goodberries that we picked, and I'm going to hold them up for each. Would y'all like to try something from Exandria? 
MATT: They look at each other. They reach over and take-- How many do you have in each hand? 
LAURA: I just have one in each hand. 
MATT: Okay, they each take one. They look at each other. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Oh. 
MATT: "(giggles)" 
LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: Now, ordinarily, do not take food from strangers. 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: That's a bad idea. You shouldn't do that. 
LAURA: But we're fine. 
SAM: We're okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, those are very good for you. 
LIAM: How long have The Clutch folk lived in The Clutch? 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
LIAM: But I mean-- 
MATT: "Oh, we've always lived here." 
SAM: What's your people's history? (laughing) 
LIAM: No, but have you guys been here-- 
LAURA: How are babies made? (laughs) 
MATT: "We've always lived just right around the corner." 
LIAM: Right, and your folks and your folks' folks, a long time? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LAURA: Can I ask y'all a question? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LAURA: Do you know of a place called the Jagged Edge? 
MATT: "No, no." 
LAURA: No? All right. 
ASHLEY: Insight check. (laughter) 
MATT: Roll an insight check. 
MARISHA: You're lying, you fucking kids. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Tell me where the bar is! 
ASHLEY: You better fucking tell the truth. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yes, we've got trouble, right here in-- 
ASHLEY: Insight, I forget. 28. 
MATT: 28? 
LAURA and MARISHA: (gasp) 
SAM: Oh, a whisper! 
MARISHA: Whispers! 
SAM: A whisper-- I'm not supposed to read this for a whisper. I'm supposed to read it for battle. 
LAURA: Oh, then don't. 
TALIESIN: Children are filled with lies and deceit. 
MARISHA: Then don't. 
SAM: Maybe I should. 
LAURA: Then don't fuck it up. 
SAM: Maybe I will. Laudna-- 
MARISHA: Stop! No! 
MATT and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Buy the kimono. 
LAURA: They don't know shit? 
ASHLEY: They didn't know shit. 
MARISHA: Are we being watched? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
ASHLEY: Good call, good call. 
SAM: What? 
MARISHA: Ugh, jesus. Was that cocked? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's cocked. 
MARISHA: It's on the edge. 
LAURA: It is a bit cocked. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Living on the edge ♪ It's worse! 
LAURA: ♪ (singing tune) ♪ 
MARISHA: Ooh, ooh! It's not too shabby! Okay, yeah, I see it, 24. 
MATT: 24. No one's watching you at the moment. You do notice that the little Reiloran girl is looking past you all right now, and eyes wide towards Chetney. 
MARISHA: Towards Chetney? I shove Chetney to the front. 
TRAVIS: Hmm! 
MATT: She's taller than you by about two inches, and is like, "You're so small, but so old." (laughing) 
TRAVIS: That's right. When you've lived as long as I do, you grow up, and then down. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "How long have you been living?" 
TRAVIS: Close to 400 years, I think. 
MATT: "Whoa." 
TRAVIS: What about you? 700 years? 
SAM and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: That's incredible. 
MARISHA: Wait, is that true though? 
TRAVIS: You're really tall for 700 years old. I bet a lot of people could learn something from you. 
MATT: "(shy giggle)" 
TRAVIS: Pretty smart. The brains of the operation, this one. 
MARISHA: You know, you're talking to a master craftsman. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: The best toy maker in Exandria. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: They look at each other. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Do you know what toys are? 
MATT: "I've-- We've--" 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
MATT: "I think I've had a dream once." 
LAURA: (gasps) They don't have toys, Chet! 
SAM: You could be the best toy maker on two planets. 
TRAVIS: Slow-mo reveal. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Two planetary bodies. 
TRAVIS: Perfectly balanced rocking horse. I take it, I place it on the ground, wait! I tilt it to one side, let it go. 
MATT: "(gasps)" They look at each other and look at it, bright-eyed, and "(excited gasps)." 
LIAM: Inception. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: It's yours. 
LAURA: Now, you'll have to share. Be good. 
MATT: The small Bormodo boy, Kelito, goes, "We can share." (shouting protests) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Got to handle it with love and care. 
SAM: Psychic Lance. 
TRAVIS: Do you feel how exciting that was when you saw it move? Your job is to spread that joy. So take it to other kids, show it to your folks. Show them what you found. But you have to take care of it. That horse is your responsibility now. 
MATT: They both look at it. "Horse. Where did you find this?" 
TRAVIS: I made it. The only thing I didn't give it is a name. 
MATT: The older Reiloran girl goes, "I'm going to name it Borse." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Borse the horse? 
TRAVIS: Borse? 
SAM: Borse the horse. 
ASHLEY: That is adorable. 
MARISHA: That is a-- 
TRAVIS: Splendid name. 
MARISHA: That is a choice name. That is great. 
SAM: You said you didn't know where the Jagged Edge was, right? But what about Spreaky's Drip? 
LAURA: No, it's like a bar. Y'all probably wouldn't know where bars are. 
TALIESIN: Some odd questions to be asking the children. 
ASHLEY: Is there a main part of town, you know? Where people go and eat? 
MATT: "We're not supposed to go far from here." 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Where do adults usually walk to when they are going to-- 
MATT: They look at each other. They both point further in the city, and they get distracted looking at Borse again before they look back. "Can you make more of these?" 
TRAVIS: I can, but it takes time. The more I make, the less special they are. So take care of this one, because I know when you're sleeping-- 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: -- and I know when you're awake. And if you're good, for goodness sake, I'll bring another one around. 
MATT: "What's your name?" 
TRAVIS: Chetney. 
SAM: Claus. 
MATT: "Chetney?" 
SAM: Chetney Claus. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Claws. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Chetney Claus. 
TRAVIS: No, not Claus, just Chetney. 
MATT: "Oh." 
SAM: Claws. 
ASHLEY: Chetney Claws. You know, it works. 
TRAVIS: Chetney Claws. All right. 
ASHLEY: It's pretty clever. 
TRAVIS: Fuckin'-- 
MARISHA: Wow, that's been there the whole time. 
ASHLEY: That's been there the whole time. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: CC-POP Industries on the moon, LLC. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: They both stop for a second and look-- 
SAM: You could be the Santa Claus of the moon. 
MATT: -- worried for a second. They look back, and you can see from around the corner, there's a Reiloran wearing scrappy clothing and a heavy over the shoulder cloak. Looks over, and sees you all. Gives this motion, and the two kids come rushing to them, and dart around the side. Steps forward, and you hear in your head, because you're the one who's closest to it, "I'm sorry, what do you need?" 
TRAVIS: Oh, nothing. We were just imparting a gift from Exandria to your children? 
MATT: "Child and her friend. We don't want any trouble." 
TRAVIS: Oh, no trouble at all. There's no trouble here. They were showing us a kindness, we were returning it. After all, all we have is each other here, don't you think? 
MATT: "Sure." 
TRAVIS: That doesn't seem like a common sentiment for you? 
MATT: "The Imperium is needing to put everything towards the coming move, so." 
TRAVIS: The coming, yes, the coming move, yes. 
ASHLEY: Yes, of course. 
TRAVIS: Well, even in these moments of great import, it's the little things that count. The Imperium can be very object-focused, objective-focused. We're part of a task force to turn that frown upside down. Don't smile. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Don't you do it. 
MATT: "Well, we don't know anything about any of that, so we promise, we--" 
TRAVIS: We were never here. 
MATT: "They're just children." 
TRAVIS: Of course. 
TALIESIN: Is there a place called the Jagged Edge around? I'm so sorry, we'll let you leave after that. 
MATT: You hear the voice in your head. "The Jagged Edge is on the far end, at the base of the sculpture of the Vidulch skull." 
TALIESIN: Gotcha, thank you. We will not take your name so that you don't have to worry about that. We don't need any of that. We'll get out of your hair. 
TRAVIS: What was the skull? What skull? 
MARISHA: Vidulch. 
MATT: "Vidulch." 
TRAVIS: Vidulch. 
TALIESIN: Vidulch. 
MARISHA: The dulch? 
TRAVIS: Vidulch skull. 
SAM: Is that an area? 
LAURA: Vidulch. Vidulch? 
MATT: Vidulch is what was said. 
LIAM: Sassoon. 
TRAVIS: Vidulch. 
MARISHA: Have we heard Vidulch yet? Is that an animal? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: My god, stop saying Vidulch. (laughter) 
MATT: "Vidulch." 
LIAM: If you don't look good, we don't look good. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Please, feel free. Yeah, go ahead. 
TRAVIS: Enjoy the gift. Thank you for your time. 
SAM: Oh, but you're using your eraser because you've always had it. 
MATT: The Reiloran turns back to the kids, and quickly disappears around the corner. 
TALIESIN: Got to be careful. I don't know if that gift is going to survive that encounter. 
SAM: The horse? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Borse? 
SAM: Borse the horse? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It's okay, it's one of the exploding ones. 
LAURA: Borse the horse is fine. 
TRAVIS: They'll all be dead soon. 
LIAM: Are there ryndon still puttering around out here? 
MATT: You do see the few of them that are off in the shaded corner there. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: One of them is laying on its back, settled in the mud and it's drying a little bit. 
LIAM: How big are they? 
LAURA: Aw, I'm obsessed. 
MATT: They're about maybe four feet from end to end, they're not massive. 
LIAM: They're how high? 
MATT: About two feet. 
LIAM: Two feet, okay. 
TRAVIS: Looks tasty. 
LAURA: No, Chet. 
TRAVIS: What do you mean, no? Primal. 
LAURA: Are we giving our real names here? 
TALIESIN: I wouldn't. 
SAM: You mean Bell Hells? 
LAURA: No, our just names. 
SAM: What can they do with a name? 
LAURA: Well-- 
TALIESIN: A lot. 
TRAVIS: Otohan knows our name. 
LAURA: I think Otohan knows our names and knows our descriptions. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, but you don't have a brand to uphold. There was an exception to the rule. 
LAURA: Oh sure, Chetney Claus is important. 
SAM: You can be Bimogen, I'll be Bresh Cut Brass. 
MARISHA: Oh, are we taking the Borse naming convention? 
ASHLEY: The Borse thing? 
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
MARISHA: I like this idea. 
LAURA: Baudna. 
SAM: Baudna. 
MARISHA: Baudna. 
SAM: They'll never catch on, Bearne. 
ASHLEY: I'm Bearne. 
LAURA: Ooh, yes you are. 
LIAM: Hey, Bearne. 
ASHLEY: Hey, Bearne. 
MARISHA: Wow. ♪ With my Baudna ♪ 
LAURA: All right, let's walk-- 
ASHLEY: Jagged edge. 
LAURA: -- towards the jagged edge. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Treshi scry ball. 
MATT: Okay, nothing there. 
LAURA: Anybody in the streets? 
LIAM: ♪ Dee dat dee dat dat ♪ 
MATT: There are people in the streets that are walking through. It's not heavily-- 
LAURA: ♪ People in the streets ♪ 
MATT: It looks as the-- 
ALL: ♪ Dee dat dee dat dat ♪ 
MATT: -- recent dust storm has passed, a few more folks are wandering out. Most of the folk you see here are a mixture of Reilorans, of Bormodos, even a handful of smatterings of the gray-furred elongated folk that you had encountered by the outpost you first came to. 
LIAM: Looking around and seeing the few folk that are traversing here. Do they seem outside of the whole, military push isn't the right word, but the-- 
TALIESIN: We're making people nervous. 
MATT: Many of the ones that you see here look to be just civilians. A lot of them look a little rough, thin, provision-starved. In some cases, some of them are gathering what they can. You see a lot of them, they're darting from underhang to underhang, trying to make whatever movement they're doing quick. Then about three minutes in the walking, you see a lot of them scatter. 
LAURA: Oh, should we scatter? They're scattering. Should we scatter? We scatter. 
TALIESIN: If it isn't us, then we should scatter. 
MARISHA: I agree, yeah. 
ASHLEY: We should scatter. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: It was all mental. 
MATT: I want you all make a group stealth check, please? 
TRAVIS: Do we have things? 
MARISHA: Do we have things? 
TALIESIN: Not anymore I don't think, because it's been way too long for-- 
TRAVIS: A real stealth check. Woo, I love it. 
LAURA: Has it been an hour since we, yeah, it's been an hour. Jesus Christ, why do I suck so bad at stealth? 
TALIESIN: Oh, you should be on my end of things. 
TRAVIS: Oh, 19. 
MARISHA: 13. 
SAM: Six! 
LIAM: Oh wow, here we go. 
LAURA: Yikes. 
ASHLEY: Natty one. 
SAM: Yeah! 
LIAM: Yep, we fucked it. 
LAURA: Nine. 
MARISHA: Oh wait, I have advantage because I have advantage on ability checks. 
MATT: Right. 
MARISHA: That's a little bit better, 15. 
LAURA: Why do you have advantage on ability checks? 
MARISHA: Because I sucked the ring, because I sucked in a ring. 
LAURA: Because you stoled a ring. 
MARISHA: I didn't stole it, we were all in agreeance on that one. 
ASHLEY: I didn't stole it. 
MARISHA: I stole a soul that we don't know yet. 
LIAM: 14. 
LAURA: What did you roll? 
TALIESIN: 13. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
SAM: Not great. 
TALIESIN: I have disadvantage on all ability checks. 
SAM: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: I don't. And I rolled lower than you. 
TALIESIN: For two days, yeah. 
LIAM: All right, consequences. 
MATT: All right, so you all dart off into the nearby shadows as everyone else scatters out of the way. You can see there are the sound of scratching on stone as two avadons start trudging through the street. You can see them harnessed up and riding on their back, there are two Reilora helming the front as the beings are (snorts). You hear that weird sucking, sniffing sound. They do not have visible nostrils, but you can see there's a weird pocket underneath where the mouth is that opens as it inhales to take in some sort of a scent or something else, as it looks around or moves its shoulders around, it's taking in the vicinity. There's a few other figures stepping behind it as it moves through, and you can see it looks like there's a wheeled container of some kind that's being pulled by a singular juggernaut, which is walking it behind as they do, heading in from the entryway from the city, from the front part. As they're moving through this main street, one of the avadons (squelching snorts). 
MARISHA: Do these things have eyes? Or do you think they're just using mental sense? 
MATT: You do not see eyes anywhere. 
TRAVIS: Any nostril slits? 
SAM: Just the breath hole, right? Does it see us? 
MATT: Who got the natural one? 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Me. 
SAM: The smelly lady. 
MATT: Describe to me where you hid. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I hid... I tried to just walk into a door, but the door was locked. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Just face into the door. 
MATT: So (impact) into the door. 
LIAM: Rattle, rattle rattle. 
ASHLEY: Go, go, go! 
MATT: As you're trying to get the door to work there, and there's no knob on it, it's like a handle, but it looks like it's being blocked from the other side or it's locked in. 
ASHLEY: This is not even a door. I don't even know what this is. 
MATT: You're like (panting). Then you hear (snarls) behind you. The warmth of breath on the entirety of the back of your shoulders. You slowly turn around and you can see the wide tooth-filled mouth of the avadon right there in front of you, and one Reiloran who's sitting on top, looking down at you with its dark eyes and its head, bony crest, point upward with this curve with detailed paint or tattoo marks across down the front. It's wearing some heavy metal and bone-plated shoulder bits. It holds the reins in the top of it. It looks down, and you hear in your head. "You're out in strange places, Vanguard." 
ASHLEY: What of it? 
MATT: "What is your business?" 
ASHLEY: I really don't think that's any of your business. 
MATT: "There have been a number of rising attacks across this city. We're on alert. I think it is very much our business." 
ASHLEY: Where have the attacks been? 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: "Answer my question. Exandrian." 
ASHLEY: Wait, am I still a Reiloran? 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: No. 
ASHLEY: No, that was probably gone, okay, okay. It's probably gone. Could you ask me one more time? I'm so sorry. (laughter) 
MATT: "Who are you and what are you doing here?" 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, what am I doing here? 
LAURA: Can I look up? You said buildings are crumbling, right? 
MATT: Yeah, there's rougher aspects of the outside. Looks like it's been worn and sandblasted by the dust storms as they come through. 
LAURA: Does it look like anything buildings up high look loose at all or-- 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LIAM: It's still really quiet around here, except for us and this group? 
MATT: It's near silent. Everyone else scattered and currently, it's just this one troop that's heading through the city. 
TALIESIN: Full spaghetti western. 
ASHLEY: I came here because I am Ruidusborn and I was called here. I don't fully know what I'm doing here yet, but I know I'm supposed to be here for the beating heart. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
ASHLEY: Damn. (groans) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: You've got this. 
ASHLEY: 16. 
SAM: Oh, not bad. 
MATT: The avadon (snarls). 
ASHLEY: May I? 
MATT: It settles in towards you. As you put your hand up, "May I--" 
MARISHA: You pet the dog! 
MATT: -- it snaps-- 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: -- but an inch from your fingers. "Who are you under? Who is your commanding officer, Vanguard? "How long have you been here?" 
ASHLEY: Only like four hours maybe? Maybe longer than that. I don't really know how long we've been here, I've been here. (laughter) 
LAURA: Do I see any loose buildings? 
MATT: What did you roll? 
LAURA: 12. 
MATT: 12? I mean there's two nearby towers that look like they're rough-- looking, it's kind of a gamble. 
LAURA: I am going to cast Telekinesis. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to double my spell distance. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And I'm going to try to bring part of the building that's starting to crumble loose to where it falls. I don't want to attack them, I want it to make it seem like the buildings are falling apart. I want a loud fucking crash. 
MATT: Okay, as you're doing that, the entity looking at you, the Reiloran is glaring down at you and says, "We'll clarify this. You'll have to come with us." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Sure. 
MATT: All right, so you watch as, are you walking away from the door? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: How many of them are there? 
MATT: You see the two avadons with Reiloran riding on them and there is a juggernaut that is behind them pulling some sort of an apparatus. That's all you can see at the moment, but you only have a view of just around that edge. 
SAM: Two beasts, two riders, and a juggernaut. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: In a wide open space that's being watched by two dozen guard towers with big as fuck-- 
LAURA: Right, which is why I'm not trying to seem deliberate. 
MATT: Winding alleys and roads and such with some buildings in the way, so it's not completely wide open. 
LIAM: Mini canyon. 
SAM: Do you hear that, we're not completely open. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're not out there. 
SAM: We could throw down and get away with it. 
TALIESIN: I think so. 
MARISHA: Let's see if they get crushed. 
MATT: I need you to roll a d20 and add your spell modifier, which I believe is your charisma, five? 
LAURA: Spell attack is plus 10. 
MATT: Well, no, not your spell attack, your spell modifier. 
LAURA: Modifier, right. 
SAM: Are we all sufficient? Can we see this happening more or less from our hiding places? 
MATT: I think most of you have hidden, you can all see this happening. I don't know if-- 
LIAM: So 30 to 60-second conversation at this point. We're just in hiding places listening to it. 
MARISHA: We can all see it in our heads, theoretically. 
LAURA: Yeah, 13. 
MATT: Okay. You see bits of rock and stone. It's not quite coming free, you're going to have to spend a little more time to try and pull it down. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Did they notice that at all? 
MATT: They're focused on you. 
ASHLEY: I am going to Wild Shape into a fly. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: And try to fucking scram. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Into a fly, you immediately transform. There's a moment where the Reiloran pulls back and the avadon's going to (snarls) and it's trying to snap you up in its massive jaws. The minute you begin to pull away. That is going to be a 22 to hit. 
SAM: Oh boy, well, it was a good idea. 
ASHLEY: Wait, do I get a reaction? 
MATT: You do, but it has to be something you can do in fly form. 
LIAM: ♪ There was a big avadon who swallowed a fly ♪ 
ASHLEY: That's right, because I can't use-- When I'm in Wild Shape, I can't use my spells. 
MATT: Spells, correct. 
ASHLEY: My spells. Fucking fuck! Okay, that hits. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, that is going to be 12 points of piercing damage. As it slams down onto your body. 
LAURA: Oh gosh. 
MATT: Your fly, I don't think has more than a hit point and you immediately return to your form in the dark enclosed toothy space that is the mouth of the avadon. 
MARISHA: Mirror Image. 
LAURA: (grunting) I'm really pulling. 
MATT: All right, now we're going into initiative. 
LAURA: Well fuck. (groaning) 
ASHLEY: I tried, I tried. 
SAM: Laudna, Chetney, Orym, and Imogen are ready to join you on your adventures. Bring home these cuddly companions today. Check out the Bells Hells plushies or plushes at wizkids.io/bellshellsplush. 
MARISHA: Plushes. 
SAM: Just bells hells. That's /bellshellsplush. Oh boy, we're fighting on the moon. 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
TALIESIN: Is rolling for initiative something that gains disadvantage or no, out of curiosity? 
SAM: It's an ability check, yes. 
TALIESIN: It is an ability check, so. 
MATT: You'll have disadvantage. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's normal for me then. 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
MARISHA: So we are rolling for initiative? 
TALIESIN: Yup. 
MATT: Yup, we are. 
MARISHA: All right... 
MATT: So for the six of this. So this was where the figures were. 
MARISHA: Ooh, look at that, that is a natural 20 where it's borderline wasted. 
SAM: It's not wasted, because I get a bonus from it, so thanks. 
MATT: This is the other figure here, and Fearne-- 
LAURA: Did you take one earlier when she rolled a nat 20? 
SAM: I did, but it only lasts a minute. 
LAURA: Nice here, though. 
MATT: The group minis are elsewhere. 
LAURA: Oh no, where? 
MATT: I think they're gone. 
SAM: Isn't that some of them? 
TALIESIN: No, those are all critters. 
MATT: Yep, that's all right, I got backups here, I got backups here. 
TALIESIN: I'm sure they're on their way right now because of random panic. 
LIAM: Flying them in. 
SAM: I see people running. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: (yelling) 
TALIESIN: Mini down! 
MATT: Yep. All right, so, Fearne, you would be there, but you are currently devoured. 
TALIESIN: Are they big enough to devour? 
MATT: The mini is a proxy. 
TALIESIN: Okay, got it. 
LAURA: So it's bigger than that? 
TALIESIN: Put it in my head. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, because you'd be riding them, they're the size of a horse, right? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Okay. 
MATT: Here, this will make it easier. It's a little more of a size thing, this will help. 
LAURA: Oh, they're big. 
LIAM: (creaking) 
MARISHA: Is that a hippo? 
LAURA: Well, it is a size thing. 
MARISHA: It's the size of a-- Ho boy. 
TRAVIS: That's a baby rhino. 
ASHLEY: These biggies. 
MARISHA: Baby rhino. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That's a big fucking-- 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I would-- Yeah. 
MATT: So now for the rest of you, choose where you were hiding in this space. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: Largely over here. 
TALIESIN: Oh, we wouldn't have scattered-scattered? 
MATT: The minute you guys pushed off to this side to hide from where everyone was scattering away from, This was where it would be. 
MARISHA: Were there doors and stuff to jump into the-- 
LAURA: There's no windows to jump into? 
MATT: Not from this position. 
MARISHA: I'll be, I guess tucked into this. 
LAURA: That's where I was going to say, too. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Is it, but-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, we could've tucked in there together. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'll say that there's stairs there, I may have crouched on the stairs. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: I might've been in the rocks right behind, right over here, I think. 
MATT: Over here? 
TALIESIN: Actually, that would've been too far away, wouldn't it have been? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Probably behind, see towards you underneath the window behind the stakes. 
MATT: Over here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, a little closer, though. Yeah, using those for some cover. 
MATT: Got it. Chetney? 
TRAVIS: I'll go under the tent. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: There's a little door under there, yeah. 
LAURA: Oh yeah? 
LIAM: Those extend up and up and up and up super high? 
MATT: Correct, yeah. 
SAM: I had rolled a six stealth, so I'll be right behind Fearne, right behind Fearne in that alleyway back there. 
LAURA: What did you roll for stealth? 
SAM: Not great. 
MARISHA: 15. 
LAURA: Okay, I would probably be in front of Laudna, because I rolled like dog balls. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Like dog balls? 
TALIESIN: Like dog balls. 
LAURA: Yeah, I rolled a nine. 
MARISHA: Dog balls. 
LAURA: Nine! 
TRAVIS: Like dog balls. 
SAM: By dog balls, you mean beautiful. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I think these are the same-- 
SAM: Ugh! 
LAURA: Ugh. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: -- pike borders. I think these are the same pike borders from the Titanstone Knuckles fight from Vox Machina. 
SAM: Oh really? 
TALIESIN: I think they are. 
LAURA: The same what? 
MARISHA: I think he made those with toothpicks back in the day, didn't he? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think those are the things-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- that he used to make the bound of the fight. 
MATT: Those are actually more official ones. 
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. 
MATT: I still have the ones that I made back then. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I was like: Are those the ones from-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yours looked just as good, Matt. 
MATT: There we go. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: They did. 
MATT: Well, thank you. I appreciate that. 
MARISHA: What's our game plan here? Are we just trying to get Fearne and run? 
MATT: Sorry, I'm pulling out my-- 
LAURA: I thought-- 
TALIESIN: I actually am-- 
LAURA: I was trying to make a loud noise because I remember those guys don't like loud noises. I wanted to make them rear up and cause some chaos. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's true, the dogs? Yeah that's true, that's true. 
TALIESIN: I think I'd possible, it would be better to get rid of these guys right now so that there's no one to report that they're-- 
SAM: Oh, interesting. 
TALIESIN: I think we clean up our mess quick before it becomes a bigger mess. 
MATT: Okay, here we go. Sorry about that. 
TALIESIN: Get rid of the Reilorans. 
MATT: I had to find the right elements there. All right, so 25 to 20. 
TALIESIN: I don't know, that's my call. 
LIAM: 22. 
MATT: 22. 
MARISHA: 22. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: So that's a-- 
LAURA: (gasps) Rollies? 
MARISHA: Rollies. 
LIAM: Not dex? 
MARISHA: Well, Rollies is more fun. 
MATT: You guys make your choice. 
LIAM: Sure, Rollies. Two, you can take it. 
MARISHA: 18. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: So wait, does that make me first? 
LIAM: Yep. 
MARISHA: Fuck. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: ♪ Laudy daudy dah ♪ 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Orym. 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
SAM: 17. 
LAURA: 15. 
ASHLEY: 14. 
TALIESIN: So Imogen-- 
MATT: Sorry, that's Imogen, and then Fearne. 
LIAM: Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: (sighs) 
MATT: Chetney? Ashton? 
TRAVIS: Seven. 
TALIESIN: Four. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Okay, this is a vibe. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I am not nearly as helpful as I normally would be. 
MATT: All righty, so top of it is Laudna, with Orym on deck. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
MARISHA: Okay, I don't have a plan. So we're trying to clear-- 
LIAM: We've been here five seconds. 
MARISHA: -- clear this up is what we're thinking? Not run? 
ASHLEY: Do we want to try to leave or do we want to-- 
TALIESIN: I'll say it'll be easier to run once we have Fearne, but I think running puts the whole city on high alert. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
TALIESIN: For at least Fearne, but there's worse things, I suppose. 
LIAM: Guess we got to try to-- 
MARISHA: It is a good point. 
TALIESIN: Grab her and run? 
LIAM: We could shove bodies in the building if we silently took them down. 
MARISHA: Silently take them down? 
LIAM: That's not my advice, I don't know what to do. 
MATT: What you doing, Laudna? 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I think we overestimate their telepathic abilities. 
MATT: You said you were being up front actually, so. 
SAM: Oh, telepathic abilities. 
TALIESIN: I don't think they can-- 
SAM: Can they be charmed? 
TALIESIN: -- sound the alarm. I think they wouldn't need giant horns if they could sound the alarm throughout. 
LAURA: I'm at advantage against it. 
LIAM: I know, but I think there's-- 
LAURA: I think, because-- 
LIAM: They could just go: Ah! 
MARISHA: Silently means I probably shouldn't throw a Fireball on them, right? 
TALIESIN: No, not that. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: People wouldn't scatter if there were already people watching, though. 
MARISHA: Okay, first and foremost, I'm going to Quicken a spell. I'm going to cast Bane. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MARISHA: On-- 
TALIESIN: Scatter means people think they can hide. 
MARISHA: (rapidly mumbling spell description) You can target one additional creature for one slot of--" 
LIAM: (like Bane) One additional creature. 
SAM and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MARISHA: One, two, three, four. Fuck it, I'll cast Bane at-- 
MATT: Yeah? 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll cast Bane at 3rd-level and debuff every single one of them. 
MATT: All righty, so working on the juggernaut. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
LIAM: Cool. 
MATT: That's going to be a 16. 
MARISHA: Fail. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Other one in there. Fail. Second one over there. That's going to be a 17? 
MARISHA: 17 is the check. 
MATT: Okay, so this one succeeds, but both of these guys-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Bane and Bane. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MATT: All righty. Then-- 
MARISHA: And the dogs. 
MATT: Fail and fail. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Baned. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: So minus four to all their shit. 
MATT: And Baned. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: Minus a d4 there. 
TRAVIS: You could just walk-- (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: They've just had a couple beers, they're a little iffy. 
MATT: There we go. We got the right ones in now. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Fuck. All right, well-- 
TALIESIN: Good start. 
MATT: So that was your quickened spell. 
TRAVIS: Dedication. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I didn't want to be loud to start. So I'm going to start with hitting the dog that's holding Fearne-- 
MATT: Uh-huh? 
MARISHA: -- with three Eldritch Blasts. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Eldritch Blasts. 
TALIESIN: Keep it quiet. 
SAM: Yeah, just quiet Eldritch Blasts. 
MARISHA: But quiet Eldritch Blasts. 
TALIESIN: Just a street brawl. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, just blasts with little silencers on them. 
TALIESIN: It's not a gas leak, it's just a street brawl. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: (muffled blasts) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Okay I have advantage because I have advantage on all attacks. So ♪ a-durka-durka-dur ♪ first one-- 
ASHLEY: ♪ Durka-durka-durka ♪ 
MARISHA: 29. 
MATT: 29 hits. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, baby! 
MARISHA: Second one, 28. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Hits. 
MARISHA: Third one. 
LIAM: This is different than Razora, this is all trouble. 
MARISHA: 19. 
MATT: 19 hits. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Nice to know. 
MARISHA: So that's 3d10. Shit, shit. Need to gather my 10s, where are my 10s? (stressed grunts) 
MATT: Replace this, there we go. 
MARISHA: 3d10, so that's going to be 15 plus, okay, 21, 28, 30 damage. 
MATT: 30 damage. (blasts) From the side-- 
ASHLEY: That's awesome. 
MATT: -- the avadon goes, (snarls) falls onto its side for a second and catches itself before, (grunts) and turns around. You can see its mouth open slightly, and you can see Fearne inside, trying to pull out-- 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
MATT: -- like Audrey and Audrey II, as it swings. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Then it's jaws clamp down again and you can see arm and leg hanging out to the side. Pretty heavy hit on it, the side of it's blasted in. You can see exposed red and muscle. 
MARISHA: Okay, can I tuck into this nook a bit? 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Can I half cover? 
MATT: As you tuck into the nook, you can see-- 
TRAVIS: Just hide behind everything. 
MATT: -- the two other Reiloran who weren't blasted, see (missiles streaking) the blasts streak out of nowhere damage the side of the avadon. The other avadon rears back slightly before landing, and both of them shift their attention over to the source of where the blasts came from, which is over to where you all are. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: But you duck off to the side. 
MARISHA: That's my turn. 
MATT: Finishes your turn. 
MARISHA: They're all Baned except for one. 
MATT: Yep. Orym, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LIAM: Okay, question about the terrain. Is this runnable or am I on the stairs? This is just approximation? 
MATT: There's a slight lip here, but most of this is just structure that builds up here. 
LIAM: Okay, if you'll allow then, I am going to start pitter-pat running, sprinting this way-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: -- and flea jumping across the back. And in midair, I will cause little dark blooms to start sprouting out the back of the juggernaut all down its back and legs as I Hex it. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm going to slash it along the back as I fly by. 
MATT: Certainly. (pitter-pat running) 
LAURA: Slice. 
LIAM: 25 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
LIAM: I'm going to make it a goading attack. So it has to do wisdom 17. 
MATT: Wisdom 17. 
LAURA: He told you to be quiet and now he's-- 
MATT: (laughs) That's going to be a 16 exactly. It misses by one. 
LIAM: Aw, fails? Cool. So that is seven, 13-- 
TALIESIN: Is that the dog? 
ASHLEY: I am so sorry about that. 
LIAM: A total of 22 damage. 
MATT: 22 damage, got it. 
LIAM: I'm going to keep attacking, but it's a disadvantage against anyone but me. 
MATT: But you, yeah. 
LIAM: Then I'm just going to start, as small flowers start sprouting out of its calf and achilles heel, I just start silently hacking away, like I'm cutting into a tree, at the ankle. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LIAM: That's a 26 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: That is 13 damage. The last one is a 20 to hit. 
MATT: Yep, that hits. 
LIAM: That is 13 damage. 
MATT: All righty. Leaping in the air, hexing it, and then landing, and then slicing rapidly before keeping it focused on you, you see it takes the hits in the back, (enraged growl) turns around to face you. It is just towering over your tiny frame with your shield and sword at the ready. 
LIAM: There's a long, thin, like a paper cut on this guy because of his size, but there's flowers slowly growing out of its back. I'm going to hold my ground there. 
MATT: You got it. Okay. Finishing your go, Orym. It is now the juggernaut's turn. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm the juggernaut, bitch! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Let's go, juggalo. 
MATT: Spin on you there, and it's going to go ahead and go into a full round of attacks. 
LIAM: Oh, and it gets disadvantage on strength moving forward. 
MATT: You got it, okay. So it's going to be first attack on you. 
MARISHA: Minus a d4. 
TALIESIN: Minus four. D4. 
MATT: Natural 20, minus a d4. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs. 
MATT: What's the range on Silvery Barbs? 
SAM: Oh, pretty far. 
MARISHA: Yeah, but I-- 
TALIESIN: If it's 60 feet, I bet you can hit it. 
LAURA: Does it count a natural 20 if it's a minus d4? How's that work? 
MATT: Yeah, still hits. 
LAURA: It still hits. 
LIAM: 20's always a 20. 
MARISHA: 60 feet. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: 60 feet? No, he's out of range. 
MARISHA: Aw! 
MATT: I know, there's limitations to that spell. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Hey! 
MATT: So the first is a crit. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: The second one is going to be 22 to hit. 
TALIESIN: Is that minus the d4? 
LIAM: Minus the d4? 
MATT: Minus d4 makes it a 20. 
LIAM: Hits, just. 
MATT: Okay, and the last one-- 
MARISHA: This guy's fucking-- 
MATT: Natural 20, again! 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Holy shit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, way to go! 
MATT: Yeah, get these 20 in! 
TRAVIS: Let's go, buddy! 
TALIESIN: Would it be cool if you two switched dice? 
MARISHA: You're about to get crushed! 
MATT: You really got this dude's attention. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry! 
MATT: So as he turns around, the massive jagged bone cestus, the heavy metal and bone-laced knuckles-- 
MARISHA: Does the-- I guess it's a natural 20. 
MATT: -- hits towards the shield, and the shield gets knocked out of your hand, almost to the ground. You still hold it, but it knocks it free. As that gets deflected, it's other fist comes down (impact) right across your face, knocking you to one knee. 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
MATT: It brings another fist to uppercut you, and you actually get lifted off the ground for a moment, as it brings both of its hands up, and wham, slams you crashing into the ground. The stone around you cracks and lifts up, leaving a dust cloud where you were. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! 
MATT: All right, so the first hit is going to be. 
TRAVIS: (insensitive clucking) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: It's okay, I have five Goodberries. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: 18 points of bludgeoning damage. 
MARISHA: (clucks) 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Didn't roll that high for the crit. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Second one's going to be 16 points of bludgeoning damage. (laughs) 
LAURA: Yeah, that crit, yeah. 
MATT: The crit wasn't that great, but the final crit-- 
LIAM: Orym tough. 
MATT: -- that's going to be better, okay. 34 points of bludgeoning damage. 
LIAM: Gotcha. 
MATT: I need you to make a strength saving throw-- 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: (whispers) Oh god. 
MATT: -- as it uses its telekinetic combo. 
LAURA: He's telekinetic, too? Even the juggernauts? 
SAM: They all are. 
MATT: All the Reiloran have some element of power. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
LIAM: I'm going to... Hold on one sec, sorry, going through my shit. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where are you? 
TALIESIN: Shit. And fuck. 
LIAM: Six plus, it's a strength save you said? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: Smoke 'em as quick as possible. 
LIAM: I'm confused, hmm. All right, six plus 11. I'm going to spend a superiority die and add the roll of that to this roll. Okay, that is 20. 
MATT: 20. As it slams you to the ground, you catch yourself in the middle of the air and flip like a cat that fell, and catch your feet, as opposed to being knocked prone on the ground. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right, that finishes the juggernaut's go. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MATT: FCG, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
TALIESIN: That was horrifying what just happened. 
LIAM: Rang my bell, real hard. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Real hard. 
SAM: Boy, oh, boysie. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
SAM: I'm going to come out from my little hidey-hole. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Assess the damage. So Fearne's in the thing's mouth. Is she hanging out of the mouth? 
MATT: You see an arm and a leg currently hanging out the side as its mouth's about to bite down and chew. 
SAM: You're going to be fine, right? 
ASHLEY: I'll be fine. I'll figure it out. 
SAM: Jesus. Orym is hurt. 
LAURA: That took a lot. 
TALIESIN: Orym cannot take another one of those. 
ASHLEY: No. 
TALIESIN: Straight up. 
SAM: Well then. Shit. Okay, I'll move forward a little bit and I'll cast, just up to where Fearne is. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'll just do what I do, I'm going to cast Banishment on the juggernaut. 
MATT: Banishment on the juggernaut? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Good idea. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: All right, so it's going to be what save, charisma? 
SAM: Charisma 16. 
MATT: Charisma 16. 
TALIESIN: It also takes a d4, yeah. No, nevermind. 
MATT: Natural 12. 
SAM: Okay! 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: (whooshes) 
SAM: Thank you, Changebringer. 
MATT: The juggernaut, standing above you, Orym-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- slams its fists together, and as it brings its arms up again, (whooshes) vanishes from sight. 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Great. 
LIAM: He ain't got nothing on me. (spits) 
SAM: You beat him, Orym. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Good job. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
SAM: Oh, bonus action, I can't really do anything because I just cast a spell, because I can't bond with anyone as a bonus action. Right? I can't cast another spell as a bonus action. That's it, that's all I'll do. 
MATT: Okay, Imogen, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
LAURA: How's my? 
MATT: You can spend another action to try and pull again if you'd like. 
LAURA: Should I do it? It's going to be loud, though, but it's just a building falling. 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Just a little building falling. 
TALIESIN: Repeat that out loud one more time. 
LAURA: Yeah, but a building falling, that's not our fault. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: I mean, if they get pinned, then we can run, I guess. 
LAURA: I'm going to try. 
MATT: You're going to try? 
LAURA: I'm going to try. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll another d20 and add your spells modifier. 
TALIESIN: Four people? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going for it. 
MATT: I'm going to tell you right now, you're trying to beat a 15. 
LAURA: (sighs) 14. 
ASHLEY: Fuck! 
MATT: 14. You watch as the building (cracks) shifts slightly and dust falls free, more stones fall and tumble on the ground. It's pretty close to coming, but it's... 
LAURA: Fuck. As I'm holding that and trying to pull it, I'm going to Quicken a spell. Are there other stones around on the ground, I'm assuming? 
MATT: Oh yeah, there's stones everywhere. 
LAURA: I'm going to... Ooh, fuck. Let me see. I am going to Quicken and Twin a 1st-level spell. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to pick up two stones and I'm going to fling them at the two Reiloran that are still standing. 
MATT: Okay, go for it. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: So that's a dex save from each of them. 
MATT: It's going to be a nine. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: The other is going to be a 15. 
LAURA: Great, they both fail, so they're both going to take 3d8 bludgeoning damage. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: Mm, mm. 
SAM: Nice. 
TRAVIS: Big time, big time. 
LAURA: Oh wait, yeah, wait, these are 10s. What am I doing? Where's the eight? Oh god, why am I breaking? 
SAM: Oh no, you don't have enough dice. 
LAURA: No, I just couldn't remember, I never have enough eights. 
TALIESIN: No wonder it's going so wrong. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Need more. 
LAURA: Okay, six plus five. 
TRAVIS: For the love of god. 
LAURA: 11 plus three, 14. 
MATT: 14 to each. 
SAM: She can probably have-- 
LAURA: To each. 
MATT: You got it. 
SAM: -- a caddy. 
MATT: (whooshes) They both just get pummeled. Their heads (cracks) knocked off to the side, and dark blood spatters out as they both right themselves, (grunts) look back in your direction. 
LAURA: That's going to be bad. Can I back up? 
MATT: Yes, you can. 
MARISHA: Wait, what's happening? 
LAURA: I'm just backing up. 
MATT: Move up around here. (laughs) You disappear around the building. 
MARISHA: We keep throwing each other in front of each other. 
MATT: Yep. (laughs) "Protect me!" "You protect me!" 
TRAVIS: Love you! 
TALIESIN: Really, y'all? Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Come on, Ash. 
TALIESIN: It's not my turn yet, but I will definitely enjoy my 20 feet of movement. 
LAURA: Did you, "Really, y'all?" me? Did you, "Really, y'all?" Me? (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: The top of your turn, and it's chewing on you. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Was it that bad? (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wait, who's y'all? 
TRAVIS: Ashton's standing between y'all and the enemy. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: And he can't move. (laughs) 
MATT: That's going to be 22 points of piercing damage. As you're being chewed in its jaws-- 
TALIESIN: Speed-wise. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: -- you are currently restrained while you're in there. 
ASHLEY: 22 points of damage? 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: What was the hit? 
TALIESIN: I can also still... 
MATT: You just take that damage from being inside its mouth. 
ASHLEY: All right. So what I'm going to do in there, I'm going to shoot Scorching Rays in here. 
MATT: Point blank in its jaw? 
ASHLEY: Point blank in its-- 
MATT: What level? 
ASHLEY: In its jaw and its belly. Let's do 3rd-level. So that'll be three. 
TALIESIN: Can't go wrong. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Can't go wrong. 
MATT: You do have disadvantage on these, because you are restrained within it. But the good news is its armor class-- It's kind of hard to miss, to a certain degree, because you're inside its mouth. So I'll give you advantage on it. So it's just a straight roll. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Straight roll. 
MARISHA: If you want to try it, I'm game. 
TALIESIN: I have yet to use this, so. 
MARISHA: You would have to hold your action. 
TALIESIN: No, I don't think so. I'll find out. 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. That's nice. 13. 
MATT: 13 unfortunately misses. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Natural 20. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Ooh. It makes up for that. 
ASHLEY: Yep. It's cocked. 
TALIESIN: Awesome. 
ASHLEY: Another natural 20. (exclaiming) 
LIAM: The universe balanced! 
MATT: One more. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
TALIESIN: F-- Ah! 
ASHLEY: This one sometimes does some special shit. 
MATT: You've got one more to go, you've got four. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. Cocked. 
LAURA: God, why did it-- 
ASHLEY: Who the fuck-- 
LIAM: Goddamn it, Ashley. 
ASHLEY: A one. (laughter) 
MATT: Miss, 20, 20, one. Perfect. All right, so roll 4d6 and then double it. 
SAM: Same juice. 
MARISHA: Same juice. 
ASHLEY: Oh, come on! That's such balls. Okay. 11, so 22 points of damage. 
MATT: 22 points of damage. 
ASHLEY: Fucking-- 
TALIESIN: The double damn. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (exclaiming) 
ASHLEY: All right, so I'm just (shouts). Then I put one hand in his throat to try to (goopy boom) in his tummy, and the whole rest of his body, and then the other one up to his brain. 
MATT: (boofs) The two sides of it blast through. This avadon, I'm allowing it to happen. I actually did the math wrong. The damage that I already had was from the guy that you attacked. But I'll allow it, since it's already there. It's great. 
ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: No, no. 
SAM: This one was a weaker one. 
MARISHA: It's sad, he was sickly. 
LAURA: He was having tummy problems already. 
MATT: Yeah, he's having a rough day. I'll balance it around the other way. 
ASHLEY: A little indigestion. 
LAURA: Was the Reiloran riding the avadon? Are the Reilorans on top? 
MATT: They're still on top of it, yeah. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: So you blast through the sides of this one. It already had a rough day. 
ASHLEY: Wait, I don't want you to give it to me! 
MATT: I'm not giving it to you. I'm going to balance it elsewhere. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. 
MATT: Don't worry. So as this one crumbles-- 
SAM: It wasn't a real victory, Ashley. 
ASHLEY: I know. (laughter) 
LIAM: Technically, none of them have been real victories. 
ASHLEY: Fair enough. 
MATT: They're all imaginary. 
ASHLEY: This is fake. 
MATT: So you blast through it and land out of its mouth. You're no longer restrained. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But you are prone on the ground when you land. So you have to get up to try and move or stay put if you'd like. 
ASHLEY: Yes. So I would like to stand up. Then may I-- 
LIAM: Matthew, may I? 
ASHLEY: -- just disengage or just-- 
MATT: Bonus action disengage? 
ASHLEY: GTFO. 
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: You have one, two, three. What's your movement? 
ASHLEY: 35. 
MATT: 35, so yeah, you can get about that far because it is half your movement to get up. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay, let me just double check that there's nothing else. Okay. That's my turn. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's my turn. 
MARISHA: It's good. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay, these two other-- Well, first the other avadon's going to go. It's going to leap forward (intense whoosh) to FCG. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: It's going to make a strike against you. It's a pounce maneuver, because it moved more than 20 feet to get to you. It's going to try and hit you with both its claw. Actually, it's going to hit you with its barbed tongue attack first. 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: As it lands. That's going to be... 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: Another fucking natural 20. 
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck sakes. 
ASHLEY: What? 
LAURA: Is it close enough to you? 
MARISHA: What's this one? Who's this one? 
ASHLEY: FCG. 
MATT: FCG. 
LAURA: What's this one? 
MATT: You can't see? 
MARISHA: No, I don't think so. 
MATT: You don't have visual on this. It's the downside with taking cover. 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: So that's the barbed tongue attack on you. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: Taliesin, look at this shit. 
ASHLEY: No way. 
LAURA: (high-pitched) No! 
ASHLEY: For real? 
TRAVIS: I see it. 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: I see it. Wow. 
MATT: That is insane. 
ASHLEY: Is it the same die? Or different ones. 
MATT: Same die. It's my Ruidus die. 
TRAVIS: Two back to back. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. Of course. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: That's fucking great. 
ASHLEY: That's crazy. 
TRAVIS: You should roll one more time to see if another-- 
MATT: Okay. That's a natural 14. That would be a 23 to hit. 
SAM: Hits. 
MATT: All right, so two crits on the bite and the barbed tongue. So the barbed tongue first. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: As it's in the back, it (swift whooshes), shoots into you and sticks into you, as it holds on, it would pull you towards it. Instead, it's going to leap towards you and use the momentum. 
TRAVIS: It might be okay. 
MATT: That's going to be 21 points of piercing damage. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: (impactful whoosh) Into you. It lands and goes for the crit bite attack. This is going to be-- 
SAM: It's fine. 
MARISHA: I need to come out of the corner. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: Woof. 
MATT: 31 points of piercing damage. 
TALIESIN: Just keep that in mind. 
MARISHA: Thank you. 
MATT: Then make a strength saving throw for me. 
SAM: With advantage! Strength 14. 
MATT: 14. You are grappled as it holds you in its jaws. Then the final attack with its claws, it's going to be 16 points of slashing damage. It's now looming over you. It has you partially its mouth. It's getting ready to start shaking you like a dog toy. Finishing that, it's now the Reilorans' go. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: The one that's on the ground-- Let me see. This one's still on top. Can't quite get to you because you're in its mouth. So it has its spear on its side and you're right there. It's going to try and strike you twice with its spear from on the top of the dog's back. 
ASHLEY: Shield. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
MATT: That's going to be a 21. What's your armor class with Shield? 
ASHLEY: (shouts) 22! 
MATT: That misses. (laughter) 
MATT: The spear (whoosh), goes towards you and you (quick whoosh)-- 
ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: -- put up the arcane sigil as an instinct and it (echoing ping) shrinks off of it leaving the runes there to fade for a second in this green swirly natural energy. It angrily spins the spear around, (reverberations) and it's going to try and strike you with a bladed edge of it. You see it's almost like a glaive spear. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to be 23 to hit. 
ASHLEY: It hits. 
MATT: It does hit you. 
ASHLEY: All right. All right. 
MATT: With that you take, it's a really shitty damage roll. You take four points of slashing damage. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: Then it's going to try and telekinetically shove you. Make a strength saving throw for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Is this a spell? Magical effect? 
MATT: I'd say it's magical adjacent, sure. 
ASHLEY: Because I get advantage on those. 
MATT: Oh, I see. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Mm, this is a different kind of magical effect. 
ASHLEY: This is not it, okay. 
MATT: Yeah, this is-- 
ASHLEY: 10. 
MATT: 10, all right, it's going to, (whoosh) shove you closer to the side to try and keep you nearby. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: The other one over here is going to then dart around and attempt to spear you from this side with its spear. It's going to try to ram you through. That's going to be a 20 to hit. But you keep shield for the round so that, (quick whoosh), deflects it again. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: That's a natural 18. Yeah, that definitely hits you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, is that with the negative d4, though? 
MARISHA: Yep, minus d4-- 
MATT: Oh, yeah. A minus one, so that would be, it's still a 24. 
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just trying. 
LAURA: Plus that one's not Baned. 
MATT: Correct. Yes, that one doesn't get it. That's going to be seven points of piercing damage. 
ASHLEY: Got it, got it, got it. Okay. (laughs) 
LAURA: It looks like your tongue is all the way down and then coming out. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) It does. 
MARISHA: Heinous! 
MATT: Make another strength saving throw. So this one's going to try and telekinetically shove you over its shoulder as it hits you with the spear and it's going to try and fling you using its tongue power. 
LAURA: Can I do that? 
ASHLEY: 12. 
MATT: 12. You fail. It shoves you five feet this way. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Perfect. 
MATT: It's the narrative version of the five-foot shove. It now puts you on the other side between those two. That finishes their go. Chetney, you're up, with Ashton on deck. 
TRAVIS: I'll break cover from the tent-- 
TALIESIN: Okay, because it's all you. I don't have to do anything. 
MARISHA: I know, but-- 
TRAVIS: As I come running out, I'll use my Hybrid Transformation. 
LAURA: Yeah, Hybrid. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Hybrid. 
TRAVIS: Meow. I'll run up behind the Reiloran closest to moi and I'll drag my claws along my thigh and-- 
MATT: He's up on top of the avadon. So you can-- 
TRAVIS: Nice. Yeah, so I'll use a little Blood Maledict for five points of damage and I'll take three swipes at him. Is it at disadvantage because he's mounted? The Reiloran that's up on the doggy? 
MATT: He's up on the doggy. I think it's just a straight roll. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: I forgot to ask for your concentration checks by the way. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
SAM: Oh sure, sure. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: Half the damage you take, each of these hits. 
MARISHA: Is this for a telekinetic-- 
SAM: How much am I trying to roll? 
LAURA: Plus con. 
SAM: That's 18 plus stuff. That's probably fine. 
MATT: Yeah, that's fine for one. 
SAM: 18 plus stuff. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Four plus stuff. 
MATT: That-- 
SAM: That's an eight. 
MATT: 10 is the minimum. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
SAM: Oh no, we got jugs back. 
LAURA: Move. Juggy jugs. 
ASHLEY: Big jugs. 
MATT: That would change things for you. 
TRAVIS: Yes, please. 
MATT: So to that degree. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: (rewinding noises) And I'll attack the juggernaut. 
MATT: Juggernaut instead, that's why I was like, this is something I got to remember to do. 
LIAM: Print is not dead. 
MATT: All right, so as you pull out, transform, and rush in towards the juggernaut. 
TRAVIS: 28 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Second swipe. 25 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Third hit is, Jesus, 29 to hit. Oh, 19! I'm attuned to the Bloody Bib, which means I get a thing but I'll do that later. 
MATT: You used your bonus action to Blood Maledict. 
TRAVIS: That's right. Oh, so I don't get the third one. 
MATT: So it'll be just the two. 
TRAVIS: Which is that one. Just the two. 
MATT: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Thank you very much. 1d8 plus four, 13. 17 for the first one. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That's the wrong dice. Four, eight, 16 plus five. 21 for the second one. 
MATT: 21. Solid hits on the juggernaut. (slices) (immense growls) You feel this pressure in your brain as it now becomes aware of your presence. 
TRAVIS: Hello. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
TRAVIS: I would move into flanking position with Orym. 
MATT: There you go. 
TRAVIS: Should have done that first. 
MATT: Well, now we know. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Ashton, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my first 20 feet towards-- I'm going to try and get right in the middle of these two. 
MATT: Over here, you mean? 
TALIESIN: Kitty quarter to Fearne. 
MATT: Like there? 
TALIESIN: Right in there if I can get-- Can I move that far? 
MATT: 20 feet? Five, 10, 15, 20, 25 to get there. 
TALIESIN: I'm not 25. I am still exhaustion level two. So I have 20. 
MATT: You can get there. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So I can get in the midst of one. 
LAURA: At least one. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I am going to fucking rage. Here we fucking go. Let's see what the fuck is going to happen. Okay, okay, okay. Fine, I'll deal with that. 
SAM: It's never what he wants. 
TALIESIN: No, it's never. (laughter) 
SAM: It's always something new. 
TALIESIN: It's almost always a one which is really frustrating. I've rolled the four and the three like never. It really is-- 
MATT: Change your dice, bud. 
TALIESIN: I keep changing them. 
LIAM: Taliesin, this is a blank piece of paper. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Sh. 
TALIESIN: All of my mind palace. 
MATT: It's our secret. 
TALIESIN: Well, the black and white cinematic vibrations begin. I turn, I lose all color in my outfit and my stone becomes a silver tone and okay. They're start their turn, so, okay. Okay. All right, I'm going to start with, I'm going to hit that motherfucker right in front of me. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Fuck it, I'm going to go reckless, because I'm-- 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: -- I'm irritated by the day. All right. Natural 20, that was worth while. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
SAM: Whoo! 
ASHLEY: Whoo. The table's hot! 
TALIESIN: So that means a bunch of shit. 
MARISHA: Yeah, there are-- 
ASHLEY: Hot table. 
MATT: Apparently. 
TALIESIN: So natural 20 means I get an extra-- 
MATT: Don't think I've rolled that many crits in a row that close in a while, that felt good. Sorry. 
TALIESIN: No. Physical damage is halved. 
ASHLEY: We're excited. 
TALIESIN: Sorry. It means I get an extra d6. 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: You get that, which is also doubled. Then there's one other weird thing that happens. Hold on. Which is-- 
MATT: Brutal Critical, right? 
TALIESIN: It's the Brutal Critical. Well, Brutal Critical is the three dice. Right? Then-- 
MARISHA: Brutal Critical. 
SAM: Brutal Critical! Brutal. 
TALIESIN: Everybody's attack rolls against that character have advantage until the beginning of my next turn. 
MATT: Correct, so all attacks against this guy right here have advantage. 
SAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: So, I'll mark it with the green. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. Let's do some damage. 
LIAM: Bootie critical masks. 
TALIESIN: I don't like those two twos. I'm going to reroll them. Fuck me. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Seven, 14. 14 plus 12 is 26 points of damage. 
MATT: 26 points of damage on the first hit. 
TALIESIN: Again, again. 17 plus 10 to hit. 27 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. Definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: Goodbye, die. That was fun. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 21 points of damage. 
MATT: 21 points of damage. How do you want to do this? (exclaiming) 
TALIESIN: I am going to just come, migraine killing, just come up and I'm going to take one good slice against the head and I'm going to go one handed and knock his fucking head into the ground. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: (strike whooshing) As you impact with the second strike, the head actually crunches, (crunching), into the torso. You watch it expand slightly as it has to make room for the meat and bone that you've pushed into it. 
ASHLEY: Nice work. 
TALIESIN: Let me know if you want one. 
MARISHA: Call it out. 
TALIESIN: So, and then well, we've got a second. So, and then I spin my hammer up and then I drop it so that the head of the hammer is above, I'm holding onto it like a fucking signpost. Let's do this shit. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go. Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: All right. Getting the sign from Ashton. I'm going to pop around the corner. Biggy diggy diggy doo. 
TRAVIS: Now I'm getting excited. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: ♪ I saw the sign ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ It opened up my eyes ♪ I'm going to cast Blight through his hammer and attempt to split it. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Okay. All right. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
SAM: That's fancy. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Blight splice. 
MATT: All righty, so the effects of that hammer, pulling it up right now. 
TALIESIN: Split a spell. There's a save, which is DC six plus spell level, which I think she has to roll a-- 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: DC six plus the spell's level, and I get to add my spellcasting modifier. So that will be a 4th-level spell. So that brings it up to 10. My spellcasting modifier is plus five. I have advantage on this, because they are ability checks. 
TALIESIN: Oh man. 
MATT: Yep. 
MATT: Well, the DC is-- Yeah, so roll with your spellcasting modifier. Roll d20 and add your charisma. 
MARISHA: I have advantage on this, right? 
MATT: It is an ability check. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. So that is 18. 
MATT: That's a success. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: So you concentrate and release the, we watch as you throw out the seed of dark magic that arcs through the air in slow motion as it slowly impacts the back of the hammer. You watch as that tiny little node becomes 7,000 tiny little spread seeds that then re-form in the opposite side of the fractal hammer glass and then shoots off as two divided, (blasting) Blights towards each of these targets. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Both him and his mount. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
MATT: They both have to make a constitution save. 
MATT: Yep, minus a d4. 
MARISHA: Minus a d4. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to duck because I know what's coming. 
MATT: Okay, so that would be a 20 minus four to a 16. 
MARISHA: Hits. 
MATT: Bane made the difference there for the Reiloran. And then for his mount, who's also Baned, that is going to be a one. 
MARISHA: Hits. 
MATT: All together a one. 
MARISHA: Fearne, watch your head. And then 8d8. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, baby, yeah. 
MARISHA: Full d8s. 
TALIESIN: Fucking fry, motherfuckers! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's going to be a taste-- 
TALIESIN: First time I got to use this shit. 
MARISHA: Hits thrice. Okay, okay, okay. Come on. 
MATT: It's pretty damn fun when it works. 
MARISHA: Come on. I'm assuming one damage roll for both of them, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Okay, eight, nine, 19. Okay, oh jeez. 19, 27, 31. 35. 39 points of damage. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
SAM: Ooh, dang. 
MARISHA: Of Blight-- 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
MARISHA: -- damage. 
MATT: All right. The avadon still stands, but how do you want to do this against the other Reiloran? 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: The other Reiloran? 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: I imagine it hits the hammer, and you know how a magnifying glass under a sun beam? I hit it at just the right angle so it shoots a hole like frying an ant in the sun. Not that I've ever done that. 
MATT: (whooshes) (laughter) 
MATT: As it looks up towards you, its eyes go to a pale gray, and the area where the burn mark would be expands as the blackness begins to consume its flesh, and it crumples back to the ground. 
MARISHA: (growls) 
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah! (laughs) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: That's my turn. 
MATT: That's your turn. 
TALIESIN: Hells yes. 
MATT: Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: Okay, as I see Chetney finish going to town on big jugs' back, my eyes go a deeper green and he spits blood on the ground. Back just in time. I start to slash away again at his calves and tendons. Oh, no, first, I give myself 13 hit points back with a bonus action. 
SAM: Nice! 
LIAM: Okay, here we go, and we're flanking so at advantage. That's a 24 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
LIAM: Three-- nine points of damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: That is a 23 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
LIAM: 14 points of damage. 
SAM: Oof. 
LIAM: 24 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
MARISHA: Damn! 
LIAM: Nine points of damage. Action Surge. 24 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: (cheers) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: 12 points of damage. 
MARISHA: Tactical! 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: 23 to hit. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: 14 points of damage. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Winner, winner chicken dinner! 
SAM: What is this? Is this six attacks? 
LIAM: 26 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Awesome. 
TALIESIN: This is some Percy shit happening. 
ASHLEY: How are you still going? 
LAURA: Action Surge. 
MATT: Fighters with Action Surge. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: How many has he done? 
LIAM: Let's make this a-- 
TALIESIN: So like when Percy would-- 
LIAM: -- tripping attack, so that is-- 17 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: (exhales sharply) 
SAM: He's still up? 
ASHLEY: How much damage was that? 
LIAM: Just breathing hard. 
MATT: Well, I told you I had fixed it. The hit points that creature did have went to the juggernaut. 
LIAM: Huh. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Ah. 
MATT: They're just beefy boys. 
SAM: You did this! 
ASHLEY: This is all my fault. 
MATT: No, it is not at all. 
ASHLEY: It's because I'm a woman. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Wow! 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
MATT: Good night, everyone. I'm just going to-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You know I'm going to hear it. (laughter) 
LIAM: Big jugs has to make a strength save at disadvantage because of the Hex beat his-- 
MATT: Well, the Hex is ability checks, not saving throws. 
LIAM: Not saving throws? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 
MARISHA: Unleashed. 
LIAM: No, but for-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Oh, okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. 
MATT: Yeah, so any sort of athletics checks-- 
LIAM: Great. 
MATT: -- contested, like strength checks, those are affected by Hex, but it doesn't affect saving throws. 
LIAM: Great, so last thing I do, I haven't used any of my movement. I run under his legs and I-- 
MATT: That's a natural 20 on his fucking strength save. 
TRAVIS: I don't believe what you're saying. There's no way. Yes, it is. 
MATT: (laughs) Different die this time. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: I'm going to run under big jugs' legs. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, that was-- Hang on, the tripping, that was a natural 20 for the tripping attack? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs. I hope I'm in range. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You are. 
SAM: This fucking spell. 
MARISHA: (claps) Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: You're in range. 
MARISHA: Let's go, baby! 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) All righty. Same react, same turn, right? 
MATT: That is going to be a-- 
TRAVIS: You used it on the previous. 
MATT: -- 16? 
LIAM: Oh, fails. 
MARISHA: Minus four, minus four. 
MATT: 12. 
LIAM: Failed already. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Ah! 
ASHLEY: Minus four, minus four! 
LIAM: So he's on his back. 
TALIESIN: No, you want to hit it. You just want to-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh! 
SAM: He's not dead. 
LAURA: That will-- 
MATT: So like-- (slashing) 
LAURA: That will have advantage? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Right underneath its knee and it falls onto its back. 
TALIESIN: Not much longer, but it's going to be advantage. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: How many points of damage was that? 
MATT: It was a lot. 
TRAVIS: I would say 70. 
TALIESIN: You should, burning this. Yeah, that was a-- Which is good because he was about to get back up. 
MARISHA: Still could use this advantage. 
SAM: I already have advantage. 
MATT: It's close to 80 points of damage. 
LAURA: Wow. Do you have anything else? 
LIAM: No, I mean, I did an action. 
TALIESIN: That was a burn. 
LIAM: And Action Surge. 
LAURA: That was a sad move. 
ASHLEY: There's nothing you can do? 
TRAVIS: Pull your weight around here, why don't you? 
LAURA: I wish you could-- 
TALIESIN: Can you disengage now that he's on the ground? 
TRAVIS: Somewhat dark. 
LIAM: No, I can't disengage. 
TALIESIN: But at the same time-- 
LAURA: You probably would be able to get-- 
TALIESIN: -- one attack versus a bunch of them might be-- I don't know. I'm just-- I'm spitballing terrible things right now. 
MARISHA: Liam, I'm giving you advantage due to Silvery Barbs, so you have an advantage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: To burn. 
MARISHA: To burn. 
LIAM: I'm actually going to run-- 
MATT: It's a 1st-level spell. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: -- over big jugs. I'm going to kick Chetney in the chest and push him back. I'm going to say: Move, Dad. Shove him back five feet and do Bait and Switch. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm going to take the AC boost. I'll take it. It's not a lot, but I got it, and that's where I'm stopping, there. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your turn? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Juggernaut's turn. 
SAM: Uh-oh! 
MATT: Juggernaut is going to (grunts) get up from the ground for half its movement. It (slurps). You can see the part of its jaw is broken from the impact of a shield bash earlier. You can see all of the different cuts across its body. 
TRAVIS: Rivers, rivers of blood. 
MATT: It's just bleeding a pile in the middle of the ground. You can see the slowly growing lake of blood that it's leaking is starting to seep into the dry dust and dirt-filled ground. 
TRAVIS: What's the name of that water park in New Jersey? 
ALL: Action Park. 
MATT: It's the Action Surge to Action Park. As it looks down at you and is going to try to grab your head and start slamming you straight into its knuckles. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
LAURA: Jeez! 
ASHLEY: Oof! 
MATT: So the first attack against you. 
LIAM: Baned. 
MATT: Yeah, Bane is going to be 21. 
LIAM: Misses. Superiority Die, Riposte. I'm going to stab him in the gut. 
MATT: Okay, go for it. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MARISHA: Wow, wow. 
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah. 
LIAM: 29 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
LIAM: 12 points of damage. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Yes! (clapping) (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
LIAM: I absolutely tore his legs up, and as he comes down to crush, I'm going to slide under his gooch and go straight up and in and cut up through the belly. And flowers just go (flutters) up his body. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
MATT: (impact lands) Onto the ground. 
LAURA: Cool! 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LIAM: That's why I stayed. 
SAM: Nice! 
MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: All right, that finishes the juggernaut's turn. FCG, you're up. 
SAM: Oh, and I'm in a mouth? 
MATT: You are. Actually, the top of your round is your-- No, it hasn't swallowed you. You're just grappled. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: That was a specific circumstance because you were already in its throat when it bit on you. 
SAM: He's surrounded by my friends, so I don't think he's going to last very long so I'll just use a cantrip. Scramble the Dead. I will open my mouth and you'll hear the AOL modem sound. (laughter) 
SAM: (modem buzzes and beeps) 
MATT: 14. 
SAM: Yeah, it fails. 
MATT: Constitution save, right? 
SAM: Fails, yeah. It's a dex save. No, no, no. It's a wisdom save. 
MATT: A wisdom save? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Even worse. 
TRAVIS: You've got (deeply) hell! 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: Bane on everything. That puts it at a 10. 
SAM: Okay. So that's 3d8. 11 points of-- Oh wait, no, I think it becomes a d12 because he has already taken damage, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Yes, so it's 3d12. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
SAM: A 12. 17. And 18. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? 
TRAVIS: Whoa, man. Yeah! (cheering) 
SAM: How do I want to do this? He doesn't have a face, right? 
MATT: Not a face. Just a giant mouth between its muscular shoulders. 
SAM: Okay, I will-- I'm going to adjust the frequency of my dissonant sound. I'm going to be looking for the perfect harmonics that will-- 
MATT: Harmonic resonance of the creature. 
SAM: -- harmonic resonance with his bone structure that will shake it apart. 
MATT: You watch it begin to quiver. It falls to one elbow as it tries to get back up, and that weird pocket slip beneath its mouth where it felt like it was breathing opens up and blood spills out of it as it shakes and then it collapses. 
SAM: Amazing. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
LAURA: That was fast. 
SAM: We got to get off the streets. 
ASHLEY: We got to go-- 
TRAVIS: Before we go, I'm going to start beheading the juggernaut and the two Reilorans. 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: I want their heads in a hole so no one can talk to them afterwards. 
SAM: But that could take a lot of time! 
ASHLEY: Oh, good call. 
TRAVIS: Not this long. (growls) 
MATT: It's going to take you about a minute to remove. 
TRAVIS: I'll take it. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to open-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Should we open the fucking hole and put them-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's the body hole. 
TALIESIN: -- the bodies in. Yeah, throw in. 
ASHLEY: Just put the bodies in. 
TRAVIS: Which takes longer, beheading three bodies or opening a hole, throwing them in and-- 
TALIESIN: Opening the hole is fast, right? 
MATT: Yeah, it takes a round or two to open the hole. 
TALIESIN: I'm opening the hole and we just kick them in. 
LAURA: Hey, guess what, I still got Telekinesis up. 
MATT: You do. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: Throw the bodies in the hole. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LAURA: What else am I going to fucking do with this? 
MARISHA: Nice. 
LIAM: ♪ Throw the bodies in the hole ♪ 
MATT: That's valid. 
TALIESIN: All right. That's two actions and get the whole thing. 
ASHLEY: We push the bodies in the hole. 
MATT: With Telekinesis aid on that, you just-- (thumps) 
TALIESIN: We're getting way too good at that. Let's run. (laughter) 
LAURA: Can I use Prestidigitation to get rid of any of the blood in the street and clear up the area? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Good call. 
MATT: It'll take you a couple rounds, but yeah, it can definitely be done. 
MARISHA: I'll aid in that with some-- 
TALIESIN: Goodbye to footprints, goodbye to-- 
LAURA: Then, yeah, all of the stuff, get rid of the evidence. Then the juggernaut was carrying something, wasn't he? 
SAM: Did we take the-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: -- The whole bodies-- 
LAURA: What was he dragging through the street? 
SAM: -- the avadon bodies? 
MATT: It's a wheeled cart that he was holding. 
LAURA: What's in the cart? 
LIAM: Yeah, what's on the cart? 
LAURA: Can we look and see what's in the cart? 
MATT: You go over and look and the cart has a, looks like a metallic box, about a one foot by one foot. 
SAM: Oh, there's a cart? 
LAURA: We should take the box. 
SAM: There's a cart? 
LAURA: Let's put the box. 
LIAM: Cart container. 
LAURA: Let's put the box in the hole. 
LIAM: In the hole. Telekinesis that shit in the hole? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm lifting the box and putting it in the hole. 
MATT: Yeah, it's heavy, but Telekinesis is more than enough to do so. 
LAURA: Okay, and then the cart. 
LIAM: A bump on a log at the bottom of the sea? 
MARISHA: Bottom of the sea, yes. (laughs) 
LAURA: Is there anything else in the cart? 
MATT: No, just that. 
LAURA: It's just an empty cart. I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: How big is the cart? 
LAURA: Well-- 
TALIESIN: I know. 
LAURA: Can I lift the cart up and put it on top of a building so it's not seeable? 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. 
MARISHA: Nice, nice! 
TALIESIN: Love it. Fucking love it. 
MARISHA: That's really great, yeah. 
MATT: Shove it off to the side. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Wicked. 
LIAM: Just "Minecraft" god mode. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Now, Orym. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: You have a pretty high passive perception. 
LIAM: Yes, it's 31. 
MATT: Yep. (laughs) As you're putting it up there, you can see one of the upper towers, there is someone looking over. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: Down over the circumstance. All you see is a figure up there and then quickly-- 
MARISHA: Shit. 
MATT: -- pull back into the window. 
SAM: Kill all witnesses! 
LAURA: Well, hopefully they're part of the resistance. 
TALIESIN: Let's roll. 
LAURA: Let's go. 
LIAM: Yeah, I think one witness up high. 
MARISHA: Do you point that out? 
LIAM: Yeah, I think it. 
MARISHA: I-- 
TALIESIN: Put our cloaks up and let's get the fuck out of here. 
MARISHA: I have invisible Pâté go up and get a closer look. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: And see who this is. 
MATT: Lands onto the windowsill. As Pâté glimpses inside, it looks like a dark shaded abode. Looks like some scavenged furniture that lies around with some sheets of dried and torn material. You see cloth-like materials around here, but you don't know where cotton would even come from. 
SAM: Hmm. Curious. 
MATT: It's not quite cotton-like either. It's thicker. But you see inside there is a Reiloran figure that is hiding off to the side of the window. 
MARISHA: Are they wearing military garb or just rags or-- 
MATT: No, no. They look like a standard civilian. 
TRAVIS: Same guy that was with the kids earlier. 
TALIESIN: Do you want to give him a little, hm? 
MARISHA: I'm going to have Pâté, I've never done this, un-invisible himself. 
MATT: (puffs) 
MARISHA: Tell him he better keep his mouth shut or else! 
MATT: "Okay!" 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: As Pâté swoops in and lands, the entity-- You see this maybe-- The Reilora that you've encountered have all been varying younger to middle age. You can see the coloration on the body is slightly more gray. A lot of the vibrant reds and purples and pinks have faded and you can see elements of wrinkles. This looks to be an older Reilora who immediately turns and looks at Pâté and backs up into the corner as Pâté stumbles forward. "Hey! You! You don't say a thing! No peeping! Ssh!" Which is hard for a skull to do. "(raspy wheezing)" (laughter) 
LAURA: He's so cute! 
LIAM: Just whistles. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Don't worry! We're all friends here. And look, we even cleaned it up for you, right?" 
MARISHA: All right, that's enough. That's enough. 
MATT: "It's a service we provide here." 
SAM: He's improv-ing. 
MARISHA: He's-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: I think he's got it. 
MATT: "Right. So, what did we learn?" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: The Reiloran (silent acknowledgement). "Yeah! So we don't tell anyone!" 
MARISHA: All right, Pâté. 
MATT: "All right. I got to go. Have a good day! Bye!" (flutters) Out the window. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Let's get off the street. 
TALIESIN: We are heading, I would assume, towards-- 
LAURA: Yeah, to the Jagged Edge. 
TALIESIN: To the Jagged Edge fast and as chill as we can. 
MATT: Okay. I would like a group stealth check to just-- 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
MATT: I guess, here's my question. Are you going-- Are you darting from shadow to shadow or are you trying to walk through the streets passing yourself off as individuals that are supposed to be there? 
TRAVIS: I think we should be passing ourselves off-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- as someone that belongs here. 
LAURA: Same, same. 
MATT: Okay. So I would like everyone to make a group deception check. 
SAM: Hmm. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Deception. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: ♪ I get advantage ♪ 
TALIESIN: That's not cool. 
MATT: Now, mind you, it's probably a-- It's a lower DC, but everyone is trying to pass this off. Because of your presentation, your attire, so-- Over here. 
TALIESIN: Three. 
SAM: Oof. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: 24. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 10. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: 16. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: 18. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Nine. 
TALIESIN: Then there's a mystery roll. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: There is. We'll wait for Orym to come back here as-- 
SAM: Or maybe we should roll for him. 
MATT: No, let's all sit in silence and stare at him-- 
LAURA: Just roll? 
MATT: -- 'til he comes back. 
LAURA: Roll one of his moon die? 
TALIESIN: Well, I want to make sure he doesn't have-- 
LAURA: Special one of the die. 
TALIESIN: Special things about it. 
SAM: Just go for it. 
LAURA: Ah, see? That was great. 
TALIESIN: 17. 
LAURA: Yeah, 17. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Lucky. (chuckles) 
MATT: So, in walking as a group and stepping through the streets here of The Clutch region of Kreviris. You can see there are people talking to each other. There's a little bit of hushed energy as people gather and step into each others' building. It has this sense like there's a military occupation is the best way I can describe it, but it's occupying its own city, and you're uncertain how long it's been like this, but from what little bits you've gleaned, it's probably been like this for some time. 
MARISHA: Treshi scry ball! 
MATT: Treshi scry ball. 
LAURA: (chuckles) 
MATT: The faintest glimmer-- 
LAURA: (gasps) No, no, no, no! 
MARISHA: The faintest glimmer. In which direction? 
MATT: Near where would be the entrance of the valley where the city is. At least you know that Otohan has arrived. 
ASHLEY: Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: But they're not here. 
LAURA: Did we check the hole for-- Did we check those bodies for rings like we did the other? 
MARISHA: No, we didn't really have time. 
TALIESIN: -- another dimension right now so we'll have time later. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: I tell everybody immediately. She's here, she's here. She's here, she's fucking here! 
TALIESIN: Well, now we know how long that takes. Let's get the fuck out of here. 
MARISHA: So that's towards the entrance from the valley into the city. Which direction are we moving in relation to her? 
TALIESIN: Rolled a deception check for you. 
MATT: If the entranceway is the south part of the city structure, you're heading in a northeastern direction. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Everything will be fine. 
SAM: I'm going to cast-- 
MARISHA: Go, go, go. Otohan is here. 
SAM: I'm going to cast Locate Creature-- 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: -- and try to find Zhesh? 
LAURA: Zhesh wouldn't-- 
SAM: Wait, who are we supposed to meet here? 
LAURA: We're supposed to meet Jidoh. 
SAM: That one. 
LIAM: Jidoh. 
LIAM: Jidoh, we're waiting for Jidoh. 
SAM: Jidoh. 
MATT: Jidoh. 
SAM: I'm going to name Jidoh. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: You immediately get a ping not far from the periphery. 
ASHLEY: Questioning Jidoh? 
MATT: Winding through these alleys, and there are many. Aside from one central street that you do cross rapidly to get in the northeastern direction you're having to go, most of this surface, all the city streets are a tangle of alleys and small walkways. Some have small tunnel enclosures where upper bridges between the higher structures are, rickety as they might be. It's a dizzying aging M.C. Escher painting at times, how everything overlaps and parts have fallen and caught the other towers and been held there with a slight angle. It's oddly beautiful in its alien presentation. But following your ping-- 
SAM: Yeah, I'm holding my coin and it's turning in the direction we're supposed to go. 
MATT: There are also a number of other small troops of Reiloran and Imperium interests walking through the streets, keeping eyes out, on patrol. Now that you know (laughs) what you're looking for, and you're keeping your presence, intentional as it is, you manage to skirt past a few of them, and as they take note, they do not pay any particular interest to you and let you continue your path forward. Until eventually you come to the outskirts of a mercantile district. As opposed to most of the simple abodes and clusters of colorless stone buildings and hovels and tents that are all clustered together, here you can see manner of color and decor. There are more of these lanterns hanging in beautiful different shades of tinted glass that hang in clusters of baubles. Some that are a deep cerulean blue, others that have shades of red behind them. You can see there are strips of material that have been dyed different colors that point to different buildings. It looks like there are clothing boutiques. Boutiques in the sense of, still look a little ramshackle, but there are nicer little things you could purchase as a gift, or as a bit of home decor. You can see there is a dyeing facility with different tubs of dye that are arranged in an opening area. 
LAURA: You go to die. 
MATT: Yeah, it's where you go to die. The culture here is very specific. 
LIAM: I've been looking for it. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: I'll get you someday. 
TALIESIN: It's called Just Dye Already. (laughter) 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Except with a Y. 
MATT: You can see some of these have chimney-like exhausts that rise and spiral upward, with only bits of dark smoke that billow out in long threads. Following FCG's ping of his Locate Creature spell, you come to the outside of a massive clay kiln. Embedded in the base of it is a doughnut-shaped stone structure that's built around the base of this kiln. Here is the strongest bit of black smoke that drifts up and gets carried away with the wind that presses down over the mountain range and through this valley. But there you see, this is the first time you've really taken a moment to appreciate the written font of a lot of the language here. A lot of it is common and broken other Exandrian languages, but everything has this oddly carved, like the memory of hand writing, in places. 
LAURA: Like looking at writing in dreams? 
MATT: Kind of, yeah. It takes you a minute to focus on enough to see "The Jagged Edge." All throughout the building's entryway, there's an arch of broken and pointed bits of glass that have been wedged into the stone archway entrance. It looks dangerous at first, but as you approach, you can see the tips have all been rounded off to ensure that it might catch you, but it won't cut you. 
TRAVIS: (smirks) 
MATT: On the inside, you could hear the clanging of metal upon metal and other materials, like a workshop that's hard at work. 
LAURA: Do we see Jidoh? 
MATT: As you step inside, the smell catches you immediately. Smell and temperature. It is very warm in here. The affixed massive kiln that works here is definitely blazing, and the windows are open to try and let as much air flow through as possible. You can see there are all manner of unique chains. That same weird rusted metal that you saw the Shrikes using. Looks like they've been repurposed. Some of them come to a rust crumble, but ones that do function have hooks on them, and you can see there are partially finished projects that are hung. Some of them look to be dishware. Some of them look to be decoration. Some of those more unique-looking lanterns that you saw hung in the tower that glowed when you entered, the same material. You can see there's a pile of broken shards of blue-green glass where certain projects didn't quite make the process, as it happens when working with glass. But also, all manner of weapons, long scimitars made of intricately sharpened glass, an obsidian flecked edge. 
LAURA: Sick. 
MATT: You can see spear edges and falchions, and glaives made of the same material. There is definitely a weaponsmithing portion of this business. You also see, occasionally, little knickknacks. You see a small multi-piece glass blown and shaped wuukor, with all its tiny little horns all around it. You see above on the shelf a beautiful rendition of a dancing Reiloran with its arms out as it's flying in the air. Very Peter Pan-esque in its presentation, with the clouded green-blue glass making the form of its body and the rest of it cleared out slightly to help it look like it's aloft. There's a unique mixture of artistry and weaponry across the interior. On the far back, you see sitting at the workshop table and hitting with tiny instruments, chipping away at a project, a tall, rotund-looking male fuzzy creature, not unlike the fanged and tusk-toothed creatures that you encountered at the nearby mountain range. 
MARISHA: Name drop. 
MATT: This one's hair is stark white at this point. You get a sense of age and maturity about them. They have a heavy set of goggles that have layer upon layer of extended-looking lens, to this tiny fine point, and you see them chipping away at this tiny little piece of something. As you begin to step in, the voice rings out. "I'll be with you, just a moment. Please be patient. Finishing this one project. Don't be loud, I hate loud noises." 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (laugh) (quick chiseling) (shattering) "(grunts)" Immediately throws it across the room, and it (shattering) on the wall. "My apologies! Ah, sometimes that's how that works." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Hello. What can we do for the Imperium?" 
LAURA: Jidoh? 
MATT: "Yes." 
LAURA: Hi. We are of the Vanguard, and we're looking for a contract. 
MATT: "Of course. Curious array of Vanguard." 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "But a contract can be arranged. Be patient, just a moment." 
MARISHA: Can I get an insight check? 
SAM: Insight check, yeah. 
MATT: Yes, you may. 
SAM: I'll do that, too. 
MATT: Both of you make insight checks. 
MARISHA: Is he looking like-- 
SAM: He's going to go pull an alarm? 
TRAVIS: Should we have said Zhesh's name? 
MARISHA: We're not walking into a trap, are we? That's what I'm wondering. 
SAM: I got a natural 20. 
MATT: Roll insight. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LIAM: (whooping) 
MARISHA: Ooh, I probably won't get as good as that. Ooh, I got a-- Wait, what am I looking for? What did I say? 
LAURA: Insight. 
MARISHA: Insight check. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What am I doing? 
MATT: Animal handling, go! (laughter) 
MARISHA: 17. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Not a natural 20, but. 
SAM: I get whispers. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
SAM: Someone stall. 
MARISHA: What if I get whispers, too? 
MATT: You both get whispers. Come in here. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
LAURA and LIAM: Oh! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Leave space for the whisper. 
LAURA: Oh, look at this double cup. 
ASHLEY: Oh, look at this cup action. 
LIAM: So dirty. 
LAURA: It does kind of look dirty. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (babbling) 
LIAM: That's some ASMR shit going on over there. 
ASHLEY: That is, yeah. 
LAURA: I don't know, I don't feel comfortable with the double cup. 
SAM: How did he get his tongue in both our ears? 
LIAM: Well, you know the thing about Matt is-- 
MARISHA: He's very talented. 
LIAM: -- his tongue is forked. 
MATT: Bisected surgery I got in high school. 
SAM: I see Chetney go for his weapon, and I stop him and say: It's okay, it's okay. 
MARISHA: Did Chetney do that? 
SAM: No, I don't know. 
MARISHA: Oh. (laughs) (laughter) 
SAM: Just Chetney would do that. It's okay! 
TRAVIS: I don't have any beef with-- I'm a fucking werewolf. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You watch as Jidoh, watching you all, and taking stock of these strange arrivals, wipe his hands, take his work apron off and set it there, and then walk through a heavy curtain that goes beyond the kiln in the back of the chamber to another room that's still on the outside of the massive smokestack. You wait one minute. Two minutes. Almost five minutes go by before the curtain pulls apart and you see a Reiloran Shrike. You see that elongated, thin, almost lizard, predator body of this extension, the exaggeration of the standard Reiloran step through. She has dark green marble set-like eyes with one big carved mark, like a giant C that's carved around the outside of the eye that comes in towards the edge of the mouth. As she steps out, she throws a bit of a jacket over and steps into the chamber. You can see she has a natural hunch to her form, but still, standing tall, is taller than any of you. Looks back, Jidoh hasn't arrived yet, or hasn't returned, and goes, "So, you have my attention. You said you needed a contract, yes?" 
LAURA: Is this Zhesh? Do I recognize the voice? 
MATT: This is Zhesh. 
LAURA: Nice to see you in person. 
MATT: "Indeed. You wear deceptive attire." 
LAURA: It gets us through the streets. 
MATT: "Indeed, astute. I like that, it shows promise." She goes ahead and moves her hand like this, and the curtain behind you (shifting fabric) closes, and the room becomes darker. "What is your business here in Kreviris? Do you need help smuggling things in, out? What do you want?" 
LAURA: Well. 
MARISHA: I guess, in a sense, we want to help the resistance. 
MATT: So interesting point in there, she's not using her mind to talk to you. She's speaking with her mouth, much like the children did earlier. 
SAM: Hmm. 
MARISHA: Are you not connected to the hive mind? Is that only reserved for the Imperium? 
MATT: "It's not about being connected to a hive mind, but I live amongst many people with different gifts. It's best we all live at the same level." 
TALIESIN: I like that. 
LAURA: Mm. 
SAM: You're part of the Volition? 
MATT: "I am not part of the Volition." 
MARISHA: But you're not with the Imperium. 
MATT: "Who are you with?" You see her take a step back towards the curtain she entered from, putting her hand up towards the wall. 
TALIESIN: It's time to put everything on the fucking table. 
SAM: Like bodies? 
TALIESIN: Well, eventually. We're from Exandria. We are attempting to stop the fucking insanity going on. We are supposed to come here and figure out what the hell this is, what this place is, who is trying to awaken The One Who Sleeps. We are just trying to figure out how to stop this. 
MATT: "This is true?" 
LAURA: Well, I have no problem with Reilorans or anyone on Ruidus coming down to Exandria. That's not what we're here to stop. It's Ludinus. It's the dreamers that have come here that shouldn't be. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage between the two of you. 
LAURA: Oh! 28. 
TALIESIN: (happy grunt) 
MATT: 28. You see their hand was going up towards something behind the curtain, and it stops. 
LAURA: No, that's-- No, yeah, 28. Sorry, 13 plus 15 is 28, yes? 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Your math is sound. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: The hand pulls back. "Very well, then perhaps we are not on the opposite sides of this conflict. Well, you've come to my place of business. This is not a safe space to talk, nor am I really a member of the Volition. I just align with their cause, and help where I can. But I can, perhaps, show you where you can find them." 
LAURA: I'd be grateful. 
TALIESIN: And somewhere we can hide for a little bit. 
LIAM: The lay of the land is the primary thing we've come here for. 
MATT: "The Volition," you see, as you're talking, she's constantly checking the windows, checking the door, like there's a definitive paranoia in the space here. "The Volition has to move pass houses once every few weeks. It's not safe to keep it all in one location. They signal their current pass house by a certain color, a particular color." She walks across the room, behind an area where there's a couple of boxes. She opens one up and pulls out all these swatches of color, and then pulls one that's a deep royal purple, brilliantly vibrant, freshly dyed, unscarred by the dust, and the sunlight, and tosses it over. (whoosh) 
LAURA: I catch it in the air, and bring it to me. 
MATT: "It is hard to find, but you'll need a vantage point. Someplace high. I recommend the Overspoke, the highest tower point in The Banners. Now they cycle through various watchmen in the Overspoke Tower. There's one that works there named Earot. He's not with the Volition. He's not with the Imperium. He's in it for personal gain, and to remain on the side of whoever wins. So if you go in with some interesting presents, and a convincing argument, he's not against taking a break at the right time. He usually works right around dusk, so you have a few hours. Look for that color. That'll guide you to where to find them. Any other questions?" 
TALIESIN: I like this shop. Yeah, I'll take metal, gold, platinum, copper. 
MARISHA: Amex. 
TALIESIN: Everywhere. 
MATT: "Whatever resources are useful in our crafts, we do for trade, yes." 
TALIESIN: Just throw up the hammer. Might come back. 
SAM: We saw some weapons. Some of the guards were holding some weapons that had a glass tip or something like that. Is that something you make? 
MATT: "Once upon a time, yes. We've had a few of our business arrangements with the Imperium canceled in recent years. I don't build them, but I've built pieces. I'm not a maker of weapons. That's Jidoh's preference. Me, I don't do that anymore." 
SAM: Do those weapons just, you know, poke and pierce and shoot or do they conduct magical energy? 
MATT: "They tend to pull latent powers from the charged atmosphere and focus them on a target before them." 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: Mm. In like a beam of badness. 
MATT: "Ever seen the flashing in the storms as they roll through?" 
TALIESIN: Is it lightning? 
SAM: Yeah. Okay. Good to know, thank you. 
TALIESIN: Any advice for getting to where we are without getting caught? We have been causing a couple commotions. 
MATT: "Well, the fact that you've come this far tells me that you seem to be quite adept at figuring that out." 
LIAM: We can't stay here. 
MATT: "No." 
LIAM: We have a couple hours until we find Earot, so we need to lay low somewhere else. 
MATT: "Give me a moment." She steps out of the room back from where she came. You hear a bit of muffled, heated conversation. Eventually Jidoh emerges. 
MARISHA: Are they just the same person? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Only--" 
TALIESIN: Clark? 
MATT: "-- a short time! You cannot stay here. I don't know you. We have no business. I'm taking a walk." Jidoh exits out in a bit of-- 
TRAVIS: One question! I'll drop a bag of gold, and just let it (crash) across the floor. The scythe with the gold, with the glass blade. Does gold do anything for you here? 
MATT: "It is a rare material, yes, but it's more about the-- Well, what do you want me to do with it?" 
TRAVIS: I was just going to offer it in exchange for the scythe. 
MATT: "Sure." They begin scooping up the pile of what you dropped. How much gold? 
TRAVIS: 300 gold. 
MATT: 300 gold. Scoops it up. Looks over and sets it over into a small little stone carved alcove and then shifts it into the kiln where the gold's going to be melted down into ingots. 
TRAVIS: Sweet. 
TALIESIN: Love that. 
MARISHA: How much for the little dancer? 
MATT: "Oh, that, you'll have to talk to Zhesh, but I need to go and--" 
SAM: Can I just, as they walk away, can I check if it's the same person? 
MARISHA: I know, it's got, but. (laughs) They're never the same room. 
SAM: Do they have the same gait or anything? Any similarities? 
TALIESIN: Are they wearing glasses? 
MATT: (laughs) No. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Jidoh leaves and heads off into the afternoon light, but Zhesh comes in again. 
MARISHA: Did we see Jidoh run all the way around to the back? 
MATT: Make a perception check. (laughter) 
SAM: Four! 
MARISHA: 16. 
MATT: You glance out the window and you see Jidoh walking away as Zhesh is in the chamber. 
TALIESIN: He's good. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "You can stay in the basement for the next hour or so maximum." 
TALIESIN: Excellent. 
MATT: "When Jidoh returns, you have to have already vacated. You being here puts everything in danger." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "But strange times, and fellows in bed and all that." 
SAM: Think you could make a mood ring with glass? Like something that shows? 
MATT: "I could probably make something like that, yeah." 
SAM: I don't know how you connect it to me, but. 
LAURA: Yeah, you put like a little jewel. Maybe it can be in your chest where the coin used to be. 
SAM: That's interesting. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Zhesh-- 
SAM: About this size? I'll come back for it. 
MATT: "All right. I have an hour, I can get some work done while you wait." 
MARISHA: How much for the little dancer? 
MATT: "Hmm." She gives a really intense look at you. Your eyes. Make a persuasion check. 
MARISHA: I have advantage. 
SAM: Do you, though? 
MARISHA: But I should have-- Rolled advantage only one. Persuasion check? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Okay. 21. 
MATT: 21. "(sighs) It's not for sale, but you can have it. But if that ever shows up in any of your business and the Imperium manages to get its hands on that, that connects me to you, I'll disavow any knowledge and I will have to give them what information I know about you if they come asking. So it'll do you much good to keep it hidden." 
MARISHA: They won't find it. 
MATT: "Good. Now I'll work on your ring?" 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "There is a pit with a ladder beyond that curtain. Stay there." 
SAM: Sounds homey. 
TALIESIN: Anything. 
MARISHA: Matt, you said that this doll was carved out of the same glass as the weapons? The same crystalline? 
MATT: Correct, with some impurities intentionally laid into it to change some of the opacity and color. 
SAM: It says "Sharper Image" on it. (laughter) 
SAM: Should we take a short rest? 
LIAM: Yes. 
TALIESIN: My god, yes. 
LAURA: Yeah, we should. I'm going to use that to attune to my (garbles). 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god. 
LIAM: Maybe Chet, this weird box. 
SAM: We should look at it. 
LIAM: Is it going to slice my hand off if I open it? 
TALIESIN: It's in the box. It's in the pit. 
LAURA: It's in the pit. We should do it in the pit so that it doesn't-- 
LIAM: That was the intention. Not going down the ladder. 
TRAVIS: Can we take a short rest? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Sure, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Great. 
MARISHA: Sounds good. 
TRAVIS: Can I check the box for traps? 
MATT: You can, go make an investigation check. Interesting point of order. The construction of this box, now that you take a look at it, there's something familiar about it. What'd you roll? 
TRAVIS: 25. 
MATT: 25. There are some Vanguard containers you had previously encountered that were under the hold of Paragon's Call. 
TRAVIS: Cerberus? 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Fucking knew it. 
MARISHA: I was wondering. 
MATT: You do not see the symbol emblazoned on it, but the construction of it seems pretty similar. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
MATT: Also, there does appear to be a magical lock on the device, one that will react rather violently should it be tampered with incorrectly. 
TALIESIN: You may want to save this for there then. 
SAM: What? No way, now is the time! 
LAURA: How do we get it open? 
TALIESIN: No. 
SAM: Can we dispel? Anybody have Dispel? 
TALIESIN: I think an explosion here would go very poorly. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: We could do it inside a hole. 
LAURA: I don't have Dispel, but an explosion inside the hole would still explode the hole. It might ruin the whole thing. 
SAM: Is that how that works? 
LAURA: I think so. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it will probably-- 
LAURA: I mean, it's not indestructible. 
LIAM: It might ruin the other contents if there's anything of value in there. 
TALIESIN: And probably really fuck up whoever's in there pretty, pretty badly. 
MARISHA: Can you Counterspell a trap spell? 
MATT: No, Counterspell is specific against spells that are being cast in the moment. For magical enchantments and magical traps, Dispel Magic and other like-minded effects are the preferred use. 
MARISHA: I kind of agree. I don't know if this is the time. 
ASHLEY: Hm. 
MARISHA: Specifically-- 
LAURA: You don't have anything like acid? Anything that could eat a hole in it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is definitely not for right now, this is for when we are not underneath somebody's home. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: I think we've caused enough civilian damage for a 24 hour period at this point. 
MARISHA: I will take out the little tiny dancer, though. FCG, what do you think? You think you can get a little bit more information on this substance? 
SAM: I sure could tomorrow. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: I'll also say-- 
SAM: Well, I mean I can-- Well, let's see here. 
MARISHA: You don't have to right now. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Chet, you got that glass thing? Do you think you can see if any of the things we just picked up in the pit are magical, or--? 
TRAVIS: The things we picked up? 
TALIESIN: We did just throw a bunch of semi-important dangerous people into a giant pit. 
LAURA: I'm regaining a fifth level. 
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll put the Monocle of True Essence on and look at all the things in the pit with Detect Magic. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MATT: Okay. In looking across it, other than the things you already have that are magical in there, the attire of the Reilorans and the entities you put in there appear to be non-magical in nature. 
TRAVIS: Not much. 
TALIESIN: No, all the-- 
LAURA: How's everyone holding up? 
SAM: After a short rest, fine. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Tired. Still. 
SAM: Oh yeah, should I-- 
LIAM: Is that how you mean? 
ASHLEY: Still exhausted. 
SAM: Should I restore you? 
TALIESIN: It'll-- 
LAURA: No, I meant more mentally. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Tired. 
SAM: Checking in? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: That's so sweet. 
LAURA: I mean this is all pretty strange and stressful. 
LIAM: So far pulling off what we came to do, though. That's got to count for something. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I've been wondering about FRIDA lately. If they're okay. 
MARISHA: Have you checked in with them? 
SAM: No, I can't. Can't. 
LAURA: Well, maybe once we get back. Sending is working now. 
SAM: Now that Sending works. Yeah. 
LAURA: Speaking of, why was it working? What did we do? What happened here? 
SAM: Did we do anything or is it just fading, or--? 
LAURA: Or maybe Ludinus is doing something. 
MARISHA: It makes me nervous. 
TALIESIN: Maybe it's stronger some places than others. 
LAURA: Can you look at the ball? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: Oh yeah! 
MARISHA: Treshi scry ball. 
MATT: Looks like there's been a little bit of movement closer to the center of the city. 
LIAM: I have an idea. 
MARISHA: I'm going to take it and leave it out. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I have an idea to open the box, but I don't know if the juice is worth the squeeze. 
TALIESIN: What's the thought? 
LIAM: Letters, the other day when you were with Otohan, you said that you poofed off somewhere else. 
SAM: I did. 
LIAM: Yeah. Could you take some of the witches to that place and have you guys distantly open the box in another place so that all the damage and sound and trouble happens there? 
MARISHA: That's interesting. 
LAURA: I don't know if I have any way to do it from a distance. 
MARISHA: I also wouldn't want to explode the contents on the inside. 
LAURA: Right. 
SAM: Fearne has something that can work at a distance. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I could try. 
LIAM: I've seen her undo traps. 
LAURA: What is it? 
ASHLEY: Maybe like a Mage Hand situation? 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: You do have thieves' tools. 
LIAM: Yes, from a distance, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Mage Hand some thieves' tools? 
TALIESIN: I guess we do. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I have thieves' tools also. 
MARISHA: I have thieves' tools. 
ASHLEY: I have thieves' tools. Yeah, I have thieves' tools. 
TALIESIN: We got to be real careful with this thing and I don't know if this is the place for it. 
ASHLEY: We've got to try to open it. 
LIAM: Well, it's not-- 
SAM: We'd be in another-- 
LIAM: The Astral Sea might be. 
SAM: -- realm of existence. 
TALIESIN: That's bat shit, I'm not going to say no. 
MARISHA: This lock looks like it can be picked with thieves' tools? 
MATT: It can be. It looks like the difficulty has been vastly improved at the presence of this arcane lock enchantment and on a failure-- 
TRAVIS: Could be-- 
MATT: -- looks like something's going to happen. 
TRAVIS: -- rough. 
LIAM: Otherwise, we're waiting on somebody else to do it for us, right? 
SAM: (extreme sneeze) 
TALIESIN: Or at least-- 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Waiting on being-- 
LAURA: (Mario) It's-a me! 
TALIESIN: -- somewhere here we are not going to get in trouble if everything goes-- 
ASHLEY: It did sound like Mario sneezed. 
TRAVIS: Dispelling the magic would help a ton. 
LAURA: Yeah, we need to dispel the magic. None of us have Dispel? 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: I could probably get it tomorrow. 
LAURA: Well then let's wait. 
TALIESIN: I have no problem waiting for tomorrow. 
LIAM: Then let's wait for that. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Let me look. Do I have that spell? 
SAM: I rarely use it. 
MARISHA: Clerics should, I think. 
MATT: Yeah, it's on the list, you just have to memorize it at the beginning of the day. 
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that then. 
ASHLEY: See if I have it. 
SAM: Detect, detect. Dispel! 
LAURA: Great. Then we wait. 
LIAM: Yup. 
TALIESIN: If we get to the end of the day and you still have something leftover, then I will happily take some things because this is not pleasant. 
SAM: Gotcha. Okay. 
MARISHA: How long have we been up and moving now at this point? Well, we're waiting until sundown. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I do have it. 
MATT: Right, which is a few hours from now. 
LIAM: I'd say we have an hour-ish down here. 
LAURA: An hour to chill. 
LIAM: Which is a short rest of time. 
SAM: Also, we heard that the Imperium is doing the coming move. They're moving. 
LIAM: To the Blue Promise, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: That's the move to Exandria, right? To Er-xandria. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Er-xandria. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Er-mah-gerd 
SAM: It's a country accent thing. 
LAURA: Er-xandria. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Welcome to Er-xandria. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: It's got a ring. 
SAM: All right, after the short rest is over, I'm going to ritually cast-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: -- Telepathic Bond! 
MATT: There you go. 
LAURA: Great, great, great. 
LIAM: (as hype-man) Telepathic Bond! 
SAM: Are we going to go break into this tower? 
LAURA: I guess so. 
TALIESIN: I think we're-- 
LIAM: Well, we're trying to-- 
TALIESIN: -- bribing. 
LIAM: Bribing someone at the tower. Earot. 
SAM: Yeah. Oh, yeah, he said bring presents. 
ASHLEY: With presents or, yeah. 
SAM: What do we got? 
LIAM: Something worthwhile. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, what can we bring? 
LIAM: Anything in the hole? 
SAM: Can we at least look through the Juggernaut's pockets or something? 
TRAVIS: Sure. 
MARISHA: I've got a behemoth finger. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Just one? 
ASHLEY: I have some leftover goodberries-- 
SAM: That would work on you. 
ASHLEY: -- that seem to be-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: They like food. 
LAURA: Some fruit. Do any of us have fruit from home? 
ASHLEY: (gasps) What if you make baked goods? 
SAM: I could bake. I could bake. 
LAURA: They've probable never had a baked-- 
SAM: Bake like the wind. 
ASHLEY: They probably never had it. 
LAURA: Baked goods? 
TALIESIN: That might be worth-- I think that might be worth something. 
LAURA: Maybe you could bake something with Goodberries. 
TRAVIS: I've been working on a new piece. 
SAM: I could. Some scones? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I've got four. 
LAURA: Goodberry scones. 
LIAM: Oh my gosh. 
SAM: Goodberry scones. 
SAM: You got a what? 
LIAM: GM, I have a question. 
SAM: Wait, what do you have? 
MARISHA: He's been working on a new thing. 
MATT: Hold on, he's talking. 
LIAM: Sorry. 
MATT: It's all right. Okay. 
LIAM: Sorry. I can make flowers. I can make little tendrils and things. Can I make blueberries and the like? 
MATT: I'd say you could probably make a handful of them, yeah. They won't have any effect, but they're just little blueberries. 
LIAM: Sure, but for a Bormodo, who's dying to eat a strawberry, I could provide a strawberry. 
MATT: Probably. 
LIAM: Good to know. 
TALIESIN: Very good to know. 
LAURA: Very good. 
SAM: I'll take whatever you don't use. 
LAURA: What were you going to say, then? 
TRAVIS: Hmm? 
LAURA: Were you going to say-- 
TRAVIS: I've been working on a new toy. 
SAM: Like a (vicious scream) toy, or like a-- 
TRAVIS: No. Handheld. 
TALIESIN: A rocking horse that goes sideways now too? 
TRAVIS: No. 
LIAM: We got 48 more minutes. You want to tell us about it? 
TRAVIS: No. 
LIAM: Oh. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: But I have a feeling anyone that (sighs wistfully) gets to see it would be quite taken with it. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: I like this plan. Do we need to-- 
TALIESIN: This is a plan. 
MARISHA: -- give a little bit of room for the artiste? 
TRAVIS: What? 
SAM: Do you need anything to do your stupid work? 
ASHLEY: Do you need space? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Do you need space? Do you need a discretion? 
TRAVIS: I said I've been working on a piece! It's done! 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: You should have said you had finished it. It sounded like it was in process. 
ASHLEY: A finished piece? 
TRAVIS: Well, art is never done. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
LAURA: Well. 
TALIESIN: It's abandoned. 
TRAVIS: You uncultured swine. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: So it's done. 
LAURA: Yeah, so-- 
ASHLEY: Do you want to show us? 
TRAVIS: You don't want to see it. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I do. 
TRAVIS: No, you don't. 
ASHLEY: Why? What happens when you see it? 
TRAVIS: You die. 
ASHLEY: Is that true? 
SAM: Insight check? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I don't believe it. 
TRAVIS: I mean, I can show everybody in here, if you want. 
ASHLEY: Show me. Show me. 
TALIESIN: Actually, no. 
TRAVIS: It'd just be a solo mission after that, which I'm okay with. 
MARISHA, LAURA, and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: I'm very confused about this toy. 
LAURA: I trust you, Chet. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I trust you. 
TRAVIS: Get rid of a lot baggage. 
LAURA: You've been so trustworthy. I completely trust you. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
MARISHA: I don't know, I kind of want to see what happens on the day, as they say. 
TRAVIS: No, it's just a toy. What could go wrong? 
ASHLEY: There's no such thing as just a toy. 
TRAVIS: Mm. 
ASHLEY: You taught us that. 
LAURA: That rocking horse was really great that you gave to those kids. 
TRAVIS: I got a lot of those. I got them like jacks, just ready to throw out. Some people got caltrops, I got rocking horses. 
LAURA: Really? 
LIAM: There's a 100 Statue Of Libertys. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just keep them tucked away. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It was a very sweet-- 
TRAVIS: Tucked away. 
MARISHA: -- thing, though. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I don't think those kids might not have ever had a toy in their life, at least not like that. It was very kind. 
SAM: You're very good with children. Almost like a fatherly instinct took over. 
TRAVIS: Got enough practice. 
LIAM: Rare in a couple of ways. There's very little wood here. 
MARISHA: You know, it does-- Seeing those kids, it seems like there's a decent amount of disparity between-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- the different classes. 
LAURA: I meant what I said. I feel like a lot of people here would have a better life if maybe they were allowed to come to Exandria. They've never seen trees, they've never seen green like that. The Taloned Highlands are just so beautiful. 
LIAM: Devil's advocate. It's very beautiful here. 
LAURA: Sure. 
LIAM: I think their problem is someone's standing on their neck more than the landscape. 
MARISHA: I don't know, I think I have four pounds of dust and sand in my eye holes. 
LAURA: Your beautiful eye holes. 
MARISHA: Oh! Just take out a massive fucking-- 
MATT: Rocks. (clattering) 
MARISHA: Rocks, yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (shudders) 
MARISHA: Just squeeze my eye a little bit. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: No, I agree. I think helping them would be a great boon to the end of all of this. Plus, we don't want to, you know-- This is probably going to sound a little cold, but it's the truth. When there is imbalance and injustices in a system, it can topple much easier if we can rally those who have been stepped on. 
LAURA: Well, I think that's why the Volition is probably in this area. You know? 
TALIESIN: Let's just remember we are here as guests. We don't know the lay of the land. We don't know what anything means. We don't know these people. We are going to follow the people who have already figured out what they need. They know that they don't want this in here. We can help them get it out. 
MARISHA: We're not guests, Ashton. We're infiltrating. 
TALIESIN: Right now, we are guests in a hole beneath a floor. We cannot infiltrate. That would require us to be subtle. 
LAURA: Well, we've got to infiltrate. Otherwise, all this mission is for nothing. 
TALIESIN: We have to learn. We have to pay attention. That's all I'm saying. It's too easy to get-- It's too easy to make assumptions. 
LIAM: Well, that's why we're here. 
TALIESIN: That's exactly why we're here. 
LIAM: I think we're doing it. 
TRAVIS: To that end, not saying we're going to get caught again, because we are smooth. 
MARISHA: So smooth. I look at the Treshi scry ball. 
MATT: Looks like she's moved a little bit, towards the core of the city, still a ways away from you. 
TRAVIS: Just a little bit. It might not be the worst thing in the world if some of us got captured. I'm just saying, in case it comes down to throwing down again or causing more of a ruckus or bringing none to attention and everything, if we've got this mental link, we have ways of tracking each other and talking. 
LIAM: No. 
TRAVIS: Going inside might not be the worst thing. 
LAURA: This mental link lasts for an hour. That's the only thing. 
TRAVIS: Sure. But people talk when they're not paying attention to someone that's on the inside. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I would say, I think it makes sense for some of us to get captured. I don't know-- 
SAM: That's high risk. 
MARISHA: I don't want to know what they would do if Imogen got captured. 
SAM: Oh god. 
TALIESIN: I can't think of that ever working out for me. 
LAURA: Getting captured? 
TALIESIN: Especially splitting up and getting captured. 
TRAVIS: Well, let's just call it out, then. I'm kind of volunteering. I could be a distraction, in a worst case scenario. Just in case we get in there. 
ASHLEY: I could, too. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I could, too. 
TRAVIS: There are some of us who are the teeniest bit, expendable's a really shitty word, but let's call it malleable. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I think I could be a part of Team Malleable. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. We're real flexible. 
LIAM: Options. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Options. 
ASHLEY: It's a good thing to keep an open mind about. 
MATT: It's about this point-- 
ASHLEY: I don't hate that idea. 
MATT: -- in your mind, Imogen-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MARISHA: Wait, what? What, what, what, what, what? 
MATT: "Quiet! No one move!" You hear the shifting of a rug or carpet over the top of the entryway that you're all in. You can barely hear the sound of about a half dozen footsteps slowly begin to enter. 
TRAVIS: Half dozen? 
MARISHA: How big is this space? 
TRAVIS: Is the hole open in the basement? 
MATT: Where you're in, it's another-- It looks like it might be a storage space, but it's been completely emptied out. It's just an open pit that's 15 by 20 feet that goes underneath the shop to a certain extent. 
LIAM: They're flipping the neighborhood. 
MATT: But you can barely hear the footsteps above-- 
MARISHA: Darkness. 
MATT: -- and silence. 
SAM: You're casting Darkness? 
MATT: In the room? 
LAURA: On us? 
ASHLEY: So they can't see in the pit. 
MATT: (expanding darkness) The pit around you is now suffused in absolute shadow. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, I can't see. 
LAURA: Shh! 
MATT: All you have is the sound of footsteps, and silence. That's where we're going to pick up next episode. (groaning) 
ASHLEY: (anxious groan) 
LAURA: (buzzes lips) 
MATT: We'll see what goes on from here, but we got some leads going towards the Volition. We're in the middle of Kreviris, or at least to the-- 
ASHLEY: We got some good info. 
MATT: -- the top part of Kreviris. 
MARISHA: We got good info! We're getting good shit! 
SAM: Fruitful. It's fruitful. 
MATT: Caeluma Kreviris. But nevertheless, that concludes our evening. Thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much and is it Thursday yet? 
SAM: (wild warbling) 
MATT: Good night.

Cooldown[]
ASHLEY: Oh boy oh boy oh boy.
MARISHA: So wait. Caeluma Kreviris.
SAM: Wait, what does that mean?
LAURA: Caeluma and Vaterra.
SAM: Oh, that's the upstairs and downstairs.
ASHLEY: Caeluma's the upper?
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: Yeah. Caeluma Kreviris is the surface, the upper--
SAM: Overground.
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Then Vaterra is down one more level.
MATT: Vaterra is the subterranean, yeah.
LIAM: Possibly down below.
LAURA: Down below.
TALIESIN: We have seen none of this.
LAURA: I want to shop here.
TALIESIN: So fucking badly.
ASHLEY: I know, I do too.
SAM: What? You want to do?
ASHLEY: I wish we had time to shop.
LAURA: I want to shop here.
TALIESIN: It may not be today, but we are going shopping.
TRAVIS: Is there a name for that scythe?
TALIESIN: We need to kill more people for money. I'm broke.
TRAVIS: The glass-bladed scythe?
MATT: It's a glass-bladed scythe.
TRAVIS: Cool.
SAM: As far as we know.
TALIESIN: You didn't attune to it.
SAM: But wait, did we ask if there's a dress that-- if there's a style of dress here? No, it's all different, right?
MATT: I mean, there's various military garb and most armor and armored pieces you've seen are either crafted or repurposed and mostly belong to members of the military as some sort of militaristic force.
SAM: But citizen garb.
MATT: Citizen garb is very patchwork. It feels very flowy and usually involves a bundled shawl in a hood that's easy to protect yourself from dust storms as they come through.
SAM: Burning Man stuff.
MATT: I mean, kind of, but also in any sort of harsh environment tends to invite a specific kind of garb, especially when it comes to limited resources.
SAM: I'm just planning for in case we need a new outfit.
LAURA: Right.
SAM: Seems like moon 'fit should be good.
MARISHA: You want to go shopping?
LAURA: You just want a moon 'fit.
SAM: I mean, a cool Burning Man outfit for all of us would be pretty awesome.
MATT: If you guys got some time here before you head over to the core of the Volition here, hopefully. If you want to do a little bit of window shopping, grab a couple things.
TALIESIN: There's always time for a shopping episode. How dare you?
MATT: Hell, yeah. Travis, you in?
TRAVIS: Casual shopping while we've got the Treshi scry ball. What could be more responsible?
MARISHA: She's literally circling us like a fucking shark.
ASHLEY: Let me just try on one more thing.
TALIESIN: Well, we can use that to make sure she's always-- We can play a--
SAM: Do you make any custom outfits?
LIAM: It's actually not a bad idea, though, to have a different option depending on the river we're swimming in, the people we're mixing with.
TALIESIN: Very much.
TRAVIS: Yeah, because if we change our clothes, our group disappears entirely.
SAM: If we go in the changing room, she can't get us because she has to wait till we're done.
MATT: That's how it works. That's actually pretty--
TRAVIS: She can look at our feet.
LIAM: I don't know why, but the whole time that you were fixating on that Reilora marionette, I started to hear the Tool song that accompanies that stop motion-- I was imagining this little thing dancing around.
TALIESIN: I cannot wait to see that.
LIAM: All your other little dolls coming out to play.
MARISHA: I figure it's cool, we can maybe take it back and maybe they can do some reverse math on it.
SAM: Subtraction?
MARISHA: Nope.
ASHLEY: Reverse it?
MARISHA: You heard what I said.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to go shopping. I want to talk glass. There's many things indeed.
MARISHA: But if there's some sort of weakness against this, if all of their weapons are based around that shit.
ASHLEY: Learn that, yeah.
MARISHA: That's why I was wondering if you could break down some of the properties, identify.
SAM: I can Identify it, but I fear that it might just be complicated glass.
MARISHA: Cool glass?
LAURA: Cool glass.
TALIESIN: But we take it home, we give it to our smart people. We have smart people back home.
SAM: We got a Percy.
ASHLEY: We got Percy, we got Imahara Joe.
TALIESIN: We have a Joe, we have a Milo. We're swimming in people who are smart who are not here.
MARISHA: I wonder where the fuck Ira is, since he wants to play a little--
SAM: Yeah, why is he being so coy?
MARISHA: --cat and mouse game, little shit.
LAURA: Are we still in?
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's being a little shit.
LIAM: He gets off on it.
LAURA: Did we say "bye"? Or are we still in the episode?
MATT: No, we said bye.
MARISHA: We're in our post run.
LAURA: My brain. I literally have no idea. I'm like, are we still doing--
MARISHA: We're in our cooldown thing.
TALIESIN: Ira had concert tickets, he could only get a few people. He didn't want to make it weird.
MATT: Laura, we still have to shoot tonight.
SAM: Did you study? Did you study for the test? During the game you said something that I wasn't paying attention for. You said the vidulch skull?
LAURA: The vidulch skull is where-- towards the Jagged Edge.
SAM: Is that an area of town?
TALIESIN: Landmark.
MARISHA: He said it was a big sculpture.
LAURA: A landmark. 
MATT: Yeah, there is an actual art piece that signifies the area, but you didn't need to use that  to find it when you would cast Locate Creature.
SAM: Got it, got it.
MATT: So you missed it on the way, but you weren't actually looking for it since you were bee lining it straight to the individual.
SAM: We don't know what a vidulch is.
MATT: You do not.
TALIESIN: We'll find out.
TRAVIS: Vidulch and Gabbana.
TALIESIN: At least it had a skull. That's all we know. We don't know if it still has one.
ASHLEY: Vidulche & Gabbana.
LAURA: That's why I want to go shopping here.
SAM: This is a knockoff.
MARISHA: You got it on the Crumbles, didn't you?
SAM: Vemu? Kemu.com?
MATT: No, the Crumble outlets are kind of rough.
MARISHA: They're really shitty, but they got an AllSaints. Just take your pepper spray.
TRAVIS: How many 20s did we have?
MATT: That was a lot of fucking 20s.
ASHLEY: So many 20s!
TRAVIS: 9, 10 20s?
TALIESIN: You were a monster.
SAM: I rolled one. Matt rolled at least 5.
MATT: I've rolled like dogshit in recent games whenever we had a battle. Today, the planet was like: Here, have a bone. I'm like, Sure. It's just on a fucking skirmish with a handful of guys, but that's fine.
ASHLEY: You get all the bones.
TALIESIN: Karma was just hoping if it gave you enough of them, you'd get sick of it like too many cigarettes--
MATT: Oh, I could never get sick of that.
LAURA: They had big hits, though. The little skirmish had huge hits.
MATT: Yeah, yeah. They took a bigger chunk than I was expecting.
TALIESIN: We had teamwork and I got to use my hammer finally. Thank you, Marisha. That was all I've been waiting for.
MARISHA: That was so fucking cool.
TRAVIS: So what was this thing you guys teed up?
SAM: You can split the spell?
LIAM: His hammer--
LAURA: Yeah, it's a twinned spell effect.
LIAM: --splits magic in half.
TRAVIS: If you directly hit the hammer with a spell? Any spell, or just--
TALIESIN: No, honestly, I don't think you even need my permission. I think you can just shoot at the hammer and it will break off either into two, or if it's a ray it will make two rays.
SAM: Any spell? I could shoot at your hammer?
TALIESIN: As long as it's a spell that has a--
MATT: Has a single target or line.
SAM: Could I heal two people?
TRAVIS: You have to be lined up with an enemy, right?
MATT: That's possible.
TALIESIN: I'd have to be in the line with one of them, but I think I can then bend the other one to wherever I want, or you can--
MATT: But it can only be used once per short rest.
MARISHA: Yeah, once per-- I'll just read it because you sent it to me. "A creature can cast a spell with a single target or a line into the head of this hammer in hopes of splitting it into multiple targets. The caster makes an ability check using their spellcasting modifier. The DC equals 6 plus the spell's level."
LAURA: I could Lightning Bolt on the--
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: So you have to roll above, if it's a 6th level spell--
TALIESIN: I've been offering for ages.
SAM: --I have to roll 12 or above to make it work?
MARISHA: Correct. Adding your spellcasting modifier.
LAURA: I remember we talked about it. I just didn't want to break your--
SAM: Adding my spellcasting modifier?
TALIESIN: It won't break the hammer. If it goes wrong, it just hits me.
SAM: It's a very high likelihood of happening.
MARISHA: Very high.
MATT: It's meant to be a high likelihood, but also a chance that it fails, and if it fails, it targets him instead.
TALIESIN: I take damage.
MARISHA: He gets hit.
SAM: Oh, shit! Yeah, but if I want to do some big thing...
LIAM: His range doesn't have it.
MATT: So a Lightning Bolt would hit and then split into two bolts.
MARISHA: "On a success, a single target spell can instead target two targets within range, or a line spell fork into two lines from the hammer in any direction." Stuff that's a line could be fucking sick.
SAM: I got a line spell.
LAURA: I can't Twin Spell Lightning Bolt?
MATT: No, that's not a target, it's a line spell. This does allow line spells, but also line spells are very specific, so it's--
LIAM: Does he, just rules wise--
ASHLEY: Wait, how do you know it's a line spell?
MARISHA: It will say.
LIAM: Is there a Dex save if it hits him?
MATT: Oh, on this one, if it targets him, I'll say probably not.
LIAM: Probably not. So that means he's going to take full damage, nothing halved, because barbarian rage doesn't do shit to magic.
TALIESIN: Yep.
LIAM: So it's a full blast if he takes it.
MATT: But it's also a decent chance of success.
LIAM: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
MATT: That's high risk, high reward.
LIAM: I'm just putting it all on the table.
TALIESIN: It's how this particular class works, is high risk, high reward.
MARISHA: That would've failed.
MATT: Yep, see, it'll happen.
SAM: I'm going to try.
TALIESIN: Can healing spells go through that or no?
MATT: Yeah. As long as it has a single target.
MARISHA: That's interesting. Healing spells.
MATT: Healing Word in theory could be put through that for two different targets.
ASHLEY: That's very cool.
MARISHA: You can only do it once a short rest, so I think it is good to line something beefy up.
LAURA: You need a twin spell ring. That's what Jester had.
TALIESIN: Oh, those are great. I remember that.
SAM: What does that do?
LAURA: It lets you twin spell.
TRAVIS: Did you catch your coin or let it go to the wind?
SAM: No, I caught my coin.
MATT: Yeah, if it arced off and then he went and grabbed it real fast.
SAM: I'm not going to let my coin--
TRAVIS: Are you sure you actually got your coin? It was a sandstorm. What did you actually grab?
SAM: Oh no! It's just a piece of tinfoil!
LAURA: It's a chocolate coin.
TALIESIN: That kid with the rocking chair is now looking at the coin going, hee-hee!
TRAVIS: Bunch of black hair starts going: "I'm here to haunt you!" 
LAURA: That hair in the water was creepy as balls, by the way.
SAM: She's beautiful, it's beautiful.
LAURA: No, that was creepy.
SAM: I got to talk to her more.
LAURA: "Grudge" shit.
LIAM: I love the landscape here.
SAM: She's the best. 
LIAM: I'd be happy to live here for a while.
TALIESIN: I'm digging the whole vibe, actually. I want to have a little cabin up here.
LIAM: The pod home.
MARISHA: So the pod, the cluster of egg homes with the holes in it? It gives me that--
LAURA: I know. I knew that was going to give you the willies.
MARISHA: Because you get the weird trypto-- yeah, with the holes.
TALIESIN: Tryptophobia.
MARISHA: That's what I think about. The phobia around holes.
TALIESIN: It reminds me of a particular building style that I will find a picture of it. It's that weird half egg style and has windows cut out of it.
TRAVIS: I'm picturing when you blow a straw in milk and it goes (bubbling).
MATT: Parts of it do have that sort of vibe, yeah.
TRAVIS: Good night, guys.
SAM: Good night!
MATT Good night, buddy.
MARISHA: And thus concludes--
MATT: Indeed.
TALIESIN: Travis has struck 12. I guess it's time to go?
MATT: I think that's a pretty good standard sign off.
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Yeah, me too.
