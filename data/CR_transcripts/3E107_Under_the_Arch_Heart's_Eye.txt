Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (garbled) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: Before we get into our episode tonight, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with our sponsor, Thorum, makers of specialty handcrafted wedding bands. Sam. 
SAM: Thorum makes rings, minimalist watches, and now pendant necklaces, featuring unique, unexpected materials. My ring's made out of meteorite. Travis, what about yours? 
TRAVIS: Oh, my ring is made out of Hawaiian koa. 
SAM: Whoa. Laura? 
LAURA: Oh, well, this watch is California redwood. 
SAM: Wow. What about you, Marisha? 
MARISHA: (mumbling) 
SAM: What's that? 
MARISHA: (mumbling) 
SAM: Odd. Anyway, Thorum ships every ring within one business day. Each purchase comes with a ring box and a lifetime warranty. Isn't that right, Marisha? 
MARISHA: (mumbling) 
SAM: All right, what is going on under there? Let's just see it. 
MARISHA: No. (gasping) (laughter) 
SAM: Oh my god! What happened to your face? 
MARISHA: (mumbling) 
SAM: I don't understand, what are you-- 
ROBBIE: Hold on, Sam-- 
LAURA: Why isn't your mouth opening? 
ROBBIE: I think I can translate. Go ahead, go ahead. 
MARISHA: (mumbling) 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, okay, Marisha is saying she had a weird allergic reaction to a knockoff ironwood pendant that she got from a Burning Man DJ. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: Oh. 
ROBBIE: Which has temporarily shrunk her face, of course. And she wishes she'd worn an authentic ironwood pendant from Thorum instead. 
MARISHA: (mumbling and crying) 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah, and now she's saying, in a very intense way, according to Thorum's printable paper ring sizer her mouth is currently a four. 
LAURA: Oh. Yeah. 
SAM: Marisha, oh, oh honey, don't cry. Don't cry with your tiny nose and large lips. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm sure we can fix your tiny face in post. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to say it, I'm going to put it out there. Kind of think it's cute and you're pulling it off. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah, you kind of look like a boss-ass bitch Betty Boop. (laughter) 
MATT: I'm kind of into it, like, really into it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
LIAM: Oh no, no, no. 
ROBBIE: Which means, oh, you guys are the best, and so is Thorum. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
ASHLEY: Wow, wow, wow. 
MARISHA: (mumbling) 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah, and now she's saying whether you need a wedding ring, an anniversary ring. That's totally what she's saying. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Or a ring looks awesome. Head on over to thorum.com and use the code Critical Pole. 
SAM: Critical Pole, that makes sense. 
LAURA: No, no, no, no. (shouting) 
ROBBIE: I'm sorry, "Critical Role." "Role." 
SAM: Thanks for translating, Robbie. Thank you, Tiny Face Marisha. Matt, back to you. 
MATT: Our next sponsor is Insight Editions, featuring their upcoming coloring adventure book, "Critical Role: Fearne Calloway's Fey Fantasy." (cheering) 
MATT: It isn't just your average coloring book. 
ASHLEY: It's so good. 
MATT: It's an interactive journey where you control the story, with stunning line art waiting for your creative touch. You'll guide a young Fearne Calloway through, and Bells Hells actually, through the magical Fey Realm, making choices that shape their quest along the way. It's the perfect way to express yourself and dive deeper into the world of Critical Role. Please don't miss out. It's amazing and super cute. 
ASHLEY: It's really weird. 
MATT: It's really weird. 
ASHLEY: And really cool. 
MATT: As it should be. 
ASHLEY: I am a big fan. 
LIAM: So much fun to make that. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: It's super, super adorable. But "Fearne Calloway's Fey Fantasy" is available for preorder now. 
LAURA: Yay. 
MATT: At Genius. geni.us/criticalrolecoloring. It will be released on November 19th, 2024, little later this year. So grab your copy and let the adventure begins. (cheering) 
MATT: Thank you, Insight Editions, for sponsoring this episode. (whistling and cheering) 
MATT: But Marisha, you're up next. 
MARISHA: Yeah! So this week we dropped a bunch of, like so much, so many announcements, highlighting all of the fall programming we have lined up on Beacon, Twitch, and YouTube, pretty much heading into 2025, which is going to be our 10-year anniversary. 
TRAVIS: What? You're lying. 10 years! 
MARISHA: 10 years, baby, we're old. That includes "The Re-Slayers Take" Season 2, and Campaign 3 of the beloved D&D podcast, "Tales from the Stinky Dragon." (cheering) 
MARISHA: I'm so excited for that one. We're so excited to give these storytellers a new home on Beacon. We're also bringing back Narrative Telephone. That's right, your favorite from the pandemic. Remember that? (laughter)  
MARISHA: And more stories from the Midst Cosmos with "UNEND." There's so much more to come. You can read all about all the details on critrole.com and beacon.tv. Or you can check out our latest "State Of The Role" video over on YouTube from moi. 
TRAVIS: Was that another language? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, yeah, it's German. 
TRAVIS: Oh, for-- Okay. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Okay, but how hot is your eye makeup? 
LAURA: Your eyes look so good. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, they look so good. 
LAURA: We all need tiny faces so that we can get our eye makeup done. 
TRAVIS: The ladies taking care of the ladies. 
ASHLEY: This eyeliner that's happening right here is a really cool touch. 
MARISHA: Yeah, Dre really crushed it. Fun fact. Sam walked into the makeup room when I was getting it done and he was like, "Why do you get makeup?" And I was like, "For your fucking bullshit." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Do you want eye makeup, Sam? Do you want a smokey-- 
SAM: I mean, I won't say no to that. I want to look good. 
ASHLEY: It looks so good. 
TRAVIS: You got stuff on your eye. 
LIAM: Is someone getting attention in here? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) Why is it me? (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Don't you listen to them. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Matt, back to you. 
MATT: Yeah, there we go. That was the cut I was looking for. 
MARISHA: Were you waiting? 
MATT: You just kept talking. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You just didn't shut up. 
MATT: All of you just kept fucking going. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You just got to talk to him. 
MARISHA: You got me. Honey, are you listening? Honey? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Honey. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Back to you. 
MATT: Thank you. Join us December 7th at the Freedom Mortgage Pavilion in Camden, New Jersey just outside of Philadelphia for a Daggerheart Critmas Story Live. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: New Jersey, it's New Jersey. 
MARISHA: Philadelphia. 
LIAM: You're coming to my house! Not literally. 
MATT: No, that we know of, yet. This will be a fun, holiday themed one-shot with all of us here at the table, including myself as the GM, and the wonderful Lenore Riegel, AKA Momlan, serving as our master of ceremonies. 
ASHLEY: Momlan. 
TRAVIS: Love it, I love it. 
MARISHA: Going to be so good. 
MATT: We'll be creating a completely new setting and characters using the final rules of Daggerheart, and VIP ticket holders will get to be part of a 45-minute pre-show where you can contribute suggestions that will affect the story, the world, and the game ahead of the main show. 
ASHLEY: So fun. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
SAM: Liam. Wait, people-- Jersey people are going to be shouting stuff at us? 
TRAVIS: Or Philly people. 
MARISHA: No, no, no. 
MARISHA: No, they'll probably write it down. 
SAM: That's going to be in the show? 
MATT: We got plans. 
MARISHA: Kind of like what we did for the Candela Live show. 
LIAM: (NJ accent) You should be fucking used to it by now! (laughter) 
SAM: (NJ accent) Get off the fucking road! 
MATT: So for tickets and all the details about this event, visit critrole.com/events and hopefully we'll see you there. 
MARISHA: I also have it on high authority that Lenore's already working on her tight five. 
SAM: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: She's already pitching jokes. 
SAM: Yep, yep. 
TRAVIS: I love it. 
SAM: She's so excited about this. 
MARISHA: Yeah, (laughs), she's great. 
MATT: And I believe that concludes our announcements. 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
TALIESIN: Oh, good. 
MATT: With that, let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off, Bells Hells, after being-- (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: What is happening over here? 
LAURA: I'm freaking out. 
ASHLEY: I know, we're freaking out. 
LAURA: I'm scared. 
MATT: It's like nothing's dangerous at all in the middle of the table. Everything's going to be fine. Bells Hells, after receiving formal titles from the Voice of the Tempest amongst the many movers and shakers of Exandria who are gathered in the center of Vasselheim to decide how to tackle the threat of Ludinus, the Vanguard, and all that seems to be emerging dangerously from the red moon, Ruidus. You all heard word that one of Ludinus's simulacrum is traveling with the Sorrowlord Zathuda to connect with the Unseelie Court for some semblance of an additional plot that hadn't been considered. Gathering your things, you all went and headed out to the Fey Realm, meeting up with Nana Morri. There in the Ligament Manor you gathered your thoughts, your plans, and set out to the Shrine of Gilded Gifts, an abandoned temple in the center of an abandoned Fey city where this meeting was to take place. As you carefully infiltrated the surroundings of this temple, you caught the arrival of both the dark fey Unseelie emissary and its surrounding guard and Ludinus, the Sorrowlord, and his terrifying dragon, Gloamglut. After quietly, with the aid of, by the way, Ira Wendagoth, the Nightmare King, of who you called from his hiding spot on Ruidus to help you, you quietly wiped out the entirety of the exterior guard without being noticed, and upon surrounding the exterior of the massive temple grounds, immediately brought to life, the stone statue of the Arch Heart in the middle of this Arch Heart temple to distract them. In that chaos, Fearne, you rushed in and turned one of the two central pillars of this temple floor into mud, which both cracked some of the structural foundation of this temple and left two of the three emissary figures from the Unseelie currently held and restrained within the now muck filled quicksand floor. As Gloamglut, the Sorrowlord, and Ludinus's simulacrum currently finish figuring out what is happening and turning in your direction as you spin to flee, the rest of you on the outskirts of this temple, either the front door or in this case, Imogen and Laudna, who are in an upper floor looking in through a series of visual slits in the stone. We come to roll initiative. (anxious clamoring) 
LAURA: That fast, huh? 
LIAM: Because we thought the dragon was this big, but then it was this big. 
LAURA: Because it was much bigger and this room is big. 
MARISHA: We thought the statue was this big, and it turns out, it's this big. 
LIAM: It was this big. 
LAURA: This big, yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: That's a shit roll. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Shit roll! 
LIAM: Ooh, me too. I can't roll any more. 
SAM: Shit roll. 
MARISHA: All right, all right. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, correct. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Discount code, shit roll. 
TALIESIN: Dot com. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: The dice just melt. 
LIAM: Real low. Maybe my lowest of the campaign. 
MATT: Oh man. 
MARISHA: Oh, is that the resin ones? 
TRAVIS: Resin. 
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no! 
ROBBIE: Can I smell your dice? 
LAURA: You cursed yourself. 
MATT: All righty. So 25 to 20. 
LAURA: Nope. 
TRAVIS: Oh good. Good, good good, good good. We just pack it in now. 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
MARISHA: 18. 
SAM: 17. 
ASHLEY: Okay.

LAURA: Oh, good. Laudna's first. 
TRAVIS: Laudna.

MARISHA: Sorry, sorry. I got distracted by how bad that is. Who? 
TRAVIS: Laudna. Two 17s. What's your dex, Braius? 
SAM: It's one, plus one. 
LIAM: We do Rollies here. 
TRAVIS: Oh, so I'm ahead of you. Okay. I'm two. 
TALIESIN: Chet-- 
ASHLEY: So, Laudna, Chet, Braius. 
TRAVIS: Laudna, Chet, Braius. 
TALIESIN: And then, Ashton. 
ASHLEY: Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh wait. What are you? 
TALIESIN: 15. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm 15, too. 
LAURA: Rollies. 
TALIESIN: Rollies. 
MATT: So, we have? 
TRAVIS: Laudna, Chet, Braius. I'm sorry. Laudna, Chet, Braius. 
TALIESIN: 13. 
ASHLEY: You're probably going to go ahead. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Ashton, Fearne. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Ashton, Fearne. 
MATT: Hold on. Ashton, what was yours? 
ROBBIE: What'd you guys say? 
MATT: Ashton, what was your initiative? 
SAM: 15, 15. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Braius, Ashton. 
ASHLEY: Fearne. 
MATT: Ashton, what was your initiative? 
TALIESIN: 15. 
SAM: 15. 
MATT: 15. Okay. Then after you was? 
ASHLEY: I was 15 as well. 
SAM: 15. 
MATT: 15 as well. All righty. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: So it was Ashton and then Fearne. Sorry. I'm having to do a lot of initiatives here as well. What was the next one after Fearne? 
ROBBIE: 14. 
MATT: 14. Okay. What's your dexterity? 
ROBBIE: Plus four. 18. 
MATT: 18 dexterity? 
ROBBIE: Well-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Great, yeah. Okay. Here we go. 
MARISHA: Okay. Who was after Fearne? 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Dorian. 
LAURA: Dorian's after Fearne. I rolled an eight. 
TALIESIN: Something bad. 
LIAM: Me too. 
TALIESIN: Oh. Rollies? 
LIAM: Rollies. 
LAURA: Yeah. Oh. 
TALIESIN: Rollies. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I got two. 
LAURA: Jesus Christ. 
MATT: All right, so-- 
LIAM: Doing good. 
LAURA: So he's-- 
TRAVIS: Is that the first time you've been last? 
LIAM: Yes. This is the worst initiative. 
LAURA: No. Well, he's not last. I'm now last. 
LIAM: Because of Rollies? What'd you get? 
LAURA: Because of Rollies. I rolled a three. 
LIAM: I rolled a two. 
LAURA: No, in Rollies. You rolled a 17. 
LIAM: I rolled that. That's what I Rollies. 
LAURA: Sweet! 
LIAM: Dead last. First in the campaign. 
MATT: This is the first time in the campaign you've been last. 
LIAM: I have advantage-- 
LAURA: Wow. 
LIAM: -- on initiative, with a plus five to my roll. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Welcome to the boot. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: The caboose. 
MATT: Incredible. 
LIAM: It's going to go great, guys. It's going to go great. 
MATT: It's going to be fine. 
LIAM: There's so much map on the table. 
MATT: So to that point. 
TRAVIS: Oh man. 
MATT: Laudna. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: You're up first. 
MARISHA: Fantastic! 
ROBBIE: F-f-f. 
MATT: You currently-- We had you out here. 
LAURA: Marisha was hitting a tiny face when we discussed our plan. So you-- 
MARISHA: I got the TL;DR. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: I had you out here just for a reference at the end of last episode. But really, you are on a secondary floor looking in from there. But you're over in this area from the outside of the temple. 
MARISHA: Did you say just try and get in? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. I still have Spider Climb up. 
MATT: You do. 
MARISHA: So, first things first. I'm the realest. (laughter) 
MATT: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: I am going-- (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Shit, go on. Oh boy. 
MARISHA: Damn it! 
LAURA: You've got this. 
MARISHA: I am going to-- 
MATT: Chetney on deck. 
LIAM: See, the Orym seat is not fun. 
LAURA: No. It's not. 
LIAM: Because you don't know what to do. 
MARISHA: Cast Mirror Image on myself. 
MATT: Okay. Mirror Image is up on you. 
MARISHA: Okay. And then-- 
MATT: I'll put this blue tag on you to represent the Mirror Image. 
MARISHA: I'm going to bonus action Form of Dread. 
MATT: (dreadful transformation) Describe to me how your Form of Dread now appears with the current dynamic between you and Delilah. 
MARISHA: I haven't thought about this at all. Okay. It's like-- Because Laudna is super domme right now, So, it's full spooky Victorian ghost realness-- 
TRAVIS: Nope. I hate it. I hate it. 
MARISHA: -- but her own version that's less influenced by Delilah. So it's like, if Laudna was-- 
TALIESIN: Tiny mouth. 
TRAVIS: My number one worst thing. 
MATT: More creepy Victorian banshee? 
MARISHA: Yeah, creepy Victorian banshee. 
MATT: Got it. Awesome. 
LAURA: I love it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Absolute worst, number one fear. 
MARISHA: Basically what I looked like in the Travis Spooktacular. 
MATT: Gotcha. Great. 
MARISHA: Remember that? 
MATT: I do. 
MARISHA: It's that. 
MATT: All righty. So that's your bonus action and your action. You want to stay put or you want to move? 
MARISHA: Can I skitter inside and like-- Because I can-- Can I see everything pretty clearly from here? 
MATT: Between the slit, you can see this are here-- 
LAURA: But I also opened up a hole, remember? 
MATT: That's right, you did. So yeah, you actually have a pretty decent view from up here. 
MARISHA: If I can't see anything, then I'll just stay put. How long is that going to last? 
LAURA: Forever. 
MATT: She carved a hole. 
MARISHA: Oh, I thought it was a magic-- (magical vibes) Okay, yeah. Then I'll just stay put right here. Especially if we're-- 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'll stay put right here. 
MATT: You got it. Laudna, that finishes your go. Chetney, you're up, with Braius on deck. 
TRAVIS: So I'm still up. 
MATT: You're in your wolven form and you're technically right outside the front of that, where that walkway ends. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm going to roll in, and I'm going to come down the walkway as far as possible. 
MATT: Movement is-- 
TRAVIS: I've got 40 feet. 
MATT: 40 feet of movement. That'll get you just past where Fearne is. 
TRAVIS: I'll actually stop right at Fearne. 
MATT: Right at Fearne? Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, it lasts for an hour. The hole lasts for an hour. 
MATT: Got it. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to stop right at Fearne and I'm going to reach into the bag of holding. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to pull out Ludinus's notes that we snagged from his room when we found the harness with the funnel-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- and that little thing of notes. I'm going to hand her Ludinus's notes and say: Use this. You know what to do. I'll hand it to her and I'm going to dip-- 
ASHLEY: What the fuck are you giving me this for? 
TRAVIS: I'm going to dip inside-- 
LAURA: We got mind talk still. 
TRAVIS: -- the doorway. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, All mind talk stuff. 
SAM: Are you invisible? 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: Are you doing the scratchy scratch? 
TRAVIS: But I'm going to go inside the doorway with the remainder of the feet. 
ASHLEY: Stuff it in my pouch. 
TALIESIN: No scratchy scratch? 
MATT: Okay, so you move over to the gate. 
TRAVIS: What is that? 
LAURA: The brand. 
TALIESIN: Putting a brand. 
MATT: Ashley, could you move-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: -- him 20 feet this way-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. 
MATT: -- into the room? 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes. 
SAM: I can do it. 
MATT: Thank you, Sam. 
TALIESIN: Is that a bonus action? 
MATT: Right there is good, yeah. 
TRAVIS: I am going to-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: As I leave her, I'm going to hit her-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: With my claw. I'm going to flick. I'm going to reach around and pull down the collar-- 
LAURA: (laughs) You're going to flick? 
TRAVIS: -- on the back of her neck. 
ASHLEY: I just put a tit out. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: I'm going to pull the back over her dress, her collar down, and going to slice across the back of her neck and I'm going to cast Brand of Castigation on Fearne. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: What that do? What that do? 
TRAVIS: Which, it just happens. "Once per long or short rest, whenever you damage a creature with a weapon that has an active rite," which I do, "you can sear an arcane brand into that creature. The brand has the following features: You always know the direction of the creature." Blah, blah blah, blah blah. Other stuff. So I'm going to use it and I will-- 
LIAM: Sick. 
TRAVIS: -- roll to hit you. 
ASHLEY: (giggly) Ow! 
TRAVIS: Sorry. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good! One plus-- 
TALIESIN: Just little prick. 
TRAVIS: -- six for the Crimson Rite, so that's seven plus six. 13 points of damage, unfortunately. 
MATT: 13 points of damage to you, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. That's okay. 
TRAVIS: On the back of your neck, you feel this (scorching sizzle) burning brand into your back that says C-POP Industries. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yes! (laughter) 
MATT: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Actually, no. It'll just be a rocking horse. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Just a rocking horse. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: It sounds like 
LAURA: It sounds like Pop Rocks popping. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: (popping crackles) 
ASHLEY: Ow, ow, ow, ow. 
TRAVIS: I'll tuck inside where I-- 
MATT: Right, I have you right there. 
ASHLEY: 13 points of damage, you said? 
TRAVIS: 13. 
MATT: All right. You got it. 
MATT: Cool. That finishes your go. That brings us to Braius. 
SAM: So Chetney is fast and small. Does it look like anyone saw him go in there? Can I see people? 
LAURA: He's a wolf. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Yeah, he's in wolf form. 
TRAVIS: And I'm not stealthing. 
SAM: Does it look like people can see him? 
MATT: You're uncertain. 
LAURA: But the dragon, at the end of the last game, the dragon did look down at Fearne. 
MATT: It looked down into the hallway. 
SAM: Oh, so it's looking down the hall. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: So it already knows that there are other people in the hall with her. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. There's these rooms on the side, there's no other windows or anything, ways in, are there? 
MATT: There are on the sides, there's little windows you can climb in. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Wherever you see them on this. 
LAURA: Wait, you could climb in from a window? 
MATT: You can climb into the outer hallway, but you couldn't look inside the actual central-- 
LAURA: Got it, got it, got it. I was like: (groans). 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: You don't see inside of it. 
LAURA: So there's nothing on this chamber. 
MATT: Correct. There's still that outer hallway. 
LAURA: Got it. 
SAM: (sighs) Shit. 
MATT: What you got, Braius? 
SAM: I mean, I don't want to fuck anything up, but I kind of want to do what Chetney did. Can I use my movement to dash on in right past Fearne? 
LAURA: You can go into this window and you'd end up in this room. 
SAM: If I could go into the window and get close. But there's no door in there, is there? 
TRAVIS: How about this one. You mean this one? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: But that one does. 
ASHLEY: That one there. 
MATT: You'd have to go around to-- 
SAM: Can I get in there? 
MATT: It's actually faster to go through the front, but if you go around the side, you go through the window and you're in the side. You can probably get out of-- What's your movement? 
SAM: It's 30, but I think either way I have to use 30 plus something else to get into that side room. 
MATT: Probably, yeah. 
SAM: Even if I went down the hall. 
MATT: Correct. Either way. 
SAM: Yeah. So, I'm going to go outside. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Movement 30. Action, dash. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: To climb in through the window to get in there. 
MATT: Okay. 
MATT: Where do you want to be placed then? 
SAM: Opposite of Chetney. 
MATT: Opposite Chetney. Okay. 
SAM: Then bonus action-- Even closer to the door. 
LAURA: There's a thing there. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Bonus action-- 
LAURA: You're tangled in grass! 
SAM: Bonus action, I will inspire Fearne by telling her: I couldn't help myself last night. I painted a painting of you. 
ASHLEY: You did? 
SAM: I did. It's really good. Here, can I show you? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: To inspire you. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MATT: (surprised laugh) 
SAM: I was supposed to paint one for Chetney, but I-- The brush just made you. I'm so sorry. 
ASHLEY: That is-- 
LAURA: Is that what 
LAURA: your paintings look like? 
SAM: It's just-- 
ASHLEY: It is so stunning! 
SAM: You're stunning. Okay. Go, go, go, go. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
SAM: Here, take it! 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
SAM: No. Later. We'll do this later. Go! 
ASHLEY: Wow! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What the heck? That's so cool! Wow! I feel amazing. 
MATT: You are definitely inspired. You can take your-- 
ASHLEY: I'm so inspired. 
MATT: -- take your d6 inspiration die. 
ASHLEY: What do I take, a d6? Okay. Oh wow. You guys are putting so much confidence in me. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Braius, that finishes your go? 
SAM: Yes. That's all I can do. 
LIAM: Is there a whole frame store by your feet right now? 
SAM: Maybe. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That is so cool. 
MATT: Next up is going to be Ludinus's simulacrum. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) Ludinus, okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yep. Making a note. 
LAURA: No, no, no. 
LIAM: Oh, he's at the top. He's near the top. 
MATT: You guys didn't roll crazy initiative. You still got a few ahead of him, but. He's going to-- 
LAURA: ♪ Oh no ♪ ♪ Oh no, oh no ♪ 
ROBBIE: He hops like that too when he goes. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Oh no ♪ 
LAURA: He's Raygun? 
LIAM: He knows what's up. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: He prances? 
LAURA: What is he doing? He's getting up next to the dragon. 
LIAM: They already caught wise to us? 
MATT: He steps over to that space and glances up over after everyone shifts and turns around and sees the dragon look down. He steps around the central platform and glances in. "Interesting. Hold tight," and points his fingers. 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no. 
LIAM: Time to do it. 
ROBBIE: Got the ruler out. 
LIAM: You be nice. 
MATT: Yep. That'll do it. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: I need you, Fearne, to roll a constitution-- 
TRAVIS: Who's this? Who's casting? Who this? 
MATT: Actually, no. Sorry. 
LAURA: It's Ludinus! 
MATT: What's your hit points currently? 
ASHLEY: My-- 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
SAM: Oh, there's no save. 
LAURA: Oh no. Is this Finger of Death? 
MATT: What's your current hit points? 
LAURA: Are you doing Finger of Death? 
ASHLEY: They are 77? 
MATT: Your current hit points are 77? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. You are stunned. 
LAURA: Oh, it's Power Word Stun. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: He looks over towards you and goes, and says a phrase in Elvish that you don't understand, but the minute your brain receives it, your whole body is racked with a flash of pain and-- 
MARISHA: I Counterspell it! 
MATT: You Counterspell it? 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: Can you? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh, because she's right there! 
LAURA: It gives away our location, but. 
MATT: Okay. What's your range? 
LAURA: I mean, maybe. 
MARISHA: Well, theoretically-- 
TRAVIS: If she's stunned, then the whole thing-- 
MATT: 60 feet, right? goes out the window. Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: (exhales) Ooh. 
MATT: Oh, he is just in range. 
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh! 
ROBBIE: Yay! 
MATT: Now-- 
TRAVIS: It might not work. It might now work. 
MATT: Now mind you, it's an 8th-level spell. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
TRAVIS: 8th-level?! 
MATT: Power Word Stun is an 8th-level spell. 
TRAVIS: He's a snow cone! 
MATT: So roll to see if you can-- 
MARISHA: So we're rolling, I'm rolling no matter what. If I cast at a higher level, it doesn't matter because we're still rolling, right? 
MATT: Well-- 
SAM: You also didn't say it. 
MATT: You also didn't say it. So I assume it's base level Counterspell unless you say at what level. 
MARISHA: Fine, fine. Fine fine. Fine. 
MATT: So, yeah. So you just-- 
SAM: There's no save on this, right? 
MATT: There's no save. If they're under a certain hit point threshold, they're just stunned. 
SAM: Why are your hit points so low? 
TRAVIS: What's the spell? What's he casting? 
MATT: Power Word Stun. 
TRAVIS: Power Word Stun. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Well, it's under 100 points, right? Is that Power-- 
MATT: Under 150. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: 150?! 
ASHLEY: Wow. I wouldn't have had a chance. 
TRAVIS: That's massive. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. I wouldn't have had a chance. 
TRAVIS: That's massive. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that shit's mean. Power Word's mean. 
ASHLEY: That's dirty. 
MATT: All the Power Words are mean. 
MARISHA: What do I have to mean? 
ASHLEY: ♪ Gonna get dirty ♪ 
MATT: Well, you have to roll to-- 
TRAVIS: "All the Power Words are mean." 
MATT: Let me make sure. 
ROBBIE: I love it when he sounds so confident. 
TRAVIS: There's just enough number of years in between our encountering Power Words to forget. 
MATT: So you roll and add your spell modifier, which is charisma, right? So you roll and add your charisma. You're trying to beat an 18. It's 10 plus the spell's level. 
MARISHA: Ten plus the spell's level. 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: (mumbled) Guidance? 
MARISHA: Just my charisma modifier? I'm just adding my charisma modifier? My spell... 
MATT: No, just your charisma modifier. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. So you got to roll a 13. 
MARISHA: 13 or higher. 
MATT: Yep. 
ROBBIE: You could do it. 
MARISHA: I hate this. I always hate this. 
ROBBIE: You got it. Come on back! 
MARISHA: Come on, come on, come on. 
ROBBIE: Let's go. Done. It's done. 
TRAVIS: 13 or higher, 13 or higher. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
ROBBIE: It's done! I've got the strength of Beau on my hands. 
ROBBIE: You already did it! 
TRAVIS: (screams) Yes! 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! Let's fucking go! 
ASHLEY: What is it? 
TRAVIS: 15! 
MARISHA: 20 total. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: That's a 15. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. That's the whole plan. 
MARISHA: It's my eye makeup. 
MATT: Right. 
ASHLEY: It's her eye makeup. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Because he isn't aware of your presence, he does not have the ability to Counterspell. I won't let him because normally he would Counterspell your Counterspell. 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
MATT: But he was unaware of your presence. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: He goes and releases the word as it begins to strike into you. Suddenly the spells unravel and he goes-- 
LIAM: Dope, dope, dope. 
MATT: And glances up-- 
LAURA: Oh no! He sees us now. 
MATT: -- and sees both of you up through the hole immediately. 
MARISHA: I look like a Victorian ghost in a window-- 
MATT: You do. 
MARISHA: -- I'm just like. (laughter) 
MATT: And someone who looks like Liliana going. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: In a window perfectly tall and in frame. 
MARISHA: Perfectly framed, yeah. Exactly. 
ROBBIE: Just like-- (laughter) 
MATT: Oh! (laughter) 
MARISHA: I look like a bad effect in a London dark history crawl. 
MATT and ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: So with that, as the spell fizzles, he like-- 
ASHLEY: Jelly fishing. 
MATT: Yeah. He flicks his hand, his good hand and looks up and says, "It seems we're being ambushed." And that's going to end his turn. 
LIAM: We are the realest. 
MATT: Ash, you're up first, with Fearne on deck. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: If you can call it a plan. 
TALIESIN: So. 
MATT: You're about here underneath the ground. (rumbling scrapes) 
TALIESIN: Psychically, I'm going to be asking about exactly how much quicksand is in this room and where it's sitting. Vaguely, since I obviously can't see it yet, but how much of this floor is soft? 
MATT: You're uncertain. You haven't seen it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. But, like. I'm sure I'm getting a general... 
ASHLEY: It's a 40-foot cube. 
MATT: A quick one. 
TALIESIN: All right, well. 
MATT: A 40-foot cube. 
TALIESIN: All right. 40-foot cube somewhere around here. That's fine. I'm diving in. I'm straight ahead and I'm towards the angle, and I'm going to go 40 feet to begin with. 
MATT: From where you are? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if I can, and gently I'm just going to be watching the scene where the break in the floor is. 
MATT: You glide through and then (scrapes)-- 
TALIESIN: Right there? 
MATT: -- emerge here. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm not emerging yet. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm figuring out where it is. 
MATT: There is a heavy section of muck right above you. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So how far down does it go, out of curiosity. 
MATT: Best that you can tell here, you have to coast to figure out. But you've now entered-- There's 10, 15 feet of this muck right above you can swim through. Which, from what she told you, means there's another 25 feet before it comes. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So I'm going to keep going into the edge of-- I'm going to take my 40 feet and go to the edge of the muck. 
MATT: This is your 40 feet here. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that is 40 feet right there. All right, I'm going to dash for my second movement and I'm going to go to the edge of it, peek out and get a sense of where that column is. 
MATT: Okay. Over here? 
TALIESIN: Can I see the column? 
MATT: From here, yes. You peek out and first thing you do is you (vacuous sucking) look up from underneath the ground. You see the massive form of Gloamglut, its tail thrashing as it's now getting low, and you see it lowering its head in the center of the tunnel, staring towards Fearne. On its back, you see Sorrowlord Zathuda is holding onto the reins. As Ludinus shouts, looks over and follows his gaze up to see the window where your two friends currently have been made eye contact with. The two other guardians of the emissary and one of the guardians, are both restrained in the muck. 
TALIESIN: So, last question. I can swing my hammer underground, right? 
MATT: You can. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going back under. I'm going to use the rest of my movement. Now that I know where the column is, I'm going to start dashing towards that column back under it. 
MATT: Mind you, what I will say is swinging-- because your hammer is not affected by this. Any attacks you make are going to be with disadvantage because you're having to fight through the actual rock and stone. 
TALIESIN: I'm into it. 
MATT: All right. So that's 20 feet this way and another 20 feet you get about there. 
TALIESIN: Straight there. Yep. That'll do it. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: There's more room. 
MATT: That finishes your go. Fearne, you're up, with Dorian on deck. 
TALIESIN: I was also-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Here it is. 
MARISHA: You got shit. Come on. 
TRAVIS: You got it! You got it! 
ASHLEY: All right, so. 
TALIESIN: You're going to have to-- 
MARISHA: Here we go. 
ASHLEY: Getting there. Getting the papers from Chet. Like, okay. I guess it's now or never. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I got to go talk to Dad. I'm going to turn around and I'm going to start walking back into the chamber. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Fuck it. I'm going to walk through. I'm going to scream, "Daddy!" 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: We need to talk! 
MATT: Give me your mini, please. 
LAURA: (squeals) 
MATT: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: Ludinus is lying to you and he is betraying you. Get me out of here! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (shouts) Get me out! 
TRAVIS and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Make a deception check for me. Or, I mean, the context to this... 
LAURA: Persuasion. It could be persuasion. 
SAM: It could be. 
ASHLEY: I'm not lying. 
MATT: Well, you know he dislikes him, but you do not know if there's ever an intent to necessarily deceive. 
LAURA: He has done stuff to Fey creatures. 
MATT: He has. 
TRAVIS: The persuasion would be, "take me." 
ASHLEY: Take me with you. 
TRAVIS: "Get me out of here." 
MATT: Okay, so. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Or could be. 
MATT: All right. So, this is not trying to convince him that Ludinus is against him. This is just convincing him to listen to you and take you with him. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Get me out of here. 
MATT: Okay, I'll allow you to do persuasion for that. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Ooh baby! 
MATT: But he is not-- we'll see where any of this goes. Because right now (laughs), this is a bit of a tangle. 
ASHLEY: It's a bit of a tangle. This is a bit of a tangle. Okay. Oh god. 
LAURA: (laughs) In a box here just says: "Spreading my legs." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: He said it, and I was like. 
LAURA: I'm writing it down. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to use it. 
SAM: Spread your legs. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Just let it fly. 
ASHLEY: I'm ready to see the world. Just spreading my legs. 
TRAVIS: Where it belongs. 
MATT: You know, one of these days, I'm going to Homer Simpson into oblivion and it's going be so nice. 
TRAVIS: Yep, yep. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: 24. 
MARISHA: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Ho! 
TRAVIS: It's the little mouth on her nose. 
TALIESIN: The little Victorian doll just make that noise. 
TRAVIS: It has a little mouth. It's all pent up. 
MARISHA: I thought other people would celebrate with me, but they didn't. 
ASHLEY: I'm not out-- 
TRAVIS: We don't know what it means. 
ASHLEY: Also, to who I think is the emissary: (shouts) He's betraying you, too! 
SAM: Oh Jesus. 
ASHLEY: Get out of here safely! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: You've spent your round talking to your father. 
ASHLEY: Okay, fine! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Let's just see what I can throw out. 
MATT: No. Fair enough. 
ASHLEY: Uppies! 
MATT: So. (laughter) 
MATT: You can shout to the emissary, but the emissary is currently trying to get out of this, and-- 
LAURA: "Oh jeez. You stuck me in mud." 
MATT: All kinds of crazy stuff is happening. All right. So, your father hears this and he's still helmeted. You don't see any physical reaction at all. What you do see is Gloamglut, the head still lowered, the front of its mouth opens up and that dark fire energy... 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: It is starting to billow within its throat. That finishes your movement and your action. Do you have a bonus action as well or is that your turn? 
LAURA: Oh, you should have guided yourself. 
SAM: Shit. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
SAM and LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Well, knowing... Can I see Gloamglut getting ready? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Doing this? 
MATT: It's like watching a plasma cannon beginning to charge up. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to stop and I'm just going to take a knee. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: And just look at him. Like, no harm here. 
MATT: Okay. Dorian, your turn. 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. 
SAM: You should Guidance yourself. 
ROBBIE: I'm still outside. All right. I got 40 feet of movement. I'll use it to get in and the most direct route to whatever's this noise going in. 
MATT: It's about 20 feet to get into. You have ten more feet. You can get into that hallway, if you'd like to. 
ROBBIE: Okay, I'll get into the hallway. So, like where-ish? (pitter patters) 
MATT: A little bit further that way. About there is where you are with 30 feet. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. You can't see anything either? 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: You can see Fearne kneeling and see the thrashing of Gloamglut's tail as its claws get down on the ground and you see its mouth open. (ominous charging-up) The light getting brighter, as Fearne is kneeling in the face of it. 
ROBBIE: Oh my god! So, it's clear there's an attack coming. 
LIAM: About to hit you. 
TALIESIN: Yep. It's about. It's about to hit you with something real hard. 
SAM: Maybe not. Maybe not. 
LAURA: Maybe not. 
MARISHA: It could be like-- 
LAURA: Daddy's going to stop it from happening. I believe in Daddy. 
MARISHA: -- yank the reins. 
ROBBIE: Imminent danger, smooshed. Oh my god. Knee-jerk reaction. Oh, this is so stupid. I'm going to cast. I'm going to cast. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I have to make sure I can Dispel it. It's scary. 
LIAM: This is a journey. 
ROBBIE: I'll cast Forcecage around Fearne immediately because I don't want her to get one shot and killed by the dragon. 
SAM: Does that protect against things? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. It can't let any matter or any anything. 
SAM: But Forcecage is huge. 
ROBBIE: I know, but I'm about to watch my friend get melted by a dragon. 
SAM: Yeah. Absolutely. 
LAURA: You're about to be melted by a dragon. 
LIAM: It could also act like a cork in that hallway, maybe, and protect you guys. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 
LAURA: Oh that's true. It is big. 
ROBBIE: Is it that big? 
MATT: Forcecage-- 
LIAM: It can be that that big or smaller. 
MATT: It can be smaller if you want to. I'm just saying, it looks like this strange, immaterial cage that surrounds them. 
SAM: 15 feet will block the whole... 
LIAM: It's big and latticework or it's small, tight and plain. 
MATT: So, we can use this. 
MARISHA: Yeah. That's fine. 
ROBBIE: That's kind of what I'm thinking. 
TALIESIN: Oh, it's a nice plug. Look at that. 
ROBBIE: Save my friend. Yeah. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Kind of saves everybody. That's pretty cool. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MARISHA: I actually like it. I like it. 
ASHLEY: Cool, cool, cool. 
ROBBIE: You're in trouble. 
SAM: Just moving forward. Can she see and hear things in there? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: You just can't get through. 
LIAM: None of us can go through. 
LAURA: She's trapped in and they can't get to her. 
LIAM: Right. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: You finish casting Forcecage. That's your movement, your bonus action. 
ROBBIE: I know. 
MATT: Anything? You good? 
SAM: How do you know so much Forcecage? 
ROBBIE: I know. Then-- 
MATT: You can just barely see Chetney and Braius along the, just inside the two further hallways, against the side of the opening, waiting. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
LIAM: It's a hobby of mine. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Then I'll say: I'm sorry to put you in a cage. I know you wanted to spread your legs and be free. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Don't put her in a box. 
ROBBIE: But you're doing great so far, I think. Then I'll give her my Bardic Inspiration as well, because they can-- 
MATT: Okay. Well, she already spent his. 
ROBBIE: You already spent it? 
ASHLEY: I spent it. 
ROBBIE: Okay. Then I'll give you mine. 
MATT: Which is a d-- 
ROBBIE: Right now it's a 10. 
MATT: 10. d10. 
SAM: You probably did that before you cast the Forcecage, right? 
ROBBIE: Oh, I can't-- Oh, does it count as a spell? 
SAM: No, no, no. I mean, it's fine. It's just, I think it can't go through the Forcecage. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
MATT: Well, it's not a directed-- I'd say because the inspiration comes from within-- 
SAM: Oh great! 
MATT: And also Forcecage, since you're casting it in this scenario, I'll say for the purposes of permeability, because you're the one who said it, not an opponent, you're not trying to prevent your own inspiration from getting through. I'll allow that to pass. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
ROBBIE: Thanks for the gift-- 
SAM: Amazing. 
ROBBIE: -- in my poor order of operations. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: No worries, dude. That's how it goes. 
TRAVIS: How often do you cast Forcecage, I mean. 
ASHLEY: That's a 10. 
MATT: Right. 
SAM: It's a 10. 
ROBBIE: When your friends get melted-- 
ASHLEY: It just looks like an eight. 
ROBBIE: -- by a fucking dragon. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That is the biggest dragon-- 
MATT: Your turn finishes. 
TALIESIN: -- I think I've ever fucking seen. 
MATT: It's now Gloamglut's go. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: The energy (crackling) is forming up inside the mouth, and you watch as the Sorrowlord, looking down, seeing this cage there, pulls up on the reins and Gloamglut fires dark flames that go above where the cage is and arcs across the ceiling-- 
LAURA: Ugh-oh. 
ASHLEY: He does love me. 
MATT: -- over to where the two of you are standing. 
LAURA: Ruh-roh. 
MATT: (roaring flame) 
MARISHA: That's okay, that's okay, that's okay, that's okay. 
LAURA: Well, you know. 
MATT: I need both of you-- 
MARISHA: That's fine. 
MATT: -- Imogen and Laudna, to roll a dexterity saving throw for me. Because you are both partially, you have half cover because you're in this area here, you have plus two to your dexterity saving throw. 
MARISHA: Okay. Plus two. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay okay. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: We got two witches in a hole and one in a box. 
SAM and LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: What the fuck? 
TRAVIS: Fucking buy some lottery tickets. 
TALIESIN: What? 
MARISHA: She's not fucking kidding, man. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: What do I do next? 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Boom. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: So, you take 16 points of fire damage. 
TRAVIS: Dark fire. 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: Would that hit my Mirror Image or--? 
MATT: It is just a blast. It's not an attack roll, so I don't think so. 
MARISHA: So, no. Okay. 16. 
TRAVIS: Does the fire have any other effects besides just getting burned? Necrotic or anything? 
MATT: Not that you know of. 
TRAVIS: Not that we know of. Okay. 
LAURA: (like Audrey) 24. 
MATT: 24. You also take 16 points of fire damage. It carves through the ceiling. You see all the beautiful carvings and artwork, that ivy and vine, somewhat cluttered and covered spaces get charred in a line across and you see the stone glowing with the heat from its impact as it burns into the hole that you've made. You both just barely get out of the way to not take the full brunt of it, but it still blasts you to the ground and you have to pat yourself out for a second as the beam comes to a close. With that, it's going to pull up on the reins a bit and Gloamglut is going to go ahead and-- 
LIAM: Oh, it's moving. 
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh my god. 
ROBBIE: Oh god. 
MATT: It's going to turn around here and fly up to face that side. 
LIAM: Oh, that's precarious! 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
LIAM: Can you use your hand to show us how high is the roof in this joint? 
MATT: It's about this tall. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So he's right at the top-- 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
MATT: -- at the peak of it. That's going to finish Gloamglut's go. Oh, you know what? 
TRAVIS: That thing looks so awesome. 
MATT: I take it back. 
ASHLEY: It's so cool. 
MARISHA: It's so pretty for something named Gloamglut. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: It's instead going to, because it has Legendary Actions, it's going to hover. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Oh wow. 
LAURA: Well, okay. 
MARISHA: Oh you got it, you got it. 
MATT: I got it. Okay 
ASHLEY: Daddy, no! 
TRAVIS: Don't fucking fall. 
LAURA: I don't know how to spell Gloamglut. 
TRAVIS: Should we, can I move it? 
ROBBIE: I believe it. 
TALIESIN: It seems fine. 
LAURA: Believe it! 
TRAVIS: God, it feels like it's going to tip. 
TALIESIN: If it falls from you touching it, you'll feel worse, though. 
MATT: That's true. 
TRAVIS: I know. It's going to go towards the center, if anything. 
MATT: Yeah, I'll be keeping an eye. 
ROBBIE: Dive for it. 
MATT: All righty. So, finishing that go-- 
LAURA: What is it? Glut? 
MARISHA: It flew up and it's looking at Imogen and I now? 
MATT: It's (clutching) onto the stone, right-- 
LAURA: It's right in front of us? 
MATT: -- where both of you are. 
TRAVIS: Look at the split lower jaw! I didn't see it from my side. 
MARISHA: That is sick! I didn't see it either. That's cool. 
MATT: With that-- 
MARISHA: That's terrifying, but that's cool. 
MATT: -- the Sorrowlord leaps from Gloamglut's back through the hole that you've created. 
LAURA: Jesus. 
MATT: You watch as he darts through the air and then vanishes into a plume of dark smoke before reappearing right behind both of you. 
LAURA: Daddy's going to attack us. 
MATT: Right there. 
MATT: Yep. 
LAURA: Daddy's going to hit us. But we're here with your daughter. 
MATT: He doesn't care. He immediately is going to pull out Duskhunger and make three strikes with it. That's going to be, against you, Imogen, 23 to hit. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Against you, Laudna. That's going to be a 17 to hit? 
MARISHA: I already used my reaction, didn't I? I can't Shield. 
MATT: No, but you do have Mirror Image. This does-- 
MARISHA: I do. So, Mirror Image. (scoffs) 
TRAVIS: (scoffs) 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Go off, dog. 
ASHLEY and LIAM: (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Different dice, too. Go off. 
MARISHA: That would've been great, honestly, if it was for something else. But that's fine. That's fine. 
MATT: So it's going to-- 
ROBBIE: That's your first one. That's just your first one. 
MARISHA: That's my first one. 
MATT: All right. Against you, Imogen, you take 15 points of slashing damage, Plus five points of fire. It swings towards you and carves one of the Mirror Images away. With its final attack, spins around to try and still carve through the other versions of you floating around hoping to find the actual originating caster. That is going to be a 28 to hit. 
MARISHA: Me? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Woo! Yeah, that hits. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) Woo! 
MARISHA: Mirror Image. 
MATT: Mirror Image. 
MARISHA: No. 
TRAVIS: Not a natural 20. 
MARISHA: Not a natural 20. 
MATT: All right. That's going to be 16 points of slashing damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Plus eight points of fire damage. 
MARISHA: 16 and then eight? Okay. 
MATT: As he stands there, carves into you all, there, behind the helmet, the voice rings out from within. "We don't need your influence on my daughter's true path here." That's all he says. Finishing his go, that brings us now to the emissary, who is going to try and break free of the muck that it's currently in. 
LAURA: Sheesh. 
MATT: That was Transmute Rock, right? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: So it has to make a-- 
SAM: What are we doing? Are we charging in there? Are we staying out? 
LAURA: I don't know. 
MATT: It uses an action to end the condition. So, it just pulls itself free. So it does get itself out of the muck. 
MARISHA: That's the emissary? 
TALIESIN: Over here. You can see where I'm standing there. 
MATT: The emissary. No longer restrained. 
LIAM: Right there? You made a hole in there? 
TALIESIN: There's no hole, I just vanished. 
LIAM: You just-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Is going to-- 
TALIESIN: I phase. 
MATT: -- rush over out of the muck next to where Ludinus is on the side, defensively looking in the direction of Fearne and the upper area. Getting out of these two points and sidling up next to what looks like Ludinus for protection. That's their action and movement. They don't get to cast anything. Finishing their go, ends with the Unseelie guardians. This one actually also gets itself free and is going to move over. It can only move, actually both of them can only move half movement because they're moving through the weird muck terrain. So, they can only get that far. This one's going to move up to here, and has his blade drawn and is looking down at you on the ground in the weird, shimmering magic cage that's keeping you protected, and looking over for what to do. That's going to finish that one's go. This one's going to rush up as well, and they're both preparing themselves to basically cut you down the minute this drops or anything gets out of hand. 
SAM: We're not attacking those guys yet, right? 
MATT: That finishes all their go. 
TALIESIN: There's plenty to hit. Imogen, you're up, with Orym on deck. 
LAURA: Oh Jesus Christ. 
LIAM: Oh man. 
MATT: Actually, at the end of their turn, Gloamglut's going to use a legendary action. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: To use-- 
LAURA: Kill me? 
MATT: -- a, actually going to use two legendary actions to use a rend attack against-- Let's see, on a one to three it's you, on a four to six, it's Imogen. It's Imogen. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: That's going to put us at-- 
TALIESIN: Can he get to a rend attack right now? 
MATT: The rend attack has a ten-foot reach. So, he is up against the wall and she's right there. So he's reaching in and striking his arm through and catches you off the side. You do have a plus two to your armor class because you're by the wall. But he did roll a total of 27. So, with that that's going to be 3d10. 
TRAVIS: A bunch of ones. 
MATT: That's actually really bad. (laughs) That's 12 points of slashing damage. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MATT: That was a really bad roll. That's going to finish that legendary action. Now, Imogen, it's your go, with Orym on deck. 
LAURA: Okay. (retching) 
TALIESIN: Thoughts? Comments? 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
LIAM: I'm in a bad position to do anything useful. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a telepathic response whether I should keep trying to knock down pillars or pop up and get rid of our wizard friend. 
LAURA: I'm going to use Misty Step. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to bamf myself onto the saddle on Gloamglut. 
ASHLEY: That's so-- Yes. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: He left him open. Come on, horse girl. 
ASHLEY: He did. He did. 
MARISHA: Come on, horse girl. 
ASHLEY: He did. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. Really? Okay. 
ASHLEY: Get it, get it, get it. 
LIAM: (gravelly) Wow. (normally) Wow. 
MATT: There we go. 
ASHLEY: Sick. 
TALIESIN: ♪ Spread your wings ♪ 
LIAM: Love it. 
TALIESIN: Actually, that has a really good look to it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It feels very natural. 
LAURA: I match. Oh my gosh. 
ASHLEY: You're definitely standing, holding the reins. 
TRAVIS: Just connect via Avatar. Stick your tail-dick in its ears. 
LAURA: Yeah, right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: Are you like: Is this a Western saddle? Gross. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Perfect. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: James Cameron. 
LAURA: He can teleport himself, your dad, right? He has-- 
MATT: You watched him do it. 
LAURA: -- Misty Step as well? 
LAURA: (uncertain noise) 
SAM: Quick animal handling. 
TRAVIS: Our plan is quickly-- 
LAURA: It's just going to shit. Can I grab the reins? 
MATT: Yeah, they're right there. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to grab the reins. Can I try to take control of him? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! Why not? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. 
TRAVIS: You've already come this far. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: You're on the saddle on the back of an enemy's dragon. This is what these moments were made for. 
SAM: You're breaking a horse right here. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
SAM: You got to break the horse! 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: Save a horse! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Ride Gloamglut! 
MATT: As you try and pull on the reins here-- 
TRAVIS: Eight seconds. (laughter) 
MATT: This-- Oh, sorry. So I'm going to consider this an animal handling check. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It is a challenging DC. 
LAURA: Yeah. Okay, I know. It's okay. 
MATT: It does not know who's on its back. It did not watch who got there. So it's just reacting to the reins that are present. So, it's not impossible. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Can you use Bless for this? 
LAURA: This was my job. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
MATT: It is. 
TRAVIS: Can you talk to it in its mind? 
MATT: Because of your background, I'll give you advantage on it. But it is a challenging DC. 
ASHLEY: Guidance? 
TALIESIN: Do you have Bless? 
LAURA: I don't have Bless. 
TALIESIN: Guidance is touch. 
ASHLEY: But if I see it, can I-- 
LAURA: No, Guidance is-- No, it's a touch. Guidance is touch. 
MATT: Good try with the negotiations. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: I appreciate it. 
TALIESIN: Bless is up, though. 
TRAVIS: You know they're coming. You know they're coming. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I feel this. I feel it in my bones. It's going to be good. 
LAURA: 20. 
MATT: 20. Okay. You tug on the reins and you see the claw that just struck you is in the hallway pulling, reaching for you and trying to go for Laudna. As you pull the reins back, it withdraws and just holds there. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LAURA: Did it work? 
MATT: You don't know. But it definitely withdrew its arm from the hole that it attacked you on. 
SAM: We have a dragon now. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Maybe. Maybe. We don't know. 
MARISHA: This is crazy. 
TRAVIS: She did disappear. 
MARISHA: This is crazy. 
TRAVIS: She did disappear. So, it may have just reacted to that. We don't know. 
MATT: Both her and-- Her rider disappeared into a chamber and then she appeared on its back. For the moment, it doesn't seem-- 
LAURA: It might thing I'm-- 
MATT: -- to have noticed a change. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: (excited panting) 
MATT: So. 
LAURA: Was that bonus action and action, then? 
MATT: Well, it's a bonus action Misty Step and then an action to-- 
LAURA: To take control? 
MATT: -- try and take control. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So that's your-- 
SAM: With your movement-- 
LAURA: Would movement be, though, to move the dragon? Is that movement because I'm mounted at this point? 
MATT: I'll say your movement can go towards on its next turn. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Telling it where to go. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh wow. 
MATT: That's how it goes with mounting, is you go on the creature's turn. 
TRAVIS: Oh wow. Oh wow! 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: That finishes your go. 
TRAVIS: Oh wow! 
MATT: Orym, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: From pirate ships to fucking dragons. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LIAM: I think my turn is going to be really short because I'm outside. I can't see anything. Not a lot has been called out. I just hear tons of noise from inside. 
MATT: Well, everyone's talking psychically, too. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: But I haven't heard anybody-- 
MATT: That's true. Yeah. So, what do you got? 
LIAM: I don't know what's going on in there. 
LAURA: You're just hearing chaos right now in your head. 
LIAM: I'm hearing chaos. 
LAURA: You're hearing (chaotic shout). 
TALIESIN: Ira's going to do something eventually. 
LAURA: Easy! Easy! 
SAM: Dorian! Counterspell! Cage! 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm hearing: Fuck, fuck, fuck! Ah! So-- 
ASHLEY: Shit. Shit. Shit! 
LIAM: I run towards the door to follow people in. 
TRAVIS: It's bacon! 
ASHLEY: It's bacon! 
LIAM: Matt, you'll have to decide how far I get. I'm here on the map. I would run into the door, see Dorian, see Fearne through some vaguely glowing light, and I will use my movement and my action, I think getting up to the rear of the Forcecage. 
MATT: Oh, you can definitely do that. Yeah. 
LIAM: But that's everything. I'm out of gas. 
LIAM: Correct. 
LIAM: So I'll just slam into it, my hands on the proverbial glass and-- 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Fearne! And that's the end of my turn. I literally can't do anything else. 
MATT: Sam, can you place this-- 
ASHLEY: Hey! 
MATT: Thank you. 
SAM: Like near Orym? 
LIAM: Right behind the Forcecage. 
LAURA: Yeah, right behind the Forcecage. 
MATT: Great. So there you stand. That's your turn. 
LIAM: Next. 
MATT: Now it's Ira's go. 
SAM: Next! 
ASHLEY: Oh, Ira! 
MARISHA and LAURA: Ira! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: Ira is going to skitter inside through one of the windows, slipping through on the opposite end. Glances over to that end and is going to Dimension Door. 
LAURA: Yes, Ira! 
TALIESIN: ♪ Ira ♪ 
LIAM: Magic is the best. 
MATT: Over to where the Sorrowlord and-- 
LAURA: Yeah. Destroy him! 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes! 
MATT: I'm going to get some of these pieces of connecting tissue on here. 
MARISHA: So wait, Ira's joining the fight up here with me? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ROBBIE: What are you guys on? Like a ledge, or are you all just-- 
LAURA: We were on the roof, basically. 
ROBBIE: The roof ledge? 
LAURA: I had made a hole through the-- 
MATT: Yeah. They're in an inner hallway that sits on the higher edge of this. They climbed through the window and then, you made a hole in the outer wall of it. 
ROBBIE: He's taking swipes at you through the hole from the inside? 
LAURA: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
LIAM: Sorrowlord stepped through that hole? Is that what's going on? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, he teleported. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: He bamfed right next to us, basically. 
LIAM: Past the hole to your side. 
LAURA: Yeah, past the hole into-- 
MATT: So he appears next to both of you as the Sorrowlord has his blade out, with Imogen no longer present and Laudna now the target. Gets his flaming black dark fey blade at the ready to strike you before, just looming behind him-- (apparating) 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: (Ira) "It's been a while, Athion." He puts his hands over the shoulders. 
LAURA: What did he call him? Wait, that's right. That's his name. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: The Sorrowlord goes like, "Fuck!" and-- (laughter) 
MATT: Now has his blade and is now standing between both Laudna and Ira, blade out at the ready, not expecting this scenario. That is going to be all of Ira's turn, though, because he did have to move through and then use his action. 
TALIESIN: Jack and Sally have just dropped! 
ASHLEY: Cool, cool, cool! 
TALIESIN: Oh! This is full "Nightmare Before Christmas." 
LAURA: I love Ira! 
MATT: All righty. That's going to finish his go. Top of the round now. Laudna, with Chetney on deck. 
MARISHA: No. I don't know what to do. 
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, you know-- 
MARISHA: I don't know what to do. 
SAM: Hey, before we get into this round, Matthew. Is the Forcecage completely blocking our entry or is there a little gap or? 
MATT: You said you were making it directly around her? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that was the plan where she was the center of it. 
MATT: So, there's a slight gap there, enough for a person to squeeze through. 
ROBBIE, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: I was just getting this piece of paper to put it underneath. 
MATT: I know. It's all good. Nah, it's fine. 
MARISHA: Is he okay? Is he okay? 
LIAM: Oh, I don't know if I'd have more movement. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: He's fine. 
LIAM: DM, I'd ask, if there was a gap, would I have the ability to move around the side of it to get into the chamber? Or did I use all my gasoline to get to the Forcecage itself? 
MATT: I'd say you used all your gasoline to get to the Forcecage itself. 
LIAM: That makes sense. 
TALIESIN: This is a-- This is-- This is crazy. 
LAURA and MARISHA: ♪ Doo doo doo doo doo doo ♪ 
MARISHA: Do you care about your dad? 
TRAVIS: I got a little crash pad for him. 
MARISHA: What's happening? Am I killing your dad? 
TALIESIN: He's going to be a lot easier-- 
ASHLEY: Got to do what we got to do. 
TALIESIN: -- to talk to if he's unconscious. 
ASHLEY: I came in there asking him for a way to let the-- We should go, and he didn't. 
SAM: He hasn't really-- 
LIAM: He hasn't had a chance to react. 
ROBBIE: He stopped the dragon from-- 
LAURA: He did stop the dragon from killing you. 
ROBBIE: -- from murdering you. 
ASHLEY: That's true. 
TALIESIN: But he then turned to murder your friends. 
ASHLEY: That's true. 
ROBBIE: Good point. 
ASHLEY: All things are true here. 
LIAM: Roleplay wise-- 
MATT: This will be easier-- 
LIAM: -- it was somewhat of an accident. 
MATT: -- one for all these assholes here. 
LIAM: Yank the head out of the way and you guys were-- 
LAURA: No, but then he bamfed to us-- 
TALIESIN: No but then me bamfed out-- 
LAURA: -- and he said: I don't want your influence on my daughter. 
MATT: What was meant to be a temporary platform turned into where everything is. 
TALIESIN: At the very least, it'll be easier to have a conversation with him-- 
ROBBIE: Sky fight! 
TALIESIN: -- if he doesn't have a sword, armor, and is unconscious. 
ROBBIE: That was a good noise. 
LAURA: It was satisfying? 
ASHLEY: Pretty please? 
TALIESIN: Taking him out is not a bad idea. In my opinion. 
LIAM: Although you're in a box. 
MARISHA: What was that? 
ASHLEY: I'm in a box. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Can I-- 
TALIESIN: I personally think he'll be a lot easier to have a conversation with if he drops to zero hit points-- 
MATT: Thank you. That's good. 
TALIESIN: -- and all of his stuff gets taken. 
TRAVIS: Here's your little-- 
MATT: Thank you. All righty. So. 
LAURA: You can't do magic, and you can't-- 
MATT: Laudna. 
ROBBIE: I really fucked you on your next turn. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: You can do that, but you'll be trapped in there 
MARISHA: Okay. This is complicated. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to get you out. 
TALIESIN: You have to hold an action until it drops. 
ROBBIE: It's not concentration. 
SAM: How long does it last? 
ROBBIE: I'll get you out. 
LAURA: It lasts forever. 
ROBBIE: No time. It's totally fine. 
LAURA: It lasts like an hour. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to get you out. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Hey. I thought I was saving your life. I tho—I was just fucking up your turn. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. No, no, no. It's okay. We're going to figure this out. We're going to figure this out. 
MATT: Laudna. 
LIAM: Exactly. 
LAURA: Exactly. (laughs) You can't! 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: I can. 
MARISHA: Okay. I-- Okay. I got Ira there. I'm feeling, we're going to do some spooky shit. So, I look at Ira and I'm like: (excited panting) Then, from my dread form, basically a replica of my spooky Victorian ghosts from my body goes, (ethereal lunge) and pulses outwards and screams. I'm going to do Void Puppet and send a screaming spirit directly through-- 
TALIESIN: Love it. 
MARISHA: -- through Ira. This fucking sucks. It's fine. 
MATT: The void spirit is now sitting there right next to-- 
MARISHA: Oh my god, none of this works. So, I got the void spirit and then I am going to wrap my hands around the Sorrowlord and cast Blight. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MARISHA: So he has disadvantage on his saving throw. 
MATT: He does. Now, Sorrowlord does have advantage on saving throws against magic and other effects, being a fey. 
MARISHA: Sorry? Sorry? 
MATT: He has advantage on magic and spell effects, being a fey. 
MARISHA: Annoying. Okay. 
MATT: So it just becomes a standard roll. So, you've negated his advantage. 
LAURA: That's good. 
TALIESIN: That's really good. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Your face. (laughs) 
MATT: That's going to be an 11. 
MARISHA: Okay. He fails. 
MATT: (laughs) He rolled real low. 
MATT: The spirit screams as it vanishes, spearing into his body right as the spell takes effect. 
LAURA: That's awesome. 
MARISHA: Okay. 8d8. I should have been more prepared. I should have been prepared. But also, I don't know what's happening in life, in general. Okay. We'll start with these four. 
MATT: Chetney, you're up next, with Braius on deck after you. 
TRAVIS: So the first couple steps of the plan, Matt, those went off, and then it all went sideways, unsurprisingly. 
TALIESIN: As it was. It was going-- 
MATT: Isn't that just how it goes, though? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. It really is. 
TALIESIN: It is. You get one round if you're lucky. 
TRAVIS: We thought a daughter's call would-- 
MARISHA: Because I might empower this. 
LAURA: Great. 
MARISHA: All right! This is actually a pretty good roll. 
TRAVIS: It's pretty good for the roll. 
MARISHA: Maybe I'll save my sorcery points. Okay. Sorry. 15, 26, 30, 40. 
MATT: 40. Heavy 40 points of necrotic damage to Sorrowlord Zathuda. (massive hit) 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: A heavy chunk of his life force withers within what little bit inside his helmet that Ira can see. As you grab him on his shoulder and pulse it into him, his cheeks go a little more sunken and he gives an exhale of pain and loss of vitality before pulling away from you and begins to spin the blade in place, getting ready to retaliate. Does that finish your turn? 
MARISHA: If I leave his radius, I'll get an attack of opportunity. 
MATT: If you move out of it, yeah. 
MARISHA: I wonder if it's worth it. So he doesn't unleash on me. He would just get one. 
TALIESIN: He also has another problem, so. 
MARISHA: He does. 
TALIESIN: As long as you stay there also, that means Ira also has advantage. 
LAURA: Yeah. That's true. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Dang it! 
MARISHA: I know. 
LIAM: We're in a tight spot. 
MARISHA: I know, I know. 
ASHLEY: Damn, we're in a tight spot! 
MARISHA: I'll stay. Me and Ira, baby! (nervous bumbling) Yeah. 
LIAM: Pithy. 
MARISHA: I guess that's it. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go. Now it comes to Chetney, with Braius on deck. 
TRAVIS: Sure does. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to roll out into the hallway. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: And now Fearne-- 
ASHLEY: ♪ Roll out ♪ 
TRAVIS: -- is in a box of energy. 
ROBBIE: We're going to get her out of there. Don't worry. 
MARISHA: Forcecage fucks you again. 
TRAVIS: I will-- (laughter) 
MATT: What are you going to do? 
TRAVIS: If you know, you know. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I can't go past Fearne so I'll be back here. 
LAURA: It was home made. 
TRAVIS: I can squeak past? 
MATT: There's enough space there to squeeze up through. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Ludinus is where on the map? Is he up on dais? 
TALIESIN: Right there. 
TRAVIS: He's right there. Oh, that changes. Okay. Yeah, let's go danger close. I will use-- 
MARISHA: Sorry, Matt. One more thing. I'm really sorry. Before we get too far. Because he was hit by a spell of mine and I have Form of Dread, he has to make a wisdom saving throw or be feared of me. 
MATT: That's fine. He's immune to fear. 
MARISHA: Great. Continue. Sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Immune to fear. 
MATT: But good looking out. So there is that gap to get through. However, one of the guards of the emissaries is right there. 
TRAVIS: Is right there. 
MATT: So you can't move past them. 
LIAM: Wonder if he has any hobbies, though. 
MATT: Unless you either take them down or you can try and make an acrobatics check to get through, but that's going to be your action and move through them. 
TRAVIS: I have something that allows me to... something allows me disadvantage on... What is it when you move past? 
TALIESIN: Opportunity. 
TRAVIS: Opportunity attacks. 
MATT: Correct. Dark Augmentation, I think it is. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! Amazing. Yes. I'm going to try and blow by the emissary's guard. I'm going to take the blow. 
MATT: Okay. So, make an acrobatics check. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Dun dun dun. 
TRAVIS: Natural 19. 21. 
MATT: 21. 20 was what you needed to try and get past him. 
TRAVIS: Woof. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
MATT: I'll say, as you squeeze through, he goes to swing towards you. You have your wolven form leaps out of the side and tries to roll past. It does get an attack of opportunity on you with disadvantage, but you do manage to not-- You manage to move past his space. Disadvantage. Oh, that's not good. (laughs) A five and a three. That's going to be 10. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Okay. That'll miss. 
MATT: (laughs) All right. So, yeah. That's five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, I'll say, to squeeze through there. So, 40 was your movement? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll use my bonus action to click my ♪ Boots of Speed ♪ and I will continue up to Ludinus. I'll make two strikes, since I use my bonus action. 
MATT: You got it. Let's go. 
TRAVIS: El claws. 
LAURA: Kill him, Chet! 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Okay. Okay. A 17 plus... 
TALIESIN: Let me take a look here. 
TRAVIS: A 27 on the first one. 
MATT: 27 hits. 
TRAVIS: And... 
TALIESIN: Okay, maybe. 
TRAVIS: Not as good. Just a dirty 20 on the second. 
MATT: Okay. That hits. 
TRAVIS: It does? Ludinus? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Because he's Snowdinus? 
LAURA: Oh, because he's Snowdinus? 
TRAVIS: Because he's Snowdinus! Okay. 
LAURA: He's a wizard. 
MARISHA: You're a wizard! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. They're very squish. 
TRAVIS: Seven, six. This one. 
TALIESIN: He's not even a real wizard. 
TRAVIS: 14 plus six. 
TALIESIN: He's a snow wizard. 
TRAVIS: 20 on. 
MATT: That's not nice. 
TRAVIS: 20 the first one with the Crimson Rite. Yeah, on the first one. 
LAURA: Think of Pumat Sol! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: 18 on the second one. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: He has his own thoughts and hopes. 
MATT: Okay. As you rush forward and strike twice carving the form, as it-- It seems to look at you nonplussed as you charge through and as you leap towards he's like, "This seems familiar." Gets the staff ready and the darkened, withered black hand with the gold tips and adornment on it. It looks like he's starting to cast a spell. You rush in and strike twice and (grunts) he takes it back and shrugs it off. Takes the hit, but shrugs it off. 
TRAVIS: (slurps) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: All right. That finishes your go? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Braius, you're up. 
SAM: I'm doing something very similar to what Mr. Chetney did. I'm going to run into that hall. Bonus action, Misty Step and continue all the way to Ludinus Da'leth. 
MATT: Okay. Robbie, can you hand me that? 
MARISHA: Misty Step? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Zo-zoop. 
MATT: You dart through and then, (poof). Like whereabouts, over here? 
SAM: I mean, if I can get behind him to flank. 
MATT: Full movement speed of 30, right? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: I love how many of us can just go (poofs). 
MATT: 30. No, you take it on the opposite side. 
SAM: I'll just be right next to. 
MATT: You can get next to him. 
SAM: Yeah, that's fine, too. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: And then... my Lord has commanded me to-- 
MATT: Remember, you are blessed, too. 
SAM: -- end this man, and now my mission shall be complete. I will attack! 
MATT: Go for it. 
SAM: With Poison Pen. Where did it go? 
LAURA: Just a little pen. 
SAM: 19. Ah, no. That's my flail. 
TALIESIN: I like the idea that he pulls out a tiny Bic and just. Tracheostomy. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: (tiny rapid ticks) 
SAM: Okay. That's a 27 to hit. 
MATT: 27 definitely hits. 
LAURA: Ha ha! Wa bla! 
SAM: I will pump in a 3rd-level Divine Smite. So that's seven, 14. God, what is that? Six. 20, 23, 29. 36... 36 points of damage. 
MATT: Ooh ooh oof! 
SAM: Do you care what kind of damage that is? 
MATT: No. I think you're okay. 
SAM: Okay. And then, I will strike again. 
MATT: Okay. Go for it. 
SAM: If that's all right. Terrible! Eww! 16. 
MATT: 16 will miss. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: First strike cleaves in with a heavy swipe. Your flail (heavy boom) batters into Ludinus's form, already wounded from Chetney's assault. This impact, you hear cracks. "(grunts)" He falls to one knee splattered with the dark magic and the ichor of Poison Pen. 
SAM: I was wrong. There's one, four more points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. That's a total of 40 on that hit, then. That's great. 
SAM: Great. 
TRAVIS: There's even less snow cone! 
MATT: Your second swing goes around and he puts his darkened hand up and a little field of energy (electric crackle) appears and just deflects the blow and he, "(grunts) Enough of that." 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: That finishes your turn? 
LAURA: Now it's his turn. 
TRAVIS: It's going to be one of us. 
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: Who are you going to make out with? 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
LIAM: You can do it. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Hot or not? 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: It's now Ludinus's turn. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
MATT: Actually, no. At the end of your turn, Ira's going to take a legendary action to make an attack on the Sorrowlord. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! Ira's busting out-- 
MATT: Someone roll an attack roll for me. 
TRAVIS: -- some legendary actions. 
ASHLEY: Someone roll an attack roll? 
SAM: An attack roll? 
MATT: Yeah, for Ira. 
SAM: I'll do it. 
MATT: Why not? This is fun. I'll have you guys do some fun stuff. 
SAM: I rolled a... What is that? 11? 
ROBBIE: That's impossible to tell. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: It's an 11. Yeah. 
MATT: It's an 11? Okay. That does hit. That's barely... Go ahead and roll. 1d12. 
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up, Riegel. (laughter) 
SAM: Nine. 
TRAVIS: All right. All right. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: That's nine. That's 12 points of damage to the Sorrowlord. All right. Great! So now for Ludinus's turn. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: Ludinus sees what's happening, looks over at the emissary and says, "Seems our enemies are on our tail. I need you to deliver our message as soon as possible. I'll get you out safely," and is going to go ahead and-- 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: -- begin casting-- 
TALIESIN: Anyone? Anyone? 
ASHLEY: No! 
MARISHA: Counterspell! Counterspell! 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. He's going to, because he knows you're there, is going to counter your Counterspell. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: (creepily giggles) 
TALIESIN: Anybody else? Anybody else? 
MATT: Counterspell. 
MARISHA: I think I'm the only one who has it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So with that, is going to-- 
MARISHA: He's going to roll for it? Does he have to roll for it? 
ROBBIE: He's the good guy now. 
MATT: Huh? 
MARISHA: Does he have to roll? 
MATT: Well, no. Because Counterspell is only 3rd-level and it's 4th-level or higher. Unless you wanted to try a higher level. 
MARISHA: I mean, I could cast it at 4th-level and then it would be a roll off, right? 
MATT: It would be. 
MARISHA: I'm going to cast it at 4th-level. 
MATT: Okay. For going forward for Counterspell, say the level spell that you use when you Counterspell because that situates the chain. 
MARISHA: I hear you. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Fair enough, fair enough. 
MATT: All right. Cool. 
LIAM: That's fair. The gut reaction is always just go (gibberishly) Counterspell! I'm out! 
MATT: I know. Exactly, exactly. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: So, it's all good. 
TRAVIS: Aah! Loud noises! 
MATT: All right. He's just using a quick 3rd-level Counterspell on yours. Yours is fourth. So, for your it's 14. He has to roll higher. He gets to add his bonus there. That's going to be-- he rolled an eight. It's going to be a 14. 
TRAVIS: Oh! He just hit it. 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: He has a very high intelligence modifier. 
TRAVIS: Got it, yeah. 
MARISHA: Of course he does. Okay. 
MATT: That fails. But he still continues casting this spell. He's going to go ahead-- 
TRAVIS: We have more rounds. 
LAURA: Do you have a Mage Slayer? Do either of you have Mage Slayer as a feat? 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: I don't think they do. 
TALIESIN: Any reaction? Anybody got a reaction? 
ROBBIE: Whoa, we played right into his hand. 
SAM: He's not making a saving throw right now? 
SAM: No, no. 
LAURA: No. He's doing a spell. 
SAM: This is just a spell. 
LAURA: Is there so much time for us to come up with something right now? 
TRAVIS: I know, I wish I had said like-- 
MATT: So he's just-- 
TRAVIS: Fearne has proof. 
MATT: So he's just casting the spell, but he's holding it. He's on the cusp of finishing the casting, but he's staring at the fact that he has these two combatants right in his face and he's not willing to step away. So he's just prepping it and muttering beneath his breath and you can feel this (building magical energy) energy in his hands. 
TRAVIS: We have to get in the emissary's ear and say: Fearne has proof. 
MATT: So finishing that go as he holds that, Ash, you're up, with Fearne and Dorian on deck. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I hear a change of plans happening. 
ROBBIE: Get out of there. 
TALIESIN: That's fine! You're all thinking weird shit. I am going to roll right to the edge of the mud, pop out, and charge that fucking motherfucker, Ludinus. 
MATT: Ludinus. Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm also going to roll for my rage, which I have not done yet. So, big money. Ooh yeah! So this is going to be great. Where are we? That blue-red shift glowing in the hammer means it's time for Time. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That'll be fun. That'll be fun. What am I going to do? How much is 60 feet from where I'm standing? Who of our people are within 60 feet range, would you say? 
MATT: Most everybody except for-- 
LAURA: I'm sorry, you had a gnat on your mic. 
LIAM: Sure I did. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LIAM: Sure I did. 
MATT: -- except for Dorian, Laudna, and technically Fearne because she's Forcecaged. 
TALIESIN: So Dorian and Laudna are the two that will get-- Sorry, guys. 
MATT: Ignored. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So, I am going to... Oh, I can't do it this round. Shit. Never mind. I got to wait for that one. All right. I'm going to run up and I'm going to take-- Was it possible to get 20-- It wasn't possible to get-- No, never mind. That's fine. So I'm going to run up and I'm going to take my attacks. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I assume I have advantage because he's locked in his, we're getting him flanked. 
MATT: Bold of you to assume you have advantage. 
LAURA: (sarcastic laugh) 
TALIESIN: I mean, I assume that I-- Yeah. 
MATT: With the movement, you get up to this point. Yeah, you can totally do that. 
MATT: (laughs) I just-- 
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah. 
MATT: -- want to remind you. 
TALIESIN: I was like: What have I done? What have I done? 
MATT: It's just bold to assume you have advantage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I was hoping maybe? Please? 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: All right. That'll be fun. It won't be the beginning his turn. That sucks. Okay, let's just take it. Here we go. First attack. A natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! (cheering) 
MATT: You all, you're crazy. 
TALIESIN: So. 
MARISHA: Last couple of games. 
MATT: I know. 
TALIESIN: That's, is that 3d6, I think? Let's double check. 
TRAVIS: Crazy fey dragon flushes them out. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: It's going to take a lot to wash Otohan Thull out. No. That's 4d6. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: That also means all attack rolls against him for a full round until my next turn have advantage. 
LAURA: Against Ludinus? 
LIAM: Everybody's attack rolls? 
TALIESIN: Everybody's attacks. I'm also, fuck it, I'm going to roll a Chaos Burst into this, too. So I'm also going to pump a little bit more damage into this. And I'm going to use one of the charges on the ring, too, because fuck it. 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: If that's okay. 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's just burn some shit. 
MATT: Go for it. Use all your stuff. 
TRAVIS: Why are you saying it like that? 
ASHLEY: Why do you do it like that? 
TRAVIS: Why? Why? 
TALIESIN: I love you, Matt. 
LIAM: Matt, this is an amazing flea circus. Thank you for juggling everything that's going on. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is an amazing-- This is blowing my mind. 
TRAVIS: But no thank you for the totally quaint and all-knowing response just then. What do you mean, "burn all your shit?" 
TALIESIN: That was really great. 
TRAVIS: Why would you lift your eyebrows? 
TALIESIN: He's trying to fuck with us. He's trying to fuck with us. All right. 
TRAVIS: He's not only trying to do it. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: No, I can't use the ring. Never mind. 
TRAVIS: The fucking 'tis happening. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Here we go. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: We're fucked. 
TALIESIN: Let's-- I know, I'm just trying to get all of my dice because I have a lot of them. Cool. So, it is... 
TRAVIS: What are we missing? What do we know? 
TALIESIN: Force damage is fine? It doesn't change anything? 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: All right. I can reroll that, too, because that's a thing I can do. (chuckles) 12, 16, 20, 28 times two is? 
MATT: Before the bonus, right? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: 28 times two. 
TRAVIS: 56. 
MATT: Yeah. 56. 
TALIESIN: Plus 14. 
MATT: That's 70. 
TALIESIN: 70 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Barbarian. 
MATT: Outside of a natural 20 on his advantage concentration check, this will break the concentration of the spell that he was holding. 13. No. 
MARISHA: Come on, come on. 
MATT: And a six, no. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: So the spell that he was holding, the Dimension Door that he was planning to wait for the arrival of the emissary to jump out. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: Holy shit! 
ASHLEY: Yes, baby! 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! 
TRAVIS: Clutch, Greymoore! 
ASHLEY: Let's fucking go! 
MATT: Without even noticing you there, you just come up from behind and wham! You watch as the spell is pulling-- 
TALIESIN: The head. 
MATT: He's eyeing both Chetney and Braius, and begins to turn towards the emissary. Right as he does, just barely sees the shadow before (massive hit) crumples to the ground. The spell vanishes out and like, "(grunts)." 
TALIESIN: For my next attack-- 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: Oh, you have another one? 
TRAVIS: So clutch, Greymoore. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
TRAVIS: Ludinus was eyeing one of us more than the other though, right? 
MATT: You don't know. 
TRAVIS: Ah! Come on. 
LIAM: What was your question? 
TRAVIS: Ludinus was checking out one of us more than the other. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: 28 to hit. 
MATT: 28 to hit. (laughs) He can't even Shield because he used his reaction to Counterspell, so. 
TALIESIN: All right. And just-- Yeah. Here we go. That's 28, 24 points of damage. 
MATT: 24 points of damage. 
LIAM: The snow is turned-- 
TALIESIN: (impacts) (laughs) Motherfucker! 
LIAM: The snow is turned to slush. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: All right! 
ROBBIE: That's good. 
TALIESIN: So how, I don't-- How do they dissipate? Does he just turn into-- It's not like a body that's left, right? 
TRAVIS: Like a snowman. 
MATT: No. It melts. It turns into melting snow. 
TALIESIN: Oh, well, okay. So I take that first hit and he's down. While he's there-- 
MATT: He's getting back up and turning around towards you. 
TALIESIN: -- the hammer starts to glow blue. I hit him-- 
MATT: As you're arcing with it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: He goes, "You learn a little every time." As you strike towards him, he leans into it. Your hammer strikes the gem on his forehead. And with that, (explosion) 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: A massive detonation erupts from the destruction of the simulacrum. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right! 
SAM: Oh shit. 
TRAVIS: We forgot that part. 
MARISHA: I forgot that they explodiate. 
TRAVIS: Are you raging? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: That is a 60-foot radius around him. 
TALIESIN: Sorry, guys. 
ROBBIE: 60-foot radius? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MATT: Every-- 
ROBBIE: But guess who's safe? 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: You have saved the day. 
LAURA: Is it 60-foot up? 
ASHLEY: You did. 
LAURA: Am I hit? 
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter if it's magic-- 
MATT: Sorry, no. 30 not 60. 
TALIESIN: Magic damage. 
MATT: 30-foot radius. 
LIAM: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Yay! 
MATT: That does unfortunately catch the emissary. 
LIAM: Oh! 
ROBBIE: No! 
LIAM: That helps! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. See? 
TALIESIN: He couldn't hear that shit. 
MATT: Okay. So let me roll some dice here. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: You saved my life today. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. I just got the first-- 
MATT: ♪ Someone saved my life tonight ♪ 
TRAVIS: I just got the, oh shit. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Sugar bear ♪ 
SAM: I just remembered, Travis. You and me had Bless. We could have-- 
LAURA: Been using that whole time. 
SAM: -- using it to attack stronger, higher. Oh well. 
MARISHA: It's a lot. It's a lot. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. It's going to be a lot. That's okay. 
ROBBIE: That's a lot of dice clickty-clackining back there. 
TRAVIS: Nobody said we were ever good at this. 
MATT: All right. So going around. Dexterity saving throw? 
TALIESIN: Oh, dex save. 
SAM: Ashton and Chetney both have a plus four to their saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. 
SAM: For being next to me. 
MATT: That's right. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I have advantage anyway on dex saving throws. 
SAM: An Aura of Protection. 
TALIESIN: So here we go. 
ROBBIE: Everybody's got rings on them. 
LIAM: Your Bless-- 
TALIESIN: Nat 20. 
MATT: Jesus Christ, dude! 
ROBBIE: What is happening?! 
LAURA: What the fuck? 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: (anxious exhale) 
MATT: Good to know. 
LIAM: We deserve this after Thull. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So you take 23 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: Reduced to, because I'm raging. 
MATT: Raging doesn't affect force damage. 
TALIESIN: It doesn't? Oh that's right! Thank you. 
TRAVIS: Bludgeoning, slashing, piercing-- 
MATT: You can't have everything, buddy. 
TALIESIN: No, I was trying to remember. I'm not totem of bear. I'm well aware. 
MATT: It only blows you back 20 feet from the blast. 
TALIESIN: Actually, it can't blow me back because of the form I'm in. 
MATT: That's true. Yeah. So you just stay put. 
LIAM: Just bits of pebble in the shale. 
MATT: Braius. Dexterity saving throw? 
SAM: Terrible. Six. 
MATT: 45 points of force damage. 
SAM: Seven. 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and ROBBIE: Whoa! 
MATT: You are blown back to the edge of-- You actually get thrown and slam into the back wall about ten feet up and then slide down. 
SAM: I do this for you, Lord of the Hells. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: Chetney, dexterity saving throw. 
TRAVIS: 14 plus 10, so 24, plus four from the-- 
SAM: Plus four. 
TRAVIS: So 28. 
MATT: All right. So, you take 23 points of force damage and you are only blown 20 feet back to there, skidding on the ground, your claws digging into the stonework and stopping yourself. 
TRAVIS: 12? You said 12 points? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: The emissary-- 
MARISHA: Is this going to kill the emissary? 
MATT: -- rolls really high. They only take 23. 
TRAVIS: Wait. 23, not 12. 23. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
MATT: And I think, oh, that guy over there, because a 20-foot radius-- No, it does not catch the other two. So that's all of it there. This (explosion) just gets blasted. The pillar takes a heavy hit (explosion) from the force damage on the side there. Fearne, roll a d20 for me. 
LAURA: Oh no. The ceiling's going to come down. (laughs) 
MATT: So. 
LAURA: That was our plan, guys. 
MATT: The blast of force damage around here, I will say, you are rolling to see if the pillar maintains its integrity. You're going to want to roll an 11 or higher. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MATT: Okay. The pillar (crunch) is cracked and a heavy (boom) impact. The whole room shifts and dust particles and bits of root fall from the ceiling and rocks fall free. The pillar itself is slightly bowed at the impact, where the crack is centered throughout. And you could hear every now and then little. (soft crackles) As its integrity is slowly failing. 
TRAVIS: We got to put high priority on the emissary, try and usher him out of here, right? 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes. 
MARISHA: We want to keep him alive. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We want to keep him alive. 
TRAVIS: And offer his guards the same, right? 
LAURA: Blocking the exit. 
SAM: Well, we can-- 
TRAVIS: We can sneak by. 
ROBBIE: Everybody can squeeze by on a single file. 
TALIESIN: Can the emissary see me, by the way? 
MATT: The emissary can see you. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So I'm like. As this is all gone. 
MATT: The emissary watched you kill Ludinus. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to look-- 
MATT: And then-- 
TALIESIN: Sorry, sorry. 
MATT: Blast it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the (muffled scream) So I'm going to do the "my bad." 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Why not? 
MATT: Okay. Yeah. Go for it. 
TALIESIN: I'm well aware. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oops, a murder. 
MATT: Yep. Sorry. All right. That finishes Ashton's go. Fearne, you're up, with Dorian on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: Come on, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Get out of there. (laughs) 
SAM: Don't worry about getting out. 
ASHLEY: Being put in confined spaces. 
TALIESIN: Mime. Mime! I'm going to bamf out Mister. 
MATT: Okay. Mister appears wherever you'd like him to within the area so he can appear on the outside of the cage, if you'd like. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to have next to me. 
MATT: Okay. Inside the cage. 
ASHLEY: Hi, baby. And then. 
MATT: (chatters) 
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know. Let's go. And I would like to try Fiery Teleportation. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: To bamf out 15 feet. 
MATT: Yep. To about there is where you would get. 15 feet. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Do I need to do anything? 
LAURA: What about charisma? 
MATT: You-- To get out of the Forcecage, you do. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can roll a charisma? 
SAM: You do. 
LIAM: Come on. High. High roll! 
ROBBIE: It's a charisma saving. 
LAURA: Oh god. And you have super high DC, don't you? 
ROBBIE: But no, no, no. It's flat. It's not against. 
LAURA: It's against your charisma. 
MATT and SAM: It's against your-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: So roll a charisma saving throw-- 
ROBBIE: It's 16. 
MATT: -- to see if you can. 
LIAM: Let's go with that rizz. 
ROBBIE: Come on. Come on, please. 
ASHLEY: Yes, come on. Okay. I was already beating it. But just in case, okay. I beat it. I beat it. 13 plus eight, 21? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Where do you want to appear? Do you want to appear next to this-- 
ASHLEY: I wanted to be as close to the emissary as I can be. 
MATT: That's about as close as you can get is right there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. And for-- 
MATT: Now, when you appear from your teleport, do you damage things around you with flame? 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: It's a Fiery Teleport. 
ASHLEY: Do not. 
MATT: You do not? 
ASHLEY: I do. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
MATT: Is it? 
SAM: Oh, it's not something you choose. It just happens? 
MATT: I'm going to double check. 
ASHLEY: "Each creature within five feet of the space that the spirit left." 
MATT: Left. Okay. But not where you arrived. 
ASHLEY: "Succeed on a dex saving throw or take 1d6 plus five fire damage." The DC's 18. 
MATT: Okay, but not where you arrive. 
ASHLEY: Not where I arrive. 
MATT: Okay, great. 
ASHLEY: But where I left. 
MATT: Okay. That's what I was checking to see here. 
LAURA: So, you're good. You're fine. Everything's fine. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Everything's fine. 
MATT: So you're just like. The inside of the Forcecage is like (whirs) Fills with flame contained within as Fearne just vanishes. You erupt from the ground nearby. Both you and Mister emerging from it, from one of the guardians who's standing there, who is holding its action as soon as you emerge out. It's going to take a swing towards you with its weapon. It was holding its attack. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to be a 19 to hit you? 
ASHLEY: Yes, it does. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: (sweetly) "Yes, it does." 
ASHLEY: But before. But once I bamf out, I want to look up to the emissary. 
MATT: Correct. As soon as you appear, though, he's holding his action. You appear next to him and he gets a quick hit in as you land. He's holding it for that purpose. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Fair. Ah! 
MATT: That's going to be eight points of slashing damage. Not a big deal. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, stop! Stop! Ludinus is betraying you. He's been siphoning our power for years to elongate his life. He has been killing the Fey for I don't even know how long. I promise you and I have proof. I was fucking getting to it! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Give me a minute! 
MATT: Make a persuasion check for me. 
ROBBIE: Come on. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. Here's your inspiration. Okay. 
LAURA: Guide yourself. Oh, you can't. 
ASHLEY: I can't. Okay. I'm going to do this one. You guys hate this dice. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: That's why I fucking roll that one. 
TRAVIS: Say it. 
ASHLEY: Natural 20! (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Natural fucking 20 on it! 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Natural 20 plus 13. Fucking 33! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: You just spiked Mister? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry! 
MARISHA: You have to believe me! Then, you turn around and kick your monkey. 
ASHLEY: I swear! (poof) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (poof) 
MATT: The emissary who has this curved longsword drawn and is panicked, looking at where to go, hears these words and gives you an intense look. You're not certain where they stand, other than the fact that they do not run or react beyond just holding their position. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit, oh shit. 
ASHLEY: I'm holding my position as well. 
MATT: Yeah. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Because that's all I can do. 
MATT: All right. You got it. That's your turn. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Finishing Fearne's go. Dorian, you're up. 
ROBBIE: I'm still in the hallway. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I'll get there! 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
ROBBIE: I mean, how long-- How far is it to get even in the chamber? 
MATT: It's about 40-ish feet. 
TRAVIS: "How's it going in there guys?" 
ROBBIE: To get in the front door? 
MATT: Oh, you're in the front door of the hallway. But to get into the actual chambers, it's about 40-ish feet. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that is my movement. 
SAM: You did great. 
ROBBIE: So I can get as far in there as I can. Can I get close enough to engage with this guard over here? 
MARISHA: So good. 
MATT: 30. 30 will get you just to where the hallway cross section. 
ROBBIE: I have 40 for walking. 
MATT: 40? That'll get you right up to where he is. There. Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Okay. Yeah. 
MATT: You can move him right up to the edge there on the other side of the Forcecage. Right there. 
SAM: We're hurting these guys or we're letting them live? 
ROBBIE: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: We're not hurting them yet. We're not hurting them yet. 
ROBBIE: No. Uh-uh. But that's the emissary up there, though, right? 
MATT: You can drop your Forcecage whenever you want to, or you can keep it up, if you want to. 
ROBBIE: I can't. I don't think I can. Can I? 
SAM: Lasts an hour. 
MATT: It lasts an hour, but any spell that you've cast-- 
TALIESIN: Always. 
MATT: -- you can drop, if you want to. 
LAURA: Oh, really? I mean, like, you're the one who holds it. Usually the Forcecage you don't want to drop it because you're using it to hold something. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
MATT: But in my mind. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: As far as like, magic works. 
TRAVIS: That's the rule. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: His mind. 
MATT: Yeah. If you're invisible, you know. Any sort of like. 
ROBBIE: But I don't have to concentrate to keep it up, right? 
MATT: Correct. No. 
ROBBIE: It just stays. 
MATT: It just stays. 
ROBBIE: I want to. We're seeing things still crumble around us. I want to keep it up, if I can. 
MARISHA: I mean, it's a great shield. 
TRAVIS: Can anybody get-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Also you don't have to. 
LAURA: But we won't be able to run quickly out of here with it up. 
TALIESIN: You don't have to dispel it on your turn, though. You can dispel it at any time if it's just a drop. 
MATT: In theory, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. So if something happens you can just. 
MATT: It doesn't take your action or anything. 
LAURA: Okay. Never mind. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MARISHA: You don't have Dimension Door or anything? 
ROBBIE: I do. Yeah, but I've got to dash in to get anywhere. 
MARISHA: Because we could use it as, like, a little holding cell for the emissary. 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. All right. 
TRAVIS: He seems to be listening. Let's not force him just yet. 
MARISHA: That's true, that's true. 
ROBBIE: I don't want to make him. He has to be willing to get Dimension Doored, anyway. But. 
TRAVIS: You can't force them with it, make them roll a save or something. 
LIAM: They could fail a save and be taken. 
TALIESIN: How many? How many of us are there? There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Plus him. 
MARISHA: The whole time. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: No, I'm adding three. That's right. That's 11. 
ROBBIE: I'll just use the rest of my turn so I want to get into the space. I'll dash in and get up behind Fearne and Mister. I just want to be in the mix. 
MATT: So you're going to have to move past one of the guardians and make an acrobatics check for me. 
ROBBIE: It's going to take a swipe at me. 
TALIESIN: One of the guardians would have to leave. 
TRAVIS: Eight players is a normal size for the table. 
ROBBIE: Acrobatics. 
TRAVIS: Matt Mercer, baby. 
ROBBIE: Oh, good. That would be 25. 
MATT: 25. That's more than enough. Yeah. So you-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Can I do a cartwheel as I go past? 
TALIESIN: I can double-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I can double everybody's movement except one person. 
MATT: So dart past. It does get an attack of opportunity against you as you do. But you do manage to move past the space. That'll be... A natural 20. 
ROBBIE: Oh, I deserve it. I deserve it! 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: However. 
TRAVIS: I deserve to be punished! 
ROBBIE: Trapped my friends! 
MATT: Oh, that's a d8. Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Protect. Protecting. 
MATT: Oh. That is going to be 15 points of slashing damage to you. 
ASHLEY: Protect. 
MATT: One heavy-- It gets to you. As you're cartwheeling through it, carves up your hip and you're like, "Ugh!" Land. Keep going. From there, you still have ten more feet of movement, if you want it. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. I want to be right next, shoulder to shoulder with Fearne, if I can. 
MATT: Okay. Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: So we'll say put you about there with her. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Anticlimactic. But now I'm in the mix, so that's my turn. 
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go. 
MARISHA: Okay. It's all their shit. 
MATT: It's now Gloamglut's turn. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
LAURA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Actually. Yeah, I'm good. 
MATT: You hear... 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: (flaps) 
MARISHA: Two battles going on. 
MATT: You hear the battle going in that way. Gloamglut is beginning to charge up its-- Actually. Let's see if it gets it back. Actually, it does get a recharge. Yeah. No. It gets it back. [painful electrical snap] 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Whoa! (laughter) 
SAM: (mocking) Is this thing on? 
MARISHA: Famous last words. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Who needs coffee? 
MATT: Yeah, that'll do it. 
LAURA: I can smell that from here. 
ASHLEY: That was a spark. 
MARISHA: Holy-- 
TRAVIS: I do fart when I get electrocuted. 
LAURA: I'm sorry. Gloamglut's charging up? 
MATT: Yeah. Gloamglut did not use any of its legendary actions because you had pulled on its reins. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It's still taking its turn to do stuff. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: What did you want to pull to make it do? Like movement wise? What did you want to do with it? 
LAURA: I had wanted to. Well, Ludinus was still alive when I was going to pull on it. I wanted to back away from the Shadowlord. I wanted to be like-- If he did Misty Step, I wanted to be at a distance so he wouldn't be able to just like. 
MARISHA: He's on Gloomglut. He's on Gloomglut! Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him. 
LIAM: Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Anxiety. [sharp crackle] (cheering) 
MATT: Well done. 
ROBBIE: Natural 20. (laughter) 
MATT: You want to move back here? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That's where I wanted to be. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: He may have just fired-- 
MARISHA: He fell next to Braius, I think. 
ROBBIE: Yes, he's in the muck. 
MARISHA: Oh, he's like-- 
TRAVIS: Does he get one more? 
LAURA: Y'all, I might have just unleashed Gloamglut's attack on everybody in this room. 
ROBBIE: What? 
TRAVIS: Why? Because you moved him? 
LAURA: I moved him and I don't know what he's about to do. 
MATT: So Gloamglut, you pull back this way, away from that side. He cannot see in that chamber. As the beam is charging up, it's going to look over there and see a number of targets. 
LAURA: Can I try to pull? Can I try to pull up on the reins like I saw him do and pull it up to where it shoots up to the ceiling instead? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So you pull him back out there, you manage to direct his movement. He's still taking his action, but you can try and pull it away. Make a strength check. 
LAURA: Strength check? 
MATT: Of course! You're trying to pull a dragon's head up. So it's you versus Gloamglut's strength. It's a contested roll. 
MARISHA: Contested roll? Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: You ever tried pulling on a Clydesdale? 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Natural 20. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, why not? Naturals all day. 
SAM: Just do a natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Pretty good, though. 
LAURA: Yeah. Against a dragon, I rolled a 13. 
LIAM: For another person. 
MATT: It's not enough. (laughter) 
MATT: Sorry, but good work. Good try. So, as you yank on the reins-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- the dark fire beam, the dark fire gaze just (scorching roar) burns across the ground. (scorching fire) 
LAURA: Sorry, you guys. 
LAURA: Oh no. Don't hit the emissary! 
LIAM: Does it hit the emissary? 
MATT: It hits the emissary, Dorian, Fearne, and the guardian there. 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
SAM: The fly is walking across the floor! 
TRAVIS: Here, here, here! 
TRAVIS: I got him, I got him, I got him. 
ASHLEY: Oh, well let him live, then! 
MATT: What's his initiative? 
LAURA: Did you get him? 
TRAVIS: I got him. 
LAURA: (shocked) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh, he was injured and walking? 
MATT: Set him free. 
SAM: Set him free. 
MATT: Set him free. 
LIAM: Yeah, set him-- 
SAM: Put him in a spider web. 
MATT: (laughs) "I'm going to go set him free!" I hear a trash can rustle. (laughter) 
LAURA: There's got to be a spider that needs a meal. 
SAM: There's an off-screen gunshot. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's a little drastic, Travis. 
TALIESIN: Here it goes, motherfucker. 
MATT: All righty, so. 
MARISHA: Can anyone-- 
ASHLEY: Oh boy! 
TALIESIN: I got nothing. 
ROBBIE: That's so many dice. 
LAURA: It's attacking everybody. It's attacking everybody! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
TALIESIN: Not everybody, it's just attacking a few people. 
ROBBIE: Who is it? Me? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Who is it? Am I? 
MATT: Okay. So. Can I have Fearne and Dorian both make dexterity saving throws? 
ASHLEY: Great. 
ROBBIE: Bet you wish you would have stayed in that box. 18. 
MATT: 18? You take-- 
SAM: Oh wow, your dex is so high. 
ROBBIE: I'm very flitty. 
MATT: You take 15 points of fire damage. 
ROBBIE: One five. Okay. 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Could be worse. 
MATT: Fearne? 
ASHLEY: That is a seven. 
MATT: Seven. You take 30 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine. 
TALIESIN: Are you-- No, you're not-- 
ASHLEY: Well, I have-- 
LAURA: You're resistant to fire damage. 
ASHLEY: I am not at the moment. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: In this form. 
MATT: When you transform. 
ASHLEY: In this mortal form. 
MATT: Okay. Double check the abilities on there. Just to check. 
ASHLEY: I think it's just when I transform. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it might be-- Is there anything in your defenses box right now on your character sheet? 
ASHLEY: I have a defenses box? 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, right-- I know, you never-- 
LAURA: That says fire. 
ASHLEY: I just burped. 
LAURA: You're resistant to fire. 
ASHLEY: I am resistant to fire. 
MATT: I'm pretty sure you're resistant naturally. 
ASHLEY: I was looking at the wrong area. 
MATT: I think you become immune when you transform. 
MARISHA: Laura's face! So you still take only 15 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: 15 points? Okay. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: You're resistant to fucking fire! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You dumbass! 
MATT: The emissary fails its save. 
TALIESIN: I'm so pretty and perfect. 
ROBBIE: The emissary failed? 
ASHLEY: I know that! I know, I am freaked out and I forgot about that at the moment. 
SAM: Ash-a-ley Johnson. 
ASHLEY: I know that that box is there and I've seen it. 
MATT: (scorching flames) As it burns across, the other guardian fails its save. 
TALIESIN: This actually may make life a lot easier. 
LAURA: Look. As far as they're concerned, the fucking dragon is attacking and it's the Shadowlord's dragon. So. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Bad business. 
MARISHA: That's true, that's true. 
MATT: So yeah. The emissary gets blasted with this beam and falls to the ground, black flames wrapping around it. It shunts its hand out and the flames manage to vanish. The guardian on the back half takes the brunt of it, too, puts its shield up, but it's not enough and gets burned, falls back and is still standing, but very badly burned. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: That's going to finish Gloamglut's turn. Movement and action there. 
LIAM: Emissary is still up, you say? 
MATT: Emissary is still up. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Now it's the Sorrowlord's turn. 
LIAM: Oy-oy-oy-oy-oy. 
ROBBIE: Sure, sure. 
MATT: Sorrowlord-- 
TRAVIS: Ira! 
LAURA: Ruh roh! 
ASHLEY: I scream out. 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
ASHLEY: Ow, Dad! 
MATT: At the end that turn, Ira's going to use his other legendary action to strike the Sorrowlord. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Come on. He's got advantage, right-- 
MATT: Go ahead and-- 
MATT: So roll an attack roll with advantage against-- 
TRAVIS: For Ira. 
MATT: For Ira. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Against the Sorrowlord. 
TRAVIS: Don't fuck it up. 
SAM: Don't choose dice. Just do it. 
ASHLEY: I'm not, I'm not! I just want to puppa-- use the right ones. 
MATT: I just want to puppa-- choose the right one. Yeah. 
LIAM: My life for Ira. 
LAURA: That's kind of cocked. 
LIAM: That's cocked. That's definitely cocked. Roll it again. 
ASHLEY: I feel like it is. 
LAURA: I can't tell if it's a 12 or a 10. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, I can't either. 
SAM: I can tell it was a 10. 
LAURA: (groans) 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
SAM: Dice don't lie, dice don't lie! 
LIAM: Bountiful Luck. Reroll it because I am such-- 
LAURA: Because you're right next to-- 
LIAM: -- a calming presence. 
MATT: How close do you have to be to them? 
LIAM: 30 feet. I'm not 30 feet? I'm behind the Forcecage. I'm 30 feet. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. You're within 30 feet. 
SAM: Dice still don't lie. 
ASHLEY: Wait, but this is for Ira? 
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. This is for Ira. 
LAURA: To hit the Shadowlord. 
ASHLEY: Ira's all the way up there. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Sorry. So that's a natural one. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: So Ira goes to-- 
MARISHA: But does he have an advantage because I'm there? I'm there. 
MATT: I said roll with advantage. So it was a one and a 10. 
ASHLEY: It was a one-- No, I rerolled one. 
SAM: It was a one and an eight. 
LAURA: It was a one and an eight. 
ASHLEY: Because it was cocked. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: It was a one and an eight. Got it. 
MATT: Okay. Still, unfortunately, not great. 
ASHLEY: Still shit. 
SAM: Still garbage. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: So after all that rigmarole. 
LIAM: What a wonderful journey. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Ira goes to strike towards the Sorrowlord, who takes his dark blade and slams it past Ira's hand and actually carves into it. Ira's like, "(winces)," pulls his hand back. 
TRAVIS: That sword's got a name, too. 
LAURA: So that was the Sorrowlord's attack on Ira? Or Ira's attack. 
MATT: It was Ira's failed roll. I'm just narratively explaining it. 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: The Sorrowlord looks over and sees Gloamglut pulling back. Looks curiously, and is going to move towards where the opening is. 
TALIESIN: That's a couple-- Okay, no opportunity attacks then. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: (sighs) Pulling him away kind of fucked it up a little bit for him. 
LIAM: Here boy. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (kissy noises) Big boy. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Huh. Okay. 
TRAVIS and LIAM: ♪ (battle music) ♪ 
MATT: Sorrowlord's going to put his blade down from an aggressive standpoint and go towards you Laudna and Ira and be like, "Look. I think with him gone, we should have a conversation." 
MARISHA: Insight check? Am I allowed to do this? 
MATT: You are. Make an insight check. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: He's tricking you. He's tricking you. 
MARISHA: I think he's tricking me. 
LAURA: He's trying to sneak. 
TRAVIS: We got to take it, even if it's a lie. 
LAURA: No. He's trying to sneak past so he can get to the dragon. 
LIAM: Take the roll. 
SAM: I believe him. 
MARISHA: It's not great. Eight. 
MATT: Eight. 
LAURA: So you believe him? 
MATT: He seems pretty legit. 
SAM: I mean, this is Fearne's dad. 
LAURA: I don't trust him. 
LAURA: Exactly. 
SAM: You got to trust him. 
TALIESIN: He dropped the sword. 
SAM: It skips a generation. 
LAURA: He didn't drop the sword, he put it down. 
MATT: He just has it down and is like, "I think we all have aligned goals, to a degree, but we have to talk it through now that we're not being watched." 
MARISHA: How do we know you're not tricking us? 
MATT: "You don't. But are you willing to take the risk of ending a possibility?" 
MARISHA: Fucking fey. Am I able to get in everyone's heads real quick and be like-- 
MATT: Sure. Well, he's like stepping back towards the hole that leads into the chamber. 
MARISHA: Does it look like he's about to "Whee!" like, get the fuck out? 
MATT: It could be. Or he's just trying to get out of your melee range because you're both aggressively on him. 
MARISHA: All right, I-- 
MATT: Ira's there, holding like-- 
MARISHA: I look at Ira. I'm going to say telepathically to everybody: Sorrowlord is offering a chat? Question mark. 
TRAVIS: Got to take it. We're looking to talk to the emissary. He's fey, so is the emissary. 
MATT: (Ira) "I don't trust any of them." 
MARISHA: Wait, Ira? Ira, just wait. Ira, just wait! 
MATT: Sorrowlord is going to just fall back out of the hole. 
LAURA: Yeah, he's just trying to get close-- 
MATT: Ira's going to take his attack on that. 
LAURA: Get him, Ira. 
MATT: So roll an attack roll for Ira for me. 
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right. I'm going to do this one. 
TALIESIN: He ain't going to get far. 
MARISHA: Okay, 10. I rolled a 10. Whatever-- 
MATT: A 10? That's just what he needs to hit, actually. So roll for Ira. It's going to be 1d12 for me, if you don't mind. 
MARISHA: 10. 
MATT: 10. All right. So it's 10 plus three. 
SAM: That's our new play, we're getting this guy out of here? 
MATT: So Sorrowlord-- 
SAM: Or killing the Sorrowlord? 
LIAM: I don't know what's going on yet. 
MATT: Falls back out of the hole, plummets. 
MARISHA: Do I get an attack of opportunity? 
TALIESIN: We can knock him unconscious. 
MATT: If you want to take one. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's whether or not you trust him. 
TRAVIS: Could your attack of opportunity be catching him? 
MARISHA: I was just thinking that. 
TRAVIS: I think we're trying to persuade the emissary. I think Lord Zathuda is neither here nor there. 
TALIESIN: Be good to get some intel. 
TRAVIS: Because Zathuda is separate-- 
LAURA: Just grab his wrist as he goes. 
TRAVIS: -- from the emissary that represents-- 
MARISHA: I will go right down with him. 
MATT: Zathuda is here representing-- 
TRAVIS: Sammanar? 
MATT: The emissary represents Sammanar in the Unseelie Court. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Sorrowlord is from the Unseelie Court. 
TRAVIS: Right. 
MATT: But working with Ludinus. 
LIAM: Rogue agent. 
TRAVIS: Right. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. You know what? Yeah. Can I reach out and just grab his wrist? 
MATT: What are you trying to do? 
MARISHA: Either hold him here or go down with him. 
TRAVIS: Oh. Keep yourself close to him? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Smart. 
MATT: Make a strength check for me. 
TRAVIS: Smart. 
MARISHA: My strong suit. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is that a negative three? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's great. Just a straight check? 
TRAVIS: All your fingers come off. 
MATT: Just roll and add your strength modifier. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That's fair. 
LAURA: Is it a one? 
MARISHA: I rolled a one. 
MATT and LIAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Everything breaks. 
ROBBIE: Tears your arm off. (laughter) 
MATT: So here's what happens. You're in your mind contemplating this. You're like, "No, I won't let him." You go to reach for him. He's already fallen and he's just gone. You're like, "Oh, I missed him." (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. 
MATT: Ira's like-- 
TRAVIS: It's the latest reach of all time. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Before he hits, uses his bonus action to step up onto here. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 
ROBBIE: No, that one's the worst. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. But he might be waiting to talk? 
ASHLEY: It's okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: And just puts his, he has the blade out to the side but has his hand up. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Just holding. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: That finishes his go. It is now the emissary's turn. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: The emissary says, "And what is going on here?" Looking over towards the Sorrowlord, and the Sorrowlord goes, "To be completely honest, Ludinus has never been worthy listening to." 
ROBBIE: It's working. 
MATT: "So we continue his plan, but the Unseelie has a future without that pissant elf trying to guide it," and looks down at you and says, "And my daughter might very well be the key." When he says, "daughter," the emissary goes, "Huh." That's his turn, and that's the emissary's turn. The other guards who have their blades at the ready, gathered around, stand there looking up at the emissary, looking at the rest of you, looking at Fearne and Dorian standing there ready to carve you all down, but just still their blades. It's just this standoff, just this tension that sits in the middle of this chamber. The pillar (stone cracks)-- 
TRAVIS: Oh god! 
MATT: -- gives a little more and more rocks tumble. The chamber, it's like, oh boy, it's getting real tenuous in here. 
SAM: We should get out of here. 
MATT: Imogen, it's your turn. Gloamglut is pulling at the reins, now seeing its master on the ground and realizing that it doesn't recognize who's tugging. But that's all you can sense from it. What do you want to do? 
LAURA: I can't move him on my turn, he moves on his turn and I just am riding him around. 
MATT: Correct. You can spend your action to try and guide him, if you want to. 
TRAVIS: Can you talk into creatures' minds? 
LAURA: I can talk to creatures. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Then they choose to listen or not? 
LAURA: Exactly. I can speak into his head. 
MATT: What would you like to do? 
TRAVIS: I was just curious. 
MATT: With Orym on deck, by the way. 
LAURA: Yes, yes. (anxious squeal) (sighs) I'm not going to attack anybody (laughs) because I'm going to use my action to try-- He's so close again. I don't want him to bamf. I'm going to try to move Gloamglut that way. I want him to be able to go out the roof if I need to. So I want to get him close to that opening. 
MATT: Okay. You did see him push through like a thin lizard shifting its bones. 
LAURA: So he could get through that hole that we've created. 
MATT: The hole that you made? You're not sure. 
LAURA: But the hole that he widened, probably, because he made it bigger, right? With his attack on the ceiling? 
MATT: Well he-- Oh, when he carved through? 
LAURA: When he went (forceful flying) 
MATT: It's a dark flame. Its impact on stone is not as not as strong. 
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: It's still a fair hole. You're just-- He may or may not. 
TRAVIS: But he did come in through a hole on the opposite side, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Like through a window. You saw him squeeze through a small hole. 
ROBBIE: But he slithered, right? 
MATT: Oh, sorry, the main entryway, he went through. 
LAURA: He came through the main entryway. 
ROBBIE: You couldn't use him as an exit because if he slithered through, he'd just scrape you off, right? 
LAURA: Well, look. No. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: She can get streamlined. 
LAURA: Listen, I got abilities. 
TRAVIS: If he burst through the roof, that whole thing is coming down. 
LAURA: Trust me. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try to move him over to that area. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Keep him up high. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I want him up and away. 
MATT: So for this, I'm going to have you both do contested will checks on this. 
LAURA: This is a will power? 
MATT: You've already done your animal handling and you've now dominated that space there. He's questioning it now with the Sorrowlord present. 
LAURA: Can I use my ability to speak into his mind? 
MATT: Sure. What do you want to say? (laughter) 
SAM: Hey! 
LAURA: Hey! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You come here often? 
LAURA: As a horse girl, I totally understand how to talk to animals. 
MATT: Right. 
TRAVIS: You always got to flirt with the dragon. 
ASHLEY: A little bit of a scritch. 
LAURA: Shit. I don't know what to say to him. 
ASHLEY: He's cute. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: He's smart. 
LAURA: I'm going to say: Stand down. Stay calm. I'm on your side. As I try to bring him up and around. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. So I'll say, it is still contested, his will versus your will in this instance. Persuasion isn't going to do anything just from a direct communication. You're almost trying to impose yourself as his own will onto his mind. So roll and add your wisdom. 
LAURA: Wisdom? 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: Not charisma. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Wisdom. 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: You're not telling him lies or anything? 
LAURA: He rolled high. I can see it on his face. Wisdom save or wisdom mod? 
MATT: Wisdom mod. 
LAURA: Doesn't matter. It's the same. 
TRAVIS: This is so eventful. 
LAURA: 15. 
MATT: 15? Okay. He rolled a natural three minus two. (gasping) 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You read him wrong. 
LAURA: I did, I did. 
MATT: Not a very wise entity. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Being able to push and insert your force of will into its mind without it understanding where it's coming from, for the moment, it seems to interpret it as its own intent. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So you push that thought into its head and it just resets itself over on this side of the chamber. Let's move Braius over here, if you don't mind. 
SAM: Sure, sure. Huh? I'm okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you broke his-- 
SAM: I was just blown against the wall. 
MATT: Just a little bit. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: There we go. 
MARISHA: Like transporting a wedding cake. 
ROBBIE: Everything's good. 
MATT: I know. 
ROBBIE: Oh, yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: He's at the top of the roof, as high as he can be? 
MATT: Right above where that opening is. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (wings flap) Then (clutching) latches onto the sides. 
LAURA: Then can I-- 
MATT: Just narrowly avoiding the central pillar. 
LAURA: If I'm holding-- Oh, wait. No. 
TALIESIN: Can you fly still? 
LAURA: Yeah, I can. I wanted to hold a spell if anything happened. Can I try to do that as a bonus action? 
MATT: As a bonus action? Yeah. 
LAURA: Then I'll use a sorcery point to turn it into a quickened spell. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: So, two sorcery points, and then I'm going to hold Psychic Lance for the Sorrowlord, if he pulls any shit. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. Orym. You're up. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LIAM: Okay, so through the force walls of that spell, I'm getting 70 percent of what's happening from what I'm hearing, and I know that I'm seeing-- 
LAURA: I'm sorry that took so long. 
LIAM: -- the emissary with Dad. 
MATT: The Sorrowlord and the emissary are both up there, maybe five feet from each other. Sorrowlord has the blade out, hand up. The emissary is looking confused. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: There's just a tension in the air, and everything's just holding tight. In the middle of it, Gloamglut just (soars and clutches) latches out of sight. 
LIAM: So I'm not 100% certain of the vibe yet. So Orym slides through that gap and I quiet pitter pat up between emissary's guard and Fearne, pad up the stairs, and I'm going to dance-- 
MATT: A little bit out of range. 
LIAM: I'm going to use my action and my movement to get all the way up and dance pirouette around the emissary and stand between them and use Bait and Switch and throw my shield and blade up in front of the emissary. 
TRAVIS: Sick. 
LIAM: So emissary gets an additional three to their AC. I'm not holding the sword out like a threat, but I am holding it up with shield up, and I over my shoulder say: We're going to get you out of here safe. We need to take the temperature down. The faun has evidence you need to see before you can make any decisions. That's the end of my turn. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Oh, no, it's not. Little blue-black blossoms start to grow out of my armor and from out of my hair as I Hex the Sorrowlord. He's a disadvantage on strength checks. 
MATT: Okay. Got it. 
LIAM: That's the end of my turn. 
MARISHA: Nice, nice. 
ASHLEY: Nice, nice. 
MATT: Okay. So right now we are pausing the initiative order. Ira has clambered to the edge. There we go. 
LAURA: We did it! 
LIAM: I did it.. 
MATT: Yay, good job. 
LIAM: He's allergic to flowers 
MATT: If that's how it worked, you lost three already this battle. (laughter) 
MATT: I'm just going to put it there and mark it there. 
TRAVIS: These rules are strange. 
MATT: Ira clambers up to the edge, where you are, peering into it. Looks over towards you. (Ira) "Can you trust them? Can you trust me?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Don't confuse me! 
MATT: "I'm not confusing. I'm teaching you. Can you trust them? Can you trust me?" 
MARISHA: No. Not really. 
MATT: "Good." He just sits there and curls his arms over the edge of where that opening is, his large knees bent and just watches from above. 
MARISHA: Are we going to go down? Should we go down? 
MATT: He's just watching. 
MARISHA: Should I go down? 
MATT: Up to you. 
MARISHA: I'm going to go down. 
TRAVIS: Are you asking the Nightmare King? 
MARISHA: I'm asking Ira. 
TRAVIS: Are you going to go down there? 
MARISHA: Should we go down together? No? You're going to stay here and watch? 
MATT: "I'm fine here. It's always nice to be near an exit." 
LAURA: He chose down. 
MARISHA: All right. Here's the thing, though. Don't just bamf. Don't go away. All right? Can you just stay? I'm going to go down. 
MATT: "Sure. You can trust me." 
MARISHA: You literally just said the opposite. Oh my god. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I still have Spider Climb up, so I'm just going to head first skitter down the wall. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Stay for breakfast. 
MARISHA: Go and join the conversation. 
MATT: Okay. So everything stays still here. A few moments pass of quiet, before the emissary relaxes their shoulders a little bit behind you. (emissary) "So what is this evidence? What in all of the hells and realms beyond has brought you here now, whoever the fuck you are." 
MARISHA: This is the emissary? 
MATT: Emissary. 
LIAM: Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Yes. We have-- I take out of my marsupial pouch. We found-- 
MARISHA: Why is it wet? 
ASHLEY: Sorry. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: We found a journal of Ludinus's, and it talks about everything that he's done. He's been siphoning our power for hundreds of years. Probably longer than that. Do I give it to him? 
SAM: Show it to him. Do your thing. 
MATT: Does a quick little thumb through. 
TRAVIS: If you're aware of the-- If I may, Your Grace. If you're aware of the great city of Molaesmyr, it was ruined by Ludinus's efforts hundreds of years ago. Decimated the landscape. What Fearne says is true. He's been absorbing your creatures, your people, your lands to stay alive all this time. His words are hollow and he will betray you. 
TALIESIN: We've seen it. 
TRAVIS: The evidence is there. 
ASHLEY: He's using all of you. 
MATT: Looks over to the Sorrowlord. "And you, Zathuda, you who've been our direct right hand to Ludinus, what do you have to say of this? What do you know of it?" The Sorrowlord's hand is down now, the blade still quietly burning at his side. (Zathuda) "There's been conversations at the top of the court where some of this is known, some of it is not. A necessary evil in the goals that we had aligned. But even so, part of why I was sent was to keep a close eye on his work. While I think what he plans to achieve can and will be done, he should not be the one granted that ability. So with their help, my sweet daughter and all of our destinies, we can find ourselves on the threshold of a new era and destroy Ludinus before he can even glimpse dream to achieve what he wants and make it our own." 
LAURA: Ruh-roh. 
MATT: "So, what you see before you are those capable of ushering in a freedom from them." He glances up towards the dome of this temple of the Arch Heart, patron of beauty, arcana, and the fey. "So, are we aligned?" 
ASHLEY: Can I insight check him? 
MATT: Yeah, go for it. What are you trying to glean from him? 
ASHLEY: I just-- I want to just know if there's some other intent there. 
MATT: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Does that make sense? 
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check. 
ASHLEY: I mean, of course there would be. 23. 
SAM: (gasps) Oh! Earlier, when we entered combat, I should have read: this combat was brought to you by WizKids and their Bells Hells unpainted mini set, which is available for preorder today at wizkids.io/crunpainted! There's an exclamation point at the end. 
TALIESIN: Usually they don't mean that. 
SAM: Is that part of the URL? 
LAURA: Maybe that's part of the-- Yeah! That's the way we should-- 
SAM: Or "unpainted!"? 
TALIESIN: I think it's unpainted. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Unpainted. 
SAM: Use both. Try both. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Both. 
LAURA: Did you get some good? Looks like you got something really good. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Mm, kay. 
MATT: "Ludinus deserves nothing. He's a brilliant mind without true vision. A brilliance locked within a damaged soul who has been tantruming for a thousand years. But your destiny awaits. As she who ate the gods inferno embrace and caster of the deepest shadows. You are the future, Fearne Calloway. Lady Fearne Zathuda." (gasping) 
LAURA: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Wait, the future of what? 
MATT: Looks over to the emissary. "Go. Tell Sammanar and the Court what you heard here. I can return to the Vanguard site. Play my part. We will carry our intent to the very depths of that red moon. And when the moment's right, we will slay Ludinus Da'leth. And you will be the vessel of the future." 
LAURA: Oh shit! We don't want him-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: -- I'm saying this in heads. We don't want him to bring the army. We don't want the army there. That was the whole fucking point. 
TRAVIS: It might be the best we can do, though. 
MARISHA: Let's say he wants his-- He wants to rally the army for a little bait and switch when the going is right. But he didn't necessarily say he was going to bring the army. He just said, go and tell them what's up. 
TRAVIS: They're going to keep up their-- They're going to keep up their part, which means we'll have to inform our forces-- 
LIAM: The triple agent stuff. 
TRAVIS: -- to not slam into a wall. 
ASHLEY: Yes, that they-- 
TRAVIS: We just have to be-- We're going to have to turn into finesse instruments here. 
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise. 
ROBBIE: Don't they have the same objective-- 
TALIESIN: This is the most silly bullshit. ROOBIE: -- but just different leadership? 
LAURA: Yeah. Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yep. 
LAURA: Yeah, we'll worry about that later. 
ROBBIE: It just seems like making a deal with the devil-- 
LIAM: We can work it-- 
ROBBIE: We'll worry about it later? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: So we're going to let them go. Just let them go and trust them to do the right thing? 
ASHLEY: It's a tomorrow problem. 
ROBBIE: A tomorrow problem!? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: What if there is no tomorrow? 
TALIESIN: Then it's not a problem, is it? 
LAURA: I thought you wanted this, Dorian? 
ROBBIE: Good point. What? 
LAURA: I thought you wanted this. 
ROBBIE: No. I wanted them to convince them not to come. Not to fight. To side with us. Not-- 
ASHLEY: Do we let him take the journal? 
LIAM: We're just staring at each other for 50 seconds. 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: As this is happening. The Sorrowlord goes, "Gloamglut!" And raises his hand up the dagger or the dragon dislodges its hands and (whoosh, shatters) land swoops across the way. Hits the ground. I need you, if you could, to make a strength check for me to maintain holding on to it as it impacts. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: What are you thinking? Take him down? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Two. 
MATT: Okay. You get flung off the side holding onto the rail. 
LAURA: That's okay. I'm going to use-- 
MATT: Dangling for a second as you're dangling right past its face, its massive jaw, which is large enough to consume you whole, just hangs open the two bottom parts where the jaw splits kind of (creepy rattle) shake and the slobber (plops) drips. 
LAURA: I'm going to use one of my points and I'm going to instantly fly instead of dropping. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Catch yourself. You indeed can be flying. How far up do you want to fly? 
LAURA: I'm going to look Gloamglut in the eye and in his head, he's going to hear: Thanks for the ride. 
MARISHA: We're needing that in-fighting. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'd rather fight the Sorrowlord. 
MATT: The Sorrowlord stands there and goes, "I can escort the emissary to the court. Or if you don't trust me, then we shall let them leave and find their own path. I'll return to the unknowing interior bosom of the Vanguard and continue tweaking and threading and weaving as I have been." 
ASHLEY: So you've been... You've been like a spy? You really don't trust Ludinus? 
MATT: "Why would anyone trust him? He's a brilliant figure who is accomplishing incredible things and doesn't deserve the fruits of that labor. So we wait, and we hate. Then when it's time to grasp that crown, it's ours. It's yours." 
MARISHA: Don't you think he is anticipating your imminent betrayal, though? 
MATT: "He's anticipating everybody's imminent betrayal. But something tells me he thinks I'm perhaps the least dependable. It's taken many years to instill a... a lack of respect from him to the point where I don't think he... I don't think he cares much for my cleverness. So I have as good a chance as any." 
SAM: You said you were going to wait for your chance and steal the crown. What will you do with it? What will you-- Will you seize power and do something with it? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "It was a metaphor." 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
TRAVIS: So you would have Fearne become the vessel for Predathos to consume the gods, wipe the slate clean, and have your kin preside over all of the realms? 
MATT: "No. Just be free from the uncared for and unwanted guidance of those that have meddled with our affairs since we found them existing." 
MARISHA: So you don't want to bring the Unseelie into our realm. You just want freedom here in the Fey? 
MATT: "I want us all to be free to pursue our natures." 
SAM: That doesn't work for us. (short, quiet laughter) 
MATT: "Why?" 
SAM: Well, we stopped-- We're trying to stop Ludinus from doing the exact thing that it seems like you want to do. 
MATT: "Where do you stand, sweet Fearne?" 
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, everything you're talking about it doesn't sound like you're giving me a say in this. 
MATT: "What is your say?" 
ASHLEY: Well, I don't... I-I don't think we should kill the gods. I don't know. I don't know what the right thing is to do, but I don't want to be in charge. I don't want to wear a crown. I don't even know what being a vessel means. 
LIAM: Orym tilts his chin back towards the emissary. What's the Unseelie Court's position in this? 
MATT: The emissary is just watching Fearne say all this and has a look of disappointment on their face. "The reason we ever even joined Ludinus's plot is we wish to unshackle ourselves from the nature that's been thrust upon us since our creation. Am I to believe and to pass along to Sammanar, that... the child that we've invested so much time and energy and focus into at the twilight hour has no interest in our plans and goals? Is that true?" 
ASHLEY: I don't fully know what your plans and goals are. If you were, let's-- I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. 
MATT: Zathuda puts his hand out and says like, (Zathuda) "She's close. She'll learn. She's grown a bit too comfortable with some, but she'll learn. She knows there's something in her that wants out. Something that takes what it wants. Something that wants to grab and feel unbridled. True freedom. A wild power within. A hunger for something. She'll learn." 
TRAVIS: In our heads. And specifically to Fearne and Braius I'll be like: Hey, we may have to consider playing from the inside, right? 
SAM: I guess, but this might be in your head. It feels like this is the time to get these guys. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: It was just us and them. 
TRAVIS: That's what I was wondering. If we eliminate these two, does the army move with or without them? 
MARISHA: I was about to ask Fearne. 
TRAVIS: It may move regardless of if they have heads or not. 
MARISHA: Emissary? 
SAM: Would be weaker without. 
TRAVIS: Think so? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Sorrowlord, your current plan stays in motion. You will rally your troops, but with nothing more than added knowledge. I am just curious if we intend to face you head to head. And if that is the guise we are all working under. Just curious, what... exactly is the ruse? 
MATT: Sorrowlord collects himself for a minute. Before looking at the emissary and looking past all of you and then just looks back to Fearne. "When the assaults on the Key are crushed, we'll be there waiting and we'll take you straight to where you need to be." 
LAURA: Hmm. No, he's skirting it. When the assaults are crushed. I don't know. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're going to be there. 
LIAM: My mind: We could all jump back in together. Say the word. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's on a razor's edge. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Holy shit, you guys. 
ASHLEY: Should I go with him? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Either we're playing on the inside and seeing where it goes, or we think that removing the two of them. And we're going to pick up a fight with a dragon and him and two guards and an emissary. 
LAURA: We know Gloamglut's going to fight right now. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: It's going to suck. 
TALIESIN: It's also not been hurt yet. 
TRAVIS: Do we think his presence is going to weaken their forces? 
LIAM: The alternative is facing Sorrowlord and his dragon alongside a fully charged in person Ludinus or fill in the blank on Mars. 
MARISHA: Well, it sounds like eventually they'll reach a point where the Sorrowlord turns on Ludinus. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: And he helps us take that fucker down. Also, it sounds like he's offering, like, a... one way direct flight-- 
TRAVIS: We could get on the inside. 
MARISHA: -- to the inside of the moon when it's time. 
ROBBIE: It's a deal with the devil. For sure. 
TRAVIS: And we could help save-- 
TALIESIN: There's nothing but devil words. 
TRAVIS: We could help save a larger force being ambushed or smashed. We could glean what we could from the inside, but we're going to be excommunicado one way or the other. And playing to lose. 
MARISHA: Yeah. That's correct. 
TRAVIS: Which is awesome. 
MARISHA: I mean, it means-- right. Because it means, like, we will be taking all the armies that we are gathering the Ashari and the Hand and all that. Knowingly throwing them in here and people will die. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Armies, we will be knowingly throwing armies-- 
TRAVIS: Or not. 
MARISHA: -- against armies. 
TRAVIS: Right. And when we do that, they'll know that we're flipped. 
ROBBIE: And-- 
LIAM: Or we could finish the job here. Create the story that Ludinus wiped everyone out here and hope that the Unseelie Court despises the Vanguard. 
MATT: The Sorrowlord puts his hand up and Gloamglut (heavy footsteps) lowers its head and rubs it against his hand as he pets the side of his fey dragon. 
MARISHA: Aw! He's humanizing him. 
TRAVIS: Fearne what? What Fearne? 
SAM: Or Fearne can just go. 
MATT: Climbs up. 
SAM: And we could go our separate ways. 
LAURA: He climbs up. He's on the dragon. We talked too long. 
MATT: He climbs up onto Sorrowlord, climbs up onto Gloamglut and gives him hand down to the emissary. Gloamglut reaches down and puts a hand out to grasp. The emissary is now climbing onto Gloamglut. But-- 
MARISHA: What are we doing? What are we doing? 
ASHLEY: May I walk up? 
MATT: The two other guardians begin to step out-- 
ASHLEY: Please! 
MATT: -- through the small-- 
LAURA: Just do it. Walk right up. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk up to close enough to where I can maybe pet Gloamglut's head and to where he, Sorrowlord could maybe hear me. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I follow her like a page. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Well, we're all probably near the platform now. 
LIAM: I'm on the dais. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: We're all down there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, so you both just-- 
SAM: In case this sets off. 
MATT: You all appear on the dais, then? 
LIAM: Yeah. Just get us together for a fireblast. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, just-- 
MATT: Wherever you guys want to be. 
ASHLEY: I hate this, I hate this. 
MATT: Bless, at this point, is faded. 
LIAM: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Zathuda? 
MATT: "Aye." 
ASHLEY: May I pet him? 
MATT: "Of course." 
SAM: Whoa! 
ROBBIE: Wha! One problem, though. 
MATT: You're still flying, right? 
LAURA: I am. 
MATT: Alongside them, or--? 
LAURA: Yeah. No, I'm kind of close. I wouldn't have flown away. I'd probably be alongside. Yeah, I went a little up into the side of Gloamglut's face. 
MATT: Okay, so you want to be over here? 
LAURA: I was picturing right on the backside. 
MATT: On this side? Over here? 
LAURA: Yeah. Right there. 
ROBBIE: As Fearne's walking up, making this approach just really quick. She hears in the back of her head from Dorian. Just a simple question. And she goes: Fearne, when you think of the word "father," who do you think of? 
ASHLEY: Nana Morri? (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
ROBBIE: All right. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: He's up on his reins, clutching them. The emissary is clambering up behind to hold on as you put your hand out. He gives a nod and Gloamglut "(growls)" its head lowers down towards you. Its massive, like, milky, clouded eyes. Its jaws "(creepy reverberations)" 
SAM: Eurgh! 
ASHLEY: Where does he like to be scritched? 
MATT: Do you ask this question? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: "The tip of its upper face, between the eyes and above the mouth." 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll just gently try to give him some scritch. Good boy. 
LAURA: I'm going to Psychic Lance Sorrowlord, when she does that. 
MATT: Oh shit! 
ROBBIE: (through gritted teeth) Yeah... 
MATT: Oh, okay. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Do you have something to go behind that? 
ASHLEY: I was thinking on it. 
LAURA: Oh, go? 
ASHLEY: Okay? No? 
LAURA: Go. 
SAM: Do your thing. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I was going to try to reach out to Sorrowlord, because I want to whisper something to him. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
SAM: Okay, do that first. 
ROBBIE and ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
LIAM: I'm going to follow-- if just real quick. If I see her do that, I've got a follow up to it. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. I'm-- We're-- 
TRAVIS: Go Fearne. 
ASHLEY: So when he gets-- When he-- I just want to whisper something to him. I heard what you said. I have felt a fire inside. 
MARISHA: Oh fuck! 
ASHLEY: And I would like to learn. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Please show me. 
MATT: Okay. Psychic Lance. 
LAURA: I'm sorry, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. 
MATT: So, intelligence saving throw. He has advantage on it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I mean, it is if she doesn't stop it. 
SAM: You could still stop. 
MATT: Oh, fails that! That is 7d6 psychic damage? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: And incapacitation. 
LIAM: Oh man! If that's happening, Orym runs up Gloamglut's tail a bit, and I'm going to, with Seedling-- 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
LIAM: -- send out a Grasping Vine-- 
LAURA: Look. 
LIAM: -- to the emissary and get him down. 
LAURA: I don't want Predathos free. Two, three, four, five, six. So. 
ROBBIE: I agree. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
TALIESIN: Are we taking a fucking surprise round? 
LAURA: Oh god, I rolled like shit. 
MATT: It's not a surprise round. 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: Everyone's tense and everyone's waiting for something to drop, so this just sets off the flame. 
MARISHA: Do we still try and keep-- 
LAURA: 24. 
MARISHA: -- the emissary alive? 
MATT: 24 points of psychic damage. Oh man! All right. So. 
ROBBIE: Well, yeah-- 
MATT: As you whisper this, he nods to you and you can see him smile through his helmet and then immediately, "Ugh!" His eyes go wide and his jaw slackens as a little bit of drool drips down the chin. His body tenses and he pulls the reins as Gloamglut (screeches) begins to pull back. He is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: All right. You said you were waiting for that. 
LIAM: Knowing her abilities and seeing what she's done, I know that Imogen has popped off. And I don't want him to fly out of here with the emissary. I want to control the narrative. So I try to run up Gloamglut's body a bit to get in range to Grasping Vine-- 
MATT: Acrobatics check to rush up a shifting and moving Gloamglut. 
LIAM: Yeah. That is acrobatics. That's a 19. 
MATT: 19. Okay. Yeah. You're able to leap onto its knee and leap onto where its head is pulling back, and you bounce off of it. Release the vine towards the emissary. 
LIAM: Right. So strength save DC 17. 
MATT: DC 17... Emissary. Not very high. Okay, that was a natural 20, though. 
LIAM: Oh! Okay. 
MARISHA: Whoa! 
MATT: Sorry. 
LIAM: That's it. 
MARISHA: Uh! Uh! Silvery Barbs. 
MATT: Silvery Barbs? Okay. That's going to be a 12. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Boosh! 
MATT: So the emissary "(yelps)" gets yanked off the top and pummels off the side, or plummets off the side, arcing as you leap and land and catch yourself. The emissary falls and takes from that height. It's 30 feet, so it's 3d6 bludgeoning damage. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: 11 points of bludgeoning damage. Emissary gets rocked. Not doing great. 
LIAM: I'm going to use the grasp to 
MATT: (heavy impact) 
LIAM: -- pull him yo-yo all the way up to my feet. 
MATT: All righty. Gets dragged up to your point there. All righty. So we are returning to initiative order now. 
MARISHA: Are we killing your dad? Are we killing your dad? 
ROBBIE: (gigantic groan) 
MARISHA: (whispers) Killing your dad? 
LIAM: At a second glance-- 
ROBBIE: That's why I asked. 
LIAM: -- I think we are. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: I didn't want Predathos free. 
SAM: I guess we're doing this. 
LAURA: I didn't want Predathos free. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: What's happening? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to-- Okay. 
MATT: Well, we're back in the initiative order now. 
MARISHA: Same order? 
MATT: You know what? Fuck it, let's reroll. 
ROBBIE: Ah! 
LAURA: Rebrand. 
TRAVIS: I peed longer than "A League of Her Own." (laughter) 
MATT: Let's do it. 
TRAVIS: The longest piss of my life. 
MATT: All righty. Oh, okay. 
ROBBIE: Come on. 
MARISHA: Orym got the emissary at his feet. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Yanked him off the ground in the chasm. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MARISHA: So we have the-- He's got the emissary. 
LAURA: On the ground? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. And then-- Oh, okay. There we go. 
TRAVIS: Did she Psychic Lance Athion Zathuda? 
MATT: Now we're getting-- 
LAURA: They did. They did 24 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: I don't want dad to be able to fly him out of here and help him report back. 
LAURA: I know. 
MARISHA: No, 100%. Because if we could still get the Unseelie at least to back the fuck off. 
LAURA: He's incapacitated-- 
MATT: Okay. So 25 to 20. 
LAURA: -- until my turn. 
LIAM: 22. 
MARISHA: It's cocked. Hang on. Wait, it was cocked. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, wait, what did I-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Orym, you rolled what? 
LIAM: 22. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: So Orym. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 20 to 15. 
LAURA: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
TALIESIN: 15. 
TRAVIS and SAM: 15. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
MATT: Okay. Hold on. 
TALIESIN: Rollies? 
LAURA: Triple Rollies. 
SAM: Triple Rollies? 
TRAVIS: Dexes? 
MARISHA: All right.. Yeah, 15, let's go. See who got it 
MARISHA and SAM: Triple rollies. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I got a 17. Sorry. 
MATT: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Sorry. Orym-- 
LAURA: Imogen. Fearne. 
MARISHA: Fearne. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Orym, Imo, Fearne. 
TRAVIS: Wait. What? 
MARISHA: Orym, Imogen, Fearne, and then triple Rollies. 
MATT: So what's the Rollies at? What do we got? 
SAM: 14. 
TRAVIS: 18. 
TALIESIN: Five. 
LIAM: Triple Rollies. 
LAURA: Okay. Chet. 
MATT: Okay, so we got Chet-- 
LAURA: Braius, Chet. 
MATT: Braius and Ashton. 
LAURA: Braius. 
MATT: What you got over there, Dorian? 
ROBBIE: I got 14 again. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Consistency. 
ROBBIE: Exact same roll. 
LAURA: Then what'd you get, Laudna? 
MATT: Laudna? 
MARISHA: A nine. 
MATT: Okay. Got it. All right, so Orym, you're up first as you drag the emissary to the ground. They are beat to shit and like "(grunts)" being pulled by the vine and they look like their eyes wide are like, "This all went to shit." 
LIAM: Yeah, for sure. Because it did. 
TALIESIN: Ira, are you getting in on this? 
LIAM: Can I ask a question that's taken me this long to wonder the answer to. The Grasping Vine for Seedling says, ♪ Da-da-ba-da-dip-i-dee ♪ "You can conjure grasping vine per the spell Grasping Vine." Does that mean it comes with a concentration of-- 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Okay. So-- 
MATT: If you take damage, you have to roll to see if you maintain it. 
LIAM: Yes, and it also means Hex, which is concentration, is dropped if I choose to use Seedling's-- It's not baked into Seedling. So what I'm going to do is run back 30 feet, and the vine is still active for a minute. I'm going to use it to drag this dude back to the column. 
MATT: You can move half your movement dragging somebody else with you. 
LIAM: Sorry. The vine unspools and grows while I run with it, and then I zipline it back in. I mean-- 
MATT: They get to make a save again. 
LIAM: The physics of-- Sure. 
MATT: So, yeah. 
MATT: So you get to move back and then pull him the second time. 
LIAM: Drag him another-- They fail. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You can do that Batman grapple. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: We can go back to plan A: Bring the building down. 
MARISHA: We could, we could. 
TALIESIN: It's probably going to do it on its own. 
MARISHA: We would need to get out of it, out of here. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, that finishes-- 
LIAM: That's a bonus action-- 
MATT: That's your bonus action and your movement. Yeah. 
LIAM: -- for Grasping Vine. I'm going to non-lethal this dude, and we can decide later. I'm going to (thunk) with the base of Seedling. 
MATT: Roll for attacks. 
LIAM: Okay. First is a 23 to hit. 
MATT: 23? Yeah. That hits. 
LIAM: Non-lethal. 11. 
MATT: 11 damage. All righty. 
LIAM: Next one's probably not going to do it. It's a 16? 
MATT: 16 does not hit, unfortunately. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: No, no! Actually, no. 16 just hits. 
LIAM: Okay. So it's also non-lethal. 14 
MATT: 14. Okay. 
LIAM: Last one was I rolled a 10, plus, it is 23. 
MATT: 23. That hits. 
LIAM: And that is 10. 
MATT: With that, they are unconscious and wrapped in your vine. 
LIAM: And that's it. I stand over them. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: And watch the scene. 
MATT: All righty. Sorrowlord starts his action. 
TALIESIN: Is he not incapacitated? 
LAURA: Incapacitated. 
MATT: Yeah. So he can't do anything. His turn is in the reins like, "(grunts)." 
LIAM: Dragon's okay, though. 
MATT: Clutching on. That finishes his go. It is now the emissary's turn. Emissary's unconscious. Can't do anything. They rolled really high initiative, but can't do anything this round. Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Is the emissary dying? 
MATT: Emissary is unconscious. 
LIAM: He's out. 
LAURA: He's unconscious. 
SAM: But, like-- 
TALIESIN: Stabilized. 
SAM: -- stable? 
MATT: Yeah. Orym ensured to make sure he wasn't doing lethal damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. Well that's good, that's good. Holy shit. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- What do I have? What do I have? 
SAM: I would've like to see you go. 
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry. 
ASHLEY: No, my god! Don't be sorry. Don't be sorry. 
MARISHA: We making strong choices. 
ASHLEY: We're making…we're making strong choices and we roll with it! 
MATT: That's what it's about. That's what it's about. 
MARISHA: We make movements! 
LAURA: I'm going to do it again. I'm going to try to Psychic Lance him again, but at 6th-level. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I will look up a thing. 
MATT: All right. Intelligence saving throw. He does have advantage on this because it's a spell. 
TALIESIN: I got to look up a thing. Come here. Looking up a thing. 
MATT: 17 is the highest he got. 
LAURA: Yes! Okay, great. So that's 9d6 psychic damage. ♪ Da, da, da, da, da ♪ (gasps) Okay. Three, 18, 20, 24... 
MATT: Fearne, you're almost on deck. Not after this turn, it's coming. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: 29 points of psychic damage. 
MATT: Ooh! Okay. 
LAURA: And he's incapacitated again. 
MATT: Again, until the beginning of your next turn. So he just starts to clear his head before (sharp lance) another time, blood rushes from his nose as he doubles over and almost falls out of the saddle of Gloamglut and holds on, barely tangling himself in one of the reins and kind of falls out of the saddle, but is now just dangling a foot out of it right now. 
LAURA: I'm going to fly up to Ira. 
MATT: 60 feet, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. That's about as close as you can get there. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Maybe a little bit closer. We'll say you're a little higher there. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right, cool. That finishes your go? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: It is now Gloamglut's go. 
ROBBIE: Oh no. 
MATT: Gloamglut shrieks. Let's see if-- It's been a few minutes of talking. Yeah, it gets its thing back. 
LIAM: Wow. 
MATT: Gloamglut-- 
LAURA: For a bonus action-- 
SAM: But you don't have to be there if that's not where you-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, no. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MATT: This is also going to, because it lasts a minute, right? 
LAURA: For a bonus action on my turn-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm trying to-- Sorry, the Havoc's Embrace is in really weird places. I just got to find it. I got to see if it's casting. Oh, you know what? 
MARISHA: Long first half, y'all. 
LAURA: Shit. Fuck it. Never mind. 
LIAM: It might just be a one off. 
LAURA: Forget me 
TALIESIN: Combat game. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Second half's going to be like 30 minutes. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh god, oh god. Okay. 
MATT: All right? All right, so Gloamglut-- 
LAURA: Oh! Oh! I'm sorry. As a bonus action, I'm going to light up my robe. I hadn't had it lit up yet. 
MATT: You got it. All the different glyphs and stuff-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: -- alight around it. Gloamglut, who in the middle of hearing its owner yell out in pain twice, you rushing off and pulling the emissary from its top, is going to try and rush over to grab the emissary, flying in this direction. 
MARISHA: No, no, no, no ,no. 
MATT: It's going to grab onto the side of the wall and the pillar. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
TALIESIN: Yep! 
MATT: I want to see-- Fearne, roll a d20 for me. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: 13. 
MATT: 13. 
TALIESIN: Magic number. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: It's a good one. 
TRAVIS: North of 10. 
MATT: (laughs) Oh, it gets more each time. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: So the impact of the DC on this is 12. It'll just get higher with each thing. So the pillar cracks even more. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: This is the pillar. Got it. 
MATT: More stones begin to fall and you watch is a crack goes (crack spreads through stone) and spider up the side of the interior here. The two guards that were rushing in to help the emissary see this and turn around. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah! (laughs enthusiastically) 
MARISHA: That is correct. 
TRAVIS: We're not paid enough. 
TALIESIN: You might want to drop that Forcecage eventually. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Mm-hmm. Gloamglut is now going to unleash a volley of attacks on you-- 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: -- Orym. Since you're the one pulling away the emissary. 
LIAM: Yeah, sure. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: So it's a rend and a tail attack on you. Rend attack is going to be a 21 to hit? 
LIAM: For sure hits. 
MATT: All righty. You take-- 
LIAM: Here we go. 
TALIESIN: Doesn't sound too bad. 
MATT: Not too bad. 21 points of slashing damage. 
LIAM: Okay. But I'm immune to dragon damage. 
MATT: The tail attack is going to be a 27 to hit. 
LIAM: Hits a little bit. Hits a little bit. 
TALIESIN: That's good to know. Good to know. 
MARISHA: You're okay. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: That hits you for 15 points of bludgeoning damage. I need you to make a strength saving throw. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Good to know. Good enough. 
LIAM: Looking something up real quick before I do that. 
MATT: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm with you, I'm with you. 
MATT: Then, Fearne, you're on deck with-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: -- with Chet after that. 
LIAM: Okay, so I roll. It's a natural one, so I'll reroll it. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Let's just start there. 
MATT: You guys are getting ones and 20s these whole past couple-- 
LIAM: Okay. That's a nine, but I'm going to burn a superiority die and use Zephyran Heart. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: And try to increase it to make it workable. Roll high. It's a 10. So 19. 
MATT: 19. You are not knocked prone as the tail slams past you. 
LIAM and LAURA: (gasps of relief) 
MATT: The tail attack does hit the pillar. (nervous exclamations) 
MATT: Because it's a spinning tail strike that whips around to try and get you. 
MATT: Roll another d20. 
SAM: Oh no. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
SAM: What happens if we are buried in this shit. 
MATT: A 14 or higher is what you want. 
MARISHA: It's going to suck so badly. 
LAURA: Well, hopefully we have reactions. 
ASHLEY: A three. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: It slams the pillar, splatters across the side of the wall. Bits of stone go flying off to the side. Immediately-- (many spreading cracks) 
ASHLEY: Oh god! 
MARISHA: Not good, not good. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: Parts of the temple begin to fall and crack. The place has begun to collapse. 
MARISHA: This was a really good idea when we weren't in here. 
TRAVIS: We're in the third or fourth phase of this plan. 
MATT: Fearne, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Changed each time. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
ROBBIE: It's going down, one way or the other. 
SAM: What are we doing? 
LAURA: We're trying to kill him. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Kill. Kill and run. Kill and run. 
SAM: Kill Zathuda? 
LIAM: Get him off that dragon. Let him get crashed in here. 
ASHLEY: Are we killing him? 
TRAVIS: If we stay in here, we might get crushed. (laughs) 
MATT: What are you doing, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Shit! 
ASHLEY: (anxious moan) 
SAM: Patricide. 
TALIESIN: Take his sword. Loot his body. 
ASHLEY: I want to do something, but I don't know if it's dumb. 
LIAM: He's just lying there. 
SAM: You can never do anything dumb. 
LAURA: Just do it. 
ASHLEY: That's not true. 
SAM: You're perfect. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: The entirety of the temple to the Arch Heart is currently about to collapse. What are you doing, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Okay. You're going to, everybody in your heads, you're going to hear: Get out of here! I love you! Chet, you know how to find me. I'm going to reach up to Papa and say: Please get me out of here. I want to come with you. 
MARISHA: It's true. There is a-- Okay. 
MATT: He is currently dangling, and his brain is scrambled. 
LAURA: I have him incapacitated. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, that's right. I'm going to-- 
MATT: He's like "(grunts)" 
ASHLEY: Then I'm going to climb up. I'm going to climb up. I'm going to try to climb up Gloamglut. and get him up there, and try to get onto Gloamglut and get out of the building. 
MATT: Make an animal handling check. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
ROBBIE: Do it. Do it. 
LAURA: Can you guide yourself? 
ROBBIE: Yes, I love this. 
LAURA: No, you can't. I always forget. 
LIAM: Dark chocolate. 
ASHLEY: What do I use? What do I use? I'm going to use this one. 
LIAM: Black forest cake, rich. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Rich! 
MARISHA: Well, this changes things. 
ASHLEY: That's cocked. 
SAM: Super cocked. 
ASHLEY: Super cocked. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Ooh, that was a journey. 18? 
MATT: 18. In the midst of all this chaos and everything tumbling around, you try and get Gloamglut's attention to try and find a way to climb. You begin to climb up a little bit and he thrashes and it knocks you off. So he's not helping you climb. So it's a contested roll to try and climb him. Make an athletics check for me. 
TRAVIS: With advantage because the scritches earlier. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Athletics or acrobatics. Your choice. You could either try and muscle your way up there, or you can try and parkour your way up there, essentially. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Both not awesome. 
ROBBIE: It's time for a nat 20. 
ROBBIE: It's time for another one. 
ASHLEY: Acrobatics is a litter better. 
ROBBIE: Let's go. 
LAURA: No, acrobatics is worse. 
ASHLEY: Acrobatics is a plus two. Athletics is a minus two. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Come on, let's do it. 
ASHLEY: Come on. Come on. Oh! You bitch! Five. 
LAURA: (groans) 
MATT: You try and leap up, and as-- 
ASHLEY: I knew I shouldn't have rolled that one. 
MATT: -- the wings of Gloamglut begin to pick up, because it now senses, its self-preservation is now taking over. As you try and leap up, one of the wings just bats you back and you tumble back and hit the ground, get back up onto your hooves. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So that's going to be your turn. You get pushed back a little bit here-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's my turn, that's my turn. That's okay, that's okay. 
MATT: -- and catch yourself. 
ASHLEY: That's okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Can you turn into bird or something? 
MATT: Chetney, you're up with Braius on deck with Ashton following. What you got? 
TRAVIS: We're getting the fuck out of here, right? 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Boots of speed, I will run off the dais and try and squeeze through the door, where…whence we came. 
MATT: Yeah. Boots of speed. That's twice your speed there. It's going to be-- 
MATT and TRAVIS: 80 feet. 
MATT: Yeah, you can with that and a dash, you can get out of the temple. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll do it. 
MATT: All right. You actually emerge out into the wood out there. That finishes your go. Braius, you're up with Ashton on deck. 
SAM: Shit. Where is Fearne Calloway? 
MATT: Fearne Calloway is right here. She just got knocked back a little bit from trying to climb the wing. 
SAM: Okay. I will run to Fearne Calloway. Boy, I don't know what I'm doing. Let's just try this. I'm going to run to Fearne Calloway. How damaged are you? 
ASHLEY: I'm not terrible. I'm like 30 something down. 
SAM: Okay. I will hold her over my head and I will cast Thunderwave on her to shoot her up 15 feet. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Get her on the-- 
ASHLEY: Oh! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: That's sick. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay, okay. 
ROBBIE: Get her on the dragon? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: On the dragon! 
MATT: So you pick her up. 
SAM: Here's a boost. 
MATT: You do take damage. So roll damage for Thunderwave. 
ROBBIE: Low, low, low, low! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! Ow! Whoa! Ow! 
SAM: What's the lowest Thunderwave I can cast? 
MATT: Level one is the lowest you can do. 
SAM: Except I don't have any. Oh, wait. Level one? Oh, I do! I do have a level one. Okay, good, good, good, good, good. So it's 2d8. A two and a four, six points of damage. 
MATT: Six points of thunder damage to you. 
ASHLEY: That's great. 
MATT: You're not attempting to avoid this, so you take the full brunt, there's no saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But it does launch you 15 feet in an arc up here. I will allow you one more contested roll to try and get onto it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Bonus action, Inspiration. 
MATT: So what do you do to inspire her as you throw her? 
SAM: I goose her little bottom as I-- (laughter) 
MATT: All righty. You have a d6 inspiration die. 
LIAM: Squeeze. Bam! 
MATT: Either athletics or acrobatics check, contested once more. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. Okay. Dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: 17 was the total that he rolled. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: So you-- 
TRAVIS: Oh man. 
ROBBIE: Let's go! 
TRAVIS: Oh man. 
MATT: You are up on the side of Gloamglut now. 
MARISHA: So wait, where's the emissary? 
MATT: The emissary is dragged off at the base of it. Unconscious and wrapped in a vine currently by Orym. 
LAURA: We got to get him out of here. 
MARISHA: So we're trying to get the emissary out? 
MATT: All right. Braius, you finish your turn? 
SAM: Yes, yes. 
MATT: All right. Ashton, you're up. 
SAM: Oh, wait. 
LIAM: I don't want them-- 
SAM: Do I have any movement left? 
LIAM: -- to report back to the Unseelie. 
MATT: To get there, that would've been five, 10, 15, 20, 25. You have five more feet. 
SAM: I'll step back five feet. 
MARISHA: Her going on a-- 
MATT: Okay, I'll put you up there. 
MARISHA: -- dragon with her dad is changing things. 
MATT: You clamber back up onto the dais. All right. Finishing that, Ashton, you're up, with Dorian on deck. 
TALIESIN: I'm raging. Just because I know that a whole bunch of terrible shit is about to happen. 
LIAM: It'll help her be our enemy. 
TALIESIN: What does that give me? 
MARISHA: Well, it's going to go one way or another. 
ASHLEY: It's going to go one way or another. If he dies, he dies. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that's a whole thing. 
MARISHA: The dragon has taken zero damage, right? 
TALIESIN: Dragon has not had shit. 
MATT: The dragon has taken no damage. 
SAM: Cool. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- Is the mud pit still here, by the way? 
MATT: The mud pit lasts-- Actually, let me see. 
TALIESIN: That was my question. 
MARISHA: What if your dad dies, but you still ride triumphantly back to the Seelie, and you're like: I'm your leader now. 
MATT: Until dispelled. 
ASHLEY: It's fine. 
MATT: So yeah. 
TALIESIN: So still there. 
MATT: Still the mud pit on that side. Everyone's been sloshing through as they walk around it. 
LAURA: So we kill your dad. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: We'll see what happens. 
ASHLEY: What are you going to do? 
TALIESIN: -- grab, who's definitely having issues? Where's Imogen? Out of curiosity. 
LAURA: I'm in the sky. 
MATT: Imogen is flying up. 
TALIESIN: Orym, you're over there? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Are you going to be okay to run? Are you going to need some help? 
LIAM: I'm fine. 
TALIESIN: Are you sure? Okay. 
LIAM: I'm where I want to be. 
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to take... Fuck. We're going. I'm taking 80 feet out the door, I suppose. 
MATT: Okay. That'll get you most of the way over there. We'll say you're near the exit. We'll place you there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Dorian's go. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to use my movement. I'm going to sprint as fast as I can over to the unconscious emissary. 
MATT: Uh-huh. MARISHA. This is bananas. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, can you get-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah. So I'm going to lean down to him and say: I need just a minute with you. I'm going to throw him over my shoulder and cast Dimension Door. 
TRAVIS: Atta boy! 
TALIESIN: Sweet! 
TRAVIS: Atta boy. 
ROBBIE: The place that I visualize, right? Because I can imagine it. 
LAURA: Within 500 feet. 
ROBBIE: 500 feet, which could get me outside for sure. 
MATT: Oh, yeah. 
ROBBIE: I want to be in that same marshy spot where I was face down, ass up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm going take us both together. I've got him, but we're down in the thing. 
LIAM: He's unconscious. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
MATT: You got it. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that's it. That's my turn. 
SAM: You're holding his head. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: It's so dreamy. 
MATT: All right, that finishes Dorian's go. 
ROBBIE: Yep. 
MATT: Ira, who's up there watching all this happen, seeing Zathuda on the edge, you up on the side, is like-- Is just staring daggers at Zathuda with a smile. He is going to... 
ROBBIE: Wait, where were you in the initiative? Yeah, you're after me. But Ira's first. 
MARISHA: Wait, Braius, did you go? 
ROBBIE: I'm before you. 
SAM: I went. I just helped Fearne. 
ROBBIE: It goes Braius, Ash, me. 
MARISHA: You did. You did. 
MATT: He is going to bonus action go into his nightmare form. His body seems to be suffused in shadow, his limbs extending a bit. His ears get longer, his jaw kind of extends like Venom, more teeth. His pale coloring goes to a darker shadow form, his eyes glowing amidst the darkness now, their black darkness now flipping to almost a pale white against the black skin of his body. As the shadows whip around, he gets down low and (swoosh) leaps through the air. He's attempting to leap onto the back. 
LAURA and LIAM: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Yeah boy! 
MATT: Yeah, with a natural 17, he does it! 
LAURA: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Fucking A. Oh my god. 
SAM: Oh my god! It's the whole family. 
MATT: He leaps onto the back. He clambers over to Sorrowlord Zathuda. Is like, "I've wanted to do this for so long," and is going to attempt to slice into him. Now, because he's incapacitated, I believe he has advantage on this? 
LAURA: Hold on, let me check. 
TALIESIN: At the very least, yeah. 
MATT: Incapacitated, checking my thing here. Oh, just can't take actions or reactions. So it just-- 
LAURA: Okay, so you don't get ad-- 
MATT: No. He's just going to attack him twice. That's going to be-- Ooh! Natural 18. That definitely hits. And a five is not going to hit. So he's going hit for-- Where's the 12s? There. Ooh! Okay. That's 11 plus three. 
MARISHA: This is so layered. 
MATT: I know. 
ASHLEY: This is so layered! 
MARISHA: This is so complicated. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, it's awesome. It's awesome. 
ASHLEY: Because every move we're making-- 
LAURA: There's a bunch of different outcomes here. 
MARISHA: I know! 
ASHLEY: There is. 
MATT: But then he gets another six necrotic damage because of his nightmare form. The second attack. 
MARISHA: Splitting dimensions-- 
ASHLEY: Nana Morri is like: (frantic bumbling) 
MARISHA: -- or timelines. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, that finishes his go. Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: Okay, I... The Sorrowlord, how's he looking? Is he looking bad? 
MATT: He's looking, from what you can see, you just watched him dump forward as suddenly, climbing up behind him on the dragon, you see nightmare form Ira reach over and slash a big gout of his throat that sprays blood and the Sorrowlord doubles over, grabbing it as he's starting to shake free from her scrambled mess in his brain as Ira is now standing over him, blood on his claw, like, "(menacing laugh)" 
MARISHA: Do you want to go back to the Unseelie? 
ASHLEY: I don't know. 
MARISHA: Do you want the dragon to live? 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: You want the dragon to live? 
SAM: She's on the dragon. 
ASHLEY: The dragon, yes. 
MARISHA: You want this pet dragon? 
ASHLEY: I kind of do. 
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs) 
SAM: It's her birthright. 
MARISHA: It is. So, wait. Wait. Do attacks on the Sorrowlord have an advantage right now? 
MATT: Mm-mm. 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: He just can't take any actions or move. 
MARISHA: I'm going to use another Void Puppet. Throw it up there. I want it to emanate almost from Ira as it wraps around, this screaming spirit wraps around the Sorrowlord. I'm going to cast Disintegrate onto the Sorrowlord. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
TRAVIS: You're going to cast-- 
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: What?! 
ASHLEY: Ex-squeeze me?! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You have what spell? 
MARISHA: This is new-ish. New-ish. It's just it hasn't been a right moment to use it. 
TALIESIN: Yes, that is what it does. 
MATT: All right, so go ahead. It's a save. Dexterity save. 
MARISHA: It's a dex save. He has disadvantage. 
MATT: Well, he has advantage, because he's a fey, against magic. So he just has a singular roll. 
LIAM: Single roll. 
MATT: I'm going to roll this here. 
LIAM: All or nothing. 
ROBBIE: Oh, this is so determinative. 
TRAVIS: Jesus! 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a big one. 
MATT: It's a dex save, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. All or nothing. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm shaking. All the damage or no damage. 
MATT: Plus one. That's a 19. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs? 
MATT: I fucking love that spell. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: So fucking-- 
TRAVIS: What does it do? What does it do? 
MARISHA: He has to reroll it. 
MATT: Has to reroll it. 
ROBBIE: Oh, that's so mean. 
TRAVIS: I don't think you meant it when you said you love it. 
MATT: It's universally despised by anyone who plays this game as a DM. 
MARISHA: That's my reaction, though, so-- 
MATT: But it's fine. It's in the game. That is your reaction. All right. Well, go ahead and roll damage. 
TRAVIS: What was it? What was it? What was it? 
MARISHA: It was a natural-- 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Seven! 
MATT: It was a seven, plus one. 
MARISHA: It was a seven? 
MARISHA: I thought it looked like a natural one for us. 
MATT: So, eight. So roll damage. 
TALIESIN: Do you need to borrow dice? 
LAURA: Don't crack your neck like that, Marisha. It's so bad for you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's bad for you. Stop it, stop it. 
LAURA: You could really-- 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I feel bubbling in my head. 
TRAVIS: Just crack your neck and loosen up a little bit. You want some d6s? I think you need 10 of them, right? 
MARISHA: I need-- 
LIAM: Dice plus 40. 
MARISHA: I need 10d6. 
TRAVIS: Here's five. 
TALIESIN: You need more? 
MARISHA: One, two, three, four five. Thank you. 
LIAM: Plus 40. 
LAURA: Is this your 7th-level? 
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five. 
LIAM: I think that's it. 
MARISHA: Is it bad if I kill your dad? 
TALIESIN: A little late! 
ASHLEY: I mean-- 
TRAVIS: You're not asking the question now, you're disintegrating somebody! 
ROBBIE: Her dad's Nana Morri! 
TRAVIS: You've never even done it before! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's tried to hurt Nana, so. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Some sixes! 
ROBBIE: That's a lot of sixes. 
TRAVIS: There's a bunch of sixes! 
MARISHA: I'm going to use my sorcery points to-- I'm shaking. I can't-- -- to empower a spell. 
LAURA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ! This got weird so fast. 
LAURA: That adds extra damage. 
MARISHA: It allows me to reroll. 
LAURA: Oh, reroll the small numbers. 
ASHLEY: What is this face? 
MARISHA: To reroll the small ones. 
MATT: Up to your charisma modifier. 
MARISHA: Which is five. 
MATT: So up to five of them you can reroll. 
MARISHA: I need to just see how many-- Whatever, I have plenty of sorcery points. I'll mark it after this. 
TRAVIS: You only need to reroll four of them. 
MARISHA: So up to five. That is correct. 
TRAVIS: One, two, three, four, five. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, right there. 
MARISHA: One, two. 
TALIESIN: It's getting so weird. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, take the threes. 
MARISHA: Three, four. 
TRAVIS: And one of the fours. 
MARISHA: I guess one of the fours? 
TRAVIS: Now we're at three sixes. 
MARISHA: Unless I should keep it. Oh wait, wait, wait, that was a six. That was a six. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, it was a six. 
TALIESIN: Nothing over three. 
MARISHA: I think you're right. I think you're right. Nothing over three. I'll do these four. 
ASHLEY: Shit, shit, shit. 
TRAVIS: (groans) It's okay. 
MARISHA: Okay okay. 
TRAVIS: It went up a little bit. 
MARISHA: It went up a teeny bit. 
TRAVIS: Actually it went up three. 
MARISHA: Did it go up a teeny bit? That was a one. I'm shaking so bad, you guys. Six, 12, 18. Wait, sorry. Hang on. Shit. Six, 12, 18, 24. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, 24. 24. 
TRAVIS: 30. 
MARISHA: 28. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, 32. 
MARISHA: Yeah, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. Plus 40. So 81 hit points? 
LAURA: That's really good. 
MATT: 81 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LIAM: Disintegrate. 
TRAVIS: Plus 40. 
MATT: Hold on, I got to do some math here. 
LIAM: Disintegrate. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You've just been sitting on Disintegrate all casual, huh? 
MARISHA: Well, we haven't-- 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: ♪ It's been ♪ 
LAURA and ASHLEY: ♪ It's been ♪ 
MATT: You fire off this beam, just waiting for the right moment. Because of all the movement, it's hard to pinpoint it. It's almost like time slows, like (timewarp) You feel that heartbeat from inside. But whereas previously it was a dark portent of a lack of control, it is complete control within you as you draw whatever power within her that you need, combine it with the innate power within you that's now become stronger without her. And together you fire this beam before it strikes the side of the Sorrowlord Zathuda, and you watch as part of his right leg just fritters away into dust. He screams out in pain. He's doing real bad. 
MARISHA: He's still up? 
LAURA: You disintegrated part of him? 
TRAVIS: He's minus a leg. 
ROBBIE: Still up. 
MARISHA: He's still up. 
MATT: He's still up. 
MARISHA: Bonus action. 
SAM: Disintegrate. 
MARISHA: Quicken Spell. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Eldritch Blast. 
MATT: Go for it. I'll say, from where you're standing and him on top of this, he has-- 
MARISHA: I have Spell Sniper. 
MATT: Yeah, you do. Let's go, let's go! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
ASHLEY: ♪ La dee da dee da ♪ 
MARISHA: Ooh! Well, one of those-- Goddamn it! 
TRAVIS: That's all right. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right. 
LAURA: I think you-- You did pretty good on this turn, regardless of Eldritch Blast. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you did really good. 
TRAVIS: Dissapointment! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Probably only one of those hits, which is 16 plus 12, 28. 
MATT: That hits. 
MARISHA: The other one that might, it was 12, 13, 14, I'm assuming misses? 
MATT: That misses, yeah. 
MARISHA: So only one of these hits and the other ones miss. 
MATT: Okay, so roll damage. 
MARISHA: One, which is really annoying. Wait, natural one. Can I reroll that because of you? 
MATT: You're not within range of him, unfortunately. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Yeah, you're just outside of 30 feet from me. 
MARISHA: Okay. 1d10 plus five. 
TRAVIS: This is a fucking nuts ass turn. 12. 
MARISHA: 12 damage. 
MATT: 12 damage. (laughs) Okay. 
TRAVIS: Digits. Single digits, I bet. 
MATT: That finishes your go. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
TRAVIS: Single digit warning. 
MATT: At the end of your turn, Gloamglut is going to use all three of his legendary actions to do his wing attack. 
MARISHA: Hang on. Let me move. Can I move? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: If you want to, yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm going to move-- 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
MARISHA: I want to start-- 
TRAVIS: I'd like to run. 
MARISHA: Yes, start running-- 
MATT: 30 feet this way. That guy is gone, by the way. You can move him out. He has run and sprinted out this way. He's outside. 
TRAVIS: He followed the dog that ran out. 
MATT: Yeah. He's like, "Oh shit!" So you can move 30 feet, almost to where the edge is there. 
MARISHA: Like here? 
MATT: One more this way. 
MARISHA: One more this way? 
MATT: Yeah, there. 
MARISHA: Can I suck my body up against this Forcecage, like I'm in an earthquake, hoping that maybe if the ceiling goes down, it'll help a little? 
MATT: You got it. Okay. So that finished that go. Finishes Laudna's go. Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: It's me. Okay. Orym takes 10 feet running start, and I leap into the air and Seedling lashes out and the vine glues to the top of Gloamglut's neck, and I yank myself up right next to Sorrowlord. 
MATT: Okay. Gloamglut's going to try and avoid this. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Wait. I thought Gloamglut was going to do legendary actions? 
LIAM: Oh, you're right, yeah. 
LAURA: Before Orym? 
LIAM: Before she moved, you were about to do that. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah, you were-- 
TRAVIS: Wing attack. 
MATT: Oh yeah, you're right. Sorry, my bad. 
LAURA: Sorry-- 
MATT: No, thank you for the reminder. I got distracted in the middle of that. So he does three for his wing attack. All creatures within 15 feet have to succeed on a dexterity saving throw. So that is going to be you, Orym. That is going to be, and everyone on top here. 
TALIESIN: Including, well-- 
MATT: Not including Zathuda. 
TALIESIN: Oh, well. 
MATT: But Ira is going to have to try. 
LAURA: And Fearne-- 
MATT: Ira fails by one! Fuck! 
ASHLEY: Okay. Dexterity saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Legendary something? 
MATT: Ira does not have legendary resistances. He just has legendary actions. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS: How disappointing. 
MATT: All right, so. 
LAURA: Did you fail? 
MATT: Imogen. 
LAURA: 14? 
MATT: 14. You take six points of bludgeoning damage and you are pushed back against the wall. Actually, no, you're just knocked prone. So you fall out of the air. You essentially get swept out, and then (plummet). Which means you fall for an additional eight points of bludgeoning damage. Crack on the ground. 
ROBBIE: Oof! 
MATT: Fearne, what'd you get? 
ASHLEY: Six. 
MATT: Six. You take six points of bludgeoning damage and you are thrown from his back. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Which means you take-- 
MARISHA: Shit. 
MATT: -- seven points of bludgeoning damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Ira also takes the damage and he gets knocked back and he falls prone for six damage. Oh, no. Six damage from the hit and then he falls as well for another 12 points of damage. Okay. And then what did you roll? 
LIAM: I didn't. Is it a dex save or-- 
MATT: It's a dex save, yeah. 
LIAM: That is a 18. 
MATT: An 18. All right. You just succeed, so you don't take any damage, and you are not knocked prone. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right, so now it's your turn. 
LIAM: Well, so what I wanted to do was leap into the air with my boots of striding and springing and lash out. And then just hit the saddle, hit the dragon and yank myself up. 
MATT: Right. So Gloamglut's going to try and avoid that. Dexterity saving throw fails. It's going to use a legendary resistance to succeed, so it does not find purchase. 
LIAM: Okay, well. All right. 
MATT: Sometimes that's how it goes. 
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Can I? I know-- 
MATT: So you leap up and send out the vine of Seedling, and it just glances off of the movement of Gloamglut. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LIAM: Okay. Then I'm-- So I guess-- I will, that was-- 
LAURA: I can help on my next turn, if you hold your action. 
LIAM: No, I don't want to do that. That's 10 feet of movement used because the jump doesn't, I didn't go anywhere. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: So I'm going to spring up and try to run up and try to run up its body and leap into the air again to get me anywhere within 15 to 20 feet of this dude. 
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check for me. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: This is contested with Gloamglut. 
LIAM: That is a 24. 
MATT: 27. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: Shit! 
MATT: So as you try to leap up-- 
ASHLEY: Dang! 
MATT: -- it just bats you back out of the way, and you just fall off to the side and hit the wall and catch yourself before landing. 
LIAM: All right, fuck it then. Then I slash the dragon. I'm at right at its feet. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: So. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy! 
MARISHA: Shit, shit, shit. 
LIAM: That is a 27 to hit. 
MATT: 27 to hit. That hits. 
TALIESIN: Are we rolling back in? I guess we're rolling back in. 
SAM: Fearne, are you still up there? 
ASHLEY: No, I got bucked off. 
LAURA: No, she got knocked off. 
SAM: Shit! 
TALIESIN: We got to get daddy. We got to get daddy quick. 
MARISHA: I think he comes after Orym. 
LIAM: I don't want the dragon to fly away with him, so. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. We got to get him off the dragon. 
LIAM: 27 to hit. I'm going to save my juice. So that is nine points of damage. 
TALIESIN: I shouldn't have run. I was on the edge. 
LIAM: Second attack is higher. That's 28 to hit. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: That is 14 points of damage. That's even higher. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I should've stayed. 
LIAM: That is 14 points. 
MATT: Another 14 points. Okay. 
LIAM: I can't believe I didn't get up there. Okay, done. 
MATT: I know. He rolled really high on that. Okay, that finishes that go. It's now Sorrowlord's turn. 
LAURA: He's incapacitated. 
MATT: Incapacitated because of you. Still sits there-- 
SAM: Still? Wow! 
MATT: It lasts until the beginning of her next turn. So he's just holding on for dear life. The... Sorry-- 
MARISHA: Emissary? 
MATT: Emissary, thank you. I was like, what the fuck was it called? 
MARISHA: Still unconscious? 
MATT: Still unconscious. Brings it to Imogen's go, and then Gloamglut's up next. 
LAURA: Okay. I still have Telekinesis up from when we cast it, when I had it before? 
MATT: Correct. Roll, roll concentration to see if you can maintain your Fly spell, by the way. 
LAURA: It wasn't a-- It's not a Fly spell. 
MATT: Oh, just the ability? 
LAURA: Just the ability. 
MATT: Oh right, yeah. So roll to see if you maintain concentration on Telekinesis. 
LAURA: Yeah. What do I add to it? Plus my charisma or my constitution? 
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw. 
LAURA: 15? 
MATT: 15. With the damage you took from the fall there, how much damage did you just take? 
LAURA: Like eight points. 
MATT: It was six. Yeah, on an eight? Yeah, actually it would be two concentration checks, so one succeeds. One was from the impact of the wing and the other was from the fall. 
LAURA: That's higher. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. 
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to use my Telekinesis to grab ahold of Zathuda, and I'm going to try to rip him away from-- 
MATT: Gloamglut? 
LAURA: -- Gloamglut. 
MATT: Okay. He cannot resist because he is incapacitated. Well, no. It's top of your turn. He's no longer incapacitated, so he can resist. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Okay. So, yeah. 
LAURA: This is a contested strength with my spell DC. 
MATT: Yes. Or your spell-- 
LAURA: My spell save. Yeah, my spell save DC. 
MATT: Yeah. I know we're going a little long here, but this is-- I can't make-- (shouts of agreement) 
ASHLEY: We can take a break. We got to, we got to-- 
ROBBIE: Maybe we die. Wait. 
LAURA: Which is now-- which is now 21. 
SAM: Whoa! 
LAURA: Which he's probably going to get. 
MATT: You make an ability check adding your spellcasting modifier. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: You roll, and then he rolls and they're contested. 
LAURA: I roll and he rolls. 
MATT: Yeah. So you roll and you add your charisma bonus. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: He's going to roll and add his strength bonus. 
LAURA: I roll my spell attack DC? Spell attack bonus or just charisma? 
MATT: You just add your charisma bonus. It's, yeah, your spell ability. 
LAURA: (sighs) Fuck. Spell ability. 
MARISHA: Probably your, like... is it the modifier? 
LAURA: Yeah, I would my-- 
MATT: This is an ability check. 
LAURA: Ability check. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: It's just an ability check. 
MATT: An ability check. You're rolling. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. An ability check with your spellcasting ability. 
LAURA: Okay, that's 14. 
MATT: 14? Natural five for a 10. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY and LIAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: So (whooshes). 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: Oh no! I rip them away. I can move them 30 feet. So I'm going to pull him up and away. Up the ceiling. 
MATT: Yep. 
LAURA: I'm going to try to drop him down right in front of Braius. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Oh shit! 
MATT: So you're going to (whooshes) up here? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Please, lord, give me a sign. (laughter) 
MATT: Crack! 
LAURA: If I can aim it at all, I want him to land here. So he cracks his back. 
MATT: 30 feet will be about there. That's as far as you can get him at an angle there. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: So he plummets with an additional, like, 20 feet up and a 10 feet to get him that direction to drop from higher. Dropping him there, that's going to be 40 feet. So he's going to take 4d6. Roll 4d6 for me. That's how much bludgeoning damage he takes as he falls. 
SAM: Do you want us to kill your father or keep him alive or what? 
ASHLEY: (whines) I don't know. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I have a-- I don't like making the decision about that. 
SAM: Are we killing her dad or-- 
LAURA: 14 points of bludgeoning damage. 
MATT: Okay. He is unconscious. 
ROBBIE: He's dead? 
MARISHA: He's unconscious? 
LAURA: Unconscious. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: He hits the middle of the dais. As he hits, the impact blasts back all of the vines here. In the middle of the central stone piece, where they get shattered with the blast of impact. You can see all these wonderful, intricate carvings of beautiful threads weaving together. In the middle is the face of... the Arch Heart, just looking upward and smiling as he lays unconscious across the dais. That's your action. 
TALIESIN: Grab him and run! We're going! 
MATT: Half your movement to get up. That gives you 15 feet to move. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: On the emissary? 
TALIESIN: Just grab them all and run. 
LAURA: Okay. Wait. 
ROBBIE: I got the Emissary, right there. 
LAURA: Is everybody going to be able to get out? Where are you, Laudna? 
MARISHA: I am like this up against the Forcecage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's good. 
LAURA: Let me see how far this goes. I'm going to... I'm going to Misty Step over here. 
MATT: Okay. 30 feet, right? 
LAURA: 30 feet. 
MATT: 30 feet. 
MATT: It'll put you about there. 
LAURA: And run as far as I can 
MATT: Running to there. That's-- You get right next to where Laudna is. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: That finishes your go. 
LAURA: Hi, honey! 
MARISHA: That was incredible. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Gloamglut's up. Gloamglut is going to screech and run out through the hole. He's going to try and squeeze through that tiny hole. 
SAM: He's leaving his master! 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
LAURA: I should have bamfed on Gloamglut. 
MATT: That's going to be... 
TALIESIN: No! You would be squished now. 
MATT: That's going to be barely enough. You watch as this massive dragon form, the wings fold back and the arms push through the stone, cracking as it goes. It makes the hole larger as it forces its way out of the temple and shrieking as it begins to fly. 
MARISHA: This is really bad. 
LAURA: I should've gone-- 
MATT: End of Gloamglut's turn. We now come to-- 
TRAVIS: Is it destabilized any more with the pushing through the hole? 
MATT: Oh, the whole thing's coming down. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's all terrible. 
MATT: So everyone in the chamber right now takes eight points of bludgeoning damage from falling debris. You have one more round to come out here before the whole thing falls down. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right, so. 
ASHLEY: Let's make it out. 
MATT: There's nothing else here in initiative order. Except for you guys. So what are you all doing? 
ASHLEY: Run! 
MARISHA: Fucking running! 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Who's grabbing Shadowlord? 
MATT: Fearne, you get up. That's half your movement. 
ASHLEY: I'll grab him! 
SAM: He's right in front of me. But yeah, if you want to go for it. 
ASHLEY: No, you get him. 
TRAVIS: Remember grabbing somebody slows your speed by half. 
MATT: It does. 
SAM: Even me? I'm super buff! 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What if I help? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Then you'll move-- You're slow. It's carrying a body. I'll tell you. You both will move... I'll say two thirds your movement. 
MARISHA: Two thirds? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I like it. 
SAM: It's very tight. It's going to be close. 
MARISHA: We're out of initiative or we're still doing this? 
MATT: Everyone does a thing. And then-- 
LIAM: We're calling out the thing that we do. Can I say in this-- in a split second, can I scan the whole room, including on the Sorrowlord. Do I see his blade? Is it like harness on his side, or did it fall to the ground somewhere? 
MATT: Oh, the blade was sheathed when he got onto the blade. 
LAURA: Do we want Sorrowlord to live or do we want him to die in here? 
LIAM: We can decide that outside. 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use my bonus action to Telekinetically pull Sorrowlord five feet towards me. 
ASHLEY: Good call. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. That's right. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: So that hopefully it gives them a little more space to run faster. 
MATT: Okay. Now you're going to-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So you're running and dashing with this now? Or, okay. Everyone's taking a round. What are we doing now? 
LAURA: I'm leaving. 
MATT: So, Fearne, you get up. That's half your movement. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Do you want your dad to live? 
ASHLEY: I will-- 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm waiting to see if he can make it out. 
ASHLEY: I feel like I want to decide outside. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
SAM: Yep. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. All right. 
TRAVIS: Everyone's still inside. I better head back in. 
MARISHA: No! (laughter) 
LAURA: What about Ira? Ira, can you get out? 
MATT: "Oh, I have my means. Don't worry." 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Ira goes like (whooshes) Dimension Doors (whooshes) outside. 
LAURA: Great! 
MARISHA: I'm just-- I look at Imogen. Are we running? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. I grab her hand and-- 
SAM: Begin making out. 
MARISHA: -- we sprint out. 
LAURA: I know. I want to make sure that everybody gets out the door, but we're going to be blocking the way. 
MATT: Double move at a dash. It's going to be 30, 60 feet. That'll get you just out the front from where you're both are standing. 
MARISHA: I just grabbed them. They're very capable. It's fine! 
MATT: So you all just barely emerge from here. 
TALIESIN: What's the plan? 
ROBBIE: Who's left? 
LAURA: Oh, wait-- Gosh. But I could help. I could help if I'm in there. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, you're fine, you're fine. I also have Telekinesis. 
MARISHA: Whatever you feel. 
ASHLEY: So I can try to-- I can grab. I can. I don't know why. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Don't worry. 
LAURA: Look. No! 
TRAVIS: It's only regrets. 
LAURA: No, I've-- I'm not going to dash. I'm not going to dash. I'm going to use my Telekinesis to try to grab the Shadow Lord. Because I can lift a thousand fucking pounds. I'm going to grab him and try to pull him out with me. 
MATT: Okay, so you were only partway here. He gets dragged 30 feet over here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: 30 feet? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I would say, then I'll-- when I felt her hand leave mine, I'll be in here-ish. 
LAURA: No, don't-- Keep going, Laudna. Go! Go! Get out the door. 
MARISHA: (screams) 
TRAVIS: You got it. 
MARISHA: All right, all right! I go out, I go out. 
MATT: So Laudna exits. You're right in the middle. 
TALIESIN: Is the Forcecage still up? 
MATT: The tower is above. You're hearing-- 
LAURA: It might help. 
MARISHA: It might help, yeah. 
MATT: The ceiling is now (cracks) 
LAURA: Grab and move, move! Dash! 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: I run, dash. 
MATT: All right. So it's half movement. So the other half is 15 feet. Will get you up on the dais-- 
MARISHA: Shit. 
MATT: -- and then dash-- 
ASHLEY: I have 35 feet. 
MATT: Right. So that'll get you there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. (laughs) 
MATT: Then 35 feet. Will get you next to the Sorrowlord. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. 
MATT: Maybe a little bit there. 
ASHLEY: So Oh no, I used dash. Never mind. Okay, great. 
MATT: All right. That's you. Braius? 
ASHLEY: Wait, do I also have a bonus action? 
SAM: Yeah. You do. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Bonus action. Can I, can I-- I'm going to use that extra 15 feet with-- 
TRAVIS: Can you dash? 
LAURA: Oh, Mister! 
ASHLEY: -- Mister and go (whooshes) 
MATT: How far can you teleport? 
LIAM: You still got a bonus action? 
ASHLEY: 15 feet. 
LIAM: Bonus action as a rogue for another chunk of movement. 
MATT: Yeah you are a rogue. 
ASHLEY: I'll do that as well. 
MATT: That'll get you just past Imogen over there if you want to put her. 
ROBBIE: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Then I'll take Sorrowlord, with me for that-- 
LAURA: 15 feet? 
ASHLEY: 15 feet? 
LAURA: Mister can't do both. 
MATT: 15 feet? 
LAURA: He can't do both of you. 
ASHLEY: He can. If I have a willing creature. 
MATT: He's not willing. He's unconscious. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I didn't know if that would count. 
MATT: That's okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay, never mind. 
MATT: No worries. 
SAM: So you've left him? 
ASHLEY: I've left him. 
MATT: Braius. 
SAM: He's in the chamber still. Okay, okay. 
MATT: Orym, you're the two who haven't done anything yet in this chamber. 
SAM: Yes. So I will start. Start off-- just for fun as I go. I look down at that image of the Arch Heart and I smash it with my heel, and then I charge off. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
MATT: It cracks. 
SAM: 30 feet of movement. 
MATT: 25, 30 gets you right there. 
SAM: Now, I guess I will bonus act-- No! Action Dash, because I don't have bonus action. 
MATT: That gets you just up close to her. 
SAM: But I'd also like to carry the Sorrowlord. 
MATT: Then you'll get half that movement. 
SAM: Yeah. So will I make it to the-- 
MATT: You'll make it just through the door and he'll be pulled just beyond that threshold. 
TALIESIN: Who else is at the door right now? 
LAURA: Everybody except Orym is out. 
MATT: Orym, what are you doing? 
LIAM: I've been waiting to watch all the chickadees leave. Then I start to sprint in a direct line towards the-- I'll use movement and action to go 60 feet. 
MATT: Then 60 feet will get you just over by where Imogen is. 
LIAM: Right. Then I will Grasping Vine a point on the ceiling of the hallway and yank myself even further forward. 
LAURA: Great! 
MATT: Okay, so you're 20 more feet that way. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Who's outside with me right now? Can I throw one more thing? If possible. 
MATT: What do you want to do? 
TALIESIN: I've still got my rage up. You mind taking a punch? 
TRAVIS: Um... 
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab Chet. You're not dying, right? You're fine. 
TRAVIS: (stammers) 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to grab Chet. I'm going to walk over to the door, like, right into the door. I'm going to take my fist, and I'm going to like, the Gravity Well is going to start pulsing and pulsing, and I'm going to cause a Singularity Assault. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So. This is going to hurt a bunch of people. I'm going to try and-- 
LIAM: You could just-- 
SAM: But we're in here. 
TALIESIN: How's the best way to do this? 
MARISHA: Are you about to do something that's going to kill the Sorrowlord? 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. No, actually, no, it won't. I just have to be really careful about it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: There's nobody in there. 
TALIESIN: Is there any way to do this and to actually not kill everybody? 
LAURA: Go to the hallway. 
SAM: Who are you attacking? 
TALIESIN: Oh, well, the trick is I have to do it in a way where you won't end up-- 
MATT: You understand the entire building is collapsing. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. 
LAURA: Yeah, but we're in the hallway. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: It's a safe zone. 
LIAM: Forcecage stops everything. 
TALIESIN: How much life do you have? 
TRAVIS: I'm fine. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: What are you doing? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to do, like, 6d10 damage to you. It'll be fine. 
TRAVIS: Ugh. 
TALIESIN: So. Yeah, I'm-- 
MARISHA: Did you say 6d10? 
TALIESIN: It's going to be bad. 
LAURA: What are you doing? Just tell us what the fuck you're doing. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to start a big Gravity Well. It's going to pull everybody in that fucking hallway 30 feet out. 
SAM: Ooh! I like that. 
ASHLEY: Push us out. 
MARISHA: Will it hurt, though? 
TALIESIN: Oh, it'll hurt Chet. 
LIAM: It'll hurt. 
SAM: Oh, just Chet. 
ASHLEY: Whoever's closest to you. 
TALIESIN: So, yeah, I'm going to... 
ROBBIE: You're ready to go, it's your time. 
TRAVIS: Respect your elders. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit Chet, and I'm going to tell everyone outside to brace themselves and tell everyone inside don't brace yourself. I'm just going to do a fist. I'm not actually going to use my hammer, which I can do. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: So that is reckless. Because life is short. 
LIAM: Pull the trigger. 
TALIESIN: That hits. That's just 10 damage straight. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Bludgeoning damage? 
TALIESIN: 10 bludgeoning damage. Yeah, because it's a fist. 
LIAM: You hit me right in the ear! 
TALIESIN: So everybody outside needs to roll a strength save. 
SAM: Are we trying to save-- 
TALIESIN: You outside. You are not outside. 
TRAVIS: I thought it was 6d10 damage. ROBBLIE: Am I far enough away to do this? 
SAM: What does outside mean? 
TALIESIN: Outside, who's made it all the way. 
LIAM: You got it, you're Dorian. 
TALIESIN: Everyone in the hallway just go limp. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Wait. So outside, we roll a strength save. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MARISHA: Well, okay. 
ROBBIE: You're going to do great. 
MARISHA: I'm going to do great. 
LAURA: You're going to get sucked up next to him. 
TALIESIN: Yep! 
MARISHA: Yeah. No. (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. (whooshes) Everyone, as you're like, you're hitting Chetney here. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Everyone's going towards Chetney who doesn't roll against a DC 16. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Everyone inside. 30 feet towards Chetney. 
SAM: Whoa! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Great! 
LAURA: Grab on to-- Can we-- We're holding on to Sorrowlord, though. 
SAM: I am. 
TALIESIN: Technically speaking, Sorrowlord is also somebody I can pull. Because he is a creature? 
MATT: Yeah, he'll pull. All right. So that means that gets Orym and Fearne out of the structure? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Everyone else gets pulled. They're still within the hallway. 
LAURA and SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: How many people are now directly-- How many people failed are now directly next to Chet? 
MARISHA: Da-doosh. 
MATT: That's going to be one, two, three, four, five, six. 
TALIESIN: No, I mean, like, within five feet. Yeah. It's for each creature that ends up five feet, so I don't count. 
MATT: That's going to be Laudna. 
TALIESIN: So that's-- 
MATT: And the guardian. 
TALIESIN: So that's two? 
MATT: Two. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. So. Chet, you take an extra-- Oh. Thank god. An extra 10 points of damage. All right. 
TRAVIS: Fuck. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Everyone inside gets 30 more feet. 
MATT: Okay. You all get pulled forward and yanked. 
LAURA: Again? 
MATT: And catching it. 
TALIESIN: No, just from that-- 
MATT: Just from that one. 
LAURA: Oh, got it. 
TALIESIN: (deep sigh) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Everyone resting outside. 
TALIESIN: I've never done that before. 
MATT: Braius and Imogen there in the hallway, clutching it, looking over that smile. That hope of the fey exterior there. As the roof comes in and swallows both of them. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
MATT: (stones crashing) 
MATT: The temple-- 
SAM: Fearne, Imogen. 
MATT: -- falls in. 
SAM: I mean me and Imogen. 
LAURA: Yeah, Braius and Imogen. 
MARISHA: What? 
SAM: I'm going to cover his body with mine. 
MATT: You cover the Sorrowlord or Imogen? 
SAM: The Sorrowlord. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MATT: He covers the Sorrowlord. 
LAURA: I can't do anything. 
TALIESIN: Do you have a reaction? 
MATT: The entirety of this temple falls. (crash, rumble, clatter) The din is deafening as dust (whooshes) billows out from all sides. You all have to brace yourself as the entirety of the vicinity becomes a dark gray cloud of dust and debris. Eventually, the rumbling comes to a stop. Stillness and shock washes over you as the dust slowly settles on the ruined pile of what was once the Shrine of Gilded Gifts. The two of your friends that have disappeared within the destruction. And that's where we're going to take a break. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! That did not-- 
SAM: Plan perfectly executed. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we still got it, you guys! 
ROBBIE: I'm pretty good about it. 
TRAVIS: Still got it. 
MARISHA: I mean, I could've-- I mean, it kind of worked. We talked to him. 
LIAM: This fey guard is like: What the fuck? 
MATT: He is very confused. Yeah, sorry for that long run. We're going to take a break, we will, too. We'll return here for what transpires after this. So see you here in a few minutes.

Break[]
(epic music) (fey music) (mysterious music) 
The future is frightening. It's a future which hasn't yet been written. Vox Machina, your world will be destroyed. This can't be happening. If we want to save it, we have to go to... Hell. Buckle the fuck up. Road trip! We shouldn't be here. Won't be needing jackets. To pull this off we're gonna need all kinds of miracles. What is that thing? Hold him off as long as you can! Vox Machina shall burn! That's a big problem! And I'm an even bigger one! -Ready? -No, but do it anyway! I'm ready to die for the people I love. We have to believe it's going to be alright. And if it isn't... No! ...then nothing matters. Vox Machina, you are now bound for eternity. They got some plush chairs in this bitch. It's okay to be scared. We can face anything if we're together. Oy! You think you can catch us, dingle dick? Maybe don't mock the murder man?

XEN: It doesn't occur to any of you that the moon is about to fall out of the sky. And why would it? It's just a regular Monday here on the moon. Goe is watching the gigantic wall of darkness inbound. This isn't going to have transformative, long-lasting, incredibly far-reaching consequences, is it? Unfortunately, it will. We have gathered together a small squad of unlikely chums to seek what perhaps cannot be found. SARA: This is feeling really weird, really fast. XEN: I think it's time to go. All aboard. What could possibly go wrong? Such as, for example, the moon literally exploding literally right now. LIAM: What's in it for you? Helping us... MATT: If there is even the remotest chance that they are still alive, I have to see that through. MARISHA: It's not about knowing or not knowing. It's about being willing to find out. 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Oops. Oh my gosh, it's so amazing. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. Oooh, so comfy cozy.

And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
LAURA: You fought well, princesses. But you didn't think winning the throne was gonna be that easy. Did you? [laughter] No, no, no. Midnight draws on. But this battle is just getting started. [laughter] I can't wait to see how this turns out.

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, here as the dust and rubble settle-- 
TRAVIS: Rabble rabble. 
MATT: -- two of your compatriots vanishing beneath the fallen and crumbled stone, clutching two unconscious figures, one still dying, by the way. 
TRAVIS: No! 
MATT: First failed save. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: On Zathuda. 
LAURA: On the emissary? 
MARISHA: On Zathuda? 
SAM: No. 
MATT: Zathuda. 
ROBBIE: On Zathuda. 
MARISHA: The emissary is stable, right? 
MATT: Emissary is stable. 
LAURA: Because Zathuda's out. He made it out. 
TRAVIS: He's unconscious, yeah. 
SAM: No, he's under me. 
LIAM: Under. 
LAURA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: Oh wait, no, he's inside. 
LAURA: He's inside. 
MATT: That's right. 
TALIESIN: He didn't get pulled far enough? 
ASHLEY: Oh, he might be out out. 
LAURA: But Braius, Braius-- 
MATT: Braius-- 
SAM: Shielded. 
MATT: -- shielded him with his body. What are the rest of you doing? 
LIAM: Immediately pulling rock. I'm not strong, but I'm pulling rocks. 
TALIESIN: I will start pulling rocks if someone can help me know what rock, because I assume I can't move through any of this because it's worked or-- 
MATT: It's all worked, yeah. 
TALIESIN: So I'm going to start pulling rocks because I do have double, and I am just-- People help me stabilize shit. 
ASHLEY: Same. 
LIAM: Immediately. 
ASHLEY: Same. 
MATT: The two emissary guards that were back there seeing all this happen rush over to you, Dorian, to try and get to the emissary and help it up. 
MARISHA: Imogen! Imogen! 
ROBBIE: I'm not going to let then have him. I don't want to fight anymore. 
MARISHA: Aw, oh buddy. 
SAM: You can talk to them. 
MATT: They both rush up and they're reaching to help them up. What do you do? 
SAM: You're a talker. 
LIAM: Come on, Rizz. Rizzler. 
ROBBIE: Hello, boys, how are you? I mean, he looks fine to me. I'm going to set him up like "Weekend at Bernie's" (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I'm going to be like: He seems all right, he seems all right. Then, oh boy. I'm failing at this ruse. I've got him like this, I'm going to just-- Do I have it? Sorry. I've got it right here. Where the fuck is it? (frustrated groan) There it is. I'm going to snap my fingers and cast Hypnotic Pattern as they're running toward me, and it's just over my head. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: It's this kaleidoscopic-- 
MATT: Natural five and a 13. 
ROBBIE: Oh okay. Yeah, 16 to save, so. 
MATT: Oh, they have advantage-- 
ASHLEY: Great! 
MATT: -- because they're Fey, sorry. 
ROBBIE: Oh. Oh! 
MATT: Natural three. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: And a natural two. Never mind, it didn't matter. 
ROBBIE: Okay, sweet! 
MATT: Didn't matter. Rolling like shit. 
ROBBIE: They're transported by the thing above me and I turn around, I got my arm around his shoulder. I'm like: He's fine. I got him out of there. I feel like I'm responsible for him now. 
MATT: They both stop in their tracks, just staring above you. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. Look, isn't that pretty? It's so pretty. Why don't you go watch it from over there? And I'm going to ask if they can get away from me. 
MATT: They slowly sidestep while still focusing on the pattern, just lost in a daydream. 
ROBBIE: Good, good. 
TRAVIS: Set up a perimeter. 
ROBBIE: You know, I feel like maybe he's bleeding somewhere and he needs a tourniquet. I'm going to pull the most powerful item out of my backpack, my 50 feet of hemp rope. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I'm going to start binding his arm, as I was like: Yes, yes, he needs this. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: It's a medical thing. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Are they walking up through the woods, is that's what's happening? 
MATT: No, they're walking a little ways off-- 
SAM: It's a tourniquet. 
MATT: -- and just standing there, staring at this pattern. 
SAM: It's a body tourniquet. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LIAM: Orym has a sudden thought and stands up like a meerkat on the rubble and looks around. Do I see any of the bodies of the people that we took down on the way in? 
MATT: You guys hid them all. 
LIAM: We hid them all? That's what we did? 
LAURA: Yeah, we did. 
MATT: Dragged them off in the bushes. 
LIAM: Okay, I just remember striking a guy and we're in, great. 
TRAVIS: I've been out here having a light snack. 
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, good. 
LIAM: Ah, awesome. 
TRAVIS: (sloppily scarfing) 
ROBBIE: I'll finish my knot, I tie him up, and I've got him tied up now. 
MATT: Okay. Hypnotic Pattern lasts for a minute. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, he's still unconscious. 
TRAVIS: (mumbling with mouth full) 
MARISHA: So we still have our Telekinetic Bond? 
MATT: You still have that. 
SAM: We should. 
LAURA: You would unless it got knocked out by my concentration. 
MATT: As you all are pulling rocks and rubble out from this, it's one rock at a time in what looks like will take hours to make any real headway. The towers themselves fell in and collapsed. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, it's not concentration so it stays up, it stays up. 
MARISHA: I'm going to just say in my head: Imogen! Imogen! Braius? 
MATT: In absolute darkness, Braius and Imogen, in the moment of accepting the end, possibly of your life, the sound of crumbling destruction consumes all around you and then stops. You reach around, and the stone is all around you. It's just stopped. 
MARISHA: Imogen. 
MATT: Like a little cavity has kept you there. 
LAURA: Is this you? 
SAM: I don't do this sort of thing. 
TRAVIS: Does your armor? 
MATT: (rumbling) 
SAM: Maybe it's my lord. 
MATT: All of the stones of the entire crumbled temple begin to shift-- (cracking and crumbling) 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: -- and begin to pull back. 
LAURA: Shit, shit. 
MATT: They lift and curl like the receding wave on a beach. The rubble begins to rescind (cracking) and you watch as in a matter of moments, the temple begins to reconstruct itself. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (gasp) (shifting masonry) The towers, (rising into place) standing there in place, the cracks still present, but just set back. Where all the vines and leaves were, they were crushed and left to the ground, and now stands the beautiful, polished, if cracked, temple of the Arch Heart, gorgeous in its imperfection. 
MARISHA: On the outside, we all see this as well? 
MATT: All of you stand agape watching this happen. As it rises up and what dust is there settles, you see standing in that front hallway, Imogen and Braius hunched over where they thought everything would come to an end. 
LIAM: Fucking Fey. 
MARISHA: I run up to Imogen. Did you do this? 
LAURA: This, this, this wasn't me. 
MARISHA: I'm so glad you're all right. 
MATT: All of you also feel a presence. The very air itself seems to fill with force, The very air itself seems to fill with force, like you are all on the cusp of something important. The faintest bit of golden light glimmers from the temple chamber you just fled from and the air seems to grow warm. 
LAURA: I get up and I grab Laudna's hand and I start walking towards the light. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm walking in. 
LIAM: Is the statue back of the Arch Heart? 
MATT: Is everyone walking in? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Is Fearne's dad stable? Can I stabilize him? 
MATT: It's his second death save. 
SAM: Okay, I will stabilize him somehow. 
MATT: Make a medicine check for me. 
SAM: Well, if I only get one shot, I'll probably just give him a hit point then. 
MATT: Okay, fair enough. Try it out. Up to you. Do you want to make a medicine check? 
SAM: No, I'll just give him-- 
LAURA: He'll wake up, that will wake him up. 
SAM: If I fail the medicine check, he will die forever. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but Nana-- 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But Nana will-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
LIAM: Do you have the means? 
SAM: To? 
LIAM: Give him a hit point. 
SAM: Of course. 
LAURA: Yeah, but he'll wake up! 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: He'll wake up. 
SAM: Yeah, we can conk him on the head. 
ASHLEY: No, just leave it. 
TRAVIS: You don't have any Spare the Dying-- any, like, stabilize, any... 
MARISHA: That's true. That's true. 
TRAVIS: Hey, let the dice decide. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: (laughs) Oh shit. Okay. 
TRAVIS: It's just you. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Medicine check. 
MATT: Medicine check. 
SAM: I will let-- 
TRAVIS: What's your modifier in medicine? 
SAM: Plus one. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Dude! 
MATT: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Anybody else? 
SAM: Inspire me? 
LIAM: Asmodeus aside? 
ROBBIE: (exasperated) Yes! 
SAM: Actually Guidance me? 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'll Guide you. 
MATT: Okay. As you walk up and your father is slipping away, you guide Braius as you attempt to now quickly bind the wounds and close things and using your healing touch, not to fully bring him to consciousness, but just enough to staunch the bleeding and set any bones as you use that holy power to try and instill just enough to keep him beyond the realm of the conscious. You need to roll a 10 or higher, but with a plus one, it would be a nine or higher. 
MARISHA: Am I able to assist him? 
MATT: If you want to, oh, you're currently holding Imogen. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: I'll say this is all happening in the same moment. 
MARISHA: That's fair. 
SAM: Yes, I'll just briefly whisper: If your eye is on me, Platinum Dragon, let this work. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
LIAM: Platinum Dragon! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Nine plus four from her. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh, so it worked. 
MATT: You barely stabilized him and still unconscious, the breath slowly escapes and returns in shallowed inhales and exhales. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: As we walk by, I'm going to take his sword right out of his fucking sheath. 
MARISHA: Good idea. 
TALIESIN: Throw it on my belt. 
MARISHA: Good idea. 
SAM: Here's your father. 
ASHLEY: I mean, it's not-- okay. 
MARISHA: Just leave him. 
LAURA: You just take him. 
MARISHA: Just leave him there. Let's go. 
TRAVIS: I take the funnel out of the bag of holding and I lay against her dad. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Is that not what we're doing? We not doing that? Okay. 
TALIESIN: Not yet. 
ASHLEY: It's not a bad idea. 
MATT: That's incredible, incredible. Dorian, are you bringing the emissary with you or are you staying outside? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, so I don't have much time. 
LAURA: You're all by yourself, Dorian. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, I'm dealing with it. 
MATT: You got like 30 seconds left of this spell in this place. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: You bound him quickly and like, ugh. 
ROBBIE: Since there's no-- we're not in initiative, can I cast another spell? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, okay. So I'm going to, I know it's a silly person. 
MATT: Remember if it's a concentration spell, it will drop the Hypnotic Pattern. 
ROBBIE: Oh, it'll drop it. Okay. 
SAM: Hypnotic only lasts a minute, anyway. 
ROBBIE: It only lasts a minute. 
MATT: 30 more seconds. 
ROBBIE: They're in range. Yeah, I'm going to, nothing clever. I'm going to sling them over my shoulder and book it inside with you guys, get them out of line of sight. 
LIAM: Just jock him in? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: So you all jog into the temple. Walking past, all the walls, you can see the thousands of spiderweb cracks throughout, but all it maintains its previous shape. 
LAURA: I'm going to touch the wall and feel the cracks as we walk. 
MATT: It's interesting. 
LAURA: Does it feel smooth? 
MATT: No, you feel the cracks there and like, as beautiful as the temple was, it's a different kind of beauty now. It's fallen and reforged. You, Ashton, find a very familiar and comforting pattern to that. As you all begin to step through the secondary hallway in towards the center of the core temple, the shattered fountain itself is reformed the opposite side. Everything in this room, the pillars themselves have now restructured themselves. Even that which was turned to mud has now been reformed back into the stone it once was and stands unscathed, if not for the intricate broken lines that weave through everything, and it's beautiful. As you all begin to step the chamber, (rumbling swooshes) all the bits of shale and rock that was first dashed against the far wall (impactful jostling) gathers into the statue of the Arch Heart, where it once was in the opposite end of the interior, and it just stands resolute, smiling, (thuds) and its head shakes and looks down at the rest of you. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: What's happening right now? 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: Where did he go? What? 
LAURA: No. 
TALIESIN: No. No way. No fucking way. 
ASHLEY: What's happening? What's happening? 
SAM: I think I know what's happening. 
TALIESIN: No fucking way! (shouting) 
ASHLEY: What?! What?! 
TALIESIN: No! No! (shouting) 
LIAM: What is going on?! 
MARISHA: You look so good! 
TALIESIN: What?! 
ROBBIE: Awesome. 
TALIESIN: How?! 
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh. 
MARISHA: You look so happy! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You sneaky mother! 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: (screams) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You-- We're going to have words. 
LIAM: Woo! 
TALIESIN: How?! 
LIAM: Oh my goodness gracious. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ABUBAKAR: The statue looks and regards each and every one of you, taking you all in and stops at Braius. 
SAM: Oh shit, I smashed your face. (laughter) 
ABUBAKAR: They walk out off the podium. Is about 8-foot tall. (laughter) Looks at you. "Did you really have to do that?" 
SAM: I mean, my lord and you don't really have a great relaish-- 
ABUBAKAR: (laughs) 
SAM: From what I saw. 
ABUBAKAR: "What you saw?" 
SAM: Are you? Oh, first off, hi, are you real? 
ABUBAKAR: Suddenly, they click their fingers, (snaps) the roof opens, and what you begin hearing is the growing screech of something horrendous. Roll an intelligence save. 
MARISHA: All of us? 
TRAVIS: Everybody? 
ABUBAKAR: Yes. 
LAURA: Oh wow, what? What? 
MARISHA: Oh my god. Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: On our heels. On our heels. Not sure what the fuck's happening. 
LIAM: DM, I'm going to use Indomitable and reroll. 
ABUBAKAR: (laughs) Okay. 
TRAVIS: 14. 
LIAM: Not much better. 
SAM: Not on saves. 
ASHLEY: No. I know. Okay. 
MARISHA: You said 14. 
LAURA: 19. 
TRAVIS: 14. 
ABUBAKAR and LAURA: 19. 
MARISHA: 20 total. 
ABUBAKAR: 20. 
ROBBIE: Not smart. Dirty 20. 
LAURA: Woo! Nice. 
ABUBAKAR: You got a nat 20? 
ROBBIE: No, dirty 20. 
ABUBAKAR: Dirty 20, okay, right. 
SAM: 17. 
ABUBAKAR: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 16. 
ABUBAKAR: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 17. Oh, go ahead. 
LIAM: 12. 
TALIESIN: 17. 
ABUBAKAR: This sound, you've all heard it before. But from where? Surely, and for a short moment, your minds are catapulted back to the days of your birth, the moments you were literally ripped from the wombs of your bearer. As the sky begins opening, these portals begin shooting out and these arms start snatching you and pulling you out from where you are. You find yourselves on a field. Imagine, if you will, this vast expanse of delicate crystalline reeds, swaying rhythmically in time with one another. Above you are stars, but each star looking unique and individual. They stand there proud and close. It's almost as if you could reach them. This air hits you, this cool air. It's fragrant and sweet and subtle, the smell of roses, a smell that makes you think of grace, perfection, beauty. Now you see a figure standing 30 feet away from you. Their form is outlined by this soft glow of starlight. They look naked, but the skin is not as the flesh as you'd normally see. They're a living canvas of a starry sky, a tapestry of constellations. He beckons you, Braius. 
SAM: Are we floating or standing on something? 
ABUBAKAR: You're standing. 
SAM: Okay. 
ABUBAKAR: Upon this field of reeds. 
SAM: I have nothing to fear. I step forward. 
ABUBAKAR: "What do you know of family?" 
SAM: I know that family is the most precious thing, and if anyone challenges your family, you must destroy them. 
ABUBAKAR: "(laughs) And who is your family?" 
SAM: Well, I have none right now, but I seek. I seek a family. 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes. So desperately. It's rather touching. I'll tell you what. Let's forget the mess you did back there. You're in my domain now." 
SAM: I appreciate that. 
ABUBAKAR: "Swear fealty to me and I'll let you live." 
SAM: There's no option B or C? (laughter) 
ABUBAKAR: "No." 
SAM: I feel that there are more important things than life. Who you swear your allegiance to, who you consider your family, who takes care of you in your worst times. Those matter more than the fleeting life of a mortal. So no, I will not pledge myself to you, for I'm already pledged to another, and he would not be happy with me, nor you, were he to be betrayed again. 
ABUBAKAR: "(laughs) So close. So close. I thought I had you, but I didn't. But it's totally fine." (laughter) 
ABUBAKAR: "Totally cool. I like it! I really respect it. Welcome, all of you, (laughs) to, well, I mean, is it my home? I don't know. What is home nowadays? It's funny. I am surprised that I'm seeing this troop of, well, truthfully, I thought you'd all be more heroic. But here we are." 
ASHLEY: Fair, fair, fair. 
ABUBAKAR: "Tell me, what did you see?" 
LIAM: DM, I have a question. (laughter) 
LIAM: We have interfaced with the gods before on the Material Plane, but always through dream and vision. Are we cognizant of the fact, are we looking at divinity face to face in this moment? Do we know? Are we aware? 
SAM: Is it a vision or are we really there? 
LIAM: Because this is-- 
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter. 
LIAM: This is the Arch Heart's realm. 
ABUBAKAR: Yes. 
LIAM: There is no golden gate-- 
ABUBAKAR: No. 
LIAM: -- between? 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
ABUBAKAR: Roll insight. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: I'm real good at this. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: 19. 
ABUBAKAR: You don't know any different. The feeling you have is so powerful and potent, it's raw. It's almost as if you are within the presence of divinity itself. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: We saw you in Aeor. 
TALIESIN: What we hope was your worst moment. 
LAURA: We saw you as you sided with the Betrayer Gods and-- 
ABUBAKAR: "Sided?" 
LAURA: Well-- 
SAM: Collaborated. 
LAURA: We saw the city fall. 
MARISHA: You were very powerful. I saw you rain fire from the sky. 
SAM: And charismatic, too. 
ABUBAKAR: "Keep going." 
TALIESIN: The bar was beautiful. 
ABUBAKAR: "It was gorgeous." 
LAURA: It really was. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm. Did you hear the countless screams of people?" 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
ABUBAKAR: "You did, didn't you?" 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
ABUBAKAR: "So you saw the events of Aeor. Fascinating. I won't ask how, but this is good. This is really good. You know of our power, you know of what we can do, and we know what you are all capable of, our children. So, my next question--" Suddenly a table materializes in front of you with food and drink. It's gorgeous. "Please, sorry, my bad. Sit down. Take care. Eat. Eat. You're welcome." 
TRAVIS: I go, I sit, but I look at the chair. Eh. 
ABUBAKAR: "But my next question is--" (laughter) "-- what are you going to do with that knowledge of Aeor? What are you doing in my temple? Fighting family, killing them, or attempting to. Good save." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Family is important. 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes. Tell me--" 
LIAM: One of your children, a mortal, saw what we saw and wants all your children to know. 
LAURA: They have recording devices in Aeor. They have it. 
LIAM: This man wants to leave childhood behind for all, and the threat that your kin has shown us, shown me. They think letting our children decide and letting that power free to do away with you. I don't know if we are completely aligned, but we all fear the question of that action. 
ABUBAKAR: "(grunt of acknowledgement)" 
LIAM: The balance that exists now for you and me to thrive, well, I fear breaking that balance. 
ABUBAKAR: "I'll be honest. I fear it too." 
LIAM: I appreciate the honesty. 
ABUBAKAR: "But there's something inside me that tells me that perhaps maybe this balance needs to be broken. I mean, there's a reason why you're all here. There's a reason that there is a burning desire for change." 
MARISHA: Things can be broken in many ways. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Tip the scales. In which way are you referring to? I saw your conversation with the dark, spooky lady. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm." 
MARISHA: You were curious about oblivion. 
ABUBAKAR: "Hmm. Yes. Oh, don't get me wrong. I don't want to die now. (laughs) Please, no. Not anymore. No. I mean, flirted with it, but the actual reality of darkness, it is rather dark. No, but I do feel that there needs to be a change. You see, something that I've realized, something that I keep seeing is (laughs) our children continue to rebel, all the time. Hundreds, thousands, many, many years continuous. We are in this perpetual cycle, (laughs) and it seems that our presence, be it either here, behind a big door, isn't doing anything. There is something innate. You want us out. There is--" I look at you, Fearne. I go towards you. "What is that?" 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
ABUBAKAR: "There is a fire within--" 
ASHLEY: What is what? 
ABUBAKAR: "(laughs) Oh!" I walk towards you and I touch your chest. 
TALIESIN: I usually charge for that. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm." You suddenly feel this feeling within you. This feeling to transform, to become primal. "So you both also have-- (laughs) Hmm." 
ASHLEY: What's the matter? 
ABUBAKAR: "Well, this changes a lot of things, doesn't it?" 
LAURA: What does it change? 
ASHLEY: Are you scared? 
TALIESIN: Are you angry? 
ABUBAKAR: "Scared? No, not angry. Fascinated. You know, I actually think that... No." 
MARISHA and LAURA: What? 
SAM: (laughs) 
ABUBAKAR: "(laughs) Never mind." 
TALIESIN: Oh no. I just suddenly realized that I'm in a position to say something I've wanted to say to a god my whole fucking life. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
ABUBAKAR: "Here we go." 
TALIESIN: What is it that you want? What do you fucking want? 
ABUBAKAR: "What do we want?" 
TALIESIN: Really. Not souls, not worship. What, what, what is this art for that you refuse to fucking abandon? what is this art for that you refuse to fucking abandon? How can it be art if you don't fucking abandon it? I just rile here. No wonder we're fucking rebelling over and over and over again. You won't let go! 
ABUBAKAR: "And that is what I want. I want to let go. There is something beautiful inside of you, and you. In fact, of all of you, but there is something here kicking, feeling. You know, I feel like I've met you before. (laughs) And to be honest, I'm a bit bored. I'm tired. That's what I want. I want to let go. I want my family to let go. Now, how we let go-- (laughs) Well, big doors don't work. Death? No, no. But there is an opportunity here. You see, while I was gazing and watching upon your little family debacle, where you decided to, you know, either side with him or not, you know, and then you decided to pull him off a bloody dragon, and then wanted to, I don't know, kill them of sort. I mean, you took off his leg." 
LAURA: I di-- That was-- 
ABUBAKAR: "Was it?" 
LAURA: You know, we get mixed-- 
ABUBAKAR: "Right, I see. Understandable." 
MARISHA: Was it-- Okay. 
ABUBAKAR: "But the thing is, is what I am seeing is an opportunity here. I'm seeing something, hmm, how do I say this? There's a window. It's open; however, it comes through potential sacrifice of family. Do you know what it means to become a vessel?" 
LAURA: We have guesses. 
ASHLEY: We have guesses, but I don't fully know what it means. 
ABUBAKAR: "What have you guessed?" 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
LAURA: Well, they keep talking about Ludinus wants a vessel for Predathos. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm. Mm." 
LAURA: Someone to take that power in and perhaps guide it. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm." 
MARISHA: I know a little bit. 
LAURA: Is that right? 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes. Yes." 
ASHLEY: I mean, a receptacle for something else. 
ABUBAKAR: "Do you want to try something else?" 
ASHLEY: Sometimes. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm. Do you think there is any other way of resolving this scenario?" 
ASHLEY: I'm sure looking for it. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm." 
MARISHA: I know a little bit. 
ABUBAKAR: "Go on, please. Pray tell, this is fascinating." 
MARISHA: Actually, quite a lot about what it's like to be a vessel with something else inside of you. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm. Tell me, do you have control now, or are they in control?" 
MARISHA: I think I'm in control now. 
ABUBAKAR: "Ah, yes. You see, that's the magic." 
MARISHA: But it took a long time. 
ABUBAKAR: "It did take a long, long time, but you succeeded." 
MARISHA: Yes. The lines, the lines that blurred on a day-to-day basis of not knowing where I began and she ended. 
ABUBAKAR: "Mm." 
MARISHA: It was exhausting. I was afraid I'd lose myself entirely. It's terrifying. 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes." 
MARISHA: But also, intoxicating. 
ABUBAKAR: "The truth is, there's a few of us who want to let go. I say a few. Two." 
SAM: May I ask who the other one is? 
ABUBAKAR: "Oh, why ruin the fun?" 
SAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ABUBAKAR: "The rest, however, we're all doing this dance again, sitting around a table deciding. Should we intervene, should we not? We are this close to another calamity, because there is a fear of our death. You see, the truth is, no matter what happens, there will be lives lost, all for the preservation of ourselves. It's incredibly selfish, and I'm realizing that, and I'm seeing that, and I thought we could change, but we couldn't. So the only solution that I see is what Ludinus desires. However, I believe either you two can truly control this thing and chase us off. How's that sound?" 
LAURA: Just chase you away? 
ABUBAKAR: "Absolutely. If you get there before anyone else does. See, our eyes are all on Ludinus and the armies that are gathering and fighting. We're ready to jump in there, but if you are able to maybe, I don't know, sneak in behind, find a way in, and take over, gain control." 
LAURA: If you-- If you were inside one of us, do you think we'd be able to control you? 
ABUBAKAR: "(chuckles) That's a good question." 
LAURA: I've listened to Predathos. I've heard the call. It's powerful. 
ABUBAKAR: "It is. But Predathos only desires one thing, and that is my family." 
LAURA: Why? 
ABUBAKAR: "Sustenance, enjoyment. It's hungry." 
LAURA: Very. 
ABUBAKAR: "I truly believe that for mortality to evolve, to grow, to progress, to flourish, is with us not waiting at the gate to intervene every now and then. The only way that we will run is if we have something to fear. Now, what happens to the vessel, I don't know. But if you truly do care about family, then sacrifices need to be made." 
LAURA: What about the children who don't want to let go? 
ABUBAKAR: "They will learn." 
LIAM: What if you aren't able to run fast enough? What happens to our families on the ground? 
ABUBAKAR: "Well, it depends on how fast you move, because if you are too slow, then we're going to repeat the Calamity all over again. And then we go back to building a gate and waiting for the next moment to happen." 
LAURA: How many would it take to truly control Predathos? How many do you think? 
ABUBAKAR: "I don't know. And that's the scary part. You are in my domain and you've seen my power. But in this moment, I am powerless. And that's what's quite funny about this is I'm looking at this troop of what don't seem like heroes having more power than what I could even ever imagine. (laughs dryly) Fate is weirdly on your side. Why? I don't know. But this is the hand we've been dealt with." 
ROBBIE: How does it feel to have the shoe on the other foot? I'm so curious. You see, we are just people, and I know you think lowly of us because you've asked us to make sacrifices for you. Now you're getting a tiniest taste of what it is to be a person with no guarantees and fear of death that looms over us every day. And your instinct is to sacrifice your own family and run. Yet you ask us to find the courage to fight for you? It seems like a poor bargain. But what do I know? I'm just a stupid person. 
ABUBAKAR: "I don't think you're stupid. You're my children, our children. You are of us. Why would I think lowly of you? Just because I have seen more than you, have experienced more than you? No. Perhaps maybe some of us think lowly of mortality, Perhaps maybe some of us think lowly of mortality, but not I. Not some of my brothers, not my sisters, my kin. That's why, in truth, I find the situation, the power that lives within both of you right now, in you, fascinating, beautiful, incredible. That can only happen if we step back. It can only grow if we step back. So I'm simply asking for you to make sacrifices in order for the greater good. I know what I will have to live with, to answer to when it all happens, but--" 
ROBBIE: But in the end you will live. That's the plan for you, to live. 
LIAM: If you can run fast enough. 
LAURA: Maybe he'll stop Predathos long enough. Maybe he'll lend a hand so his brothers and sisters can get away. 
TALIESIN: What happens to your power when you leave to that vacuum? Does it just go away? Does it get handed to the next mortal that dares go for it? 
ABUBAKAR: "Here?" 
TALIESIN: This place. 
ABUBAKAR: "I don't know." 
MARISHA: You're the one who gave us these gifts? 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes." 
MARISHA: Thank you. We've all done a great many and terrible thing with them. 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes." 
ASHLEY: Why did you do that? 
ABUBAKAR: "Why?" 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
ABUBAKAR: "I wanted to change things up. You see, I am no different to you." 
MARISHA: Did you try the Jell-O? 
ABUBAKAR: "Your carving of toys, why do you do it?" 
TRAVIS: It brings me joy because you never know what it's going to turn out to be. 
ABUBAKAR: "There you go. Surely we all want our children, our family to flourish." 
TALIESIN: I don't have children or family. 
ABUBAKAR: "But you have friends." 
TALIESIN: For now. 
ABUBAKAR: "(laughs)" 
TRAVIS: This food is incredible, by the way. You guys are missing out. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought you were just eating some Werther's. I forgot about the food. 
TRAVIS: I only have two questions. Is it true? Were you around when Predathos first came to this world? We had heard that two of your siblings had been devoured by the creature before you encapsulated it. Is that true? 
ABUBAKAR: "Wow, you know a lot. Yes." 
TRAVIS: Been around a while. 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes, it is true." 
TRAVIS: Second question. I might have died in my sleep and this is just a crazy-ass dream before the end, or it's real. But either way, I don't think I've ever had an audience with a god. So thank you. But I have to ask, did you also have this talk with Ludinus? 
ABUBAKAR: "Oh, no. No." 
TRAVIS: His idea? 
ABUBAKAR: "No. His idea was inspiring, but I didn't have the talk with him. You see, the problem with Ludinus, or, well, again, this is just my opinion, is that he is a bit power hungry. He kind of wants to be like us. The problem is, he'll never be like us." 
MARISHA: We've said that. We've said that. 
LAURA: Yeah, we said that to him, we said that to him. 
MARISHA: It's validating. 
ABUBAKAR: "I mean, there have been moments in history. But Ludinus is, again, from my point of view, too caught up in his own self. So to answer your question in what will happen if, you know, we leave, I don't know. But again, isn't that beautiful? I have a feeling that things will balance themselves out, because it always has. The issue, however, comes at moments where you can't balance things out. Like, for example, unleashing Predathos with the aim and intention to kill us. Do you really think that we would let that happen? No. Because when mortality tried to kill us, well, (laughs) you've seen it." 
MARISHA: You tip the scales. 
ABUBAKAR: "Exactly. So what I am asking for, or suggesting, is that you go a step further, become faster than us, because we are waiting for the moment that you all arrive into this big battle and all it takes is for us to just step in." 
TALIESIN: Does your family know that-- Does your family know about this? 
ABUBAKAR: "Oh, no. (laughs) I mean, I'm pretty sneaky." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: If-- 
TALIESIN: And you-- 
SAM: Oh, sorry. 
TALIESIN: And you're, you're asking for our help. You are asking mortal creatures for your help, are you not? 
TRAVIS: How much you paying? 
ABUBAKAR: "I mean, if you want to see it that way." 
TALIESIN: I want you to see it that way. 
ABUBAKAR: "(laughs) Does it make you hard?" (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Damn! 
TALIESIN: Everything has made me hard. 
TRAVIS: You said step-- 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes." 
TRAVIS: Oh. Sorry. 
SAM: Oh. 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes, I'm asking for your help because I'm realizing now that we need your help. You were saying?" 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: Oh, I mean I don't want to step on any, I'm new to the group here, so-- 
LAURA: Braius, just talk. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure we're all dead anyway. 
SAM: Just a couple of questions, if you don't mind. You said, I mean, we all know that Predathos is hungry and sacrifices must be made. Why not just feed him, like, one of you? 
ABUBAKAR: "(laughs)" 
SAM: Won't that quell his appetite? 
ABUBAKAR: "So you're asking me--" 
SAM: To make a sacrifice. 
ABUBAKAR: "Of our own family." 
SAM: Well, I mean-- 
ASHLEY: Your family or ours. 
SAM: I guess I'm just asking why that's not an option. 
MARISHA: Do you really think that if Predathos ate one of them, that he would be satiated? 
SAM: I don't know. I don't know anything about Predathos. 
LAURA: I don't think it would. I mean-- 
TRAVIS: He ate two before. 
LAURA: That hunger inside-- 
ASHLEY: It's going to be there always. 
LAURA: -- is bottomless. It's all-consuming. That's-- 
LIAM: They wouldn't have trapped him in a moon if he was one and done. 
LAURA: Yeah. I feel like that's one of the reasons I'm most afraid that if we release him, that he'll turn on humanity as well because-- 
ABUBAKAR: "He will not turn on humanity." 
ASHLEY: How do you know? 
ABUBAKAR: "Because you are nothing to Predathos." 
SAM: I mean, we're-- 
ABUBAKAR: "You are simply specks of dust to Predathos." 
LIAM: Well, I step on ants every day because I don't know they're there. I'm a little worried about the same thing, Lord. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ABUBAKAR: "Believe me, it has a singular purpose. It always has. And that is to devour us. Humanity will never satiate it. It will chase us to the ends of what we think or believe or feel. It will constantly come for us." 
LAURA: So you want us to take Predathos into ourselves and end it. 
ROBBIE: So he can get a head start. 
SAM: If we don't, nothing bad will happen to us. 
ABUBAKAR: "Oh, no. Terrible things will happen to you because the fight will open itself up here. We want to get away from Predathos." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ABUBAKAR: "Containing it in this makeshift moon has obviously not worked." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: I mean, it worked for a while. 
ABUBAKAR: "For a while." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Well, why don't you-- 
SAM: I mean, not for nothing. It's kind of a stupid plan. You hid him within view of us. We could see him. The moon was always there the whole time. You should have like-- 
LIAM: Or her. 
SAM: -- sent him far, far away so we couldn't see, be curious about it. It was a big mistake. Hey, question. (laughter) 
SAM: Question. When you flee with your family, do you mean all your family? 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes." 
SAM: All your family? 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes." 
ASHLEY: Even the-- 
SAM: All your family? 
ABUBAKAR: "Even the one you so desperately desire. Yes." 
SAM: Does he know that? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ABUBAKAR: "Why? Should I tell him?" 
SAM: I mean, I think it would-- 
ABUBAKAR: "Would you unleash Predathos for him?" 
SAM: If he asked me to. 
ABUBAKAR: "Hmm." You suddenly see behind me the stars beginning to form what looks like a horned beast, a being. 
SAM: Now I'm hard. 
ABUBAKAR: A creature. 
TRAVIS and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
ABUBAKAR: (demonic) "So if I asked you to free Predathos for me, would you do it?" 
SAM: I mean, you're not-- I know that this is a trick. 
ABUBAKAR: "Do you?" 
TRAVIS: Insight check. (laughs) 
SAM: Can I insight check a god? 
ABUBAKAR: Absolutely. 
ROBBIE and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Maybe it's like Zoom. 
TRAVIS: The insight check-- 
LAURA: They're buddies. Maybe they've been buddies-- 
TRAVIS: -- of your life. 
LAURA: -- for a while now. 
ASHLEY: Guidance? 
SAM: I mean, pretty high insight. 
ABUBAKAR: What is it? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: 19. (laughs) 
LAURA: Ooh! 
ROBBIE: Ooh. 
ABUBAKAR: You have no idea. (laughter) 
LIAM: My 19 ate shit earlier. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Just-- 
ABUBAKAR: Suddenly, the stars dissipate. "No, he's not going to ask you." 
SAM: (scoffs) 
ABUBAKAR: "He's too proud." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ABUBAKAR: "But-- Look, it's really simple. I am aware that the power is in all your hands. All I can do is simply suggest, ask, and be honest. Whether you're going to get an answer from anyone else, (tongue clicks) who knows?" 
TRAVIS: Why not? Maybe. 
ASHLEY: Why don't you leave now? 
LAURA: Yeah, but he-- 
ABUBAKAR: "Why don't we leave now?" 
ASHLEY: Yeah, while he's still put away. 
ABUBAKAR: "If only it was that simple. Why leave your children to fend for themselves when something big, dark, and scary is on their doorstep?" 
ASHLEY: To be fair, you're asking us to go to the front of the battle instead. 
ABUBAKAR: "I know. Try convincing my family to leave their children. They simply won't. I have said it time and time again, 'We need to leave. 'Just let them do their own thing, let them grow.' (deeply) "'But my children! I can't leave my children.'" 
SAM: Is that the Dawn Father? You're doing the Dawn Father thing, aren't you? 
ROBBIE: Right? 
ABUBAKAR: (snaps fingers) "Exactly." (laughter) 
ABUBAKAR: "Just loving you, hating you. Constant fluctuation." (laughter) 
ABUBAKAR: "Fear for our own lives like animals. You see, this is the thing, we are just animals. At the end of the day, we are no different to you. Mm, maybe a bit more powerful. But we still fear for our lives. We still fear for survival. The only way to get us out is the fear of our lives. Now we have always been a step ahead. You've seen Aeor, you've seen what they were, what you are capable of, and what we did." 
MARISHA: With all due respect, say we take you up on your plan. One of them becomes a vessel of Predathos, begins the chase. How can you assure us you still won't start that calamity? Do you promise to run? 
ABUBAKAR: "Every time that we have felt a threat, we have acted upon it. As I said, you are this close to an event happening again. The only difference is, however, is that not all of us are aligned on acting. There is a divide within the family, a moment of weakness. There has never been an opportunity like this before. Believe me, when we are on the back foot, which we have been, we will run." 
LIAM: Orym jams Seedling, his blade, into your table and little tendrils of vine and flower grow around it and waver. Some of your kin seem pretty set to fight one way or the other. Even if we take you up on your offer, it doesn't seem like you have a lot of sway over your brothers and sisters and what they'll do. 
LAURA: What if they fight us? 
LIAM: What if they start a calamity anyway if that thing gets loose? 
ABUBAKAR: "Again, I can only speak from the experiences that I have had. We have always had the advantage. We don't have one now. So what happens?" 
ROBBIE: Do you really think the vessel could control Predathos? 
ABUBAKAR: "I don't know." 
ASHLEY: I think I could. 
SAM: I mean, Fearne's pretty-- 
LAURA: I feel like, 
ASHLEY: I feel like I could, I feel like I could. I feel like I could. 
LIAM: Well, you know, one god tells me one thing and one god tells me another, I don't really know what to believe. 
MARISHA: I've never had a god tell me-- 
ABUBAKAR: "That's life." 
MARISHA: -- anything. This is fun. You're very beautiful. 
ASHLEY: That is true, I will second that. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I really was just like-- 
ABUBAKAR: "Thanks." 
SAM: As much as I hate to admit, they're right, he's super hot. 
ASHLEY: It's like, wow. 
ABUBAKAR: Suddenly, I start turning gold. (laughter) (laughter) 
ABUBAKAR: "Look, these are all valid questions. And I simply wished to present to you my opinion because I can, because someone allowed me to. I don't know, and I don't have the answers and that's what's so exciting about this. Because every single time there has been a threat or there's been an idea, you can see through it. I can't see what's going to happen here. However, I do know what will happen if you all decide to go to war. I do know what will happen if you unleash Predathos when we expect it. Which is why I'm asking you, or simply suggesting that you get ahead of us, get ahead of everyone. Again, this is just my opinion. I don't know if it's going to work. I have a feeling, a gut feeling. But again-- I am like you. I don't know what will happen. However, what I do know is that if you move too slow, if you think for too long, we will simply make the decision for you." 
ROBBIE: Dorian's been sitting super rigid, backed away from the food because he's disgusted by it. The luxury of it, the idea that it's not even real, but it's presented this way. Then he scoots forward and begins to relax and takes a drink and partakes and says: When we first met a few moments ago, I thought, "I can't believe this god is his own worst enemy" because I was prepared to serve you by serving my friends. And then we met and everything you said made me want to resist it more. But you've just given us the opportunity to unleash Predathos but control it and also get rid of you. That was the only block my conscience had. And if I can do both, that is a deal I'd be willing to make. I will never care for the gods, ever. But I will make a deal with them if it allows me and my friends the freedom to live our lives. And this does not sound like a bad deal to me. So run because you're scared. That would make me happy to see. 
ABUBAKAR: "You are beautiful." 
MARISHA: If we do this... How might you aid us? 
TALIESIN: That was definitely a question. I knew it was going to be you, too. Ever since that vision, I knew you were going to be the one to show up. And you asked. I'm in. 
MARISHA: We thought about seeking you out when we were in Vasselheim. It's honestly kismet to find you here. 
ABUBAKAR: "So here's the conundrum." 
MARISHA: Oh? 
ABUBAKAR: "I can't aid you." 
MARISHA: Hmm? 
LAURA: Cool. 
MARISHA: Wha-- 
ABUBAKAR: "Because--" 
MARISHA: He got a fancy sword from his god! 
ABUBAKAR: "Yes." 
LIAM: I don't have a god. 
ABUBAKAR: "The issue here-- I mean, I can aid you in some way, shape, or form, but in the moment, the idea of stepping foot or actively partaking opens the door for everyone to partake in." 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ABUBAKAR: "And that is something I don't want to allow because then I know what will happen." 
MARISHA: That's fair. 
ABUBAKAR: "What I can do, however," and suddenly you see me pinch into the sky and you see a star pulsating. The cool air suddenly turns warm as I begin pulling it towards us. As I yank it out of the sky-- 
LAURA: That's cool. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ABUBAKAR: -- a star, or what looks like a star, is about 10 foot away from you. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
LAURA: Wow. 
ABUBAKAR: The table and food disappears. So whatever you are eating-- 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
MARISHA: The scones! 
ROBBIE: Oomph! I just got my drink. (laughter) 
ABUBAKAR: -- isn't there anymore. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ABUBAKAR: "Please, walk towards me. Walk with me towards the star." 
ASHLEY: Always wanted to see one up close. 
ABUBAKAR: As you step closer towards it, those from the school of magic can feel a sort of supreme power radiating from it. You can make out a face. It's gaunt and hollow-eyed, feminine. Their eyes are burning with an intensity, it's unyielding, this star. You can hear it whispering. It's indecipherable. But there is a panicked sort of mantra to it, like a wish. 
LAURA: Can I lean forward and try to hear a little bit better? 
ABUBAKAR: (whispers) "(garbled words) The knowledge... (garbled words) the weapon. I wish the knowledge..." 
LAURA: Are these prayers? 
ABUBAKAR: "The weapon." 
TALIESIN: The knowledge is the weapon? 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ABUBAKAR: This star, the only thing human about it is the face. Everything else, there are almost like these tendrils just coming out of it. "(whispers) this weapon, I want everyone to see it." 
LAURA: This is her? 
SAM: Who? 
ABUBAKAR: "You want your aid," at the corner of its mouth, you see a hair dancing to its breath. "This was someone dear to me." 
LAURA: I want to push through the gate. 
SAM: Huh? 
ABUBAKAR: "But a series of events led to a-- Well, the planning of a last resort. But now I'm seeing that maybe I-- I don't need them anymore." 
LAURA: Has she been here this whole time? 
ABUBAKAR: "You want my help? Pluck the hair from her mouth." As you reach for the hair, it begins to wrap itself around your finger, slowly spooling itself. As you do, this human star lets out a hoarse groan as it begins to dissipate before you. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
ABUBAKAR: As it slowly unthreads, a sigh of relief escapes its lips. Suddenly, a powerful flash of light explodes from this star. Heat, energy, magic, it's forceful and you feel this sense of weightlessness, euphoria, it pierces you. And Laudna-- 
MARISHA: Aye. 
ABUBAKAR: The first thing that hits you isn't the light, but a smell. A smell you know very well, the smell of winter. Then an image hits you, something familiar yet alien. A mask, black feathers, and then a whisper. "Come find me." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ABUBAKAR: The last thing that you all hear is, "You have heard my side. You have not much time. Do what you believe is right." The first thing that you feel as you all awaken is the cold stone floor pressed upon your cheeks. (gasping) (applause) (joyful screaming) 
MARISHA: Come on, come on! 
ROBBIE: Come back! Come back! (screaming) 
ASHLEY: Please! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Ah! (applauding) 
MARISHA: I love you, Abu! 
ASHLEY: I love you! 
ROBBIE: Abu! 
ASHLEY: Abu! 
MATT: As your eyes flutter and your senses slowly-- 
SAM: Ugh, this voice. (laughter) 
SAM: It's so normal. 
MATT: It's what you got, man. 
TRAVIS: (poorly tuning string instrument) 
SAM: It's gross. 
SAM: Ew! Ew! 
LAURA: Don't you hate us, Matt. 
ROBBIE: Stop. (laughs) 
LAURA: I love you. 
MARISHA and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
MATT: Braius doesn't wake up. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughter and cheering) 
MATT: Just a pool of his own blood. (laughter) 
MATT: No. As your senses come to you, one by one, the blurry experience of being back in your body begins to become more and more familiar as you sit up here in the cracked chamber of the reforged Temple of the Arch Heart. The statue stands resolute and still. A golden band wrapped around your finger. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (gasp) 
MATT: And the echoes of the choices to be made and the times to come. That's where we'll go ahead-- 
ASHLEY: Don't! 
MATT: -- and close tonight's episode. (exclaiming) 
SAM: Ooh! (cheering) (oohing) 
TRAVIS: What'd it say? 
MARISHA: Did you marry a god? 
TRAVIS: What it is! 
ROBBIE: I love it. 
LAURA: It's called the Ring of Remembrance. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
LAURA: "While wearing this ring," wait, "manifested from the Arch Heart, this ring forms an invisible web-like weave around the wearer," that was a lot of W's and I almost-- 
ASHLEY: Wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh. Wittle weave. 
LAURA: "While 'weawing' this 'wing'," 
LIAM: What bwings us togethaw-- 
LAURA: "-- you gain a plus two bonus to armor class! As well as a plus two bonus (shouts) to your spell attack rolls!" 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LAURA: "And spell save DC!" 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: "You also have advantage on-- 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LAURA: "-- constitution saving throws." 
LIAM: That's a caster's best friend. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Constitution saving-- 
LAURA: "When maintaining concentration, as an action, you can activate the latent arcane power within this band. Roll a d20. If you roll above your current hit points--" (ominously) Oh. "-- you immediately cast the Meteor Swarm spell," wow. 
SAM: Jesus. 
ASHLEY: Oh! Because, oh, that's good. 
LAURA: "If you roll lower or equal than your current hit points, you instead take 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage." 
ASHLEY: And! 
TRAVIS: It's a last resort. 
MARISHA: It's a last resort. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: It's a last resort. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MATT: Yes. You have to roll higher than your current hit points. So it's something you-- 
LAURA: You got to be hurting real bad. 
MATT: -- to use when you're hurt. 
LIAM: You've got three points left. Yeah. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: There's still a chance-- 
LAURA: Oh, or equal to-- So if I'm at one and I roll a one, I'm dead. 
LIAM: That's, yeah. 
LAURA: Deady-deady-deady dead. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Or you can just take the boost to your stats at all times. 
MATT: That's fine too. 
LAURA: This is fucking amazing. 
MATT: But anyway, we'll pick up from here next time. 
TRAVIS: Jesus! (oohing) (exclaiming) 
MATT: Thank you all for joining us. We love you very much and is it Thursday yet? (exclaiming) 
MATT: Good night. (all clamoring)

Cooldown[]
MATT: Abu, come in, come in. Let's get another chair. We're both going to sit here.
LIAM: You kept that secret like nobody's business.
LAURA: How did you--
TALIESIN: How did you keep that--
LAURA: Where was he?
MATT: It was--
ASHLEY: And of course we had the longest first half.
MATT: I know, but--
TRAVIS: I had beer with him last night. He was in town "for the day".
ASHLEY: Oh! He fibbed.
LIAM: Get him in here!
MARISHA: Sit next to Matt! Sit next to Matt!
MATT: Sit down, sit down. We're going to chat about all this. I can kneel. All right, I'll sit on the chair with you.
LIAM: You were in character, because that was fucking magic.
MATT: So fucking good.
ABUBAKAR: I was shaking and pacing all day. Genuinely. It was crazy. When Matt asked, essentially, I was like, "Yeah, I'll do it!" And then I'm now backstage, and I'm like, "What the fuck am I doing? Why am I doing this?"
SAM: It's an impossible task. We had only questions for you.
ABUBAKAR: I know, and I was thinking to myself, "Oh, man, I got to turn the tables. I got to ask them questions." But I'm like... unhh.
TALIESIN: You were so good! That was so good!
ROBBIE: It's nice to meet you.
MARISHA: Oh shit! Oh my god.
ROBBIE: My character [JENGA]. You were so amazing.
ABUBAKAR: That was great.
SAM: How much prep did you guys...?
ABUBAKAR: I mean, I asked a ton of questions.
MATT: Yeah, we got lunch yesterday.
ABUBAKAR: Yesterday.
MATT: Like two or three hours, and just talked about all the lore.
SAM: Did you try to anticipate the things that we would be asking him?
MATT: The prep was mostly just one, getting up to speed with some of the important facets of the campaign from his perspective, and then letting him know a little bit about your characters. But mainly just answering his questions and giving him free rein as to what this was going to be. It started with a phone call weeks ago. After Downfall, I was-- there are things that the Arch Heart chose in that that I was like, "Oh. That is an interesting wrinkle, given the perspective of most of the Pantheon." So I called him and we talked on the phone for like an hour and a half.
ABUBAKAR: Yeah.
MATT: I got charged way too much international because I forgot-- I didn't realize-- totally worth it! No, it was just asking questions.
MARISHA: But, if I can jump in--
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Did you see the phone bill?
MARISHA: Yes I did. Because it goes onto my-- I'm in charge of the phone bill. And so I was like, "What the fuck-- why do I have a $200 charge--? Who the fuck--?"
TRAVIS: Zoom is right there.
MARISHA: Who'd he talk to?
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: What the fuck was this?
MATT: I was just asking questions, like, "Okay, from the perspective of how you've now lived in the Arch Heart for Downfall, how do you feel about-- How would you feel about these events transpiring through history? How would you feel about someone like Ludinus doing this? And the threat of this? I didn't know where the Arch Heart would be, I just started asking questions, and then you began answering as the Arch Heart and began building this whole--
ABUBAKAR: This whole idea of thinking about it.
MATT: And I was like, "Okay, that all being said--". And it wasn't an idea, I was just talking about it, and was like, "Okay, now that we've built this out, it would be really cool if they ever had the opportunity to interact with you as the Arch Heart. If that happened, would you be down to fly out again and do this?"
ABUBAKAR: Yes. Give me a reason. Give me a reason.
ASHLEY: That was so good.
LIAM: That was such a gorgeous bit of business.
ABUBAKAR: It was so much fun. It was great. It was really--
LAURA: It did really feel like you were a god. Like you were--
ASHLEY: I know, I was like I'm gonna bow down and be like--
TALIESIN: The vocal cadences--
ABUBAKAR: Took you back.
TALIESIN: I was just having those-- really, who else can you be-- too much, too much.
ABUBAKAR: I think a lot of it as well was-- Downfall was three episodes, right? So there was a lot of bits and pieces, like the hair, Selena. Like all these things I wanted to tie up and play with. I was like, "This is a fantastic opportunity to do it!" I've never sat in this position before as well. This is the first time I've ever, ever been in the DM--
TALIESIN: You're a natural!
MATT: Right? Right? You did so fucking good.
LIAM: When you're a god, the DC's always set at 30.
ABUBAKAR: I know. This is it. This is it.
ASHLEY: Anything you roll.
ABUBAKAR: It was a lot of fun. And also it's just playing, man. I think that was the great thing about it.
LIAM: I would like to point out that within the last 48 to 36 hours, one god told us, through me, "Fight."
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Because they blessed my sword up the nines, and then a couple of days later, another god's like, "Fucking get out. We're going to fucking bounce."
ABUBAKAR: But that is the whole thing, right? Where the Arch Heart is thinking, "Oh, we are now going through the cycle again, of do we fight, do we not? Do we get involved, do we not?" And it's like, "Okay, we're going to go back into it again because it's getting scary now." It's like, "No, we need to act." That's kind of where their head is at.
TRAVIS: And there's one other god in the Pantheon that shares your perspective.
ABUBAKAR: Yeah.
TRAVIS: It's Ludinus, because he's a god!
ABUBAKAR: It was great, as well, watching the battle behind the scenes and thinking, "God, they're destroying my home!" And then your action of crushing my face.
MATT: Yup.
ABUBAKAR: This guy!
MATT: You did that and I was like, "...Whoa. Well, let's go to break and see how he feels about it."
TALIESIN: Sorry for making you wait this long.
ABUBAKAR: No, it was great, it was fantastic. Again, there was so much to pull and mine from it and play with it, and I think-- and again, it was really interesting just watching again how the family turmoil that happens. How it happens here, it happens with the gods, and how reflective that is. It almost gave me ammo of being, "Yeah. Do something about it."
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.
ABUBAKAR: Otherwise it's just going to keep happening.
ROBBIE: I think we've been asking for agency from the gods for a while, so hearing that and being like, "Oh, you've got opportunities--" I don't think anybody's ever mentioned that we can potentially control Predathos. Not really.
LAURA: We knew that Ludinus wanted to do that, to control Predathos, but it would be serving him to do it.
ABUBAKAR: This is the thing. I don't know whether that is even possible. It just seems to be the only solution right now, because everything else-- again, it's that whole "Dr. Strange" moment of like, "I see everything that's going to be happening--"
LAURA: We should have asked you to channel into one of us and see how easy it was to feel that divinity and see if you could control it.
ASHLEY: Wait, so was that choice-- that is what the Arch Heart thinks is the solution. Was that your choice or a Matt choice?
ABUBAKAR: That was my choice.
ASHLEY: Okay.    
MARISHA: (laughs)
ABUBAKAR: We were chatting yesterday, and we were just like, "Oh, yeah, what do you think the Arch Heart's feeling about all this?" And I'm like, "I think they should get possessed. I think that they should do it."
TALIESIN: I've been sitting here since "Downfall" going, that's the one guy who probably is just like, "Yeah, we should all fucking run." I've been sitting here since that game going, there's just one voice going, "Maybe we just leave."
ABUBAKAR: It's just my opinion, right? It's just my opinion. It might not even be the only solution.
ROBBIE: We've been pulled in so many different directions--
LAURA: I know, there's so many choices.
ROBBIE: But I-- 
TALIESIN: I'm right there with you. Finally.
ROBBIE: --this one does it for me. As a character, it really does.
TALIESIN: This was everything I needed.
ROBBIE: I've been in a rock and a hard place spot since I came back. And this is an option that feels good, because (pointing to Matt and Abu) fuck you guys. Also, I don't have to feel bad about-- I don't want you to get eaten, either, so it's like--
ABUBAKAR: But this is it, right?
ROBBIE: I like the option.
ABUBAKAR: I think that's the thing. I think for me it's that whole thing about beauty and about the unknown and how anything can happen. I think that's what is pulling me and alluring me and this is the first time I don't have the answers. And I think that's what's exciting. That's what's really-- again, it's terrifying, but also exciting, and that's why I'm like, "No, you've got to do this." I probably felt the same way with giving you guys magic for the first time. Like, "What will happen? I don't know. Are you going to find a way of killing us? Are you going to find a way of becoming gods yourselves? What's going to hap-- I don't know!" And suddenly all these things begin happening. "Oh, okay, that's really cool!" And now I'm like, "Fuck, I don't know what's going to happen, but if Predathos takes over you're all-- what could happen?" So it's great. It's good fun.
TRAVIS: We have a lot of guest DMs and some things are hard to hide to certain parts of the company. I had no fucking clue. I'm pretty sure my face was just like-- (mouth agape)
TALIESIN: When you walked away, I was like, "But there's a continent happening."
LIAM: "Matt's getting up and walking away like someone's coming in. What's he going to get or do?"
TALIESIN: Getting a model or something.
ASHLEY: That was so cool!
ABUBAKAR: It's so funny, because literally like yesterday we had dinner.
TRAVIS: Uh huh.
ABUBAKAR: And you were like, "Are you flying back tomorrow?" And I'm like, "Yeah!" "Where are you staying?" "Oh, I'm in West Hollywood." Being in Burbank, like just here.

MATT: And you didn't have to curse anybody.
ABUBAKAR: No, I was so close. I was so close.
MATT: This is a thing, by the way. The Vestige that you just received--
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: -- and the curse were designed by him.
LAURA: This is a Vestige?
ABUBAKAR: Yes.
MATT: It is an exalted vestige.
MARISHA: Of course it is. That ring is dope as fuck.
MATT: It's literally crafted from the hair you watched him--
ABUBAKAR: Pull out and toss.
LAURA: You straight out made it--
ABUBAKAR: Yeah. The idea is that--
LIAM: Stardust?
ABUBAKAR: What ended up happening is that that hair was tossed in Exandria and did its thing. History as is. Selena-- in my eyes, she was lost within my own domain, and I could see her not finding anything to-- feeling lost. So what I ended up doing was I turned her into a star, a wish upon a star, a wish. She wanted this wish and she just kept uttering this wish, and so I planted the hair in her and it turns into this.
MATT: And the curse.
ABUBAKAR: And then the curse, yes.
MATT: There was a curse, depending on how this went. If somebody really drew the ire of the Arch Heart-- I was like, design a curse, what you could possibly throw on somebody.
MARISHA: What is it, what is it?
MATT: Want to read it? Drink some water first. I got you. "Mark of the Arch Heart -- Legendary Curse. The bearer of this curse gains a dark arcane mark across their face that covers their left eye, changing that eye's color to a swirl of orange and purple. The cursed has disadvantage on Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws. In addition, the cursed is vulnerable to Force damage. This curse remains until the Arch Heart feels the cursed has paid penance or exemplified their [Jenga].
LIAM: Till I say so.
TALIESIN: That would have been amazing.
ABUBAKAR: I was so ready. But then there was just a moment where I was, "This is actually really great. I quite like this." It was brilliant. It was--
TRAVIS: That was fluent, man. [general agreement] 
LIAM: More even than the vision from Downfall, this just threw Orym upside down mentally. But the whole time, I wanted to be like-- (adoring look)
ABUBAKAR: It's terrifying. It is terrifying.
LIAM: Will you commit right now to coming back in some way, shape, or form?
ABUBAKAR: Always. I just need an excuse.
ASHLEY: I can't believe you've never done that before. The whole time, I was like, "God, he must be so fun in his games that he DMs."
TRAVIS: I think we all have notes. You'll get there.
TALIESIN: You were just--
ABUBAKAR: Just riffing, man.
TALIESIN: God, you're good.
MATT: Yeah, right? I was behind the curtain going, "This is so great!" Me and Kyle were just losing it, hugging each other.
SAM: Every couple seconds I would turn over there and I would see Matt like (peeking around a curtain).
MATT: I was just proud.
ABUBAKAR: It was great fun.
TRAVIS: Round of applause.
ABUBAKAR: Thank you so much, man.
LIAM: What did we say at the beginning of this campaign?
LIAM and MARISHA: All bets are off, baby.
ASHLEY: That was cool.
TALIESIN: Changed my game. The game has changed in my head now.
MATT: Let's see where it goes. All right. Let's go.
ABUBAKAR: Thank you, thank you.
