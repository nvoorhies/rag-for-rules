Pre-Show[]
MATT: (like Gandalf) Hello, everyone, and welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
LIAM: ♪ ("Concerning Hobbits") ♪ 
MARISHA: We play Dungeons & Dragons. 
MATT: Welcome to our Halloween episode, where we are ridiculous every time. (laughter) We do have some announcements to get through before we jump into tonight's episode, beginning with our spooky sponsor this haunted evening, "The 7th Guest." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: One of my favorite games growing up. 
LAURA: Ah, so good! 
MATT: Sam, tell us all about it. 
SAM: Ah, this-- (gruffly) This iconic '90s supernatural mystery puzzle game-- 
MARISHA: Oh, we're still doing a character. 
SAM: No, I won't. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: This iconic '90s supernatural mystery puzzle game with millions of fans, "The 7th Guest" has been brought back to life in virtual reality! "The 7th Guest VR" launches today, 19th of October, just in time for spooky season. 
MATT: Ooh. 
SAM: On Meta Quest 2, PlayStation VR2, and PC VR. Enter the infamous mansion, and witness the ghostly apparitions of ill-fated guests with cutting edge VR technology. Do I look silly? 
LAURA: No, I was looking at Travis-- 
ASHLEY: Not at all. 
LAURA: -- looking at you. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (dreamily) You're doing great, man. 
SAM: Six, six-- (laughter) 
SAM: Six guests have been welcomed, but who is the seventh? And will you live to tell the tale? As you explore, puzzles become increasingly challenging, and dangers lurk around every corner, with each shadow, creak, and flicker of light adding to the tension. Now, the developers were kind enough to send me an advanced copy of the game, but they made me swear that only I would play it. 
TRAVIS: What? 
SAM: But since you guys are my best friends, my fellowship, I wanted you to experience it, too. So tonight, I present to you the first ever virtual virtual reality experience. I will enjoy "The 7th Guest--" 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
SAM: -- and describe it to you in vivid virtual detail, everything I see, so you can get the full experience. Who wants to play? 
MARISHA: I do. 
LAURA: Oh-- Uh. 
MARISHA: That's what it says in the script. 
SAM: Yep, thanks for volunteering, Marisha. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
SAM: Okay, are you ready? 
LAURA: I was truly, I was in it-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: I was like, I do! 
SAM: Here we go. Okay. Oh wow, you're in a spooky area, you've just entered a spooky mansion. There's wind blowing. (uncomfortably strong puffs of air) 
MARISHA: Jesus-- (groans) 
SAM: Okay, okay, and now you've gone into a hallway, and there's creaky floors, (creaking). Okay? 
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. 
SAM: Oh god. Let's-- You're going to move up, up the stairs. Up the stairs, you're going to hold on one of those, it's not a banister, it's that thing that you hold as you walk up the stairs. 
MARISHA: A banister? 
SAM: No, no, no. It's like that, it's like, you know, the piece of wood that runs along up the stairs, it's like a long piece of wood? 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a banister. 
SAM: I don't think so. Anyway, so, you're upstairs now. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. (laughter) 
SAM: And-- Oh, oh, something's happening! The ceiling is dripping something. Is that blood? 
MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
SAM: It's virtual! (laughter) 
SAM: Oh, now there's a kid, there's a kid. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: And the kid's creepy, right? He's-- (giggling) 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: He's handing you something. He's handing you a key. What do you do? Are you going to grab it? 
MARISHA: I-- 
SAM: Are you going to grab it? 
MARISHA: Sure, I grab it. 
SAM: Oh no, something's blocking your way! 
TRAVIS: Yes, and! 
SAM: Something's blocking your way! Oh god, it's a corpse, it's a cold clammy corpse! It feels so real, it's like a decaying piece of flesh! Sorry. Anyway, you run out of there! You run down the stairs! You slide down the, ah, fuck, it's like a long piece of fencing it's right next to the stairs. 
MARISHA: No, that's a banister. 
SAM: Oh, it's a banister! 
MARISHA: What the fuck? 
SAM: That's what it is! Okay, you made it out, you're done! (laughter) That's it! (laughter) 
SAM: That was virtual reality! 
MARISHA: What-- 
SAM: Did you love it? 
MARISHA: Yeah, Sam, I loved it. Is what you wrote in the script. 
SAM: Unlock hidden secrets, and outwit eerie horrors in "The 7th Guest VR," the ultimate adventure for fans of mystery puzzle games, and those seeking a new haunting VR experience, go to www.the7thguest-vr.com today! 
LAURA: I think the game is more fun than what you presented. 
MATT: I really think so, yeah. 
SAM: I was playing the game! 
ASHLEY: That doesn't-- 
MATT: I'm pretty sure Stauf's mansion is a little more-- 
SAM: There's lots of banisters in there. 
MATT: -- involved. Marisha, you got some announcements. 
MARISHA: Yes, I'm Legolas! (laughter) 
SAM: Is that how he talks? 
MARISHA: Here, he kind of pushes forward all the time, ah! (laughter) 
MARISHA: The thrilling conclusion-- 
LAURA: There it is, there it is. 
ASHLEY: There. 
MARISHA: -- of "Candela Obscura." 
SAM: I didn't fart on elves! 
TRAVIS: Huh-duh-duh, huh-duh-duh, buh-duh-duh, Legolas. 
MARISHA: Huh-duh-duh, huh-duh-duh, Legolas. (laughter) 
MATT: Hug a dog, Legolas. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Hug a dog, Legolas. 
MARISHA: The thrilling conclusion of Candela Obscura: The Circle of Needle & Thread will air on Thursday, November 2nd at 7:00pm on Twitch and YouTube. We're so immensely proud of this story. We hope it chilled you to the bones like it chilled us to the bones. 
TRAVIS: Brr. 
MARISHA: Mm. You don't want to miss it. (laughter) 
MATT: (like Gandalf) Speaking of Candela Obscura! 
TALIESIN and LIAM: Ah. 
MATT: The Candela Obscura Core Rule Book is coming out November 14th! (cheering) 
MATT: In both standard and deluxe editions. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: It's absolutely gorgeous. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
MATT: It's-- 
ASHLEY: Deluxe edish. 
MATT: I'm going to pull open this and pull art here with some creepy-ass shit. 
LAURA: Ah! 
MATT: Form your own circles, and investigate otherworldly phenomenon in the many layered city of Newfaire and beyond. 
TRAVIS: I love it, I love it. 
MATT: Look for it in all our Critical Role shops, Darrington Press Guild stores, and other friendly local gaming stores. Visit darringtonpress.com/candela to learn more.

LIAM: Show us the shinies. 
LAURA: Hold up the pretty one. 
LIAM: Show us the shinies. 
MATT: Oh! 
LAURA: Ah! (groaning) 
LAURA: That looks really nice. 
LIAM: Damn! 
MATT: Laura, you're up. 
LAURA: Oh yes, hello. Oh, I mean: (gruffly) Hello. I mean-- (laughter) 
LAURA: Dom's voice is very low, Merry voice is low! 
SAM: That's how he sounds now. 
TRAVIS: One, two, three. Hobbits? 
LIAM: (gravelly) That's right. 
TALIESIN: Hobbit? 
ASHLEY: Hobbits? 
LAURA: What? (laughter) 
SAM: Is that what they say in "Lord of the Rings"? 
TRAVIS: I just want a surprised hobbit's face. 
ASHLEY: Hey, give me some Old Toby! (laughter) 
LAURA: Okay, so anyway. For Halloween, you guys, it's the month of October. We have ♪ (triumphant fanfare) ♪ Welcome to ligolet-- ligament. (laughs) (laughter)

TALIESIN: I don't even know what you were trying to say there.

TRAVIS: No carbs in beer. 
MARISHA: Hmm...

TRAVIS: Facts!

MARISHA: Before we do this-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
MARISHA: Should we go around and tell people who we are? 
MARISHA: No, the-- 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: We normally do that. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Some people-- 
MARISHA: We always do that. 
SAM: Have never seen "The Lord of the Rings." 
MATT: That's true. 
MARISHA: Like Sam. 
MATT: That's true. 
MARISHA: Sam needs to know who we are. 
MATT: I'm dressed as Hagrid. (laughter) 
LAURA: Do you know who we are, Sam? 
MATT: You're a wizard, Frodo! 
SAM: Oh, should I? 
MARISHA: Oh, that's funnier. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Say who we all are. 
SAM: He's Gandalf the Great. 
TRAVIS: Yep.

SAM: Mr. Frodo, and that is Samwise Gangee. 
LIAM: Sam! 
SAM: Gamgee? Gamgee. "Gangnam Style"? 
ASHLEY: What's Frodo's last name? 
SAM: It's Frodo Baggins! 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
SAM: He's the grandson of Bilbo Baggins? 
LAURA: Yay. 
SAM: Is that right? 
MATT: Look at you. 
ASHLEY: Do you know my full name? 
SAM: Pippin-- (sighs) 
TRAVIS: Longstocking. 
SAM: Longstocking? 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: No. (laughter) 
MATT: Here, I'll help you, I'll help you with this. You should know this, you should know this. 
TRAVIS: No, no! 
MATT: (like Gandalf) Fool of a--! 
ASHLEY: I'm a-- 
SAM: What? 
ASHLEY: A fool of a-- 
MATT: Fool of a--! 
ASHLEY: Peregrine Took. 
SAM: Oh. (laughs) I'm still confused! 
TRAVIS: He was never going to get this. 
SAM: You guys are yelling, "Fool of a" at me. 
MATT: I know, that's fine. 
LIAM: And you're "Ice Road Truckers," right? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "Ice Road Truckers."

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off. (laughter) 
MATT: Oh shit, goddamn it, every Halloween. 
LIAM: Now we have to spend four hours looking at each other like this. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Arwen! 
TALIESIN: They're never cute episodes, you notice that? It's always an intense episode-- 
TRAVIS: Where are you? 
TALIESIN: -- at the end of October. 
MATT: Always. 
TALIESIN: Every time. 
MATT: Last we loft at, the last we loft off-- 
LAURA: Lost we loft off. 
MATT: Lost we loft off. 
TRAVIS: We can just wrap it here. 
MATT: Last we left off: Bells Hells-- 
MARISHA: Genuinely. 
MATT: -- in trying to gather answers to mysteries, and possible power advantages in the coming conflict with the Ruby Vanguard, and Ludinus Da'leth and his cronies, sought to look into the past of Ashton, as well as some unanswered questions that may lie within the Shattered Teeth. Traveling there, you befriended a ghost ship, and helped bring romance together. You wandered through the dangerous misty jungles, you spoke to Evontra'vir, the Great Tree of Atrophy, and learned more about the titan blood that flows in your veins, and were sent to where a remaining shard of one of the great Primordial Titans still currently resides hidden and uncollected. There, you delved through the very tight mountainous caverns beneath the mountain where it is held. (laughter) 
MATT: You went to the lava pool, and retrieved both Ashton and Fearne together within the depths of its molten rock. 
ASHLEY: That's right-- 
MATT: The last remaining spark of Rau'shan. And also seemed to draw the attention of Ludinus, and some traveling, magically traveling associates. Battle ensued, in which you managed to free Fearne from what seemed to be a intended grasp at having a hostage, and a-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Why are you laughing? 
LIAM: This is all just a simulation, right? D&D's a simulation? 
MATT: You guys are acting so weird about this. 
ASHLEY: The little hole that he can talk through. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT: Being so weird. 
ASHLEY: It's a little bit to the side. 
LAURA: It's like-- (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We all knew what this was going to be. Let's not pretend we didn't. 
MATT: So, no, went through the thing-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It's like you're talking out the side of your m-- 
MATT: We got-- (muffled by beard) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I love it so much. 
TRAVIS: Oh god. 
TALIESIN: Stop, god, no! 
LIAM: Don't put the tongue through it, man! 
TRAVIS: Looked like a fish. 
MATT: I'm beautiful. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Okay. Slay. 
MATT: And after-- (laughter) 
MATT: Goddamn it. 
SAM: Damn. 
MATT: After defeating what seemed Ludinus, though eager to throw himself into the lava, other than give you information, and maybe not at the full power you've expected, you took this fraction with you-- (laughs) Should I take the beard off? Is it going to be a problem? 
ALL: No! 
LIAM: We'll be used to it after the first hour. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: That's true. 
TALIESIN: We'll let it roll, for now. 
LAURA: It's not as bad as when you were Victor. 
MATT: Oh, that was pretty absurd. 
TRAVIS: I'll be here if you need me. (groans) 
MARISHA: Just hiding? (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Happy Halloween, everybody. 
LAURA: Happy early Halloween. 
MATT: Bruised, but stalwart, you took the staff of Ludinus, and decided to teleport your troop to Whitestone in hopes that the repaired harness from Ludinus' past might be the answer to unlocking the power of not one, but two Primordial Titan shards that are within your grasp. As part of the teleportation spell, you now drift through the magical ether of Exandria. I need you to roll a percentile dice for me. 
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. 
SAM: Here we go! 
LIAM: We're fartin' though space! 
SAM: Oh shit. 
LAURA: No, what, what? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah! 
ASHLEY: What? What? 
SAM: Well, so what's the 00 mean? Is that, that's 00? 
TRAVIS and LIAM: That's zero. 
MATT: That's a hundred. 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: Wait, three zeroes? 
TALIESIN: Plus zero? 
SAM: No, so, it's oh-oh-five. 
LAURA: (gasps) You did the same shit I did! 
SAM: It's bad. 
MATT: So it's five percent. 
SAM: It's bad, it's real bad. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: So yeah, that is a mishap. 
TALIESIN: Woo-hoo! 
MARISHA: A mishap. 
TALIESIN: This shit's going to get crazy! 
TRAVIS: I'm so happy, I'm so happy. 
MARISHA: 'Tis a mishap. 
LAURA: Did you really? 
SAM: Look at it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: As you all-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- get pulled into this sudden surge of arcane power unleashed with the runic symbols in the side of the staff, you are all immediately thrust into a space of spiraling arcane energy that's spiking into your body. It is a painful-- 
ASHLEY: Ow! 
MATT: Feeling your essence being torn from all sides, like you're about to be jettisoned into a million different particles, and lost into the magical weave of Exandria. To that point, all of you take-- 
LIAM: (like Gollum) It burns! It burns! 
ASHLEY: Wait, we still haven't healed yet. 
MATT: Aw, no. (laughs) That's not good. (laughs) All of you take 24 points of force damage. 
ALL: Whoo! 
TRAVIS: Not fucking around. 
TALIESIN: That's not fucking around. 
MATT: I need you to roll again, FCG. 
SAM: Oh, oh, it's-- 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
SAM: The teleport's still going? 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: (stammering) 
ASHLEY: Get it right, get it right! 
SAM: Help me focus, help me focus! Okay. 66. 
MATT: 66. 
TRAVIS: Six! 
MATT: That would be considered-- 
SAM: Or is that 69? 
MATT: For a place you've-- 
MARISHA: Nice. 
MATT: -- seen casually, that is on target. 
SAM: It is, it's 69. 
LAURA: Nice! 
TRAVIS: On target. 
ASHLEY: Nice. That's got to mean something. 
MARISHA: 69 is on target. 
LAURA: When we bamf in, we're all fucking. 
SAM: Bruh. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (chuckling) 
TALIESIN: Whose foot is coming out of my arm? 
LIAM: (like Gimli) My axe! (laughter) 
MATT: As the pain leaves your body for a second, you feel yourself finally pulled through an intentional destination. All at once, you all feel your feet touch the ground as the sky begins to warm you. The mid-morning air of a faintly cloudy sky above begins to greet you as you look around at the upper branches of the golden bowed Sun Tree greeting you at your destination. Immediately, some of the local townsfolk turn and gasp and look confused. Some folks run for a second, not certain what it is. There is trauma historically in the town of Whitestone that people who have lived here for a lot of their life still take. Pale Guard begin to rush up immediately as you get your bearings and you can see two of the front armored Pale Guard look up to the rest of you. 
LIAM: Hi. Hey. Sorry. No cause for alarm. We're acquaintances at least of the Lord and Lady here. 
MATT: They look at each other and one of them steps forward and pulls up the front of his helmet a bit to reveal these-- his light green eyes. He goes, "Do not worry. We were told to expect you." 
SAM: Oh. Yeah. 
MATT: "Bells Hells, right?" 
SAM: That's us, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. 
MATT: "Unless you have other business, we were told to escort you to the castle if you were to arrive." 
SAM: Who told you we were coming? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Well, they knew that we had people here, so. 
TRAVIS: What people? 
LAURA: Maybe it was Keyleth. Is she here? 
MATT: "Lord Percival gave the order. I don't know." 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that crotchety old fucker. 
LIAM: Letters, are you all right? 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah, why? Don't I look okay? 
LIAM: You don't look like yourself, and things went sideways on the jump. 
SAM: It's the first-- I haven't used the staff very much and my hands were sweaty. 
LAURA: I understand. I think that staff is finicky. I really think something's wrong with it. 
SAM: Yeah, it messed up with you, too. 
LAURA: Because every time. Yeah! 
TALIESIN: Shit happens. 
LAURA: We're usually pretty good with this stuff. 
SAM: Yeah. Maybe we should get it looked at a repair place. 
LAURA: Yeah. It's probably the staff. 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. Always blame the staff. 
LAURA: Not user error at all. 
TALIESIN: Come on, seriously. You guys can't tell me that this shit doesn't happen all the fucking time. Look at this tree. Jesus. 
MATT: They nod a little bit. "Well, yeah, but there are certain individuals that we've gotten used to seeing arrive in and out. But nevertheless, you--" 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. No, it's fine. 
MATT: "We know. Come with us, please." 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're coming. 
ASHLEY: We're right behind you. 
LIAM: I might just close my eyes through this game. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Don't do that. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Only I can hide from my destiny. 
MARISHA: Oh no, I hadn't heard Chetney yet. Oh no! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh no, my brain hurts. (laughter) 
SAM: He's a Plane Strider. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Sail away, sail away ♪ 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: He's a Plane Strider. That's true, that's true. 
MATT: As you're being guided through the town at the behest of the Pale Guard, accompanied as opposed to kept at a tense point, you can see other townsfolk begin wandering out once more. Your arrival here, a little less heralded, but you are a unique looking crew and you can see children peeking out of windows and some of the local townsfolk keeping an eye out as you progress up the pathway towards the castle that sits at the top of the hill. 
TALIESIN: Are there leylines in the sky, out of curiosity? 
MATT: Looking up into the blue sky, it takes you a second to focus, but indeed you can see the color pattern still shifting and shimmering up towards the stratosphere. 
TALIESIN: Huh. Okay. 
SAM: Yeah, we're going-- Yeah, we'll just go to the palace, yeah? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
SAM: Right? 
MARISHA: In the palace. We're going in the palace. 
SAM: Great. 
LAURA: Are you all right? 
MARISHA: I'm o-kay. (unconvincingly) Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I just hold your hand as we go in. 
MATT: It is unique. Even though you were here previously, you didn't have too much of an opportunity to wander through the city. Every time you've had the opportunity, you relive these flashes of memories, these flooded moments and familiar alleys and spaces you used to play as a child with your friends. You get these moments that are mixed with positive interactions and dark emotions that flood over you. This ice cold, slow knife that rests in your stomach as you turn back over your shoulder and see the entire city there, before you catch your breath and walk back with the rest of your friends. 
MARISHA: (deep exhale) 
MATT: Approaching the castle, the Pale Guard separate and open the front gates. As you step within Castle Whitestone itself, the familiar antechamber, the Pale Guard that's escorting you asks, "Lord Percival, where is he at the moment?" One of the other Pale Guard turns around, "He's in his workshop with the guests." "Very well. Come with us, please." 
SAM: Guests? 
MARISHA: Guests? 
SAM: There's other guests? 
MARISHA: Imahara Joe? 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
SAM: Oh, that's right. 
ASHLEY: That makes sense, because they were talking. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. That's why they knew we were coming. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: We're stupid. 
MATT: Leading you deeper into the castle, a different direction from your previous pathway to a location that would be oriented somewhat beneath where the office of Lord Percival de Rolo was previously. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Ignore me. Sorry. 
MATT: It looks to be a hidden door that is still partially ajar, but the outside of it is decorated to hit flush with the continuation of the wall. 
LIAM: It's going to take at least an hour. 
TALIESIN: That was on me. Carry on. 
MATT: I'll just keep on going. 
TRAVIS: He made a-- (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I don't like makeup on the cup. Carry on. 
ASHLEY: Yes. (laughs) (intermittent snickering) 
MATT: Immediately, the scent from the inside is an odd combination of a heavy smell of iron that is a bit almost painful when it hits your nose, like a chemical scent as well as familiar smell of gunpowder and other strange, weird, almost acrid metallic scents and tastes that sit in the air. As you begin to step down the stairs into the workshop, you see this large open room with various workstations at either side of the chamber against the walls. There's a clean main island that sits at the center like a table. You can see there are no windows in this chamber. It is somewhat subterranean in its construction, but there are these odd lights that sit on the walls that aren't torches. It could be magical. They slightly glow and shimmer, a little larger than a cantaloupe or a melon. It gives this soft natural light on the inside of this area. You can see there are workstations for leather working and metallic tinkering and all manner of tools and odd metal arms and contraptions that are all along the walls on the inside. What you do see is at that center portion of the room, there's also a massive desk you can see on the far back wall, this beautiful rollaway desk. But in the middle of this room, where that central table island is, there are a handful of figures all sitting around, some in chairs, some hunched forward, looking at the top of this table where you can see there's a smattering of tools and materials laid out and what looks to be, at a quick glance, the harness that you had left behind. As the troop hears the footsteps as you approach turning around, you can see indeed, Verna the Viper, the female lagomore that you had met in Bassuras, glances over and gives you a curled eyebrow. You see Imahara Joe glance up, he's got soot smears in his face. He pulls his goggles up and gives a big smile to the rest of you. Dancer is over in the process of doing some repairs on the small tripod-like automaton that follows her, and looks over and gives a nod and acknowledgement. There, on the opposite side of this table, arms out, akimbo to the sides with another set of heavy goggles with all manner of lenses clipped onto it, pulled up on the forehead, the thick, soot-filled beard of Lord Percival de Rolo glance at the rest of you. "Oh, well, it appears the rest of them have arrived maybe just in time." 
TRAVIS: Oh, in time for what? For you to make the needed transition from metal to wood? 
MATT: "Hmm. I have missed you so much." 
TRAVIS: Yeah, likewise. 
MATT: Imahara Joe leaps up real fast, and who'd be the first person to enter the room probably? 
LIAM: I'll head in. 
MATT: Yeah. Imahara Joe like, "Welcome back." Runs up and gives you a half shoulder hug and goes over and starts grabbing each of your shoulders. "I'm so glad you're safe." 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: "Oh." 
LAURA: Were you able to make any breakthroughs? 
MATT: "We're on the cusp. We've had a couple of speed bumps." He looks over his shoulder to the rest of the crew and Dancer puts a hand up on a bit and you can see there's a palpable air of frustration. 
LIAM: Is everyone playing well together? 
MATT: "Yeah, yeah. So far. It took us a little bit to get in the mood for all of our different experiences and theories. A lot of different angles coming at the same problem, but it's come to a pretty positive point." You notice at this point now that Dancer and Percival are very much at opposite ends of this chamber and are not making eye contact. Verna is still hunched over at the edge and Percival is lording over this table at the moment. At this point, Lord Percival looks up, "How about the rest of you? I assume you've had an eventful journey." 
LAURA: It was something. 
ASHLEY: Pretty standard. Just kidding. 
SAM: Yeah, Lord de Rolo, do you happen to have any protections against being looked in on? Because we recently found out that the bad guys were watching us from afar. They might still be watching us from afar. 
TALIESIN: Probably are. 
LAURA: Yeah, we fought-- Well, he looked like Ludinus, but turns out he was a clone or something. It was very strange. He had all of his powers, but-- 
LIAM: He just plunged himself into a pool of magma. 
LAURA: He had a stone on his forehead. 
MARISHA: Which we have. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. You got it. 
ASHLEY: Yes, we do. I have it. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Lord Percival takes his goggles off and puts his glasses back on and adjusts them on his nose before leaning forward. "I cannot say that I have-- Well, I do have what you ask, but that is specifically for my protection." 
SAM: But is the room protected? 
MATT: "There are protections within the castle, yes." 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: "But as far as the scale beyond it, that isn't my specialty." 
SAM: Oh, that's all right. I was just making sure that no one could be watching us here and disrupt your research and stuff. 
MATT: "No, we've worked quite some time to ensure that what we do here is far from prying eyes, as the problem that you described is not an unfamiliar one in some of our past history. As far as this interaction gem, it may overlap with the one final piece of our puzzle we're waiting on." You hear behind you as you've all entered the chamber another voice that you don't recognize go, (posh woman) "All right. I think perhaps I can bring this to bear." You see stepping down the stairs, an older woman in her early 60s or so, mostly gray hair with shocks of blonde highlights in the top of it, brought into these two braids that are circled up and clipped in. (gasping) 
MATT: You could see these long, it would be wizard robes are pulled back and tied at the elbow to leave the forearms exposed and you can see other dark dirt-like materials or whatever they've been messing with sitting on the fingers, as she steps down and pulls her hair back again to tie it and looks at the rest of you, "Oh, hello. Well, it's quite the crowded chamber suddenly." 
LIAM: Hey, we're Bells Hells. 
TALIESIN: Hi. 
MATT: "I've heard a bit about you, too. I am Arcanist Allura Vysoren of the Tal'Dorei Council. Pleasure to make your acquaintance." 
LAURA: Nice to meet you. 
MATT: "Indeed. What were we saying about a--" 
LAURA: Oh, Ludinus spied on us and showed up in the Shattered Teeth where we were trying to get a shard. 
TALIESIN: Let's give them the appetizer, we'll get into the main course after. 
LAURA: They showed up. He had some of the Ruidusborn, not Ruidusborn. He had-- 
MARISHA and LIAM: Reilorans. 
LAURA: Reilorans with him, but it wasn't him. It was a clone of him with all of his powers, but he stepped into the lava before he let us kill it and it had a stone in his forehead and it-- 
TRAVIS: It turned into snow. 
LAURA: Yeah, he literally melted. 
ASHLEY: This was on his forehead. 
MATT: "Simulacrum, obviously." Plucks it from you. 
TRAVIS: Sima-sima! 
MARISHA: Simulacrum. 
TALIESIN: I'm not going to remember anyways. 
TRAVIS: Synonym cinnamon. 
MATT: "No, sorry, I didn't mean for that to sound condescending. I was talking to myself. It would make sense that someone of his particular station would have the capability of creating a simulacrum quite easy." 
LAURA: Is it hard to do? Is it a-- 
LIAM: What is it? 
MATT: "It is essentially a magical copy of oneself, diminished in some capabilities, but in others extremely capable, especially those of the magical persuasion. Usually an individual is capable of only having one at a time of their own behest. But someone with a network as his would mean that he could have many." 
MARISHA: That was diminished. All right, that's great. 
LIAM: The gem plane. 
MATT: He looks at it for a second. "One of the limitations of a simulacrum is it's unable to learn. It's unable to acquire new knowledge." 
TALIESIN: Wait, does that mean that he doesn't know what happened in there? 
MATT: "This gem, I think is what allows him to learn what they cannot." 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
SAM: He's watching them through it? 
LAURA: He said that right before he stepped in, we were about to defeat him and he said, "At least I've learned some valuable things about you," or something like that. 
MATT: She clutches it in her fist for a second. 
MARISHA: He just face-planted into the lava, too. It was honestly quite a vibe. 
MATT: "I'm going to be honest, I'm a little sad I don't have that memory. He's quite the-- What would your wife say?" Percival, "The douche?" (Allura) "Yes." 
SAM: You've met Ludinus? 
MATT: "On a handful of occasions. Unfortunately, in my particular line of work, you have to rub shoulders with individuals you find detestable for the sake of keeping the peace. He's quite possibly one of the most, if not the most powerful practitioner of the arcane arts in Exandria, or was in Exandria, I suppose." 
LAURA: Yeah, he's on the moon now. 
MATT: "Which coincides with the stories we've also been hearing, that he's been many places as of late. But nevertheless." She puts the stone in her pocket for a second and reaches into her pouch. "May I?" Percival leans back a little bit and crosses his arms. "Of course. Apparently, I've reached the limitations of my usefulness. So show us what you are so good at, my dear." As the rest of the crew step back a bit. 
SAM: Such a dick. 
MATT: Allura steps forward and as you see now the glow on the central table, the harness that you had previously left behind in its damaged, aged state, it currently has a much more vibrant appearance. You can see all of the leatherwork has been either renovated or replaced. The scrolling across it, the filigree is immaculate and thin. The runes have all been replicated. You can see the metallic frame that holds the harness together is polished and also contains its own innumerable inscriptions all across its design. The elvish historical quality of its build is even more prominent on display and it is beautiful and removed from the historical context that it exists in. You can see amongst the belts that pull it taut against the chest and neck area, there is that thicker portion of its metal structure around the back of its neck. Where that same odd funnel emerges for about half a foot or so and opens up and is left open, you can see runes along it as well. It is inert, but present. Allura pulls her hand out of her pouch and you can see her bring these odd little leather roll of tools, as she rolls them out across the table and slowly begins marking in a few final bits of the metallic harness structure that are not connected by these inscriptions. As she chisels them in with this tiniest little hammer. You're familiar with hammer and chisel and all manner of instruments used for carving and shaping and sculpting. These look too thin and too frail to be functional against metal. Yet, with every single small hammer it hit, there's a slight flash of blue-green energy. Where she hits, you could see a rune is now carved under the metal, no more than maybe a couple of millimeters across. You watch as she goes across muttering under her breath. As she does, the tools glow. You can see bits of material that she holds in her palm, she spreads occasionally across the front of the hammer and with each strike, it almost seems to burn. As it does, another rune appears. Sweat's dripping down her forehead as she gets close and is muttering, and you can see the rest of the team's fidgeting, not in a impatient way, but an anticipatory anxiousness that now begins to fill the chamber. Eventually, she gets to the very, very final end of finishing it and (sighs) takes a breath. "Do you all understand what this is?" 
LAURA: A siphon of some sort. 
MATT: "This is a much-- Well, there are devices like this that have been used throughout the use of arcana, referred to as power stills. They are much smaller." 
LAURA: Power stills or power-- 
LIAM: Power stills. 
MATT: "Power stills. This, at this scale, this size and intent, I would call it, maybe, a Quintessence Array. It's carefully regulated, even in its most smallest applications. They're extremely difficult to craft, the highest level of magical enchantment. It's used to extract and refine arcane power from natural, magical materials or used in existing enchantments to transfer magic. Attempts to craft one on this scale have historically ended in tragedy due to both the volatile powers required and undoing the fabrics of magic itself, and those attempting it usually did not have the greatest of intents. The fact that Ludinus managed to create this initially, and accomplished it, speaks to his knowledge, his patience, his capabilities, and, to a degree, his ambitions." 
LAURA: This was hundreds of years ago? 
MATT: "Well, I'll be honest with you, I could not make this. The only reason we're able to do what we've done so far is because we're working on an already completed construction. And even--" and you see her fiddling the tools in her fingers as she looks down at it with this distant stare. "Even aiding and repairing this device gives me pause and I warn you that its use regarding sentient living beings is extremely amoral. But whatever help this can grant in learning about the Martinet and aiding your cause against him, I support that. All that I ask is, when all this is done, could you please turn this over to the Council or the Cobalt Soul for its sealing and/or destruction? This should not be out in the world freely." 
TRAVIS: I think it's up for negotiation. 
MARISHA: Chetney! 
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, you just don't give things away. I mean, this is probably a real opportunity. 
ASHLEY: How do we know that they're going to not do something bad? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm! 
ASHLEY: You know? How do you know? 
TRAVIS: Trust is earned! 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: "(laughs)" She laughs a bit. Percival leans across the table and goes, "You'll answer the lady who has gone so far as to help you complete what you requested. We're all on the same team here." 
TALIESIN: Yeah, smash it to fucking smithereens. 
SAM: Yeah, we'll just-- We'll give it back. 
ASHLEY: I was just giving a counterargument here. 
TRAVIS: You cannot wield it! It has no other master! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Very good. Lady Allura." (Allura) "Thank you. I appreciate your trust. Well--" 
TALIESIN: Actually, before you go, if you are about to go, we should probably serve the main course. 
TRAVIS: (mutters) 
TRAVIS: We've got something fun. 
LAURA: Yeah. One of the things we can take advantage of with this tool. 
TALIESIN: Whose bag is it in? 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
SAM: Probably yours. 
TALIESIN: Here, I'll-- 
LAURA: I think he's in the bag of holding. 
TALIESIN: He's in the bag of holding. 
MARISHA: It's in Chetney's case. 
TALIESIN: I'll get it. 
TRAVIS: Invisible! No, I'm just kidding. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I rush towards exactly where you were. 
LAURA: Wait, as you-- Are you going to hold it? You're going to touch it? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull it out. 
LAURA: As soon as you pull it out, I'll take control of it so you don't have to hold onto it. 
TALIESIN: Either way. I pull it out, place it on the fucking table. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. As you place it on the table (impactful slam) it burns your fingers, grasping and leaning it over it that way. You take two points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: As it impacts, you can see the top surface of the central table cracks ever so slightly at the impact and you watch as Lord Percival goes-- "(groans) (sighs)" 
LAURA: She can fix it. 
TALIESIN: Just build a better one. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Upgrade! ♪ 
MATT: "(growls) You can see there's a faint bit of a carbon ring of immediate flash burn on the surface material. 
SAM: It's gone. 
MARISHA: There it goes! (laughs) 
MATT: The center of-- 
LAURA: (laughs) Your hat fell off. 
LIAM: Your hat's gone. 
MATT: It's fine. Whatever. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: It was an eventuality. 
TALIESIN: Should I move it over to the kiln to be, but I don't know, everyone should look at it because I'm curious to see if she knows what this is. 
SAM: You talking about his hat or the thing? 
TALIESIN: The hat. Well, the thing. 
LAURA: Yeah. There you go. 
MATT: Hat on? Hat off? 
LAURA: Yeah, it's good. No, leave it on. 
TRAVIS: It's good. 
TALIESIN: It's a vibe. 
ASHLEY: Completes the look. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: Thank you. Yeah. 
LIAM: Vibes. 
MARISHA: It's a different look without the hat. 
ASHLEY: Yes. It confuses me. 
MATT: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just curious to see the magic lady guess. 
MATT: Now the placement here, this is an enclosed chamber, and while the temperature was a moderate chill now the room immediately, flash, becomes a sauna. You begin to feel the flop sweat begin to gather at the back of your neck and on the inside of your armor. Allura glances down at it, as do the rest of the troop around Verna, excitedly peering across the table. Dancer, who has been keeping a distance from this conversation immediately glances over with intrigue as Pussy II climbs her shoulder. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Imahara Joe is adjusting a number of lenses on his goggles to get to one that has a sunglass filter across it, so he can get a good look at it, because it is brightly glowing. The center of this crystal has this staring into the sun feel as it sits there and thrums. (low thrumming) Allura just, "Oh my!" (laughter) 
MATT: She does this odd, triangular carving in the air, leaving this very faint trail of magic behind and presses it forward with her palm gently. As it does, the triangle expands and vanishes around the object, and you watch that same color drift into her eyes. "(gasps) Where did you get this?" 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
SAM: The craziest place! 
LAURA: The Shattered Teeth. Yeah. 
SAM: In the middle of a lava pond. 
LAURA: In the middle of the winter. 
SAM: In the middle of a volcano. 
MARISHA: In the middle of the Shattered Teeth. 
TRAVIS: ♪ In the middle of the night ♪ 
SAM: It wasn't in the Shattered Teeth. We were elsewhere. 
LAURA: No we were in-- 
SAM: We were still in the Shattered Teeth? 
TALIESIN: We were still in the Shattered Teeth. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
LIAM: Just a different island. 
MATT: "Shattered Teeth island. I'd like very much one day to pick your brains. I've only been a few times and it's a curious place." She looks back towards this, "This, this is extremely dangerous and extremely exciting." 
MARISHA: Hmm! 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
SAM: Like Chetney! 
TRAVIS: Oh baby! (laughter) 
MATT: "Well, I ask you this, then. If you brought this here, what is intent with this?" 
LAURA: (sucks) (mutters) 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: What is that? 
TRAVIS: That was a lot of sound effects! 
TALIESIN: I followed all of that, for your information, so I was fine. 
MARISHA: Someone's got to suck it into their body. 
TALIESIN: We're just trying to figure out who. We've brought it down to two very likely candidates. 
MATT: "And you're certain that's a good idea?" 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: Absolutely not! 
SAM: We were prophesied that it could happen from a tree. A tree told us that it might be an okay idea. 
TALIESIN: We had a long talk. 
MATT: You see her have a moment going through her memory banks. "The Tree of Atrophy! You had quite the experience, didn't you?" 
TRAVIS: You're familiar with this tree? 
MATT: "I've read about it.' 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
TALIESIN: They were really pretty great, all things considered. 
SAM: We smoked with the tree, too. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Well, some of us did. 
MATT: Dancer chuckles in the background. "(chuckles) I'm sure you did." 
TALIESIN: So this is-- 
LAURA: Ashton has a shard already. 
TALIESIN: I am, in theory, infused with a Shard of the Empress Ka'Mort. 
MATT: "Really?" 
TALIESIN: So I'm told, by a tree. 
MATT: Lord Percival leans in. "Are you being serious? Are you just trying to fuck around?" 
TALIESIN: Adults are talking. Sorry. 
MATT: "You're in my home, you do realize." 
TALIESIN: I went right back to her. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I am definitely not fucking around, certainly not with you. Yeah, and this, of course, is a shard of Rau'shan the Emperor. The very fact that anybody like me would know these two words, I think, is pretty fucking impressive at this point. 
MATT: "I'm quite taken aback by it, to be honest." 
TALIESIN: Cheers. 
MATT: "This is curious. So the intent is to use the power of an ancient enemy of the gods to save them." 
TALIESIN: Well, at the very least, it can stop this terrible, terrible person. 
TRAVIS: But it also seems pretty clear that Ludinus was intent on taking it to fight the gods. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Well, we just have to stop Ludinus. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MARISHA: Also, it still feels like our goal to save the gods is more of a secondary thing because I think-- 
SAM: Speak for yourself! 
MARISHA: Well, it's first to just stop Ludinus. 
SAM: I mean, I think the gods are worthy of our attention as well. 
MARISHA: And to save Exandria. And the gods are kind of a package deal with that. 
MATT: Allura curves an eyebrow with an odd smirk and Percival, in the background, gives a "(chuckles) First thing I've agreed with!" 
MARISHA: He likes me! 
SAM: No, he just doesn't like gods. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: Allura leans forward. 
TALIESIN: He likes that. 
MATT: "Well, this is all very exciting. The prospect is, well, it could take anything to turn things in our favor." 
LIAM: I don't think we can afford to be choosy anymore. We're running out of time, I assume. 
MATT: "I believe you're right." 
TALIESIN: So-- 
MARISHA: Are you talking-- Sorry. 
TALIESIN: No, go ahead. 
MATT: "I've seen you around, in passing." 
LIAM: Yes, Lady Allura. 
TALIESIN: I don't know if it is everybody. 
LIAM: I'm surprised you remember me, but I remember you. It's an honor, really. 
MATT: "You look more confident." 
LIAM: Oh, well. We'll see. Have you had any word from the Voice of the Tempest of late? 
MATT: "Indeed. She should be arriving shortly. She retrieved some other individuals. We're to be having a meeting in the war room this afternoon. Perhaps you should join us with what you've encountered." 
LAURA: I would very much like that. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: How do you fucking know these people? Okay. Yeah. 
MATT: "Well, at the very least, I'm curious to see this. (exhales)" 
LAURA: Is it safe to just jump on in and-- 
MATT: "Well, let me finish the device first." 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Well, and we definitely want some opinions on, since I already have a, in theory, a shard in me somehow. 
MATT: "Shh!" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: She lifts the small hammer with one final tap of the device. 
SAM: Good GM move. 
MATT: (tiny tap) There's a little spark once more and you watch, at once, all of the tiny bits of script on this harness (whooshing) begin to light up with a vibrant blue coloration that is moving and pulsing as it goes through (whooshing and thrumming) like it's coming to life. As it does, you can see the leather itself seems to glow this very, very faint bluish light. The runes then shift to greens, to purples. The funnel itself in the back gives this crystalline, somewhat opaque, like a-- What's the word I'm looking for? Almost like a-- 
MARISHA: Opalescence? 
MATT: An opalescence. We'll go with that one, yeah. Begins to shimmer and shift, and everyone steps back a bit. As it does it, you could hear the table, this rapid tapping, like the very thrum of power on this harness is causing it to vibrate against the table, like it's shaking. (taps) The rest of the room takes a look at it. (Allura) "I believe it, I believe it's working." 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Everyone looks at each other. Percival leans forward. "Well, we'll see if indeed it has met its expected and then we can celebrate what we've all been sweating over for the past number of days." 
LIAM: What happens now? 
MATT: Well, obviously we need someone to try it. 
TALIESIN: I'm a little more nervous now. Now, or--? 
MARISHA: Is there a test run we should do? 
SAM: Oh yeah! 
LAURA: Just straight up do it. 
SAM: It sucks magic out of things? Maybe we should try it on something that's a smaller magical item first 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: "I suppose. Have you anything?" 
TALIESIN: Not getting rid of my pipe, man. 
SAM: I have a Pearl of Power. 
LAURA: No, don't use that! 
MATT: "Lady Allura." 
SAM: Well, I don't need it. I'm just going to kill it. 
MATT: "From what I can gather based on its nature, whoever's wearing this it can permanently take the enchantment from devices, and in some cases, creatures of magical nature and imbue the wearer with temporary benefits, and in some cases, permanent ones." 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
SAM: So it'll take the magic out of an item and put it inside of you? 
MATT: "To a degree. Not necessarily the exact enchantment, but the raw magical essence of it will instill you with the capability." 
SAM: This is maybe how Ludinus got all of his mighty spells. 
LAURA: Yes. He has a map that he X-ed out so many things that he had used it on. 
LIAM: Is that what he's been doing through the centuries? 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
SAM: Guess so. 
LAURA: I think to a point, yeah. 
MARISHA: Why doesn't he need it anymore? Or was this just a prototype? 
LAURA: Maybe he made a better one. 
MARISHA: A better one. 
MATT: "If this was found in Molaesmyr, it may have been left in the wreckage, but if he's made one it wouldn't surprise me if he's improved on it since." 
LAURA: He left this shitty staff there, too, that's totally broken. 
SAM: I mean-- 
LAURA: Every time we use it, it malfunctions. 
SAM: It works sometimes, but clearly there's a splinter in it or something. 
LAURA: Yeah, something's wrong with it. 
SAM: Maybe you could look at it later. With everyone here's help, it looks like you assembled quite the dream team of tinkerers and magic users. 
MATT: "Well, to be honest, I believe you've assembled most of the team. I was just called in as a favor. Anyway." 
LAURA: Who's going to put it on? 
TRAVIS: Me! I got an idea! 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: I pull out the Bag of Holding. This is a vial of cleansing flame. We only got one of these. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: But it's got pretty crazy properties. 
SAM: But you're not really a magic person, are you? 
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? I make magic! 
MARISHA: He can go invisible! 
SAM: Oh, that's right, he can. But I thought that was just a werewolf thing. 
MARISHA: Didn't you see that little boat he made? 
TRAVIS: Magic! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: You mean that he carved? 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Out of nothing. 
LAURA: So wait. Anybody can put it on and then it sucks something in and then take it off and give it to somebody else, or once that harness is on, does it stick to you? 
MATT: "I don't believe it sticks to you. But I mean, anybody could probably make use of its capabilities. I imagine an individual creature could only make use of it so often within a short period of time. That's my assumption." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I'm not going to use it again. We might as well see if putting it on hurts. 
SAM: What if it kills you? 
TALIESIN: But also-- 
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? 
TALIESIN: We're pretty beaten the fuck up right now. 
TRAVIS: I'm not! 
ASHLEY: We already-- You're okay? 
TRAVIS: I never got touched! 
TALIESIN: Oh my god, you are! You didn't do shit. 
TRAVIS: I'm pristine! 
SAM: You got zapped by the teleport. I will give you some healing. 
LIAM: We got a lot of people who can take care of us here. 
TALIESIN: We're pretty fucked up in general. Don't-- yeah, we've got-- 
TRAVIS: I've got 69 hit points. I'm ready! 
ALL: Nice. 
LIAM: Nice! 
LAURA: Put it on, Chet. 
SAM: I'm going to heal you up. I'll do a-- 
TRAVIS: You're going to ruin my 69? 
MARISHA: (laughs) Mm-hmm. 
SAM: I'll add on to your 69. 
LIAM: Nothing can ruin a 69. 
SAM: I'll cast Cure Wounds on you. 
LAURA: Some things can ruin it. 
MATT: Yeah. It's a lot to focus on. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, there's a very broad table of things that can ruin that. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: You go to 68 or 70. It's done. 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: 12 points of healing. 
TRAVIS: (mumbling) How did that? 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Amazing! Give it to me! 
LAURA: Do we got to wait like an hour for it to-- 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
LAURA: Do you have to-- 
TRAVIS: Sometimes the effects are instantaneous. 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
LAURA: I know, he-- 
TALIESIN: No, let's let this happen, because if it doesn't work-- 
LAURA: It's the hair. 
TALIESIN: -- I'll be okay with that. 
SAM: Of course! 
MATT: "Percival?" You see Allura's holding her hands out. He goes, "Oh yes. Right." He takes his cane and walks over to the edge and grabs these thick leather gloves and tosses them to Allura, who grabs them and puts them on and carefully reaches out and grabs the harness, and walks over and hands it to you. "Put your arms through." She opens the back of it. 
TRAVIS: (grunts) It's like watching a mom dress her child. 
LAURA: Aww, cute. 
TRAVIS: (grunts) 
MATT: Puts it through, and as soon as it makes contact with your body, it doesn't hurt, but it definitely feels like it's on the cusp of it. There's this faint electrical current that seems to flow through it that tingles. 
TRAVIS: (teeth chattering) 
LAURA: I think he likes it! 
TALIESIN: Any last requests? 
MARISHA: Wait. Is the funnel in the front or is funnel in the back? 
MATT: The funnel's towards the back of the neck. 
MARISHA: To the back of the neck. Right. We can do that. 
LAURA: Nobody get close to him. Nobody getting near him. He'll suck you dry! 
MATT: It takes a little bit to help affix it to you and clasp the back, and there's four metal clasps in the back of it that have to lock over and they latch so it locks onto your body. 
TRAVIS: Oh! (shivers) 
MATT: It seems, as she does it, it seems to adjust to your form, like the leather contracts and pulls down to your torso size. 
TRAVIS: Ashton, come give me a hug. 
TALIESIN: All right, fucker. 
LAURA: No, no! What if it sucks-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) This is my time! 
TALIESIN: No, I back up. I back up. 
TRAVIS: Aw! 
TALIESIN: Ah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: All right, what am I getting imbued with? 
LAURA: This cleansing potion thingy. 
TRAVIS: Put a tree trunk in my back. 
LIAM: Do we just pour it in? 
LAURA: I just-- Wait, how do we use it, how do we use it? Do we just hold it in front of it? 
TRAVIS: I mean, try anything. 
MATT: She looks at it. "I'm not certain if a potion has enough--" 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "-- permanent magic capabilities, being a temporary consumable item." 
LAURA: No, that's fine. 
TRAVIS: You're going to break it. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. 
TRAVIS: Give it back to me. 
SAM: Do we have anything else? I mean, I have a pearl of power, but-- 
TRAVIS: Give it back. 
TALIESIN: Let's not-- 
TRAVIS: One wolf claw goes (unsheathing swish). 
LAURA: Chetney, you need to focus on-- 
LIAM: Pearl of Power, portable hole, the staff. 
SAM: Does anyone have-- I'm not giving up the staff. 
MARISHA: No, it's our only way. 
LIAM: But you could wear it, and maybe you would be imbued with that ability. 
SAM: Just get the staff of power forever? 
LAURA: I shove you back five feet. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: I could try it. 
MARISHA: But you said, if some are temporary-- (stammers) How-- What-- 
SAM: We don't know yet. 
MARISHA: If some are temporary, and some are permanent-- 
ASHLEY: Then he really would be a plane rider. 
SAM: Oh, you know what I could do? 
MARISHA: Plane Strider. 
ASHLEY: Plane Strider. 
SAM: That lens that-- 
ASHLEY: I see. 
SAM: -- lets me identify? 
LIAM: Hmm? 
SAM: I can't attune it and have all these other things attuned. I could just try to suck that in. 
LAURA: Oh, and then you could have it all the time! 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "I will warn, it draws in the raw magical essence, not necessarily the enchantment, unless it's of a particular greatness." 
SAM: Level. 
MARISHA: Well, look at this castle. You guys have to have some magic shit laying around, right? 
MATT: Everyone looks at each other, then everyone, at once, looks over at Percival, who-- "(sighs)" 
SAM and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LAURA: You're saving the world, sir. 
MATT: Knocks the ground with his cane three times, the door opens, and you hear footsteps. One of the Pale Guard from the castle comes out. (Guard) "Lord?" (Percy) "Yes, could you please retrieve for me, let's say, some of the enchanted dishware that we were given last year by the Ventrals?" 
MARISHA: Dishware? What does that-- Why? 
LAURA: Yeah, why would you need enchanted dishware? 
MARISHA: Does it dance? 
MATT: "We don't need it, that's why I'm giving--" 
LAURA: Does it clean itself? What does it do? 
TRAVIS: Did you check with the Missus? 
LIAM: Comes out with food on it. 
LAURA: Oh, that's cool. 
TRAVIS: They get personal about that stuff. 
LAURA: I could do that. 
MATT: "Lady Vex'ahlia was as displeased by the gift as I was." 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ASHLEY: What does it do? 
TALIESIN: It's enchanted dishware, we're practically doing him a favor. 
MARISHA: I really need to know what it does. 
MATT: "It cleans itself." 
TALIESIN: I knew it. 
LAURA: That's what I said! 
ASHLEY: So, you'll be clean? 
LIAM: First guess. 
TALIESIN: Maybe you'd stop dripping blood everywhere. 
LAURA: I mean, I would appreciate that. I don't like cleaning dishes, you know? 
MARISHA: I agree, that sounds fantastic. 
ASHLEY: That does sounds pretty great, actually. 
TALIESIN: I don't mind. 
LAURA: Are you sure you want to waste that? 
TALIESIN: It's meditative. 
MATT: "I'm sure." 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: "We're clean eaters." A short time later, the two Pale Guards return, and they have a small chest and you can see that it-- 
MARISHA: Clean eaters? What the hell does that mean? 
MATT: It's this really nice, small wooden carved box. They step forward and present it to Percival, who's like, "(scoffs) Give me that." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Opens it up, and you can see there's, wrapped in this silver twine, there is a set of three sets of silverware that are all connected by this twine. On the box, there's a little note (laughs) that he takes it, and crumples it, and throws it back in the box. 
TRAVIS: Who is it from? Who is it from? 
MATT: "Don't worry about it." 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
MATT: He closes it. 
MARISHA: He doesn't remember. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: "It's the Ventral family." 
MARISHA: The Ventricle family. 
MATT: He walks over with his cane and holds the clasped silverware near the edge of the crystal funnel. 
TRAVIS: A blow hole? 
MATT: As it approaches, you can see the funnel begins to glow brighter and the object begins to shake a little bit. You see him get a bit nervous and pull back, and then bring it forward. As he presses it towards the very, very entrance of this funnel, you watch the set of silverware suddenly flash, glow brightly. He lets go, and they just stay there, slowly turning on the outside of the funnel. 
LAURA: Wait, is it silverware or dishware? 
TRAVIS: Silverware. 
MATT: Silverware. 
LAURA: Got it. 
LIAM: It's a spork. 
MATT: As it floats-- 
TRAVIS: It's happening. 
MATT: -- the light begins to, (sucking) shift inside the funnel, into the base of your neck. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: At which point, the silverware curls into a blackened, bent version of itself before scattering to black dust onto the ground. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: You gain five temporary hit points. 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
MATT: And are also instilled with the knowledge of what it's capable of. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: Mostly. 
LAURA: Is that forever? 
TRAVIS: (mind blown) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Whoa! I can see everything! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Chet knows Prestidigitation. 
LAURA: What does it do? 
TRAVIS: (protective stutters) 
MARISHA: No! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I see in your eyes the fear that would take the heart of me. 
LAURA: (groans) 
TALIESIN: For fuck sakes. 
SAM: What does it do? 
TRAVIS: What? 
SAM: We did this as an experiment to find out what it did. 
TRAVIS: Get this thing off of me! (dramatic moaning) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Tell us! 
TRAVIS: Wondrous item. The elaborate harness marked with runic inscriptions affixes to the torso of a humanoid creature. When activated, any non-artifact magical item placed within the harness' funnel for one minute will have its enchantment permanently removed. Depending on the rarity of the item in question, the wearer of the harness gains one of the following benefits: Common: Five temporary hit points. Uncommon: 10. Rare: The wearer's hit point maximum permanently increases by two; all attack rolls and ability checks have advantage until they complete a long rest. Very Rare: The wearer's hit point maximum permanently increases by five; all attack rolls, saving rolls, and ability checks have advantage until they complete a long rest. Legendary-- 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: One of the wearer's ability scores is permanently increased by two-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: -- depending on the item, as does your maximum for that score. Some powerful items might pah-stow additional benefits. 
MARISHA: Pah-stows. 
ASHLEY: What does that-- 
LAURA: We got to find legendary items. 
MARISHA: I want to be pah-stowed. 
TRAVIS: The next two paragraphs are just for me. 
LAURA: I want to be pah-stowed! 
MARISHA: Wait, what was that? 
LAURA: What was that? 
MARISHA: There's more on that sheet. 
TRAVIS: (shushing) 
LAURA: What did-- What-- 
SAM: What's the rest? 
MARISHA: What do your elven eyes see? 
TRAVIS: Oh. (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: If a-- (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: If a creature of powerful magical essence is physically touching the harness, the funnel for one minute, their magical essence is temporarily drawn from them, removing any magical ability they have for 24 hours-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: -- while bestowing a unique benefit upon the wearer until the wearer completes a long rest. This benefit varies depending on the creature. If a magical creature touches the harness for one hour or more, they are destroyed, and the wearer gains a permanent benefit based on the creature. Once a creature gains a benefit from the array, they cannot benefit from it again until they complete a long rest. If this item is used more than once within a 24-hour period, there is a cumulative 20% chance each additional use that it breaks. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: That thing's fucking-- 
TRAVIS: This is awesome! 
TALIESIN: -- insane. 
MARISHA: So, you can suck the magic out of a person, but they have to be touching it? 
TRAVIS: I just throw my back into Laudna. 
MARISHA: Don't touch me! 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: That was really good. 
MATT: "You can suck the magical essence out of a magical being." 
TRAVIS: Being, yes, not an individual. 
MATT: "If an individual has a magical essence." 
TRAVIS: Like a unicorn. 
MATT: "Indeed, unicorn, you know." 
MARISHA: So we can't suck the magic out of Ludinus, is what you're saying? 
TRAVIS: Like a nightmare. 
MATT: "I don't know." 
MARISHA: You don't know? 
SAM: Yeah, we can, if he stands right next to us for an hour. 
MATT: "If he's been using this for as long as he might have been, I'm not certain what he would be these days." 
TRAVIS: (long exhale) 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: What if you found a storm giant, or a-- Whoa. 
SAM: Well, we have a shard of something that we-- 
LAURA: Yeah, what is that going to do? 
TALIESIN: Technically two. 
LAURA: No, well-- 
SAM: Well, one's inside you, right? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: How do we activate that? Has it already been activated? 
TALIESIN: I don't think so. 
LAURA: He said it was dormant, didn't he? 
TALIESIN: He said it was dormant, the tree. He also said it might be dangerous for these two shards to intermingle. Or he didn't say dangerous, he said that-- 
MARISHA: He said it could destroy you. 
LIAM: A chance the vessel could break. 
TALIESIN: It could destroy me. 
SAM: But another person-- 
MARISHA: The vessel could break. 
SAM: -- could take it, right? 
LAURA: We could do one. 
SAM: This person over here. 
TALIESIN: Maybe. 
ASHLEY: Wasn't there something if you put them together with the right thing that it'll be okay? 
TALIESIN: It might come together and be okay, yeah. I don't know. 
SAM: How do we know what to do? I could ask my god. 
TALIESIN: We are genuinely in a place of never knowing what to do. 
LIAM: Couldn't hurt. 
LAURA: We could fucking make it up ourselves. 
TRAVIS: It's weird. It leaves a weird aftertaste in your mouth. (smacks lips) It's real tinny. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Tinny? 
TALIESIN: Tinny. 
MARISHA: Iron-y? 
LAURA: Do you still have it on? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You should probably take that off. 
TRAVIS: (jittery moan) 
TALIESIN: It might be a really good idea. Could somebody get him-- 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Allura has the gauntlet's still, "I'll go ahead, and--" (unlatching) 
TRAVIS: (jittering) (sigh of relief) Whoa. 
MATT: Sets it back down on the table. 
TALIESIN: When you are faced with a mysterious power and a strange technology and none of it makes any sense, the appropriate thing to do is to ask somebody who fucking knows. So. (laughs) Table of smart people. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Can that thing you think, maybe, no guarantees, either wake up whatever the fuck's in me, or maybe try and put these things together, and see what happens? 
MATT: They all look at each other. 
TALIESIN: Estimated guess. 
MATT: Dancer steps forward. "I mean, as far as I can understand, this item, this device seems to be designed to take and instill, other than, you know, nourish something latent. Maybe if it were to meet one of its own ilk, it could awaken." Allura steps in. "This object, this crystal that you brought, this part of Rau'shan, is an extremely powerful artifact. What you said as a point of warning likely is true. To have both within a singular vessel, it's possible one could survive, but it's also highly possible that it would rend you into a thousand pieces." 
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm already pretty rendered here. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Well, maybe you already-- Maybe that would make it more likely to happen. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
MARISHA: If you-- 
SAM: I mean, what about Fearnie? Can Fearnie do it, then? 
MARISHA: Maybe by Fearnie activating it, it'll still activate something in you. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Question, hypothetical. This is not me projecting in any way, but if someone did explode by trying to-- Don't touch me! 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
MARISHA: -- by trying to suck it in, would it also destroy the shards? Or would those be like (crystal clattering) and be left behind? 
MATT: "I have no idea." 
MARISHA: Great. 
TALIESIN: That was the other thing is, if they pull the magic out of me, could it then be moved back in? Yeah, I don't know. It's just, there's so much to think about here. 
MARISHA: I don't want you to explode. 
MATT: "We're in that strange area of experimentation, and unknown knowledge." 
TALIESIN: Well, I have a broken head, but-- 
LIAM: The legends about the titans were that they were mates, right? Am I remembering that right? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LIAM: Yeah, so maybe Fearne hoovers it in, and you two meet like Rau'shan and Ka'Mort? 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
LAURA: Maybe it'll wake it up. Oh, maybe you just got to-- (suggestive nod) 
LIAM: That's kind of-- 
SAM: Hold hands? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Start with a hug, at least. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ashton? 
MATT: "I don't know if that's necessary." 
LAURA: Oh, well, you know. 
SAM: Or just meet each other. 
ASHLEY: May be not necessary, but we could always, you know, wouldn't hurt. 
TALIESIN: Honestly, it just tends to end up that way one way or another anyway. 
MARISHA: Ashton, is the glowing gem in your head, is that the other shard? Has that always been there? 
MATT: You can see Allura is taking a very keen interest in your head as you point this out. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. I've never-- I've never-- I don't know. I don't know. It's very dangerous in there. 
LIAM: It's a really busy spot. 
LAURA: It's very dangerous in there. Seriously. We almost got trapped. 
TALIESIN: You're welcome to try, but it is-- Shit gets very strange in there. 
MATT: She takes the gauntlets off slowly. "If I might have a look." 
TALIESIN: As long as there's someone who's willing to revive me if I drop dead, and her too, obviously. 
SAM: Well, there's no reviving, but I'm here to heal. 
LAURA: I'm here to try to-- 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. 
LAURA: -- wake you up if something happens 
SAM: I'll cast Spare the Dying on you. 
MATT: "I appreciate that." 
TALIESIN: I think I've already got it still. 
SAM: Oh, great! 
TALIESIN: Actually, I'll be fine. Thank you, I'll take it. Well, I've got one, yeah. 
MATT: She leans forward, and carefully making eye contact, looking for consent to go ahead and-- 
TALIESIN: Don't say I didn't warn you. All right. 
MATT: You feel her fingers touch the sides of your head, one hand across the forehead, the other on the back of the skull. She begins to look inside. The rest of you can see this faint shimmer that seems to surround, like this ethereal orbit of particles that begins to encircle Ashton's head and where her hands are touching. She closes her eyes, and for a moment, it looks like nothing is advancing. You watch, you see Ashton begin to rock forward and back slightly. As he does, you can see the blue and red ghosted images of him moving out of sync with his movement. As her arms move, her arms also seem to give off that same energy before she eventually pulls away. "Huh. You-- (sighs) This is very odd. You are like a shard of impossible-- Have you ever heard of dunamancy?" 
TALIESIN: No? 
MATT: "It is a particular esoteric form of magic that dates before the Gods and Primordials, even, the very nature of the cosmos beyond, the creation of all, the destruction of all, the balance of the universe itself stems from these base fundamental energies. Gravity, time, entropy. Some of it is borrowed, and tapped into by the arcana that we understand, but dunamancy is something far older, and often mysterious. What you have lodged in your head is somehow a condensed focus for it. It reminds me of-- huh. There's a particular culture on the continent of Wildemount, known as the Kryn Dynasty. They worship pieces of an ancient entity that history has said disseminated itself into crystals referred to as beacons. These beacons represent artifacts that focus dunamis, and are the most sacred artifacts to the Dynasty. It is said that there are many still hidden throughout Exandria, and they seek them as part of their worship, and rites, and-- 
ASHLEY: Is he--? 
LIAM: Are you saying that's what Ash has in his head? 
MATT: "Oddly, I do not think you have a beacon in the classical sense, but an approximation, a half beacon, a... something new, something not quite the same, but of similar essence. You have a part in your mind that rests between reality and destruction. The fact that you're standing here is a marvel, and the fact that you've walked the path that you do is equal parts worrying, and... well, hopeful." 
TALIESIN: A beacon like a crystal? 
MATT: "Like an extremely powerful focus for a dark, not fully understood magical force." 
LIAM: You also talked about an entity. What entity? 
MATT: "A being referred to within the Dynasty as the Luxon. There is no historical confirmation of its existence, and some believe it to be a story to bring reasoning to what these objects are. They've built a philosophy, and practically a religion around it. But whether or not the Luxon ever existed, these beacons very much do, and I've seen one for myself." 
TALIESIN: You've seen--? 
MATT: "A 12-sided device carved with handles. It sparkles with the deepest of starlight like you were looking through the cosmos on the other side of the universe." 
SAM: Did we see one of those? 
MATT: It begins to call imagery for those of you that were present for the Malleus Key. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MATT: Something that-- 
TRAVIS: Ludinus. 
MATT: Ludinus. 
TRAVIS: Stuck his hand on. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Bag, bag, bag. 
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, yes. The Bag of Eternal Space. 
TALIESIN: Thank you, I go right in and pull my old jacket out. 
TRAVIS: That's fucking anticlimactic. 
TALIESIN: It's fucking, just a-- I'm going to trace, and I trace an octagon with two handles very roughly. Like that? 
MATT: "Yes, quite like that, actually." 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I dream that sometimes. Yeah, I've like-- 
TRAVIS: You dream that sometimes? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. It's, it's-- 
LIAM: It's hard to keep up. So you have a half beacon? 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, is that the same thing as the shard of-- 
LIAM: In your head? No! 
TALIESIN: God only knows. 
SAM: So he's got two things in him or them? 
MATT: "It would seem, which is why I'm a bit-- Well, you're either the greatest weapon we could hope for in this time, or will be our end. I couldn't tell you." 
TRAVIS: That sounds about right. 
TALIESIN: That's very me. 
LIAM: Well, boy, maybe we don't add a third thing. 
TALIESIN: I was put together by bits and pieces. This was not an intentional thing and it, I honestly shouldn't have survived it. It was, literally, I was put together with junk. 
MATT: "In an odd way, your fragmented nature might be what keeps all of this in check. I only peered but a glimpse. But whatever's inside your head is unfocused chaos." 
TALIESIN: Sounds about right. 
MATT: "Perhaps we don't put another powerful entity within your form." 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it seems fair. This all seems so old. 
TALIESIN: Figure out a way to maybe start up what's already in there? 
MATT: "Maybe. I hate the idea of turning this wonderful city we've put so much effort into safeguarding into a crater." She looks towards the Lord Percival who goes, "My wife would be extremely angry." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I like her. I'd feel very bad about that. 
TRAVIS: So this Luxon is an ancient creature that's not confirmed in the histories that worship fragments of it. Predathos is some ancient being that attacked some of the gods and was sealed away as a red moon? Am I getting that right? 
LIAM: Those are two different things, yeah. 
MATT: Number of nods in the room is that everyone grasps it. (Allura) "More or less, I suppose." 
TRAVIS: Fuck! 
LAURA: Are they connected? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. I mean, what if a being was destroyed and shattered into a bunch of pieces and Predathos was around eating gods, does that mean the Luxon was attacked by whatever Predathos is? 
TALIESIN: Maybe it's a messy eater. 
TRAVIS: Is there part of the Luxon in the moon? 
MARISHA: (gasps) Maybe we could find one of these beacons and suck it in! 
TRAVIS: Maybe they're looking for them. Oh, we're on the case! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: We figured it out! 
MARISHA: Ah! 
MATT: "All right. I will say that-- Much of this is beyond me and beyond many of us. There are so many mysteries in the universe beyond just Exandria itself. We've already, as you are, it seems have come in contact with many of these powers that are beyond comprehension." 
LIAM: It's hard to pick apart the history from the myth. 
TALIESIN: I just put them on my jacket. I just don't. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "This is what draws me to my studies to hopefully find answers and the people I work with." 
MARISHA: Do you know of more powerful things that we can suck into ourselves? 
TRAVIS: That is a interesting sentence. 
TALIESIN: Rephrase. Well, no never mind. 
MARISHA: How do I do-- That was accurate. The thing, just say I wanted-- 
MATT: "I'm sure there are. Pertaining to what you were saying, there is so much more beyond this world. There are other worlds out there. There are planar dimensions that we're still only grasping the very edge of. This is what excites people like me in the Arcana Pansophical. This is what drives us to understand the world around us before people like Ludinus misused that knowledge. But it is terrifying as much as it is exciting. And in an odd way, there's a bit of peace in stumbling through these mysteries firsthand without grasping the whole picture. To that I... To that I kind of envy you to a certain degree." 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: When this is over, I want to go check out, visit the Kryn Dynasty. I've never been. I've read about it. 
MATT: "I would be very careful. They might be very intrigued by your noggin there and perhaps less eager to converse over its significance." 
SAM: Maybe they'll wear a hat. 
MATT: "Might be a good idea." 
MARISHA: I don't think I've ever seen you wear a hat. 
TALIESIN: Not a fan of wearing a hat. 
MATT: "They're a fine--" 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, unless necessary. 
MATT: "They're a fine people. Just... there can be some misunderstanding. I-- Unfortunately, I have compatriots that have better knowledge of this, but we've been unable to communicate since the... the solstice continues." 
SAM: Wait. You are assembling a group to have a discussion soon? 
MATT: "There is... some of us that we were able to communicate with, make contact with to draw together, and we continue to reach outward. But the time grows thin. There's much to discuss. But I would hate to repeat myself, especially if such a meeting is to occur in the next few hours." 
MARISHA: Can we come? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we? 
MATT: "Oh, I would certainly hope you would." 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Can we take short-- just a little bit of a nap for a minute, also would be, I'm personally a little wasted. I don't know about the rest of you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I agree. 
LIAM: I'm going to talk about this shard. I mean, if Ludinus wanted it, we have it. It's probably better that we use it. 
TALIESIN: Want to put a weird fire emperor in you? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I mean it wouldn't be the first time. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes, I, it's-- 
TALIESIN: A few. 
ASHLEY: I mean, we could certainly try. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh yeah, there we go. Everybody drink. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I've always wanted a sister. This could be fun. Let's get weird. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you've always wanted-- 
LAURA: A sister, oh. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) That's not exactly what I was thinking. 
TRAVIS: (guffaws) 
MARISHA: It's mixed messages, but it's fine. You know, we can-- 
TRAVIS: That took it to a very Lannister place. 
TRAVIS: No, I'm well aware of what they were going in there. But yeah. 
LIAM: We're figuring things out. 
TALIESIN: We'll figure it out. 
LAURA: So is it dangerous? Should we not use it again today since it might destroy itself? 
SAM: Oh, we used it already today. 
TALIESIN: We also probably should rest because we have our ass kicked. 
ASHLEY: Yes, absolutely. 
LAURA: Yeah. We could chill for an hour. She said the meeting's going to be in a couple. 
TALIESIN: We literally dived into a pool of magma head first. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. 
LAURA: We did. 
TALIESIN: I turned red. 
MATT: "Really?" 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "That's terrifying." 
TALIESIN: Orange. 
LAURA: Yeah, it was a orange-y sort of red. 
MARISHA: You were like a gradient. 
TALIESIN: I saw this bit, so it was kind of sad. 
MARISHA: It was awesome. 
LIAM: It was scary, but it ended okay. 
LAURA: Wait, do you have clothes on yet? 
TALIESIN: Yes, I put my clothes on before we got attacked by the weird guy with the gem. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: But thank you. 
MARISHA: Just shirt cocking through Whitestone. (laughter) 
MATT: No wonder the townsfolk were-- 
TALIESIN: Can we retcon that? 
MATT: -- coming out. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's the de Rolo way. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Indeed. 
MARISHA: His residuum shine. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
LAURA: Yeah, residuum, could that be something? 
TALIESIN: That was part of what did this to me. 
SAM: Well, that doesn't hold magical power-- 
LAURA: Oh, it amplifies magical. 
SAM: -- just boosts it. 
LAURA: Right, all right. 
LIAM: I mean what? 
ASHLEY: What about that other stuff? Brumestone or whatever. 
TALIESIN: That's magical power. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I love the thoughts. 
TRAVIS: You know, I think a lot better on full stomach, and we've been jumping all over the place. I don't know where your friends are, but can we get something to eat? Wait, let me try. (thumps) 
TALIESIN: This room is. We're not eating in-- This smells like shit. 
MATT: One of the Pale Guard comes down. Lord Percival's like "(exhales), Yes, please see that our guests are fed and given some rest before this afternoon's gathering. Go." 
ALL: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Very well trained. 
MARISHA: Great. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
MATT: "I'm used to it." 
SAM: If I may, before I go. Well, what about our friends, Imahara Joe and Dancer, are they going to just be sent home or do they get to hang out for a while and given safety? 
MATT: Imahara Joe raises his hand a bit. "That's actually a very fine question. I'm not certain if Bassuras is a safe place anymore. My entire shop was nearly destroyed and was, I think there's-- In particular, likely a bounty out for most of our heads via Paragon's Call and the Ruby Vanguard. Is it okay if we stay here?" Percival gives that "(slowly exhaling), Yes, of course. It's been a bit of time since we've had enough danger surrounding all of Exandria that it causes us to intertwine with strange bedfellows. Perhaps the children would be happy to have some interesting storytellers around." 
MARISHA: Children. 
LIAM: How old are your kids? 
LAURA: We saw some. 
MATT: "Oh, they're a plethora of ages. You've met them." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) A plethora. 
MARISHA: I don't fucking know. Old and tired. 
LIAM: I'm in my shop. 
TALIESIN: That's what boarding school's for. Keep track of birthdays. 
MATT: "However, Lady Allura, I would like to have a conversation for a bit given the completion of our project." (Allura) "Yes, of course, Percival. But please rest up. We'll see you all shortly. Thank you." 
SAM: Good day. 
MARISHA: I, upon hearing this-- 
SAM: With your elven ears. 
MARISHA: With my elven ears, I grab Pâté and go: Go invisible. 
MATT: (Pâté) "All right." 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Stay here. And we leave. 
MATT: All right, as you leave, Verna, Imahara Joe step out into the hall, and the Pale Guard begin to lead them back to their rooms. They already had chambers here, but now it looks they're here for more permanent stay. Dancer also exits. You hear "FCG?" 
SAM: Mm-hmm? 
MATT: "Do you have a moment?" 
SAM: Oh. Sure. Did you want someone else with us just so you can feel safe? 
MATT: "I think I feel pretty safe in a castle filled with guns." 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: She walks up and drops down on her knee like she used to do in addressing you. Still not directly making eye contact, but less shut off and stoic. "Look, we all got weird shit in our past that we've had to work through or still are working through and-- There are a few of us who understand the difference between the reasons for being created and the nature of what you want to be. I just want to say... I understand whatever happened there wasn't you. I can't say I'm necessarily ready or comfortable yet. But I see that you've brought a very necessary light to some new folks' lives and they seem to be doing a better job of keeping you truer than I ever did. Maybe it's because I never really looked too far beyond myself. Maybe we just weren't a good team. I'll admit that. Got my faults. Anyway. I know you're-- real mushy on the inside for being so hard on the outside, and I just didn't want you going into more dangerous circumstances with this weighing on you." 
SAM: Well, thank you. I mean, that's more than I deserve or expected. I know it was hard for you to say, and I thank you. I think... You gave me a really great gift. You gave me a shot at living, and that's something that I'll be grateful for forever, whether you intended to or not. It was really an incredible gift to me. I hope to pay that gift forward to all my friends and keep them alive. Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe we weren't a great team and maybe I... I think I've just been trying to find meaning for so long now that I forgot that getting forgiveness from you or validation from a god, or a purpose from deep within my memory banks, it's not really, that's not a thing. None of those things will tell me what I am or where to go. I think, I guess part of life is just figuring it out as you go. Not not having a map. Not having a destination. If my destination wasn't with you, well, then I just hope I'll find a place where I can be happy and where you can be happy, and if our paths cross again, well, that'll be special. But thank you for sending me on the path. 
MATT: She finally makes eye contact with you. "You always were something special. Just don't fuck it up." 
SAM: I won't. Before I leave you, is there anything you can tell me about the fella you got me from, anything else that I don't know yet? 
MATT: "I mean, D's-- D's been a rumored dealer for a number of years now. Those of us who delve in toying with automation through arcana and it's like a scrapper scavenger. The reason there's some mystique about him is he gets around quick and seems to have some of the more-- unique pieces. He spends his time wearing a mask. At first, you think it's just to build a air of mystery, to strike out with a brand that finds a unique against all the rest of the scrappers. But he-- I don't know. There's something about him I don't trust, and that's why I liked his wares, if that makes any sense." 
SAM: It does. Does he like money? 
MATT: "He takes money. Anybody who's a proper scrapper does. Don't know what he uses it for. Drink, building a stronghold somewhere. I don't know. But whatever he's doing, he makes good money. At least I've given him some and others have as well." 
SAM: Well, I hope they take good care of you here, and if they don't, just tell me, and I'll raise hell about it. I feel like I should give you something. I don't really have anything. I don't keep any money. I eat it. (laughter) 
MATT: "Yeah, you're always a tough investment. Nah, I don't need nothing. You've given me plenty." 
SAM: Can I give you a hug? 
MATT: (exhales) 
SAM: All right, I'll come and sort of put my arms around her. 
MATT: You doing the one saw blade arm, that side of the body. She leans a little away from, is like, "Eh." (laughs) You can feel the tension in her body as you do. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, it's okay. 
MATT: "Okay, okay. That's enough. That's--" 
SAM: That's fine. That's good. That was something. 
MATT: "I'm going to go take a hell of a nap after drinking a hell of a pint." 
SAM: Good night. 
MATT: "Good night. Come on, Pussy." 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (chuckle) 
MATT: (metal wings flapping) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: I'll rejoin the others. 
TRAVIS: That's what it sounds like. 
MATT: In the interim, Pâté's in the shadowed corner of the work room. You see Percival walking around in a circle around the table for a bit. 
MATT: "(sighs) Lady Vysoren, this is extremely upsetting." He's been a hard ass. He's been a dick this whole time. But you see his face drop. There's a softness and a worry on his brow that you haven't seen before. "I'm not against making Whitestone a sanctuary once more, but historically that's always brought with it its own danger. And my family is here. My people are here. We've already had to rebuild once. Can you assure me that we can take this struggle elsewhere?" Allura turns to him, "Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, I can guarantee you that right now very few care about Whitestone. We have a red moon locked in the sky and as some would say it, we're being invaded by aliens." 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "So I think you have the necessary protections. Your wife is doing good work with the council. We're trying to gather all that we have and all that we can. Let's see what this meeting brings about." She looks back and looks right towards Pâté and goes, "Hmm. It appears we're being eavesdropped by some of these allies as we speak." 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh shit, no. Do a dance! Be charming! 
MATT: (Pâté) "Oh! Sorry, I was taking a nap. I was sleep dancing," and he starts doing the Charleston. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: The Charleston? 
MARISHA: Do a back flip! Do a back flip! 
MATT: "(grunts)" Roll a dexterity check for him. 
LAURA: (laughs) For Pâté. 
MARISHA: Jesus. Six. I don't know what his dex, but it doesn't matter. 
TRAVIS: One. 
SAM: It's bad. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's bad. 
MATT: He does a back flip part way and then "(grunts)" lands on the ground and recovers by doing the worm a little bit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughter) 
MATT: Which is not smooth. You see the bones (dry cracking) pop around. 
LIAM: So Percy is looking at nothing and Allura's watching a semi-transparent break dancing number. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: Great. 
MATT: Percival, hearing this, goes, (Percy) "Oh, what interesting lives we lead." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Allura flicks a finger and Pâté "(unsteady grunts)" gets ushered towards the door. The door opens on its own and gets thrown out before it slams behind. 
MARISHA: I catch him. 
MATT: (Pâté) "Did I do good?" 
MARISHA: You did so good. I didn't know you could do that little worm thing. 
MATT: "I didn't know either." 
MARISHA: That was awesome. 
MATT: "But know now, it's in my repertoire." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Repertoire. 
ASHLEY: "My repertoire." 
MARISHA: Fantastic. Remember that one. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
TRAVIS: Repertoire. 
MARISHA: Okay. Shove him back in his house. 
MATT: "(grunts)" 
MATT: No. The rest of you have a little bit of time to rest, if you'd like. 
SAM: Yay! Short rest? 
MATT: Food is prepared for midday lunch. 
TALIESIN: Oh god, please. 
ASHLEY: Short rest. 
TALIESIN: ♪ (Zelda tune) ♪ 
LAURA: I'm nervously looking around. I don't trust that Ludinus isn't spying on us right now. 
LIAM: Where do they stick us? Are we in a large sitting room salon type deal? 
MATT: They have a guest dining hall within the castle. You've eaten here once before. But it's pretty empty. Right now, most of the attention is outside of the castle or other chambers. So food's being served. There are a few guards posted at the door, but for the most part, it's just you all quiet at the table, finishing your meal and taking a breather. 
LIAM: Well, what are our next steps? 
SAM: We're going to go to this meeting, see what they have to say, and then maybe Fearne is going to suck in a shard of fire into her body. 
LAURA: Tomorrow, so we don't break the harness. 
SAM: Tomorrow? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We're all feeling good about that? I am. 
TALIESIN: I'm feeling very good about that. 
TRAVIS: Then we ride out. Ride out and meet them. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I will take it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: But if you can't, I can certainly carry you, if need be. Well, he can do it, actually. 
TALIESIN: I'm from Whitestone today. 
TRAVIS: I think this is pretty good. More learned folks, powerful biddies popping by. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Yeah, I guess we'll see how the meeting goes. But where do we go after this? 
LIAM: I don't know. I mean, let's-- 
SAM: Our mission from Kimothée Chalamet was to gather allies. These are our allies, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, we're doing it. We're doing it. 
SAM: This is it. 
LIAM: This is some of the most-- 
LAURA: Maybe D. 
LIAM: -- powerful people-- 
SAM: Maybe D. 
LIAM: -- in the world are here right now. Lady Allura is a legend. She's a legend who spawned legends. 
LAURA: Oh, really? 
LIAM: Yes, she's OG. 
LAURA: I mean, she seemed very powerful. 
SAM: Where did you meet her before? 
LIAM: She has dealings with Keyleth from time to time. So I'm always in the background. I didn't think she'd remember me. 
TALIESIN: You seem like you know everybody. 
LIAM: Oh, everyone's an acquaintance. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: I'm always a bridesmaid, never a bride. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: Well, now you're a bride. 
MARISHA: You're a very pretty bride. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I don't know what's next. 
LIAM: I need a haircut, guys. 
LAURA: (laughs) We all do. 
TRAVIS: We got this powerful artifact, or this item that's going to buff us a little bit. 
LIAM: Pass that down, man. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take a gander. It's in Gnomish, if you need me to translate. 
LAURA: Once a day, all of us just find a legendary item and get stronger. 
LIAM: Get swole? 
MARISHA: Maybe that's what we do. We can travel around the world and go find powerful things to suck in. 
LAURA: I feel like that would take some time, though. 
LIAM: Out-Ludinus Ludinus? 
TRAVIS: I bet that sword that talked would've been a good thing to-- 
LAURA: Oh, you're right. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry, I thought we were going to have some sort of grand machinations to get it back and it just never really happened. 
TRAVIS: I mean, it bought us passage across the sea, it was pretty good. 
LIAM: I wonder, would the sword wilt like the spoon did? Or-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: -- is that because it was a spoon? 
SAM: No, I think it destroys any item that you put in it. 
LIAM: I don't know how any of this stuff works. 
LAURA: What if he did it to a person? Would they crumble in the same way? 
SAM: They do, yeah. If you do it for a minute, they live, but you get their essence for a day. If you do it for an hour, they die. 
LAURA: They die-- For 10 minutes. 10 minutes. 
SAM: No. 
TRAVIS: We're in this city, didn't he say there were a bunch of tragedies that befell it before? 
LAURA: One minute. Shit, you're right. 
TRAVIS: They're not going to notice if a couple citizens go missing. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Whitestone's been through a lot. 
TRAVIS: Didn't even bite. 
LAURA: Oh yes, smart. 
MARISHA: It feels very pointed, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. Yeah, I can see that. 
SAM: Well yeah, I guess I'm trying to think of what else we had on our to-do list here. 
LAURA: DM. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: What is a wondrous item considered? 
MATT: Wondrous item is a characterization of items. There's rods, rings, weapons, armor. Wondrous item is the catchall for boots, cloaks, things that don't fit in the other categories. 
LAURA: Got it, got it. But it will still say rare or very rare? 
TRAVIS: Potion of possibility is very rare. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Yeah, most items have-- 
TRAVIS: Boots of speed, wondrous item. 
LAURA: Yeah, but does it say rare, very rare, legendary? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
MATT: If an item does not, just let me know and I can let you know. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: That what you hold in your hands is considered an artifact, which is an even further level beyond legendary. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: I don't think it works with artifacts. 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: Got it. 
MARISHA: It doesn't work with artifacts. 
SAM: All right. Well, we got to go to this meeting and see what comes of it. 
MATT: A short time into your rest, you finish your meal and banter amongst yourselves before you hear, I don't want to say a commotion, but the sound of heavy foot falls and approaching Pale Guard in further ways down the hall. You glance past the doorway and see there's about a dozen or so Pale Guard enter, and you see with a quick movement. Three figures, two of similar heights, one with large antlers, you can see-- 
SAM: That's our friend! 
MATT: -- that rapidly ascends the stairs into the secondary floor of the main chamber of the castle. Then one smaller one. You get a quick glimpse as they pass by before two Pale Guards arrive to the chambers where you've been resting. One of them is saying, "The Voice of the Tempest has returned and is within the war room. Your presence has been requested." 
LAURA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Let them know-- 
LAURA: So we rested. 
TRAVIS: -- we'll be there shortly. 
LAURA: We took a short rest? 
MATT: You took a short rest. 
LIAM: Short rest. 
MARISHA: Oh, we're going to do that. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got to build your aura. 
SAM: We're going to be late? 
LAURA: I took a spell back and then I regained them on the short rest, those sorcery points. FYI. 
SAM: FCG. 
LIAM: We're on hobbit time. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Yeah, it's time for second breakfast. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Elevensies. 
MATT: Oh my god. It'll never end. 
LIAM: I really want elevensies. 
TRAVIS: Promise? 
MATT: Gathering your things and riding the growing tension and energy that's pushing towards this war room, you follow the Pale Guards that called to your attention up the staircase, up to the secondary floor of the castle, down a long hallway to the right, to the opposite side of where Percival's office is into eventually a chamber with a large round table. The inside of this has these marbled walls with threads of dark blue and green through them against a pale gray and white stone. You can see large banners that depict historical moments of Tal'Dorei and a number of other depictions of battles, these multicolored dragons and a group of adventurers. You can see a large gray one with an axe. You can see another with antlers and begin to realize, oh, this is Keyleth, this is Vox Machina. These are events of their history embroidered into these tapestries that surround this war room, as well as other historical moments around Tal'Dorei's history. The large chandelier that sits above the central table glows and crackles and seems to be brightening slowly over time as you enter the chamber. You can see other figures there waiting, looking up towards you. As Lady Allura looks up and smiles with a nod, you can see Lord Percival already within the chamber leaning with his cane in front, both hands on it. You see the Voice of the Tempest herself, Lady Allura. You see the older halfling, Professor Ebenold Kai of the Grim Verity present and another woman of half-elven descent. Similar garb to Keyleth, though looking a bit older as well standing at her side. As you enter the chamber-- 
MARISHA: My mom? 
LAURA: Is it your mom? 
MARISHA: It's my mom. 
MATT: As you enter the chamber, the doors close behind and Lord Percival goes, "Very well. I guess it seems the time to speak is now." And that's when we'll go to break. (exclaiming) 
TRAVIS: Is that your mom? 
MARISHA: I think that's my mom. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Consider your oaths fulfilled. 
MATT: Trying to role play through this tiny little fun slit-- 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MATT: -- is its own unique challenge. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: But nevertheless, we'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll see you shortly. 
LIAM: I think we should get off the--

Narrator 1: It would be a nice place if it weren't for the colossally vast, quietly howling and increasingly close vast, terrifying, reality-gnawing tsunami of black fog ocean inbound rapidly. Narrator 3: Oh. that! Narrator 2: Oh, yeah. Narrator 1: It is a spectacularly terrifying scene. Listening to this, it may not seem particularly terrifying. But with the power of your imagination, you too can become very upset. Narrator 2: With our help. (epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music) 
ANNOUNCER: We now go live to a special address from the President. GALE: Hey, dweebs. Now as your president, I've been kind of killing it lately. I gave global warming an atomic wedgie. I balanced the budget by selling my Pog collection, and I saved the Queen of England from that octopus! But my kick-assery is far from done. According to this chart that I made, an estimated 35% of you are still a bunch of nasty goobers, but don't worry, I have a plan. Operation: Gag Me With A Spoon. It's easy sleazy. According to this study that I wrote, if every citizen subscribed to Critical Role on Twitch, we could reduce maximum goobage by a metric buttload. Twitch is the only place where you'll get a live and moderated chat. And! If you subscribe to Critical Role, you instantly get access to all their shows as soon as the live broadcast ends. So while you're oogling those Critical Role dorks with their sick goof-'em-ups and their nutty voices, think of me, Gale, the current president of (blows raspberry) whatever. Now, I got to go make a fresh batch of spitballs, but I guess I have some time for your boring questions. You. REPORTER 1: Gale, is it true that if you subscribe to Critical Role through Prime Gaming, you have to resubscribe every month? GALE: Uh, yeah. I do it right after my monthly prank call to Pee-on O'Brien. Next question. REPORTER 2: Does Critical Role have exclusive emotes for their subscribers? GALE: Uh, doy. Of course they do. I like the "Hello, bees!" one because bees are cool. I replaced my whole security detail with a bunch of bees that think I'm their queen. Last question! REPORTER 3: Yeah, with all due respect, is Operation: Gag Me With a Spoon a real policy, or are you mad goofin'? (record scratch) GALE: (scoffs) Am I mad goofin'? What, do you see me scarfing Milk Duds while doodling ding-dongs in the SkyMall catalog? Listen, I know I'm new to this. And I admit that when I made the wish to be the boss of everything, I did not know the witch that works at Woolworth's was listening. Well, Faustian bargain or not, I am the president now, and I have an obligation to lead this country. So to answer your question: No, I am not mad goofin'. Security, take him out! (bees buzzing) REPORTER 3: (panicked yells) GALE: (cackles) (blows raspberry) Later, chudruckers! (large explosion) (fireworks exploding) 

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: Good stuff. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: With his little glasses on. 
MATT: As you all step into the chamber, in which conversation has already begun, the doors close behind, and all that are present continue their discussion. Professor Ebenold Kai, the older halfling of the Grim Verity, steps back into his conversation. "The Verity has been able to reach diplomats and leaders across the Menagerie Coast and eastern Marquet thanks to Mrs. Vilya here. We have the support of Ank'Harel, Yios, and the Tangulan Keep in Marquet, as well as the Clovis Concord willing to offer aid. We've been wary to contact Othanzian officials unless absolutely necessary, given the nature of our group's theft of their historical records." There's a general nod. The half-elven woman who Ebenold referred to as Vilya leans forward to the table. 
LAURA: Is that-- 
MARISHA: My mom. 
MATT: (Vilya) "I have been able to contact a few allies in Wildemount that are aligned with our goals, some that are already tangled with aspects of this mess. Word of Ludinus being present at multiple places across Exandria reveals how wide his network of chaos has spread. More and more civilians are claiming allegiance to the Ruby Vanguard's ideals every day, causing escalation and disturbances, and leaving some politicians immobile. It seems organization of this movement has been well plotted in advance." Keyleth gives a nod. (Keyleth) "(sighs) The unbinding of many legendary dangers across the world has also only added to the fear and frustrations of the populace. Many of the realm's strongest have been caught dealing with these threats at a time when unity is paramount. The suppressing of communications has greatly diminished the ability to organize fast enough. Every step feels like three steps behind them." Allura nods and says, "To that point, the few of us within the Arcana Pansophical that have been in contact have concluded that the source of this scrambling of magic communication is either near or is the Malleus Key itself within the Hellcatch. With other militaries still trying to organize in the wake of the solstice and the dangers that have been unleashed at home, the only true military force that has been able to surround the site is largely Vasselheim's. It seems, however, that the Ruidians continue to hold a strong defense, and seemingly, word is they hold some innate capabilities that diminish some divine magics." 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
LAURA: The Reilorans do? 
MATT: "Apparently. There have been reports of support teams, healers and such, being lessened in their capabilities on the front line." 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Oh no. 
LAURA: Did we see any of that when we fought the two of them? We took them out really fast though, so maybe it-- 
SAM: Took them out? 
LAURA: Well, the Reilorans that-- 
TRAVIS: The Reilorans? 
LIAM: Yeah, the scrap we just got into. 
SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: Kind of made quick work of them. 
TRAVIS: I don't think they nerfed you at all, right? 
SAM: Well, aren't they saying that divine magic has been lessened near the Malleus Key? 
LAURA: Right, but the Reilorans are the ones that hold an innate ability. 
LIAM: An innate. 
SAM: Oh, I mean, I wasn't healing much when we were fighting them. 
LAURA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: We didn't give them a lot of opportunity before we, I mean, quite frankly, jumped them. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were whooping that ass. 
LAURA: Sorry, we interrupted your-- Please, keep going. 
MATT: "Oh, it's all right. All that being said, it seems because of this, the areas immediately surrounding the Malleus Key is, at the moment, a graveyard of war crafts and the fallen. Regardless, in our study with the Pansophical, another worrying hypothesis has risen. The longer that the Key holds the peak of the Apogee Solstice in place, a cumulative strain on the very weave of magic, the leylines themselves, begins to build." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "I do not know for certain what it could lead to, this is unprecedented. But we worry that with enough tension, over time, it could tear the weave itself. This could alter or rearrange the fundamentals of magic as we understand it throughout the world, or worse, destroy it, or even Exandria." 
SAM: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: "So regardless, that tower likely has to be destroyed." At which Percival steps in. (Percy) "I agree, but is that not the link to Ruidus we need to stop Ludinus and his toadies before they unleash divine Armageddon? If we destroy the tower, we have no way to even reach them to stop them." Keyleth then follows up on that point. (Keyleth) "We don't even know what awaits us on that moon. With this many unknowns, we cannot send our forces into a possible meat grinder on the other side of that bridge. We need intel, a scouting mission to quickly survey the state of things, how dire our timeline is in return. The fact that the gods still remain after these weeks tells me that the awakening of Predathos isn't as simple as the Vanguard just shaking the moon awake." 
LAURA: We'll scout. 
TALIESIN: We already have intel. 
TRAVIS: We already have scouted. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: A little bit. 
SAM: Well, through visions, yeah. 
LAURA: Sure, but I've seen the surface. 
MATT: There's a pause in the chamber, but Keyleth nods a bit. You've told her a little bit of this. (Keyleth) "Indeed, you've had some visions, yes?" 
MARISHA: Imogen's Ruidusborn. 
SAM: Yeah, she's connected to the beings up there and knows them intimately. 
MARISHA: In a good way, not in like a-- 
LAURA: Yeah, it's not like I'm, you know. 
MARISHA: Like a turncoat kind of way. 
MATT: Percival leans in. (Percy) "And how well do you know this surface?" 
LAURA: In his head, he hears: I've seen it. 
MATT: "Oh, I hate that. I really don't like that." (laughter) 
MATT: "I don't like that at all. Mm. Well, then what can you tell us?" 
LAURA: There's cities, there's wildlife, red dust storms. The people there feel bitter, betrayed. They've been trapped. They have a whole society. 
MATT: Allura looks over to you. (Allura) "Do you know anything of how they're organizing, where they're organizing, where they're going, or what it is they're hoping, specifically, to achieve up there? Do we know where the bridge leads?" 
LAURA: (sighs) I don't think I do, but-- I think they want-- I mean, they want to be here. 
MATT: "Hmm." 
TRAVIS: We'll have to go look again, find out. Plus, we've got one really big advantage: We're expendable. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Yeah, in her dreams, did we ever see where the beam was touching down? 
TALIESIN: Not wrong. 
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think we ever saw that specifically. 
MATT: Not specifically, no. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: Anytime I tried to get close to the beam-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Literally, the beam. 
LAURA: I felt a very strong urge to join the beam, if that makes sense. 
MATT: (Percy) "Would it be safe to even send you, then, if you feel this calling?" 
LIAM: Yes, it would. 
MARISHA: She's very capable, don't doubt her. 
ASHLEY: It's true. 
MATT: "I'm not doubting her, I'm just being precautious." 
LIAM: Our little group, this squad, has a lot of skin in the game. Put us to use. 
MARISHA: Plus, it's probably more advantageous to have someone who's closer to the subject matter. 
TALIESIN: We may have a contact even. 
SAM: Chetney's right, some of us are half dead already, or not really alive, or, I mean, he's going to die any day now, so. 
LAURA: Did you roll this morning? 
TALIESIN: We haven't slept yet. 
MARISHA: What if he just drops dead? 
LIAM: Oh, what if it were to happen right now? 
MARISHA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: I'm flirting with it. 
MARISHA: Jesus, every time. 
TRAVIS: (dramatically catches breath) 
TALIESIN: We do have somebody on the surface, maybe. 
SAM: Yeah, we also have an inside man, woman. 
TALIESIN: We do have Ira. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Imogen's circumstances are going to get us closer than anybody else. 
MATT: Keyleth puts her hand on Percival's shoulder and he nods. (Percy) "Have you put your trust in them? I apologize if I seem a bit brusque at times, I have a lot on my mind." 
LAURA: Not at all. Protect your own, I get it. 
SAM: It's the accent. 
MATT: Hmm. 
LAURA: Well, yeah. It is a bit-- 
SAM: Just sort of makes-- 
TRAVIS: It's also the beard, I think it's irritating. I do shaves, if you're-- Okay. 
LAURA: Percy's really let himself go. 
LIAM: Let himself, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: He's covering-- 
LIAM: What's he building in there? (laughter) 
SAM: Box of scraps. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Keyleth pipes up. "Well, I guess there is merit to that. You all have specific capabilities. Do you feel confident in your ability to infiltrate unnoticed? You're a small enough band in comparison to the legions that have been arriving and creating a military wall outside of the Key. 
MARISHA: You know, I was honestly hoping that, to FCG's point, we were just the bumbling fucks that no one was really paying attention to, but a little bit of that changed as of last night. I don't know if Ludinus was really interested in us or this shard. 
SAM: What we had. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Correct. But the unfortunate thing is that we are a bit on their radar. 
SAM: Also, the surface of the moon up there seems a little harsh. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: So we might be wise to prepare ourselves for inclement conditions, and it also might be nice to have some items that would shield us from danger or viewing. 
LAURA: That we can suck into ourselves and not use at all instead. (laughs nervously) Just kidding, I'm kidding. 
MATT: (laughs) (Keyleth) "She's kidding. She's just joking, she's just joking." Allura nods. (Allura) "I can make a quick jaunt and see what we can spare. I'm not certain what you're going to run into up there, but based on what you've said, we can provide materials, maybe a few odds and ends that could be of help. While I don't have enough items to protect you from prying eyes, I can impart you that sort of shielding for a period of time." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "About eight hours I can prevent you from being seen--" 
LAURA: That's amazing. 
MATT: "-- remotely." 
MARISHA: That's fantastic. 
LIAM: That'll get us started. 
ASHLEY: All of us? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Does the Terrible Tinkerer have any idea of things to make us a little more comfortable if we get to the surface of the moon? 
LAURA: I do know, well, I think that some of the Reilorans share a bit of my abilities. If there's anything you can do to protect everyone from mental-- 
MATT: "Let me see what I can do. I may have to go through my tome and prepare some specifics, but if you don't intend to leave in the next few hours and perhaps can give me a bit of time to--" 
TRAVIS: Of course, please. 
TALIESIN: Well, we need to sleep. 
LAURA: Well, we might stay-- 
TRAVIS: You're helping us! 
LAURA: -- the night if it means-- 
SAM: Well, it's not just us up there doing the scouting. We have to get there, too, right? So we're going to have to get to the Malleus Key again. 
TRAVIS: Exactly. 
LIAM: We have to figure that shit out, yeah. 
SAM: I mean, not just teleporting there, but are we going to have any help causing a distraction so we can slip in the back way or something? Just getting down there is going to be kind of hard. 
MATT: "Hmm, we can certainly put something together. I mean, causing a distraction..." Looks over at Percival. "I think we have a few ways and a few minds that could put something together. 
LIAM: So if Allura can keep us on the DL and put us right on the ground there, that'll be a huge help. 
MATT: "I think I could do that." 
MARISHA: Keyleth, we lost a lot of people the last time we tried to thwart Ludinus, yes? 
MATT: (Keyleth) "We did." 
MARISHA: I would just hate to have a repeat of that. 
MATT: "That's why we're not storming it." 
LIAM: Yeah, I think this time, it's just us. 
TALIESIN: And whatever our version of being sneaky is. I mean, it's something. I don't think it's sneaky, but it's something. 
LAURA: I mean, some of us can go invisible. Some of us can turn into bugs. 
TALIESIN: We did get in last time, actually. 
LIAM: Some of us are real small. 
MATT: "Well, if you can all manage to--" 
LIAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Why? 
MATT: (laughs) Oh no. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Oh no. 
LIAM: Quaid! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The worst. 
LAURA: No, no, he lost it. 
TALIESIN: I was waiting for it. I was waiting for it. 
MATT: We've given him too much power. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Too much power. 
LAURA: It's going. It's going, oh no! 
MATT: Oh god, oh god! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: The head's falling off. (laughter) 
MATT: We're good, we're good. 
TALIESIN: This beard is brought to you by-- Okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You look great. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Thanks, Tilda. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's what it is! I have been staring at you, trying to figure it out. Aw, I love Tilda. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: We must be careful in the mirror dimension. (laughter) 
MATT: (Keyleth) "Well, I think the purpose of this would be to cause a distraction, but not cause an assault. We are in the process of getting our things in order, of getting forces prepared much more than last time. The more we know about where we're going, the better we can all go confidently through that bridge and meet the other side. While you, should you want to go on this particular mission, acquire the information that you think is pertinent to this, we can begin to put all of those motions forward. If you infiltrate the Malleus Key, cross the Bloody Bridge, learn whatever you can about the state of Ruidus, the Reiloran people, how advanced the Ruby Vanguard's plan is, return, we can all coordinate an advance on this Moon of Ill Omen, all who are willing to go, at least." There's a pause, and Percival standing there. (Percy) "This is both terrifying and exhilarating. I'm thankful there is a younger generation willing to take up the torch." Allura nods. (Allura) "And you're all certain you're willing to take this journey?" 
MARISHA: We already had a conversation, naught just a few nights ago. Most of us are all accepting that we might not come back from wherever we're going. We've all lived pretty chaotic and honestly tragic lives, except for Chetney, I guess. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: This grants us all purpose. 
SAM: It's our calling. 
MARISHA: It's fine. 
MATT: "Well, who am I to stand in the face of bravery?" 
LIAM: They're expecting the nations of the world to convene. They're not expecting us. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm not going to let my kid grow up in a world that-- 
SAM: Mister? 
ASHLEY: -- that's as bad as this. 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Are you-- 
LAURA: Are you pregnant? 
SAM: Are you pregnant right now? 
ASHLEY: Not that I know of. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
LAURA: Okay. (laughs) Oh, Mister. (laughter) 
MATT: (hoots) 
ASHLEY: It's all right, we're going to make this a great place for you. 
MATT: "I'll try to gather more of the Pansophical and our associates to continue putting our minds together. Find out where the rest of them might still be." Keyleth goes-- 
LAURA: Oh my god, are you pregnant with Chet's baby? 
MARISHA: That would be so-- 
SAM: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: I kind of want this. 
SAM: You have to roll a d100 to find out. (laughter) 
MATT: (sternly) We are not rolling for pregnancy. (laughter) 
LIAM: What about infernal conception? 
MATT: Yeah, in the wrong systems, yeah. Let's play some F.A.T.A.L. next campaign. 
LAURA: Are you pregnant? 
LIAM: Natural 20, let's fucking go. 
MATT: "If I can manage to get the rest of the crew, Ryn would have some interesting things to say. It wouldn't be quite a--" 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: Maybe-- 
TRAVIS: You know, I can speak-- 
SAM: We broke Ryn. 
TRAVIS: I can speak on behalf of the Planeriders. Unfortunately, Ryn was damaged in the initial assault on the Key. 
SAM: Turned to stone and then cracked in half. 
LAURA: Not in half, the arm fell off, right? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was just a limb. 
LAURA: But then we weren't able to get the rest of the body out. Right? 
SAM: Or any of it. We didn't bring the arm. 
LAURA: No, we didn't bring the arm. 
ASHLEY: Did we? We left the whole body. 
LAURA: Yeah, she's-- 
ASHLEY: All of her? We left it all. 
LAURA: She's still at the Key, unless you got her out? 
MATT: "I haven't contacted her. I assumed she was out and about on her business when all this went down." 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: She was, she was out and she was doing a great job. I got to say, very impressive for a rider. But indisposed at the moment. 
LAURA: There were two others that were helping us on that day. They were taken as well-- 
LIAM: From Wildemount. 
LAURA: They seemed like-- You might know him, he seemed like a very powerful wizard. Maybe not as powerful as you, but-- 
LIAM: Ginger fella. 
LAURA: Redhead. 
SAM: Red beard. 
ASHLEY: Kind of dirty. 
LAURA: Scarf. And a woman with abs. Lots of abs. 
MATT: "I do believe I'm familiar with who you're speaking of." 
LAURA: Yeah, they were taken. I don't know if you've heard from them. 
TALIESIN: The woman, not the abs. 
MATT: "Not them specifically, but some of their allies I have been in contact with--" 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: "I'll be able to find out quickly. But, at the very least, if we can recover Ryn as part of this that would be extremely helpful." 
LAURA: Maybe we can do that. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: It's a little terrifying thinking about going back in there. Not going to lie. 
TRAVIS: And we've ruled out just straight up teleporting to the moon, right? We've ruled that out. Too dangerous, can't happen because of-- 
LIAM: Seems unfamiliar. 
MATT: "Some have tried." 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LIAM: What happened? 
MATT: "The extension of the Divine Gate that seems to encircle it also prevents direct teleportation." 
TRAVIS: That is... 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "I think that is also why Ludinus had to go through all this effort to even find his feet upon the moon." 
LAURA: Right. Has anyone tried to take the bridge? 
MATT: "None have been able to get to it and return." 
LAURA: Right. 
TALIESIN: Has anyone talked to any of the disciples of the Betrayer Gods? 
MATT: "I haven't. I'm certain there might be some individuals present at the site. Vasselheim, I'm certain is struggling with keeping its independent bits of worship and ethical codes,  but also realizing that the enemy of your enemy is sometimes an ally." 
TRAVIS: Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I read a book. I'm, you know. I know what's up sometime. 
LIAM: This is where the rubber meets the road. 
MATT: "Indeed." Keyleth clears her throat a bit. "Mother, Vilya, rally those who've conscripted to the cause and have them keep their powers at the ready for when we know the time is right." She goes, "Of course, always." And they smile. "For the rest of you I guess, prepare what you need. While we've enjoyed a bit of time to think, for whatever reasons Ludinus is casually walking towards his goal. We know not why or how soon he'll reach it. So, do what you can to prepare. Allura," and she nods. (Allura) "I will do the same and see what I can muster at the Pansophical and the council's capability. We can only offer what is not needed to defend things at home. But, I'll see what I can. Lord Percival." (Percy) "You're welcome to stay here for the time that you need to prepare. Whitestone is yours for your protection. Should others who are also along your cause require it as well, just let us know. Don't just let them wander in. They will be shot." (laughter) 
LIAM: Also, if you had seven legendary weapons at your disposal-- 
LAURA: Or items that you don't need. 
LIAM: -- that'd be real cool. 
LAURA: Or just six. 
TALIESIN: Some even battered things. 
MATT: "I wouldn't even have any idea where to look for such a thing." 
TRAVIS: Insight check. 
MATT: Make an insight check. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Do you not remember the stats on this motherfucker? Good luck. 
SAM: We have time to do one thing. 
TRAVIS: 16. 
LAURA: We could use it and use it and use it and use it and use it until it breaks. 
SAM: Until it breaks? All in one day? (laughter) 
MATT: He's maybe holding something back. 
TRAVIS: Figures. He's probably holding it in that beard. 
MATT: This one? 
TRAVIS: That one. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Glorious. 
LIAM: It's full of birds. 
MATT: (growling) (shouting) 
TRAVIS: Kill it with fire! 
LIAM: Ludinus! 
MARISHA: His is bigger than yours. 
TALIESIN: (growling) 
TRAVIS: That's a Sam Raimi move. You just (whooshes). 
MATT: Just a little, hi there. 
LIAM: Easy, Gimli, easy. 
TALIESIN: Well, I guess if you can think of any of your stuff that might help us out there. 
SAM: I'd make a request. 
TRAVIS: Good tech. 
SAM: If we're going to spend the night here, right? 
LAURA: We are. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yes, Letters. 
SAM: If I can borrow, you're so wealthy, and you had so much dishware and dinnerware that you seem to not care about I would love to get my little metal hands on a jeweled plate or chalice of some sort, worth, I don't know, about a thousand gold pieces. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's a good idea. 
MATT: He goes, "Why does that sound so familiar?" (laughter) 
MATT: "I think we could muster such an artifact, yes." 
LIAM: They've got to have a punch bowl or something. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Keyleth stands and looks at the rest of you with a big smile. "You've already done great things, but it seems fate has us all intertwined in paths we don't expect. Hmm. It's funny. I'd hoped these days were done in my lifetime until I realized my lifetime was far longer than I anticipated. So I guess it's just part of enduring. But what makes me heartened is knowing that people like you will rise to the occasion. Sleep well. Be careful. Be brave, but don't be stupid, and good luck." 
TRAVIS: Thanks. 
MATT: (Keyleth) "Lord Percival." (Percy) "Lady Keyleth. Lady Allura." (Allura) "Percival." (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Waiting for hands in the beards to come up. 
MATT: (Allura) "Professor." (Ebenold) "Lady Allura. Lord Percival. Lady Keyleth. Lady Vilya." (Vilya) "Professor." (laughter) 
LIAM: For the rest of the game. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Good night. 
SAM: A scarecrow is just waiting there at the end. I'll miss you most of all! 
MATT: I know! The turtle's all, "Good night, Ned." 
TALIESIN: Cassandra was in here, fuck. 
MATT: The doors open and the war room union is adjourned. Folks begin to scatter and leave. Keyleth and Vilya walk off with Ebenold, giving a smile back to you, Orym-- 
LIAM: Oh, he chases after for a quick second. 
MATT: (Keyleth) "Ah, Orym." 
LIAM: I don't want to stop you from whatever it is you're about to go figure out. I just want to take a minute before we go to thank you for the footsteps I and we have followed in and, looks like it might be time to veer off and follow our own path. I'm sure you're no stranger to that concept. 
MATT: "Not at all. Although, I have faith in you all. And as strange as our paths may be I think they'll reconvene." 
LIAM: I hope we have that much luck. 
MATT: "Your people seem to carry it innately at times." 
LIAM: They're fucking wild. 
MATT: "Hmm. That they are." 
LIAM: Going to go rest up. 
MATT: "And I know that her mother works with the Vanguard. Just keep an eye. Family ties can be confusing in moments of heightened emotion." 
LIAM: You know, over the last few months with her those thoughts have crossed my mind as well. 
MATT: "It's not that I don't trust her. It's that I don't trust them." 
LIAM: I'll tell you what, if you have any faith in me you can have that same faith in her because I do. 
MATT: "I know you'll do what's right." 
LIAM: We will certainly try. 
MATT: She holds your shoulder for a minute, and tussles up your hair. 
LIAM: Oh. It's all over the place now. 
MATT: "That's from your mother." 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "Stay safe. Savior Blade." 
LIAM: See you tomorrow. 
MATT: She exits. 
LIAM: (footsteps tapping) 
TRAVIS: Ashton, are you serious? We could go find a church of a Betrayer God and go recruit some acolytes?! 
TALIESIN: We already kind of did. 
TRAVIS: We did? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: What, where, when, which one? 
LAURA: The guy that kissed your hand. Isn't he a servant of one of the Betrayer Gods? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but he just showed up out of the blue. We didn't go to a church. Do they have such things? 
LAURA: Do they? 
TALIESIN: Not-- 
TRAVIS: Temples? 
TALIESIN: I assume that they have spaces that they consider their own and we'd wandered into. We wandered into somebody who clearly is in the know. Maybe they talk to each other. I'm not sure. 
TRAVIS: Ah. 
TALIESIN: But clearly, they're just as freaked out about this as anybody. 
TRAVIS: This is great. 
LAURA: Yeah, but at the end of the day, if we succeed, what does that mean, if you've made some sort of pact with a Betrayer God? 
TRAVIS: Well, you said, "At the end of the day, if we succeed." That's step one, right? We'll worry about the rest later. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's a great problem to have. 
TALIESIN: I got a funny feeling that pacts are thin and far between right now. You don't negotiate when you're drowning. 
TRAVIS: I mean, maybe they have means of getting in and out of places that we haven't even thought about. 
ASHLEY: Should I check in? 
LAURA: Well, maybe that's something your guy can do for us. Maybe he can get us in. 
TALIESIN: Do we trust him to know what we're up to and what we're going to do? 
ASHLEY: Yes, of course. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Maybe not trust. 
TALIESIN: Do we, in a more democratic fashion, trust him to know what we're going to do, and-- 
LIAM: What was the vibe on that? It was a single favor, yeah? Isn't that what you told us? 
ASHLEY: I think, I think, yeah. I mean, I think he just kissed my hand and it just ended up staying there. I don't really know what that fully entails. I think it was just like-- I don't know, actually. 
LAURA: Wasn't it like, "If you need something, call me." 
TRAVIS: He was a devil, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Who knows about-- Wait, Letters! 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: You're so old! Do you know about devils, somewhere in your metal dome? 
MATT: You could make a religion check, if you'd like. 
SAM: I will search my memory banks and unencrypt the deep vault. 
TRAVIS: Smack him as he does, see if it shakes anything loose. 
SAM: This is a religion? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: He goes red and slaughters us all. 
SAM: 13. I've got a negative one on religion. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: 13. You do know that devils exist within the hells, and there are many layers to the hells, and many different guardians of them, but most exist underneath the banner of the Lord of the Hells, one of the betrayer gods of the larger pantheon. The existence of devils exists, where the society permeates a sense of duty and law, though in a way that is generally bent to a selfish degree and doesn't consider the larger moralities of life like, you know, murder, torture, all sorts of bad stuff. (laughs) That's what you get with a 13. But what you do know is that for the most part, they are reliable to their word. You just have to be careful what the interpretation of those words can be. 
SAM: I also have a spell that I've just been granted by the Changebringer. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, man. 
SAM: That can summon some sort of creature. I think I can talk to your friend, but you can talk to your friend just by kissing your hand, so. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, you can bring him forward and talk to him? 
SAM: I can summon a, not a celestial, but I can summon some sort of-- It's a planar ally. 
LAURA: Mm, all right. 
LIAM: (sneezes) 
LAURA: Bless you. 
TALIESIN: That's a different thing, if I recall. 
LAURA: That's different. You can't summon devils with that, I don't think. 
SAM: No, but he's a devil or a demon? 
LAURA and TALIESIN: A devil. 
MATT: He's a devil. It falls under fiend as an overarching umbrella. 
SAM: Yeah, so I can talk to him and ask him for help as well. But so can you. You don't need me. 
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know. 
MARISHA: There's a temple to the Raven Queen here. At least there was. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Who knows how indisposed she is right now. But that's curious. 
ASHLEY: Man, that was-- 
MARISHA: There's a lot of weird shit in Whitestone, at least back in my day. 
SAM: Talking to her would be pretty cool. 
LAURA: Yeah, maybe we should. 
TALIESIN: Weird shit? What kind of weird shit? 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: There was a lot of, whoa. 
MARISHA: There's a lot of weird people. 
LAURA: I wonder if-- 
TALIESIN: I'm big into weird towns. Weird towns are how you find cool shit. 
MARISHA: This is a weird fucking town. 
TALIESIN: And this was your weird town. 
MARISHA: It was my weird fucking town. 
ASHLEY: Are you okay? 
TALIESIN: Maybe we should dig up some of your weird shit. 
ASHLEY: How are you feeling? Are you feeling weird? 
MARISHA: I'm all right. It's a little weird. I do kind of want to maybe go snooping, though. 
TALIESIN: Snooping or touring? 
LIAM: Snooping where? 
TRAVIS: Go around the old hood? 
MARISHA: A little bit. 
TRAVIS: A little jaunt around the block. 
ASHLEY: Should we go find-- 
MARISHA: I'm less afraid now. I'm just more curious. 
TRAVIS: If we're fucking somebody up, you've got to give us the heads up ahead of time. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, do we go find Whitestone Andy and show him what's up? Be like, you fucked up, dumbass. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that fuck. 
MARISHA: Whitestone Andy? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: How old would he be now? 
TRAVIS: Good old Whitestone Andy. 
TALIESIN: I've been dreaming about one punch for Whitestone Andy for months. 
TRAVIS: Apple of my instantaneous eye. 
LIAM: How old are you? 
MARISHA: I'm 50. 
LIAM: 50, so is he older, younger, about the same age? 
MARISHA: He's around my age, maybe a few years-- 
TALIESIN: I love hitting old people. 
MARISHA: So he'd be 52. 
LAURA: Let's knock him in the mud. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: What? He was awful. He threw rocks at her. 
MARISHA: He probably doesn't even remember me. 
TRAVIS: Let's find out. 
TALIESIN: If you punch him a couple times, he will. I tend to find that jogs my memory really, really fast when someone punches me. It knocks about a bit, but-- 
TRAVIS: So Whitestone Andy, Raven Queen temple, talk to Le Chiefre. 
ASHLEY: Teven. 
TALIESIN: Do you want to be you or do you want to be inconspicuous? 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: You know my vote, but-- 
MARISHA: I came from a different era. I don't know what being inconspicuous would get me. 
ASHLEY: I think you should be you. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: I think that's the better way. 
TRAVIS: You've earned it. 
MARISHA: Is Percy still in the room? 
MATT: Percival? No, the war room has been cleared out, and the door is closed, and he's stepped away. 
TALIESIN: I know where he went, though. 
LIAM: Where'd he go? 
TALIESIN: He's in his office. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: He's probably right. 
TALIESIN: I'd be more than happy to find out. 
LIAM: He's probably playing with model trains in the basement. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Gomez Addams. 
MARISHA: It's loud with the shop vac on. We could go see him. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Good throwback. 
MATT: You did see both him and Allura, when they left, heading towards the central chamber of the castle to a lower floor. His office is on the second floor, so thinking about it, he didn't go to his office, but he might be elsewhere. 
MARISHA: With Allura? (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Do you have a request? 
MARISHA: I'd just be curious if he would give me a tour. 
TALIESIN: Or if maybe not him, one of his-- 
LAURA: Yeah, maybe one of his underlings. 
TRAVIS: Of the city or the castle? 
LAURA: He seems kind of-- 
MARISHA: Castle. Might jog some of my memories. 
LAURA: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: He did have that weird little kid of his. 
LAURA: Jog some of your memories, or someone else's? 
TALIESIN: Actually, you could probably ask him right now, couldn't you? 
LAURA: I could try. 
TALIESIN: If you're worried about irritating him, I'm sure Allura would be less-- 
LIAM: His wife was also pretty sympathetic. 
LAURA: I do still have a mental connection. I had made one. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Hmm? 
LIAM: Right? Remember Lady de Rolo was pretty sympathetic the last time we were here. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's true. I like her. 
LAURA: What did you want to ask of him? 
MARISHA: Last time I was in this castle, it wasn't great. But also, I imagine Delilah has quite the connection to this place. I don't know. Sometimes, being confronted with the darker parts of your past can shed a little light on other areas. 
TALIESIN: I bet there's someone in this castle who was probably here when you were a kid, was probably up here when everything was fucked. 
MATT: Orym. 
LIAM: Mm? 
MATT: In this moment, you notice that feeling like you're being watched. 
LIAM: Ears twitch a little bit. I try to subtly take in the weather, figure it out. 
MATT: You look around the vicinity, and you see a shadow shift down the hall, far from where you're standing. 
LIAM: Is it that kid again? I'm going to put my hands in my pockets and stroll down that way. Hello? 
MATT: You hear a shift, like a stool. 
LIAM: It's okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: You want to come meet everybody? 
MATT: You look past, and in the next room, it looks like there is a reading den. Standing holding a soft doll, but it seems to clank with metal innards in an odd way as she shifts it-- 
TRAVIS: (scoffs) Terrible. 
MATT: -- this little girl you've seen previously here, horned, dark hair, red skin, looks over and smiles. "Hi." 
LIAM: Hi, you remember me? 
MATT: "I do." 
LIAM: I remember you. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LIAM: Busy around the grounds today, huh? 
MATT: "There's a lot going on." 
LIAM: What are you up to right now? 
MATT: "Just playing." 
LIAM: Who've you got there? 
MATT: "This is Gemma." 
LIAM: Gemma. She sounds clanky. 
MATT: "She's got a skeleton." 
LIAM: Oh yeah? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LIAM: Do you like skeletons? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
LIAM: You've got to come meet my friends. Do you want to come with me to meet my friends? 
MATT: "Maybe." 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: "I'm taller than you." 
LIAM: You are taller than me. A lot of people are taller than me. 
MATT: "That means you have to do what I say." (laughter) 
LIAM: You are a de Rolo. (laughter) 
LIAM: Okay. Do you want to tell me to introduce you to my friends? 
MATT: "No." 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: "I command you to introduce me to your friends." 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Well, I do live to serve. Right this way, milady. 
MATT: "(giggles)" She follows. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I'm so proud. 
MARISHA: "I'm so proud!" (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
LIAM: Sorry to interrupt, guys. I have some more of the nobility I would like to introduce, or maybe she can speak for herself. 
MATT: "I am Lady Gwendolyn de Rolo. I am the queen of the house, and everyone who's shorter than me has to do what I say." 
TRAVIS: Oh! What? 
MATT: "It's the law." 
LIAM: I didn't know there were queens in Whitestone. 
ASHLEY: I very much like this law. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I do, too. 
MATT: "Well, you're not from around here, are you?" 
LIAM: No, I'm a ways off. 
LAURA: I have heard of that law here in Whitestone. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
MATT: "See?" 
LAURA: Yeah, it's based on height. 
LIAM: Seems like a bum deal. 
TRAVIS: I'll tell you what, I don't really bow to laws, but if you can guess how old I am, I will do what you say. How old do I look? 
LIAM: Aim high. 
MATT: "You are 4,000 years old." 
TRAVIS: It's because I'm wise. I love her. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's pretty close. 
TRAVIS: Your wish is my command. 
MATT: "What's your name?" 
TRAVIS: I'm Chetney. 
MATT: "Chetney?" 
TRAVIS: Chetney Pock O'Pea. 
MATT: "All right." 
LIAM: Oh, I forgot to mention, Laudna, Gwendolyn really likes skeletons. 
MARISHA: (gasps) Really? 
MATT: "I've been watching you." 
ASHLEY: Oh? 
MARISHA: (honored gasp) You have? You know, I always wanted to be a lady. 
MATT: "Well, you can't be one, because we're full." 
MARISHA: (disappointed) Mm. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's all right. 
TRAVIS: We're full? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I still have a skeleton or two. I pull out, first I pull out Pâté. 
TRAVIS: I thought you were like, I pull my finger off. 
MATT: (Pâté) "Hey, what's going on?" 
MARISHA: Be-- (stammering) Child. Presence of child. 
MATT: "Right. Hello." (laughter) 
MATT: (Gwendolyn) "Hello." 
MARISHA: Do you want to see something really cool? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MARISHA: I put Pâté on her shoulder. 
LAURA: He doesn't bite. 
MARISHA: He's very friendly. 
MATT: (Pâté) "I'm very friendly, in the presence of children." (laughter) 
MATT: (Gwendolyn) "Okay." 
MARISHA: Do you like scary? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
ASHLEY: I love her. 
MARISHA: I take my middle fingernail and I carve it down my chest. 
SAM: Ugh. 
LAURA: This is very-- Okay. 
MARISHA: And allow the skin to pull back just enough. 
SAM: Oh god. 
LAURA: That's a lot for a child. 
MARISHA: What? I asked if she likes scary! 
ASHLEY: I think it's a good idea. 
MARISHA: It's fun! 
ASHLEY: She's going to be into it. 
MARISHA: Just part a little bit of the sternum. 
MATT: "That's really cool." 
MARISHA: Do you like it? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MARISHA: Do you want to touch it? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's blow my mind-- 
MARISHA: Ah! 
MATT: "Ah!" 
TALIESIN: -- when I was eight. 
MARISHA: (laughs manically) 
TALIESIN: Absolutely blow my mind. 
MARISHA: I zip up a little. 
MATT: "That's pretty cool." 
ASHLEY: She's fun scary. 
LAURA: Fun scary. 
MATT: "That was fun. That was fun scary. Can I touch it?" 
MARISHA: Yes. I open up again. 
MATT: She touches the little cut mark, and you watch her go-- 
MARISHA: What? 
MATT: "I have to go." 
MARISHA: What's wrong? 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: She takes her doll and just darts off. 
MARISHA: Why does this always happen to me? 
LIAM: Insight check, insight check. 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
ASHLEY: That's-- Yeah. 
LAURA: I don't know. 
LIAM: Not great. 
ASHLEY: I can assist, because I was going to do it, too. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Roll for yourself, I'd say. 
LIAM: Yeah, go for it. 
MATT: It's kind of hard to assist somebody else's insight check. 
LIAM: 13. 
ASHLEY: I know, I was throwing out ideas. 
MATT: 13. 
LIAM: (as Ashley) Guidance. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! Okay. Insight. That would be 19 plus 13, so-- 
SAM: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Woo! 
TRAVIS: That's 32! 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: I get to whisper as Gandalf. 
SAM: It's a whispers-- 
LAURA: ♪ (jaunty tune) ♪ 
TRAVIS: 32 on an insight check? 
SAM: Laura, how about those new Laudna hoodies that we got in the store? Is it just in the American store? 
TRAVIS: Is that your biggest insight check ever? 
MARISHA: Maybe? 
LAURA: I don't think so. 
TRAVIS: 32? 
TALIESIN: When I was that child's age, you would be my best friend right now, by the way. 
LAURA: I think it's all stores. 
TALIESIN: Other than the fucking end. 
SAM: All stores? 
TALIESIN: I would have left my parents for that. 
SAM: What else? 
MARISHA: This whisper is brought to you by leaven bread. A single bite can fill a grown man's stomach. Yes? 
MATT: (Gandalf) "Are you talking about lembas bread?" 
MARISHA: Lembas bread, that's what it is. 
MATT: Leaven bread's a whole different thing. 
MARISHA: Leaven bread is church shit. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Can I, as she runs away-- 
MARISHA: I just really want kids to like me. 
MATT: Telekinetic Shove her into the wall? 
SAM: Hold Person! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (slam) 
LAURA: No! 
ASHLEY: (roughly) Get over here! 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, I was going to make a call down the hall, but I don't know what-- 
LAURA: In her head, I'm going to say: Are you all right? 
MATT: She goes-- "(gasps)" 
LAURA: No! 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
LIAM: It's a one-two punch. 
MARISHA: Witches be bitches. 
ASHLEY: Do you want to see my fire monkey? 
MATT: She's gone. You could pursue if you want, but she's leaving. She's not running, but she's definitely-- 
TRAVIS: Vex probably comes stomping down the stairs. "What have you done to my daughter?" 
LIAM: When kid says she wants scary, she probably means-- 
SAM: Maybe just take it a little slower next time. 
MARISHA: I thought kids liked that. 
SAM: Try the thumb trick first. 
MARISHA: Did I scare her? 
ASHLEY: No, I think-- I think maybe she picked up on something, like maybe-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, from touch? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: She's gifted? 
MARISHA: She seemed really into it, until she touched me. 
LAURA: Oh, I wonder if-- 
SAM: She might be gifted in some way, and she could sense your past. 
LAURA: Delilah. 
MARISHA: What if she's like me? 
SAM: Everyone likes you. 
MARISHA: No, no, what if she-- What if we have something in common? 
TRAVIS: It could be. 
LAURA: How-- Do y'all know-- I mean, from what I saw, Lord Percival was human and Lady Vex'ahlia was elven or something, right? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: There's adoption. Adoption is an option. 
LAURA: Yeah, I mean-- 
TALIESIN: There's a lot of facial structure happening there, though. 
LAURA: She does look the same. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Just with horns. 
MARISHA: Would we know how this might happen? How tieflings come about? 
MATT: Make a religion check. 
LIAM: First, there were the dinosaurs. 
TALIESIN: They got too big. 
SAM: Are we just gossiping now? Is that what we're doing? We're gossiping? 
LAURA: Well, maybe. 
MARISHA: Five. 
MATT: No idea. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I wonder if she felt something familiar. 
TALIESIN: Well, if you want your tour, we should maybe find somebody who was actually alive back when things were shitty here. 
MARISHA: No. 
TALIESIN: Or you can walk-- 
MARISHA: I want to talk to her. 
TRAVIS: Who, the girl? 
MARISHA: Yes, Gwendolyn. 
LAURA: Can we follow where she went? 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: Sure, are you all going? 
TRAVIS: No. 
SAM: A whole bunch of grownups are chasing a scared kid across-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to hang back. 
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to go elsewhere as well. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Maybe the witches. 
MATT: Okay, the three of you? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Going to share a jail cell. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You follow her, and she darts up a different staircase, a spiral staircase that's a little further down the eastern side of the castle. Eventually, the door doesn't fully close, but a small chamber she vanishes into, and the door just (clicks) rests partially unlatched, but closed. 
LAURA: Oh, I do wonder where the queen has gone? 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
LAURA: Her loyal subjects are lost without her. 
ASHLEY: W-whatever will we do without our queen? 
MARISHA: Her citizens are quite in need. 
ASHLEY: I, I was really hoping that the queen could show us where there's some delicious snacks and sweets and cookies, but oh well. 
MATT: Make a group persuasion check, the three of you. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Jeez, why am I like this? 
MATT: Laudna? 
MARISHA: Seven. 
ASHLEY: 24. 
LAURA: Nine. 
SAM: (sighs) Terrible. 
MATT: You hear the door finish latching. 
MATT: (locking) 
LAURA: (sighs) 
LAURA: It's Gwendolyn, right? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's Gwendolyn. 
SAM: Bust down the door. 
TRAVIS: Don't! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: No. 
SAM: Just... 
TRAVIS: No! (laughs) 
SAM: Fucking talk to us! (laughs) 
LAURA: We are sorry, Lady Gwendolyn. I hope we didn't frighten you. 
MARISHA: We're looking for answers, young one. You seem to be very smart. Come find me if you feel like talking. 
MATT: You just hear from behind the door, "I'm afraid of you and I don't know why." 
MARISHA: I understand. Sometimes I'm afraid of me, too. I turn and I leave. 
LAURA: Sometimes, I say through the door, Sometimes things that look scary can be so beautiful if you give them a chance. 
MATT: "Why does she hate me?" 
LAURA: Who? Laudna? Hate you? Never! 
MATT: "I could feel it when I touched her." 
LAURA: You could feel a hatred? 
MATT: "I've never felt hate like that." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: (whispers) Cursed. 
LAURA: Maybe. Maybe your doll was just trying to scare you. 
MATT: "Maybe." 
LAURA: I promise you she doesn't hate you. 
MATT: "The queen's going to take a nap." 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "Bye." 
LAURA: Bye, my liege. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out the Eyes of Charming. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to stick them under the door. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Just a little present for you, have fun. 
MATT: You hear them scrape inside. 
LAURA: I run after Laudna. I'm going to go up and give you a hug. It was Delilah. 
MARISHA: I think so. 
LAURA: I know so. She said she felt hatred as soon as she touched you. Who would hate her more? Who would hate the de Rolos more? That wolf is connected to her. She is inside you. We can't let Percival know. They would destroy you-- us, maybe. 
MARISHA: What am I supposed to do with this, this seed of hatred that I carry with me? 
LAURA: What do you want to do with it? You talked about taking advantage of it, making you stronger. 
MARISHA: What time is it? 
MATT: You arrived here, it was morning, so it would be, by this point, mid-afternoon. 
MARISHA: I'd love to go on a little excursion tonight when the castle beds down. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Want to come? 
ASHLEY: I would love to. 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Are we going on an adventure? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: A witchy adventure. I love it. 
MARISHA: Let's do it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Maybe let's sleep a little bit beforehand though, so that-- 
ASHLEY: Little nappy-nappy. 
LAURA: Yeah, we can recover a bit. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Sounds good. 
MATT: All right, the rest of you, what have you been up to in the interim? 
TALIESIN: I was more of a fan of the third Captain Emon play personally myself. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It really brought... 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (snores) (laughter) 
LAURA: Captain Emon play. 
TALIESIN: I'm probably, I mean, unless you all are doing something, probably doing a little wander. Curious if there's a library. There's a clock tower isn't there? 
TRAVIS: So? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It's one-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, it keeps time, whoopty-fucking-doo. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I heard it was a whole thing. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Are we tourists or are we going to ramshackle and run through and look at the silverware in here? 
TRAVIS: Didn't they say there was a Matron temple? 
TALIESIN: Probably a city like this, there's probably a couple temples. Although I don't know, this place is weird. 
TRAVIS: Let's go check it out. 
LIAM: You want to double-dip? 
TRAVIS: Well, I figured, I mean, we got lucky the one time. Couldn't hurt. I doubt it'll happen a second. 
TALIESIN: Can we let the witches know what we're up to? 
LIAM: Eh, they can take care of themselves. 
TALIESIN: I guess they'll-- 
LIAM: It's not that big a town. 
TRAVIS: Reach out, yeah. 
LIAM: You want to go, Letters? 
SAM: I don't know, I mean, that's not my bag. 
TRAVIS: But same team, right? 
SAM: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, broaden your horizons. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Yeah, I think it's all right. 
SAM: Yeah? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Well, I was going to maybe go to the... there's a Changebringer temple here. 
TALIESIN: Is there? Oh yeah. 
SAM: But I don't want to-- 
LIAM: Well, Changebringer's with you at all times, right? 
SAM: Yeah, but I haven't talked to her in a while. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you should check in. 
SAM: But you guys go to check with the Matron. I'm curious, didn't you have a run in with her once before? 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Yep, I did. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I didn't. 
LAURA: Yeah, you guys had a vision. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LIAM: Yeah, with Fearne and Chet and I, yeah. 
SAM: Can you check with her? 
TALIESIN: Run around, and when you're done at the Changebringer gift shop, come find us and we'll look around and-- 
SAM: Ashton, you're welcome to come with me. 
TALIESIN: I'm-- 
SAM: I know you've been looking for something to believe in, and this is a good one. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: God, I really have, it's so true. But that's okay, actually, I'm curious about some Raven Queen shit, but I do appreciate the offer. 
TRAVIS: We'll meet at the crêpe stand over by the Sun Tree. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TALIESIN: Oh god, yeah, that thing is really-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, they got that Nutella shit. Man! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Well, let's walk around. 
TRAVIS: Put a little booze on there. 
TALIESIN: But if the clock thing goes off, we'll check that shit out. 
TRAVIS: A little sugar, whew. 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
TALIESIN: Let's roll. Yeah, it's not fair, man. 
TRAVIS: All right, let's go. 
TALIESIN: Okay, hmm, all right. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: We'll go in search of-- 
TRAVIS: Some kind of-- 
LIAM: -- some sort of temple to the Matron, or chapel, or. 
MARISHA: I think IHOP does crêpes. 
LAURA: No way. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: (whispers) Yeah. 
MATT: Well. 
MARISHA: (whispers) Maybe we should order crêpes. 
MATT: Asking around a bit, it doesn't take too long for people to guide you to a location within Whitestone referred to as the Greyfield. The Greyfield sits on the eastern, northeastern side of the city. There's a couple of paths there, one that's a direct road, one that's a nice forest walk that leads you through the beautiful trees of the surrounding Parchwood Timberland. As you stroll past the outskirts of Whitestone and the large walls that keep it safe, it's that beautiful, dark, mysterious part that you find at the deepest of any sort of north woodland, where the rich greens and shaded browns would almost seem ominous if there wasn't splashes of color and the sound of birds and natural wildlife lifting the air. As you curve through this path, you see the sign referred to as the Snowdrop Memorial Trail. You pick up, indeed, there are all number of little white snowdrops that grow along the edges of the walkway. It's a beautiful little walk, and there's benches built in places. 
LIAM: The bench, jeez. 
MATT: You do eventually find the path open up into what is an old graveyard. There are tall iron gates that surround it and there are sections that are segmented. You can see all manner of simple gravestones and grave plots, with names carved into large statues, and a handful of mausoleums that set upon the grounds. Within here, you do see two structures that aren't directly mausoleums, one of which looks to be a modest temple to the Dawnfather, which, for those who were in their Vasselheim excursion, there's a brief bit of trauma that bubbles up from that experience. But this one feels older and welcomed, and not extensively massive, very strong locks on the doors. You can see the stained glass that show the classic sun rays of the Dawnfather. The doors, while closed, you can see up top, there's a little bit of repair being done to the western side of the roof. But there's nobody currently repairing it, you can see there's paper and some simple wooden scaffolding. On the other side, much smaller, is what people have sent you towards, called the Altar of the Raven. This is a even more modest place of worship for the Raven Queen. It is a large stone worship structure that looks like it houses a smaller chamber in the back of it. As you approach, you can see this massive structure of a cloaked, stone-faced woman mask, the familiar visage of the Matron of Ravens, there standing. Though not detailed, more artistic interpretations of the shapes, to where if you know what you're looking for, plainly the Matron, but otherwise, it could look like a masked dancer, it's hard to tell. But there perched before her on the ground, you see another cloaked figure with its own raven-like mask, also loosely interpreted, with a feathered mantle. You realize you've seen this figure once at the base of the Malleus Key, before this individual was made part of it. This is a statue relief of that strange winged figure you saw briefly appear to defend the Voice of the Tempest. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh wow. 
SAM: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Wait, that was the guy with the move and the one-liner. 
LIAM: That's the guy. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: Is he from here? 
LIAM: I don't think so. 
TRAVIS: Can we approach that statue? Can I look for an inscription plate, or some kind of audio guide, or something? (laughter) 
MATT: (laughs) Audio guide. 
LIAM: You said you didn't want it at the kiosk. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It was 20 silver. 
TALIESIN: Wow. (laughter) 
MATT and TALIESIN: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Rip off. 
TALIESIN: Too real. (laughter) 
LIAM: You can just get it on your phone and-- 
TALIESIN: Just buy the tour kit, come on. 
LIAM: It's the same deal. 
MATT: Indeed. The larger structure that sits behind the main statue is inscribed with the Altar of the Raven. The larger statue of the Matron has no inscription, but the smaller of this figure you recognize is noted as, "The Champion of the Raven. In memory of friendship, sacrifice, and the day that he carries us all upon the threshold and beyond." 
LIAM: Well, you sure got a raw deal, huh? It'd be nice if the gods spelled things out a bit more for us, but I don't think that's the point. 
TALIESIN: I'm not entirely sure what the point is. 
LIAM: I think they want us to figure it out for ourselves. 
TALIESIN: Ugh. 
TRAVIS: It's pretty humble here. We had to do something last time. There was a door. A threshold? 
TALIESIN: Threshold. 
LIAM: We partook in some water in an altar there, meditated for a bit, and then when we left, we got the whammy. 
TRAVIS: That's right. We should check the altar for water. 
TALIESIN: Check the altar for a lot of things. 
LIAM: That might have been a one time occurrence. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure, for sure. Yeah, one time occurrence. Check the water for Walter. Wait, what? 
MARISHA and SAM: Check the water for Walter? 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Check the altar. 
TRAVIS: (sharp moan) 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: Walter Matthau! 
TALIESIN: Check the altar for-- 
TRAVIS: Okay. Whew! 
LIAM: Up or down! 
TALIESIN: -- water stains, signs of gifts, candles, et cetera. 
MARISHA: Dennis! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is that the first time that's come out? 
TALIESIN: I think the previous joke was better, but that's still pretty solid. 
ASHLEY: Did you see the first one? 
TRAVIS: I never see them. 
ASHLEY: His body Axe spray, it said: You have my Axe. 
MATT: Around this altar, there are small offerings. Many of them are baked goods or apples. A handful of copper. They're themselves very humble offerings, but the occasional flower, you see gathered snowdrops from somebody who took the path and picked their favorites and left them in memory. But yeah, there are a number of simple offerings left about the altar. 
LIAM: I look at all the snowdrops and splay my hands out and make little ones grow between my fingers. Those are pretty. 
TRAVIS: No water. 
LIAM: I don't see any water, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Well, what about that back area? 
LIAM: Well, all right, come on. 
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm not scared, but you go first. 
SAM and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
LIAM: Okay. Anyone home? 
MATT: You head to the back entryway to that small structure. It looks like a shed that's affixed to the back of this central statue altar. 
TRAVIS: (shudders) 
MATT: The door is closed. While the structure itself has a unique design to it, you can see the similar threads between the architecture of this small, shed-like building and the massive temple that you previously had that odd encounter with in Jrusar. There are points, literal points at the apex of the doorframe that are stretched and at the edge of the roofs where, as distant as the cultures are, there are things that carry over through worship. 
LIAM: When you say shed, is it a wooden door, or a stone structure? 
MATT: It is stone. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: There are elements of wood. Sorry, the structure is stone. The door itself is wood, wood and metal. 
TALIESIN: Would you like me to press heavily against it? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Speak friend and enter. 
TRAVIS: Nice, yes. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) (hinges squeaking) It opens up, and it is a blank interior and a staircase. 
LIAM: Still scared? 
TRAVIS: Mm-mm. (moans) Never. 
LIAM: I start walking down. 
TRAVIS: Oh god! 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Ashton, are we doing this? 
TALIESIN: You want to be in the middle or the back? 
TRAVIS: In the middle! 
TALIESIN: Okay, get going. 
TRAVIS: (yells) 
TALIESIN: Shut the door behind me. 
MATT: (door slamming) 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: It is lightless up here. 
SAM: What if you find more doors? 
LAURA: (laughs) That was good. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: That was good. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
ASHLEY: I hate it, but it was good. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That was good. 
MARISHA: It was very good. 
MATT: You descend the steps below, and a vague red light begins to approach as you see a basement floor begins to come closer. Your not quite silent footfalls echo through the somewhat tight pathway where these steps descend through, and you hear a voice go, (gravely, worn) "Ah?" 
LIAM: Hello. Sorry, don't mean to intrude. Just come to worship a little bit. 
MATT: You hear a bit of shuffling, and the shadow of a figure steps forward out of the red light. "What's going on? What are you doing? What are you here for? You're here for worship, you said?" 
ASHLEY: Who is that? 
MATT: You see this hairless, somewhat scrawny and-- 
LAURA: Is it Scanlan? 
MATT: -- jagged looking dwarven fellow, no hair, no beard, robes on that go just past his knees, and he walks with that hobbled knee walk and goes, "Oh, you're coming to worship? Okay, yeah yeah. Come on down here. You can worship, okay." 
LIAM: Just a casual visit, if that's okay. 
MATT: "Yeah, I know, it's what it's here for. I just-- Yeah. Yeah, come on down." 
TRAVIS: A lot of visitors, worshipers? 
MATT: "Not that many, no. I've just got to keep it clean, make sure teenagers don't come in here and leave a mess at night, you know?" 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: What's your name? What's your name, friend? 
MATT: "Othinon." 
LIAM: Othinon. 
MATT: "I'm having lunch. You can come in." 
SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: Okay. You tend the place? 
MATT: "I do." 
LIAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: What're you eating? 
MATT: "You want some?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Depends on what you're eating. 
MATT: "Egg sandwich." 
LIAM: Oh, that's okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Each to their own." Turns back around and heads back into the chamber. 
TRAVIS: Is it just a solid chamber? 
MATT: As you step down, it's interesting, there are five stone sarcophagi down here, each with the carving of a person on the lid. But they're all, while humanoid and of varying sizes, there is a lack of definition in the face. 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
MATT: He sits off to the side with a little table, on a stool. His legs are a little up past his shoulders, almost, as he's eating a sandwich and looking at you all from across the way. You get a better look. He's got a winding scar that goes from the middle of his nose down past and connects with the side of his mouth. He's not homely by any means, but he looks like he's certainly seen some experience in his days. He looks older for a dwarf, just snacking and watching you all. 
TRAVIS: You said his name was Othinon? 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Othinon. 
TRAVIS: I'll go in a little closer, like I know what I'm doing. Any words or other descriptions on the sarcophagi? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: Weird. Othinon, sorry, you know, we've come from far and wide to check off this beautiful temple to the Matron, may she be praised, and I was just curious, do you know who these sarcophagi belong to? 
TALIESIN: You hadn't picked that up yet. 
TRAVIS: Huh? Us? Huh? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is-- 
MATT: "You're all going to die." (laughter) 
MATT: "I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding." 
TRAVIS: Oh. Oh. 
MATT: "I'm fucking with you." 
TALIESIN: I mean, eventually. 
LIAM: Yeah, technically true. 
MATT: "Maybe, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Probably. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's representative of everyone's impending doom at some point? 
MATT: "Sure." 
LIAM: Othinon, are you a chaplain? (snickering) 
LIAM: Or more of a groundskeeper? 
MARISHA: It's better with the-- 
MATT: "Yes." 
LIAM: Yeah? 
MATT: "I just, you know, handle what needs to be done." 
ASHLEY: He kind of sounds like Beetlejuice. 
MATT: "Look, I've been doing this for a long time. I'm just happy to spend the rest of my days keeping it easy here in Whitestone, so." 
TRAVIS: Well, a long time? How long have you been here? How many years? 
MATT: "Oh no, no, here in Whitestone, only for about 10 or so years." 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: "I've been doing this, been cleaning, keeping." 
TRAVIS: Looks clean. 
LIAM: If you didn't do it for the Matron, who would you do it for? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: "Yeah." 
TRAVIS: Is there any water in this chamber, Othinon? Buckets, pools? 
MATT: "I hope not, did I mess up?" 
TRAVIS: Meditation-- No I've-- 
MATT: "Is there any--" 
TRAVIS: No. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 
TRAVIS: No. 
TALIESIN: I got a question. 
MATT: "Yeah?" 
TALIESIN: If I were to start doing something inappropriate or unsettling or touch something that I'm not supposed to touch out of the sheer ignorance of somebody as deeply uneducated as myself, would you stop me from doing it or at least say: Hey, stop? I don't know, I'm not going to try and do an imitation. 
MATT: "Hit you with a spoon, probably." 
TALIESIN: You'd hit me with a spoon? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Yeah." 
TALIESIN: God, I kind of want to see the spoon. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: He reaches over to the side table, and there's a wooden ladle. 
TALIESIN: Cool. I will accept that, if I do anything untoward. 
MATT: "All right." 
LIAM: You could do some damage with that. 
TALIESIN: I walk down and I'm going to stand in the middle of these five. How is my blasphemous ass having these thoughts when the rest of you are just being so chill about this? Do none of you think about death? I'm going to start opening one of the sarcophagi. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: Okay. You open it up. It's empty. (stone shifting) 
TRAVIS: Don't do it! What's in there? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh my god, it's you! Oh my god! You look 30 years younger in here, it's amazing! 
TRAVIS: Melodrama doesn't suit you, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I know, but it's so much fun. 
MATT: "(laughs)" 
LIAM: 30 years younger is still pretty old. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: How do you think you meet a death god? 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
TALIESIN: I'm just going for the hell of it. I have a couple questions, but the rest of you, if you have something serious to talk about, you can go ahead. I'll just sit here and watch over the two of you. 
TRAVIS: You going to crawl into the sarcophagi? 
TALIESIN: If you don't. Or if we're doing this, let's fucking do it. I hop in. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Do I close it myself, or do you use your spoon? 
MATT: "Oh, I can-- All right, I got you." 
TALIESIN: I'm fine either way. 
MATT: He finishes his sandwich, walks over to your lid and goes-- (grunting) (stone lid shifting shut) Closes it on you. Darkness takes you inside the sarcophagus. 
TRAVIS: Oh, wait. I mean, hold on. We're jumping in? 
LIAM: Is this a regular occurrence here? Semi-regular? 
MATT: "I mean, it's not regular to have people come to want to worship directly, but that's what they're here for." 
TRAVIS: What other purpose would these sarcophagi have? 
MATT: "They don't." 
TRAVIS: (sighs) 
MATT: "I have my lunch in them, usually." 
TRAVIS: In the sarcophagi? 
MATT: "Just that one." He points to the one that's closest to the entryway, but to the left. 
TALIESIN: (muffled) Did he point at this one? 
TRAVIS: I'll go to the right, I'll go to the right. 
TALIESIN: Did he point at this one? 
TRAVIS: No! No! 
TALIESIN: Okay! 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: I just came to say a prayer, but if you want, you and I could probably fit into one. 
TRAVIS: I'm here. Let's do it together. 
LIAM: Want to share one? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LIAM: Feet to feet. 
TRAVIS: Feet to feet. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Help me push. (grunts) 
MATT: (stone shifting) There's one that's large enough to not uncomfortably fit you both, but just enough. 
TRAVIS: Four foot and under, let's do this. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: "I got you." Closes it there. You hear muffled footsteps as he walks over, and then you can't hear anything, and it's just darkness. 
LIAM: (muffled) You know, just because we got in here doesn't mean anything is going to happen. 
TALIESIN: "Shh." 
TRAVIS: I know. I just-- 
TALIESIN: No, I'm not in there. 
TRAVIS: Okay, should we just be quiet? 
LIAM: I guess. 
TRAVIS: I'm seeing the little white swirls behind my eyelids. You? 
LIAM: Mm-mm. In the middle of this dumbfuckery, I do say a few words in my head and tell the Matron: I'm sorry for your friend. I hope you're holding up. I hope we can help. That's it. 
TRAVIS: As the silence passes in my head, I say: Take your time. 
TALIESIN: (snickers) 
TRAVIS: That's it. 
MATT: Minutes pass in silence. Hours, even. It's so hard to tell. You're just standing alone with nothing but the sound of your own breathing. Did you stop breathing? No, but you can hear him breathe. Not anymore. As you feel for any sort of shift, rise or fall of your chest, you are uncertain if your eyes have been closed or open this whole time. The minute you think of that thought, you force them open, and darkness still surrounds you, but for a faint white light ahead of you, like a spotlight on the horizon. 
LIAM: Come on, Chet. Ash? 
MATT: You all hear that voice, but you see nobody around you. Orym's echo, sourceless. But that single white light sits hanging. Far? Close? You're uncertain. 
TRAVIS: Orym? 
LIAM: Let's take a walk. 
TALIESIN: Towards, or away? 
LIAM: Towards. I start walking. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Hmm. 
MATT: You step towards this light, and as you do, the spotlight seems to be highlighting a sphere, an orb, a shape, formless, distant, and the closer you get, the more it begins to take detail, the more that it looks like a hill or the back of a chair. No, it-- It seems like it's miles away, and then it seems like it's but feet away, and then it begins to move. You see what was once just this mound, this colorless shape, rise and elongate until it has a somewhat humanoid outline. Facing away, all you see is a cloak of black. 
TRAVIS: Same kind of feathered mantle as the statue outside? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: Hello? 
MATT: The figure slowly begins to turn to face you. You see, peeking beneath the long black hair, a pale, white, expressionless porcelain mask. Feminine, cold. A hand reaches up and pulls the mask free, and behind it, there is black, void, nothing. (wraith-like hollow scream) It rushes in, and you feel yourself pulled into a second wave of shadow, lost. Your feet touch nothing. You are just floating in absence, in nothing. You hear metal hitting metal, clanking, jangling, like chains dragging against chains. You look up, and you look up at the surface of a hole, not unlike when you looked up from the great Tree of Atrophy. You see just a ring of light, like you're staring up from a grave, and there, looking down, the masked figure looks. You see chains around their wrists that seem to dangle into the hole. 
TALIESIN: This is what we do where I come from. Come on, I think this is more than we bargained for. I'm going to try and grab one of the chains and see what happens when I start giving pressure to it. 
MATT: You feel yourself beginning to slowly climb towards the exit. 
TALIESIN: Don't wait behind. There's nothing good to be found at the bottom of a hole. 
TRAVIS: Oh. Oh god, oh god. (anxiously) Oh. Oh, Matron. Okay. 
MATT: The two of you begin to climb these chains. You feel yourself getting closer and closer to the surface. Do you climb as well? 
LIAM: Yeah, I'll follow up last. 
MATT: As you drag these thick chains, hearing the metal echoing in the space beneath you, endless, like a waterless well that is miles deep. You pull yourself closer, and eventually you feel the chains begin to give, and the masked figure, the Matron, raises her arms. These chains are affixed to the shackles around her wrists. 
LAURA: Oh no. Oh no! 
MATT: You pull once more. They break. (chains shatter) She lowers her hands and looks up as giant raven wings release. (powerful wings flapping) She begins to fly up as you fall. As she begins to take off, you watch her break into hundreds of black ravens, flying free and away as the light diminishes and you return once more to darkness. You don't feel scared. You don't feel perturbed or exploited. You feel-- You feel noticed and oddly appreciated. You then begin to feel that pins and needles numbness in your feet beginning to build in, and you realize, I can feel my feet. You can feel the texture of the stone around you. 
LIAM: My toes can feel the inside of Chet's-- 
TRAVIS: (fearful squeaks) 
LIAM: -- thigh. 
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing and pulling. 
TRAVIS: (terrified mumbles) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Wake up slow, slow. 
TRAVIS: (fearful squeak) I'm not supposed to be trapped in tight spaces like this for a long time. My hips are on fire. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: It's okay, just wiggle your toes. 
TRAVIS: (moans) 
LIAM: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Can we get out of here, please? 
LIAM: I'll try to pull the lid. 
MATT: (stone shifting) It opens up. 
TALIESIN: No, never mind. 
TRAVIS: (gasps for breath) 
LIAM: Go on first, let's go. 
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing) Did you see? Did you see the-- She had chains. She was so huge, and then the wings. Oh god, Ashton! (shifting stone lid) Ashton! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm literally right behind you. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I thought you were a goner. I mean, I'm valuable, but if they were going to take one of us-- 
TALIESIN: I pat. You've gotten so soft in your old age. 
TRAVIS: (sighs) These gods, they're going to be the death of us. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Maybe, but they're close. 
MATT: You hear the rustling of wax paper crumple up. 
TALIESIN: Start pushing the stone back. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: How was your sandwich? 
TRAVIS: Othinon, how long were we gone? 
LIAM: For the length of one-- 
TRAVIS: How long we were we gone? 
MATT: "Like two minutes." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm okay to go. 
LAURA: I'm okay to go. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) I'm okay to go. 
LAURA: I'm okay. 
LIAM: What do you say we stop by the kiosk-- 
SAM: Are those yoga pants? 
LIAM: -- pick up egg sandwiches, take them back to town? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Is there a gift shop? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "There's an area where you can leave gifts, I guess. Not really much of a shop." 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. 
MATT: "I'll take tips though, I guess." 
TALIESIN: I throw five silver. 
MATT: "Oh. Matron keep you." 
TALIESIN: Get yourself a sandwich. 
TALIESIN: Let's hope so. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Thanks for the illuminating experience. I'll start going back up the stairs, hands and feet up the stairs like a medieval castle. 
LIAM: When we walk past the Dawnfather temple on the way out towards town, I say, the difference is, this is Dawn Methodist, but in Issylra, it's Dawn Catholic, which is a whole other boat. 
ASHLEY: Whole different thing. 
TALIESIN: I take a copper and throw it at the Dawnfather temple. 
MATT: (glass shattering) It breaks the-- 
TALIESIN: No, not like that. (laughter) 
MATT: I know, I know, I know. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's dead! 
LIAM: Run, run! 
LAURA: Run, run, run! 
TALIESIN: On the way out, I drop a copper. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: That's the worst insult I know. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: FCG, what have you been up to? 
MARISHA: Oh jeez. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Oh no. 
SAM: No, I'll go to the Horizon Temple. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Is anyone there, or am I free to wander about, or--? 
MATT: Oh no, you approach the Horizon Temple. It is open. The doors are free and wide at this point. It is later in the afternoon, not quite pushing toward sunset, but you see the familiar face of Osli. 
SAM: Osli Kamyda? 
MATT: Yep, Kamyda, who had previously set you on this path-- 
SAM: (sneezes) 
TRAVIS: Ugh! 
ASHLEY, LAURA, MATT, and MARISHA: Bless you. 
MATT: -- who is finishing sweeping off dust from the front. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: As he glances up, "Oh my goodness, you've returned!" 
SAM: Yeah, smiley day to you. You changed my life last time I was here, and I had to come by and say hello. 
MATT: "Well, it's wonderful to know that she's had as much of an impact as you have in bringing yourself back." 
SAM: May I go in and pray for a bit? 
MATT: "Of course That's what it's here for." 
SAM: All right. 
MATT: "Indeed, I'm going to finish." (broom swishing) 
SAM: Oh yeah, feel free to keep sweeping. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: If that's what your object work was. 
MATT: "That was." 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: "The stoop, it's very dusty." 
LAURA: Your vest is pretty. 
MATT: Sorry, I couldn't show it through my beard. 
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: Sure, no. I'll go in and see if there's a place to sit. 
MATT: Yeah, there are a number of-- There are recesses in the ground, small little circled stone recesses that can be used for independent prayer. There are also some benches on the side, or you can approach the central statue of the Changebringer. 
SAM: I'll do that. I'll go to the central statue and I'll sit and pray and try to open my heart and mind to the Changebringer and say: If you can hear me, it's me, Fresh Cut Grass. Remember me? It's been a while. I feel like me and my friends are going on a mission that is important and could change a lot of stuff, and I feel like-- I feel like something bad's going to happen. Something-- There's doom on the horizon. But I still think it's right that we're going, and I wanted to ask you, not for guidance or answers or anything, but if you could look out, and if there's a way to, when things go bad, if you could make it happen to me and not them, I would really appreciate that. 
MATT: You look up at her stoic face, the hair that cascades past the shoulders and seems to reach out to the various pillars of the interior of the temple. You swear you see the stone eyes blink. When they open, there's a deep burgundy color to the stone where the eyes would be that sinks to a deeper red, and you see these crimson trickles that run down the cheeks. The head seems to shift and look down to address you. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: You can almost hear the creaking and shifting of stone (stone shifting) as the statue addresses you with its red, bloody gaze. 
SAM: I'll grip my coin a little tighter. 
MATT: You hear her voice in your mind. "Dark days are ahead for all. But those who walk the path of bravery can save that what they care most about." 
SAM: Am I walking the path of bravery? 
MATT: "You are, and you're not the only one. There are many who do. The road before you is fraught with peril and loss. But that is what it is to be a hero, to be a paragon, to be a child of change." 
SAM: Is it-- Thank you. I don't-- I don't think I want to know any more than that. But maybe just-- It's just nice to know that you've been watching me and will continue to. You will, right? 
MATT: You look away to have that thought, and look back up, and the tears that were once crimson are now clear water, and you can hear the (soft plops) as they hit the stone where you were first looking. You meet the same gaze of the statue, though it's not looking towards you. It's looking back out from where it was, though the tears still drip. Then the voice says, "Always. We watch over you always." 
SAM: We, meaning all the gods? Or royal we, just you? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "We are all in danger." 
SAM: Yeah, I got that. Well, we're coming. We might see you tomorrow. Seems like it's going to be a pretty bad day. Or maybe it'll be a great day. Maybe it'll be really smiley. Anyway, thank you for this coin, for all the guidance you've given me in the past. I feel like-- I feel like I've realized that you're not given a purpose and you don't choose a purpose. You just sort of make one as you go. And I think-- I think I'm ready to make one. 
MATT: "That is true freedom, and one of the great many meanings of life." 
SAM: Also, can you-- This is the only thing I'll ask. Can you make some sort of crazy sign for Ashton? I want him to believe. Maybe you could do some sort of crazy thing to make him-- I don't know, that's minor. Don't even-- You know what, strike that. We don't need to-- You don't need to do that. I just think it would be neat if they were like, "Oh wow, I believe now!" I don't know, that's just another side thing. Never mind. I'm out of here. 
MATT: "Guide him to the path that inspires you. One must be open to miracles for them to be believed. Be safe, and do not forget, if the road ahead is frightening, you can choose to walk another. Freedom, freedom, freedom." As this echo happens, you look up at where the tears were dripping from the statue, but now it's dry. You come out of this odd vision. 
SAM: And I've got skin and hands now? 
MATT: No. 
SAM: Oh fuck. 
LIAM: I'm a real boy. 
SAM: All right, I'll throw it in reverse and (vrooming) Just kind of back out. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Beep, beep, beep! 
TALIESIN: Filled with fumes as you-- 
MATT: Osli's like, "I hope you found what you were looking for, friend." 
SAM: I did. I did. Have you noticed anything different about her worshipers or about anything since the big thing in the sky happened? 
MATT: "I mean, folks are coming more often than usual." 
SAM: Oh, really? 
MATT: "Faith comes readily when there's uncertainty in the air, of course. For me personally, she seems distracted. But aren't we all? And there's solace in knowing that even the great powers above us can be anxious. Does that not bring us closer together?" 
SAM: Gods, they're just like us. 
MATT: "Yes. Yes, they are." 
SAM: I've been trying to convince my friends that they're just like us, but they don't seem to think that, though. Anyway, you get it. 
MATT: "I do. I do. Ah, no. Someone must have spilled something." 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: "I'll go clean that up." 
SAM: Oh, yeah. 
MATT: "Have a good day." 
SAM: Goodbye. 
MATT: He goes over and starts cleaning up a puddle of water that seems to have gathered the base of the statue. 
TRAVIS: Water! 
SAM: Awesome. 
TALIESIN: That's what we do in-- 
LAURA: Why was she saying freedom? All this time she's been saying-- 
TALIESIN: -- stupid fetch quests. 
LAURA: "You have to do this," every other time you've talked to her, it's been like, "You must save us." This time she was like, "If you don't want to--" 
LIAM: Maybe they don't know what they're doing. 
LAURA: "-- freedom." 
SAM: Maybe she's being-- 
LAURA: Coerced? 
SAM: -- held hostage. 
LAURA: Red tears. 
SAM: Did I notice anything different about her? Reverse insight? 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Retroactive insight? 
TALIESIN: On the wrong side of the face. 
MATT: No, nothing different other than-- the demeanor still has an air of urgency. Make an insight check, actually. 
SAM: Guidance. 
LIAM: Big money, no whammies. 
ASHLEY: She's losing hope. 
SAM: Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MARISHA: Really? 
MATT: Really? 
LAURA: (Whammy-like) Ha-ha. 
MARISHA: Holy shit. 
LAURA: ♪ (game show jingle) ♪ 
MATT: For a total of? 
SAM: Insight? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: 27. 
LAURA: And you Guided yourself. 
SAM: I mean-- 
TALIESIN: Go for it. 
SAM: If that's allowed, Dungeon Master. 
MATT: I'll say no. (laughter) 
SAM: Four. 
MATT: (dice clanking) (laughter) 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: (laughs) Nah! 
MATT: That's a pretty high roll. 
LIAM: Measly 27. 
MATT: You get the sense that the nature of the Changebringer is semi-mercurial-- 
LAURA: Mm. 
MATT: -- in how they guide or inspire their followers. You wonder if it's almost like changing the message to see if that has a stronger push for you. If forceful direction doesn't work, then coercion, or reverse psychology, or enticing a different path, and the most faithful will be even more driven to stick to where they walk. You don't sense any sort of, anything that you should distrust, just a unique extension of your understanding of what it is you worship. This is an entity that, much like the wind, can come at you from different directions and in different ways. 
SAM: Thank you, Cat Stevens. (laughter) 
MATT: The least I could do for you, ZZ. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes. Yes. (laughter reignites) 
MATT: What? 
MARISHA: ZZ. 
LIAM: This is the whole-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (silly Gandalf laugh) 
SAM and MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: Oh! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ALL: (uproarious) Oh! 
LIAM: The hat's gone. 
MATT: It's gone now. It's over. 
LIAM: Oh man. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Is this a Hall and Oates reunion? (laughter) 
MATT: Aw, it's all in the beard. (laughter) 
MATT: Bleh. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It's shiny. 
LAURA: I know. 
MATT: I feel like Dan Aykroyd eating the salmon in his beard from "Trading Places." (laughter) 
SAM: Are we all getting back together? 
TRAVIS: Yes. Crêpe stand, Sun Tree. 
SAM: (transition zoom) 
MARISHA: Crêpe stand. 
SAM: We're all back together! 
MATT: You all reconvene-- 
TALIESIN: Crêpe stand. 
MATT: -- at the base of the Sun Tree at the crêpe stand that's there now, I guess. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: We've apparated one here, sure. 
TRAVIS: Orangina. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
LAURA: Oh, that sounds so good. 
LIAM: It's temporary. It's on wheels. It doesn't stay here all day. It's just here now. 
LAURA: It's like a Slayer's Cake. 
TRAVIS: Seasonal. 
MARISHA: I want it so bad. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Popup. 
LIAM: Yeah, a popup shop. 
LAURA: A popup that goes around. 
MATT: Sure, yeah. Why not? 
ASHLEY: Well, that's a good idea. 
MATT: As the dusk-lit sky begins to creep overhead, you reconvene. Anything else you wish to do? 
MARISHA: Hmm. Ah, powdered sugar. 
LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: "Okay, yeah, no, I'll get powdered sugar in that." 
TRAVIS: Oh jesus, are we about to fucking RP the crêpe stand? 
LIAM: Let's RP the crêpe. 
MARISHA: Strawberries? 
MATT: "Strawberries." 
MARISHA: Strawberries. 
MATT: "They're a little mushy. Is that okay?" 
MARISHA: Ah, fine. 
MATT: "Okay." 
MARISHA: Condensed milk. 
MATT: "We're out of condensed milk." 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LIAM and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Chocolate? Chocolate's fine. 
MATT: "Chocolate? I'll put more chocolate, okay." 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: "You look real familiar." 
MARISHA: Does anyone want to share this with me? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll have a couple bites. 
MARISHA: I look familiar? 
MATT: "Do I know you?" 
MARISHA: (uncertain) Mm. 
LAURA: How old is he? 
MARISHA: He looks old. 
MATT: He looks probably in his early 50s or so. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
LAURA: What's your name? Wait, what's your name? 
MARISHA: Are you Andy? 
MATT: "Andrew." (exclaiming) 
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck you, Matt! No fucking way! 
SAM: The buzz saw starts. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I lower-- 
SAM: (saw whirring) 
MARISHA: You know, I get that a lot, that I look like people that they knew in high school or middle school growing up, or that they used to throw dirt clods at. So I get that. 
MATT: "That's oddly specific." 
MARISHA: No, no, no. It's just things that I happen to hear. 
MATT: "Okay. Do you want your crêpe?" 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Fearne, do you want a crêpe? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MARISHA: Imogen? 
LAURA: I do. I would like a crêpe. 
MATT: "Okay." 
LAURA: I would like a crêpe with chocolate. 
MATT: "Well, I already have one made that--" 
LAURA: Another one, with chocolate and powdered sugar. 
MATT: "Is someone going to--" 
LAURA: Banana. 
MATT: "Hold on, you're going real fast." 
LAURA: Strawberry. 
LIAM and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: "Okay." 
LAURA: Do you have nuts or crumbles or something like that? 
MARISHA: Mm, yes. Like walnuts? 
MATT: "Yeah, I got a little bit right here." 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. As small as you can crumble them, please, thank you. 
MATT: Puts them in a little bag and-- (slams) 
LAURA: Oh, wait, I forgot. I'm allergic to nuts. 
MARISHA: You are allergic to nuts. Oh my god, I can't believe we forgot that. 
SAM: She's just kidding. 
LAURA: I don't want it. Thank you, I'm sorry. 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: "Okay." 
MARISHA: There's a dog over there. See that dog? 
MATT: (cart lifts) (wheels squeaking) 
MARISHA: You can't give chocolate to a dog! 
MATT: "I wasn't. I'm just moving. I need to find somebody to eat these crêpes. Oh great, dinner it is." 
LAURA: Oh, now I feel guilty. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too. 
TRAVIS: Oh, are you sure? 
LAURA: Well, he threw dirt clods at her. 
TRAVIS: When he was five?! 
SAM: But now he's alone-- 
LAURA: No, he was-- 
SAM: -- and miserable. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: No, he's not. He's a very joyful crêpe maker. 
TALIESIN: Oh, well. Are we there? 
MARISHA: Do you have joy in your life, Andy? 
MATT: "Andrew. Yeah, I like making crêpes." 
LAURA: How long have you lived here, Andrew? 
MATT: "My life?" 
ASHLEY: Do you have someone that you share your life with? I'm not asking, I'm just seeing if you do. 
SAM: That is asking. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I am not asking for myself, is what I mean. 
SAM: Oh. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) I forgot that-- 
MATT: "That's a lot of prying questions." 
LIAM: Where is this conversation going? 
TALIESIN: Are we here yet, or--? 
MATT: "Look, I'm back on the market, if that's what you're asking." 
ASHLEY: No, definitely not. 
MATT: "Okay. Now I'm going to go eat my two crêpes that nobody paid for." 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I'll grab one of those. 
TRAVIS: Pay him. 
MARISHA: They want one. 
TALIESIN: I'll grab one of the ones that no one-- That sounds good. I don't have any-- 
MATT: "Are you allergic to nuts?" 
TALIESIN: If I am, it's far too late. 
MATT: "Okay, here you go." 
LIAM: I'll take the other one. Just means more pull-ups tomorrow. 
MATT: "All right, and the strawberries are a little mushy." 
LIAM: That's fine. 
TALIESIN: That's fine. They're better mushy. 
MATT: "All right. Crêpes!" 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Can I fuck with him a little? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, please. 
TALIESIN: Thanks, Laudna. All right. 
TRAVIS: No, it's amazing. That's like a-- 
TALIESIN: Let's all head back home. 
TRAVIS: That's a great sense of closure. 
MARISHA: Yeah! No, it is. Yeah, it's weird. 
TALIESIN: So, yeah, let's-- 
TRAVIS: It's almost like it didn't matter to anybody but you. 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Let's maybe let this poor guy-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a blast from the past. What are you going to do? 
ASHLEY: Oh, he's not a poor guy. He's fine. 
LAURA: He's selling crêpes. Andrew? 
MATT: "What?" 
LAURA: You know what will make you feel better and make your life better? 
TRAVIS: Stop. Leave it. 
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no. 
LAURA: Is to say sorry. Is to say I'm sorry. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "For not paying for your crêpe?" 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: For throwing dirt clods, Andrew. 
MATT: "All right, you've been on this thing for a good solid minute now. What's your problem?" 
MARISHA: Don't answer. It's all right. 
LAURA: What if he's not the same Andrew? 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yes, it might not be actually-- 
TRAVIS: (continues laughing) 
TALIESIN: Let me try to-- Let me try a thing. 
SAM: You're too far to turn around now. 
LIAM: Yeah, you can't. 
LAURA: Andrew. 
MATT: "What?" 
LAURA: Did you throw dirt clods at little girls? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: "I don't remember. Probably." 
LAURA: Well, if you did, you should say sorry because it really hurt their feelings. 
MARISHA: I thought you were so cute. And now you're a miserable, old crêpe man. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: "Dawnfather save me, they're crazy around the tree this time of day." 
TALIESIN: Can we wrap this up, Matilda? 
MATT: "Wow." 
SAM: Banishment. (laughter) 
MATT: Do you? 
SAM: No. (laughter) 
LIAM: Imagine if he was floating in the Astral Sea. 
MATT: (Andrew screaming) (laughter) 
MATT: A dreadnought comes by. "(screams)" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (composing sigh) 
MARISHA: It's fine. No, it's good. Say hi to your mother. 
MATT: "Did I throw a dirt clod at you?" 
LAURA: Not at me. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Not at me, Andrew. 
SAM: At a little girl named Matilda. 
LAURA: You remember Matilda? 
MARISHA: Yes. (nervous hyperventilating) Do I look familiar to you? Pick up dirt. Do I look more familiar now? 
LAURA: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: That makes it worse. 
LAURA: Laudna. 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: "No. I mean, I remember there was a Matilda around here, yeah." 
LAURA: Did you know another little boy named Andy, maybe? 
MATT: "There were a few Andys around the town." (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: "It's a pretty common name." (laughter 
MATT: "There was three in my class." 
LAURA: Oh. You know, I'm going to pull out-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Did you know-- 
TRAVIS: Keep going. 
LAURA: I'm going to pull out a-- 
TRAVIS: Keep going. More than you're grabbing. 
TALIESIN: I was so excited. 
TRAVIS: More than you're grabbing. 
LAURA: I pull out a gold. I pull out a gold, all right? 
TALIESIN: I was so excited to-- 
TRAVIS: Just a gold? 
LAURA: Yeah, a gold. You know how much these crêpes cost? How much do crêpes cost? (laughter) 
LIAM: Let's go, Karen. 
TALIESIN: I was going to put the whole crêpe thing-- 
LIAM: Let's go, Karen. 
TALIESIN: -- crêpe machine into our hole. 
LAURA: I'm not a Karen. I am protec-- 
MATT: "A copper." 
LAURA: Here, take the gold, Andrew. 
MATT: "My, that's a lot of them. Okay, thank you. I appreciate that. 
LAURA: And accept my apology, because you know what I do. I apologize for my-- 
LIAM: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: I apologize. 
TRAVIS: Oh my goodness. 
TALIESIN: Just couldn't let it go. 
MATT: "Well." 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
LAURA: If you see Andy who threw dirt clods, you tell him that he's a sack of shit. 
MATT: "I will narrow that down one day." 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: "Sorry if you got dirt thrown at you. There are a few Andys here that are kind of shitty." 
MARISHA: (stammers) Thank you. 
SAM: Do you remember their last names by any chance? 
MATT: "Oh, there was Andy Darrence. There was Andy Whitestone-- No, no, no." (laughter) 
SAM: Whitestone Andy? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Andy Dufresne. 
TRAVIS: Thank you so much. Good luck with your crêpes. Can we go? 
SAM: Flame Strike. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (explosion) 
LIAM: They probably all died under the Briarwoods, anyway. 
SAM: Closure. 
TALIESIN: I mean, it was just-- 
ASHLEY: Closure. 
MARISHA: Closure. 
LAURA: Yeah, kind of closure. 
MARISHA: Maybe. It's a start. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you close one wound and you open another one right on top of it. 
LAURA: He's fine. 
TALIESIN: They keep a census in the castle, probably. We could find out everybody's name who's Andy at one time. 
SAM: Or we could just go to sleep and get ready to go-- 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: I might be cranky because I haven't slept. 
MARISHA: Yes, we'll go to sleep. 
TALIESIN: That's very true. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes. 
MARISHA: We're going to go sleep. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: To "sleep." 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: All right. You all go back to your chambers within the castle of Whitestone. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly see if I can find a book to read. I want to read a little bit of the history of the de Rolo family or a little bit of what the fuck happened to make these people so fucking weird. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to know a little bit about what the fuck went down. 
MATT: Sure, yeah. There are definitely books within the castle that go over that. 
TALIESIN: Grab a few of them. 
MATT: Yeah, grab them and bring them back to your chambers and start glancing through. Your beds are comfortable. The evening's rest is a welcome end to what has been a lengthy day. 
MARISHA: That sounds so good. 
MATT: Bruises and sores begin to set in. After resting in a matter of strange challenged spaces, a ghost ship, a jungle, it's nice to be in a very plush, warm bed as sleep eventually comes and takes your minds and leads you off to that quiet inhale (Gandalf voice) before the plunge. I had to do it. 
TRAVIS: You're so good.. 
MATT: You think of the strange day to come, the strange device your friends have repaired, and the burning crystal that still thrums a light in the workshop below. 
MARISHA: Ladies. 
MATT: And that's-- 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
MATT: What are you doing? 
LAURA: I'll tell you next time. (laughs) 
MARISHA: I thought you were about to wrap it up. 
MATT: Oh, I was about to as well, and I was like, "Oh, they're still doing something." 
MARISHA: Yeah, I am. 
MATT: That's cool. Let's go. All right, cool. And that's where we'll end the episode now. (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Timing, timing. 
SAM: Seamless! Smooth! 
MATT: Look at that. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Look at that. Well-oiled machine. 
TALIESIN: Are you there, Keyleth? It's me, Marisha. (laughter) 
MARISHA: She's never far. 
TALIESIN: No. (laughter) 
LIAM: That was one of the craziest "Yes, and" chains that we've ever seen. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
LIAM: We willed that banana stand into existence. (laughter) 
LIAM: And then it was Andy, and then it wasn't Andy. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That hurts. 
TALIESIN: That was amazing. That was a journey. 
ASHLEY: That was quite a journey. 
MATT: It's fun being silly. Dang, y'all. 
TRAVIS: Happy Halloween. 
MATT: Happy Halloween. 
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Happy Halloween. 
MATT: Yeah, thank you all so much for joining us. We'll pick up next on what is now a mounting infiltration mission to the moon. 
MARISHA: We're slinking through the castle. 
MATT: I mean, there's a few things to do before you leave. We'll pick it up then. But thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and (as Gandalf) is it Thursday yet? (cheering) 
MATT: Good night.
