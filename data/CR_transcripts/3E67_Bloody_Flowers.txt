Pre-Show[]
MATT: (laughs) Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: (grunts) Before we jump into our episode tonight, we do have some quick announcements to get through beginning with our first sponsor, Thorum. Sam? 
SAM: Thorum, makers of unique wedding bands, handcrafted out of everything from meteorite to whiskey barrels with over 5,000 five star reviews, they ship every single ring within one business day. That's madness. 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: Each purchase includes a free Thorum silicone activity band and Thorum American-- Thorum American walnut wood ring box. Many of the cast is wearing one right now. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Woo hoo! 
SAM: Not all of them because some of them lost them. 
TRAVIS: We did not, no! That's not true! 
SAM: The thing I love about Thorum rings is how much time and effort goes into their production line. It reminded me a lot about how much time and energy I put into these ads every Thursday night. In fact, Thorum generously sponsored a little behind the scenes documentary about how my sponsorship skits get made. Thank you, Thorum, and I hope you enjoy the video. 
SAM: Advertising. It's my gift. (inspirational music) 
SAM: It's what I do, but it doesn't just happen. It takes a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to make these ads a reality. 
SAM: (VO) The first step is research. I do a deep dive into the sponsor, the product, talking points, getting a sense of the story I want to tell. Sometimes this phase could take 10, even 15 minutes. (door knocks) 
SAM: Uh, somebody's in here. 
SAM: (VO) The next phase is brainstorming. We have an amazing and talented production team who always support my vision 100%. 
SAM: I just don't understand. Why can't we do another ASMR bit? Why? 
MAXWELL: Because the audience hates it, Sam. 
SAM: Well, they're wrong! 
MAXWELL: Are they, Sam? Are they? 
SAM: Yes, my ideas are great. (tearily) They're great. (sobs) 
KYLE: Technically, I'm a producer. You're a genius. They just don't get it. 
SAM: Really? 
KYLE: But a lot of my job is "talent management." We're going to get in there, and we're going to do this, okay? 
SAM: Okay, I'm a genius, though, right? 
KYLE: Yes, and don't let them see you cry. You got this, okay, buddy? All right, you got this. 
SAM: (exhales) 
KYLE: (sighs) I need a raise. 
SAM: (VO) Props and costumes are a big part of making ad masterpieces. 
SAM: Fun fact, I cut and sew all my own wardrobe and I design every single prop. It's a dog costume. And the producers put the finishing touches on them before the show. How's it look, guys? Pretty good? 
JERRY: (sighs) We usually toss Sam's costume in the garbage and order from online. He doesn't know the difference. 
SAM: (VO) Oh, here I am coming up with one of my famous flask bits. 
SAM: Mm-hmm, yeah. Sometimes these take six to eight hours of Photoshop. 
KIRBY: Honestly, I don't think Sam knows how to use a computer. 
SAM: This is going to be a fun one. 
KIRBY: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Yeah, it's really, it's good. It's good. 
KIRBY: I just play him a bunch of how-to videos to keep him occupied. 
MAX: And that's how you color in a horse. 
SAM: So much time and effort goes into making my ads that they are the number one favorite thing every member of the Critical Role family loves doing. Right, everybody? 
PRODUCTION TEAM: (flatly) That's right, Sam. 
SAM: See? So remember, next time you see me do an ad, don't skip ahead. Thanks, everyone, and on with the slow. 
PRODUCTION TEAM: (groans) 
SAM: I messed up that last part. But, you know, can we just go again? Just once more from the top? 
KIRBY: No. 
SAM: Everybody, I'm going to need you back. Please don't leave me. (laughter) (cheering) 
MARISHA: Shout out to our crew. 
SAM: Thank you, Thorum, for that eye-opening look behind the curtain. Made from materials like ironwood, dinosaur bone, tungsten carbide, and countless more, each with a lifetime warranty. Whether you need a wedding ring, anniversary ring, or just want a ring that looks cool, head over to thorum.com and use code criticalrole to get 20% off a truly unique ring. Matt, back to you. 
MATT: Thank you, Sam. (cheering) 
MATT: That was awesome. 
MARISHA: Well done. 
MATT: Well done. 
TRAVIS: The bar gets higher. 
MATT: Our amazing crew, and I guess Sam. 
TRAVIS: Wow, wow. 
MATT: Our second sponsor tonight is Baldur's Gate III. 
LIAM: (growls) Baldur's Gate III. The land of Faerûn is under siege by hostile and otherworldly mind flayers. The army expands with every brain they infect with parasitic tadpoles, such as the creature that now wriggles deep within your player character's mind. (oohing) 
MATT: But as their corruption grows within you, so do mysterious new powers. Baldur's Gate III! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Had to spook you on that one. Is a true next generation Dungeons & Dragons experience set within one of the most iconic fantasy settings of all time. I've been a fan of Baldur's Gate since the first one and played them all, super excited that you can now play the third one and gather your party and make your return to Baldur's Gate alongside new friends and classic characters in the original series, like Minsc brought to life by me! (cheering) 
MATT: There is ever so much of Minsc to bring to life. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Swords for everyone! But the adventure awaits you in this tale of friendship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the allure of absolute power. But it'll be your choices that determine whether your story ends in redemption, salvation, domination, or something else entirely. Maybe involving bears. (laughter) 
MATT: Baldur's Gate III releases today on PC and make sure to check out larian.club/bg_cr. 
MARISHA: Bg3. 
TRAVIS: Bg3 underscore. 
MATT: I'm sorry, my apologies. larian.club/bg3_cr to learn more. 
MARISHA: Yay. 
LIAM: Nice. 
MARISHA: Nailed it. 
TRAVIS: Baldur's Gate III. 
LIAM: I will play it. 
MATT: It's all I'm going to do August. All the month of August. 
TRAVIS: All of it. 
SAM: Just be balling? 
MATT: Yup. Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Balduring? 
TALIESIN: Balduring? 
MATT: Yep, just Balduring and poop-socking. 
MARISHA: Just Balden those gates. 
MATT: Laura, you're up. 
LAURA: I have stuff. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
TRAVIS: Hey! Stuff! 
TALIESIN: Yep. Woo! 
LAURA: Oh my gosh! 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
LAURA: Here's something that's really freaking cool. Here's the thing. When we were making these, we had no idea what was going to happen in the story, but somehow it all timed up perfectly, you guys. We're making these amazing Air Ashari dice. 
ASHLEY: That is really crazy. 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: It's a collaboration with Everything Dice. 
MARISHA: Look at the box! 
LAURA: This is in the US store only. 
LIAM: It's pretty. 
LAURA: Box artwork of Zephrah by Alex Lillie. Go look in the store. It's amazing, you guys. 
LIAM: So pretty. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Have we ever done boxes like that before? 
LAURA: No, this is because we're working with Everything Dice, who are like, so, so much-- 
LIAM: Bust them out! 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I love their stuff. 
SAM: Bustin', bustin', bustin'. 
LAURA: It comes with a thing. It comes with its own little bag. It comes with its own polishing cloth. 
LIAM: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LAURA: Because-- 
LIAM: I can wipe my glasses with Zephrah? 
LAURA: These dice are everything. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
LIAM and TALIESIN: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
LAURA: They have little clouds in them and they're like the sunset of Zephrah. 
MATT: What? 
MARISHA: No way! 
LAURA: It's so beautiful. 
LIAM: I'm going to look at the 12. 
LAURA: Go look at it. I'm so just-- 
ASHLEY: Those are so pretty! 
TALIESIN: Holy-- 
LAURA: You could polish it. 
ASHLEY: For your glasses! 
LAURA: Look, you can polish. 
MARISHA: What?! 
ASHLEY: Oh my garsh. 
LAURA: That's amazing. 
LIAM: These are pretty. 
TALIESIN: This is so pretty. 
ASHLEY: So pretty. 
LAURA: Ooh, somebody can play with them tonight. 
MATT: That's so cool. 
LAURA: Do you want to play with them tonight, Marisha? 
MARISHA: Yes, I do! 
TRAVIS: You're not Keyleth. 
LIAM: You're not an Ashari at this table. 
TRAVIS: She's wrecked right now. 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. It's true. 
TRAVIS: She is wrecked! 
LAURA: Orym is the-- 
MARISHA: You can't take Keyleth from me. 
MATT: (laughs) It's true. 
LAURA: It's a tough call. 
MARISHA: I just borrow her on occasion. 
LAURA: Yeah, you guys can Rollies for who gets to play with the Ashari dice tonight. 
LIAM: Give her the dice. 
LAURA: But the next thing that we have that I can talk about-- 
MARISHA: Ooh, it's a natural one. 
LAURA: -- is this. It's in all stores. It's our Critical Role ReAction figure series. Nott the Brave! 
SAM: Nott the Brave! 
MATT: Woo! 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
SAM: That's the character I played! 
LAURA: Artist Hannah Friederichs and Super7-- 
TALIESIN: I have to Wiki that. 
SAM: With ears. 
LAURA: I know. She's so cute. And like our Hooded Game Master and Essek, Nott the Brave is exclusively found in Critical Role shops. 
SAM: Is that true? 
LAURA: Yes, this is a CR exclusive. 
LIAM: Dang. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
TALIESIN: The mask fits. 
LAURA: Yeah, because Veth is the one that's available everywhere. 
SAM: Oh, that makes sense. 
LAURA: Nott is a special special. 
LIAM: Special variant. 
SAM: I get two? I get two and you guys-- 
LAURA: You get two. 
SAM: -- only get one. I win. 
TRAVIS: Shut up. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: It comes with a teeny tiny little mask, Sam. There's a teeny tiny mask. 
SAM: Oh, I love it! 
LAURA: Take it, you can hold it. 
SAM: I'll take it. 
LAURA: So yeah, it completes our Mighty Nein set. Ta da! 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LAURA: That's all I got to talk about. I love you. 
MATT: Fantastic, thank you, Laura. Marisha, you're up. 
LAURA: Oh here. 
MARISHA: Right. 
LAURA: that goes with your dice. 
MARISHA: I was looking at the dice. In case-- 
TRAVIS: (slaps) 
MARISHA: Ah! 
LAURA: Wait, wait. Here you go. That goes with the-- 
MARISHA: Oh shit, there's things. 
TRAVIS: (punch) 
MARISHA: Oh, fuck! 
LIAM: Things got busy!

SAM: How do I get an invite to the Locksley gala?

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So last we left off, Bells Hells, after reuniting, being scattered across Exandria and a slight burst in time, managed to reconvene, catch up a little bit, and decide a number of various paths that should be set upon in the near future. The initial one, upon realizing how wounded Keyleth is and not recovering, to check in with her in Zephrah. In doing so, there was another reuniting with some of your home and family and your people you haven't seen since you embarked on this journey with Bells Hells. Really having the opportunity to catch up a bit with the people that are closest to you aside from those that you travel alongside. Also discovered that Keyleth, the wounds not healing, does have one possible opportunity to salvage and recover from this. However, it sends you to one of many possible cursed areas, the most viable and proven one being the Grey Valley of Tal'Dorei. You also heard that there was a troop that already volunteered to go but a day before and has not returned, which was worrying. However, you were then sent to the Grey Valley, wandered about the dark and long, cursed and dangerously ominous landscape, avoiding being found and seen for much of it before encountering a number of terrifying fiendish entities. You did battle, and through some quick thinking and some powerful druidic magic managed to come out of there fairly well. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Took a break, gathered yourselves, and prepared for the rest of your journey to gather enough of the perennem flowers-- 
LAURA: Ha. 
MATT: -- to be-- (laughs) To be utilized in healing Keyleth's wounds and setting for your next leg of your journey. So, we come back in here in the center of the Grey Valley where you've made a temporary camp to rest. 
LAURA: We fought the creatures in that little side area, and we're on the path following where we had seen them? 
MATT: You're heading the direction where you believe more of the flowers may be. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: You passed a perpetually burning portion of the forest. These entities seem to be also, at least, gathered in the direction you were traveling. But that's the best knowledge you have at the moment. But coming in as we're finishing up our short rest, is there anything anyone needs to do or prepare for on the way out? Discuss or shall we continue onward? 
SAM: I want to quickly check in with Orym. Orym! That's you, right? How you doing? This is your lady's-- Her life is on the line. And we still haven't found any of these taint flowers, like are you-- 
LIAM: We did find some gooch poppies already. 
LAURA: We did. 
LIAM: It filled the bag-- 
SAM: But not enough. 
LAURA: You bastards. 
SAM: But not enough grundle bundles to do anything, right? 
TRAVIS: Oh no! No, no, no. 
ASHLEY: Grundle bundles, yes. 
SAM: Are you okay? 
LAURA: Those were your people, right? 
TALIESIN: And your sister? 
LIAM: Here, yeah. No, I don't think so. I hope not. I don't think so. How am I doing? How's everybody doing? 
ASHLEY: Really good. I mean. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
SAM: Fearne! 
TRAVIS: Feeling alive, I mean-- Oh. 
SAM: Fearne, please! Read the room. 
ASHLEY: Sorry. I'm just, sometimes I-- 
LIAM: Yeah, I've been better. I've been better. 
SAM: Being back here, does it, you know? Are are you still with us? You're not going to stay after we-- Do you belong here? 
LIAM: Um. Maybe someday, but right now, we're needed elsewhere. I'm not done with our story. Whatever that end is. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yeah, it's hard to see her like that because I'm so used to the woman I grew up around. It kind of felt like she was invincible. It's a little hard to see. 
SAM: Were you guys close? 
LAURA: She seems so young. 
SAM: Yeah, she does, doesn't she? 
LAURA: You were around her when you were a kid. 
LIAM: Well, it's part of her Aramente. Part of her story is that she's going to live a long time. 
SAM: That's great! 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
SAM: Will you live a long time? 
LIAM: I don't think so. 
SAM: Can you do what she did? Aramente? 
LIAM: No. 
SAM: You can't? 
LIAM: No, I mean, you saw her in action at the Malleus Key. Can't do any of that. 
SAM: Yet. 
LIAM: I'm good at what I do. 
SAM: I think you can do it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I like this. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that sounds like a good new goal. 
TRAVIS: Orym, you just got to believe in yourself. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: A flower grows out of my thumb. (laughter) 
LAURA: Hey! Is it blue? 
SAM: See? 
LAURA: Look, we can add it to the bag. 
LIAM: Yeah. That is a taint-patiens. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Careful where you put that thumb. 
SAM: Well, if any-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: If you get too stressed out or whatever, you know, you can squeeze my hand really hard, doesn't hurt, as a stress reliever or, you know, or you can cry. That's okay. It's okay to cry, or I can give you a cigarette or whatever you need. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: The cigarettes. 
MARISHA: He did get cigarettes from Prism. That is a real thing that happened. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: You going to be a big smoker now? 
SAM: I mean, I only have like 16 left. 
ASHLEY: Doesn't that do something inside? 
LIAM: You don't have lungs though, right? 
SAM: I don't think so. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: It wasn't-- 
LIAM: So it was more for the vibe? 
LAURA: You can just always keep one in your mouth, just not light it. 
TRAVIS: He does the poser thing where it drifts up into his eyes, and then he is like this the whole time trying to look cool. I do this all the time. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That was a very specific story, Chetney. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Listen, I've tried the vibe out once. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: I was a beat poet, but it didn't work out. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Let's hear it. 
SAM: You were a beat poet? 
ASHLEY: Let's hear it. 
TRAVIS: (rhythm drumming) 
SAM: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: I don't know this. 
LAURA: I see what-- 
TRAVIS: (rhythmically) The forest is dead, and so (snaps) are we. 
MARISHA: How are you doing, FCG? 
SAM: That's deep. That's deep. 
ASHLEY: Wow, wow. 
TRAVIS: Dig it. 
ASHLEY: Who knew? 
TRAVIS: I also ran a coffee bar. It was a great side hustle. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LAURA: You have so much life, Chet. 
TRAVIS: It was just mud water, but they didn't know. They were fucking, you know, hippies. 
TALIESIN: You're such a good woodworker. You're really such a good woodworker. 
TRAVIS: Thank you! 
TALIESIN: You're welcome. 
TRAVIS: I love working with wood. 
TALIESIN: Thank god, yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: So anyway, Orym. (laughter) 
LIAM: Let's go around the circle. How's everybody doing? I mean, we haven't been alone together that long. 
SAM: It's true. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: I mean, you seem weirdly happy. 
ASHLEY: I do? 
SAM: Yeah. 
SAM: And you-- This is just a weird observation. Feels like you are glowing a little bit. I don't know why. 
MARISHA: Well, you know, when Imogen and I took a little walk to go visit Zhudanna, we talked it out. 
LAURA: We talked about a lot of stuff. 
MARISHA: We cleared the air. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Just, you know? 
SAM: What does that mean? 
LAURA: Yeah, we got some snacks. 
MARISHA: We're good. 
SAM: What did you talk out? Did you have problems that you had work out? 
TRAVIS: Oh, you all had beef? 
LAURA: Yeah, well-- 
MARISHA: Well, just, you know, just the kind of-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I apologized, which I-- You're not wrong. I should probably extend this apology to the rest of you for my behavior. I'm feeling a bit irrational towards being kind of mad that you guys had a really good time on your trip. 
SAM: Oh, you were right. You were right. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Still processing. 
MARISHA: We had a really horrible, kind of traumatizing time. 
TALIESIN: Also still-- 
MARISHA: And that's it. 
TALIESIN: Also still processing as well. 
MARISHA: But, you know, I apo-- We're good now. 
LAURA: We apologized, we talked. 
MARISHA: We're great. 
SAM: Why are you sweating? 
MARISHA: It's just clammy. 
LAURA: Laudna doesn't sweat. She glistens. 
MARISHA: Exactly. 
TRAVIS: Do you sweat ink? What is that? 
MARISHA: It's a little dewy. It's-- 
TRAVIS: You're dewy. 
MARISHA: It's a little gray, I know. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: Pit stains. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. 
TALIESIN: It's viscous humors something, I don't know what that is. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine. 
MARISHA: It's fine. We're fine. 
LAURA: Everything's great. It's fine. 
SAM: Everyone's checked in, then. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Except for Ashton. Ashton, you okay? 
TALIESIN: Strangely, I think I'm the best I've been in a very long time. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
TALIESIN: I just want to get this taken care of. 
LAURA: I feel like-- 
TALIESIN: Get people have taken care of, and let's just move through this. We've got a direction. I like having a direction. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's true. 
SAM: You do? 
LAURA: Yes, exactly that. Everything has been so up in the air. I don't know what's going on with the moon and the gods, and it feels so directionless, you know? What are we doing? What are we doing? 
LIAM: I think we're going to take a couple of days to get good, and then we're going to go back to the source, aren't we? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MARISHA: The source. 
SAM: But to do what? 
LAURA: That's the thing. But the point of it is, it's nice to have a focus. It's nice to go after flowers to help Keyleth, you know? Then maybe we can figure out where we stand with the gods because I think everybody's in a different place. 
TALIESIN: I love an odd job. 
SAM: I mean if-- 
TALIESIN: You don't have to think about things during an odd job. You have a thing to do, you do it, you've accomplished something. It's really nice. 
MARISHA: It's all been so complicated. I mean, I remember even when we were trying to explain it to our compatriots that we ran into in Issylra. It was so hard to explain everything that we're trying to do. Getting flowers is nice. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. 
SAM: Yeah, when we finish that, we're going to help the gods, right? 
LAURA: Of course. FCG. 
SAM: I don't want to force you to do that or anything. 
LAURA: No, I don't-- Obviously I think-- Yes, Predathos is bad, and I want to-- 
SAM: Feels like you're trying to convince yourself of that. 
LAURA: Well, a little bit. A little bit. I finally feel like-- I'm feeling better about my abilities and what that means for me. And I feel like ending Predathos could potentially end me in a way, which is fine. 
SAM: Wait, what? 
LAURA: It's worth that. 
SAM: What do you mean? 
LAURA: I don't know if that is gone if I'll be who I am anymore. 
SAM: You won't be dead. 
LAURA: I don't know. I don't know if that means people that got their life from a godly power, if that means they'll be ended as well. You know? I don't know what it means. But I do think-- 
TRAVIS: Shit head. 
LAURA: I do think that so many people depend on the gods, and it's the way we've been for such a long time that it makes sense to honor that. It's not like we don't believe in the gods, you know? They exist, they're there, it's just a matter of if we support them or not. And obviously we do. 
SAM: Do we? 
TRAVIS: I'm a little undecided. I'll just be straight up with you. I mean, history's always written by the victors. So we've only heard one side of things. 
MARISHA: I'm kind of with Chetney. 
SAM: Can we just take a quick straw poll? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: All-- Everyone in favor of the gods, raise their hand. Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Well, let's keep going. 
TRAVIS: All those-- 
SAM: All those opposed, raise your hand. All those not sure. 
TRAVIS: Undecided. 
ASHLEY: Undecided. Undecided. 
SAM: Well, that's-- 
LAURA: Yeah, and that's the problem! I feel like we need to figure this out. 
SAM: That's everybody. 
MARISHA: What was your vote? You didn't really-- 
SAM: He just kind of dragged. 
TRAVIS: Did you abstain? Did you abstain from the vote? 
TALIESIN: I'm abstaining. 
TRAVIS: You got to work in this governing body. 
SAM: You're abstaining from being undecided? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He was in the bathroom. 
SAM: Wow. You really are a punk. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ashton was probably a druid. A fake druid. 
TRAVIS: What? 
SAM and LAURA: What? 
SAM: What does that mean? 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: I just feel like you should talk about yourself some more, Ashton. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: What does that mean? What? 
LAURA: What? 
TALIESIN: I don't know how much there is to talk about. 
SAM: Were you a druid? 
ASHLEY: Is there's something there more about you than we know? 
TRAVIS: This short rest is fucking awesome. 
MARISHA: Did we talk about any of this? 
SAM: Wait, we didn't talk about this? 
MARISHA: I don't remember what we talked about. 
TRAVIS: He could be a fake druid! 
TALIESIN: A druid is some-- 
SAM: You're a druid?! 
LIAM: No. 
TALIESIN: No. 
MARISHA: He came from a cult. 
TRAVIS: You came from a cult?! 
ASHLEY: What?! 
TALIESIN: Clearly. 
TRAVIS: Really? 
LAURA: So wait. But did you like the cult or do you want to fight the cult? 
TALIESIN: I don't actually have any real memory of the cult. I was-- 
SAM: You're not excited about the cult?! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (laughs) I was evacuated from it when I was very, very young. I have almost no memory of the cult. 
MARISHA: Evacuated or jettisoned? 
TALIESIN: There was a, some sort of interesting dimensional anomaly is the best I've been able to put together. I'm trying to get some more information out of it. Big thing exploded. 
ASHLEY: That happens to you a lot. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it weirdly does. It threw me to the other side of the fucking continent, and not before I got to watch my family torn to tiny shreds, which is basically my first memory. Actually, thank you for bringing it up. 
TRAVIS, SAM, and ASHLEY: (stammer questions) 
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. Questions! 
SAM: How old were you? 
TRAVIS: Questions! 
SAM: How old were you? 
TALIESIN: I don't know! 
TRAVIS: To the other side of the continent? 
TALIESIN: I don't fucking know. 
SAM: What continent? 
TRAVIS: How long ago was this? 
LAURA: No, not Tal'Dorei, the other continent. 
TALIESIN: Where we met. 
TRAVIS: Marquet? 
SAM and LAURA: Marquet. 
TALIESIN: Marquet. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
TRAVIS: How long ago was this? 
ASHLEY: Marquet, of course! 
TRAVIS: (gasps) Are you older than me? 
MARISHA: I know! What if you-- 
TALIESIN: God, I hope not. 
MARISHA: You could've have jumped time, though. Why not? 
TALIESIN: I don't think I have because people are-- I'm starting to learn that there's a certain timeline to these things. 
SAM: I thought you were Orym's dad-- 
TALIESIN: Honest to god, I genuinely don't-- 
TRAVIS: It's a human centipede of fathers. 
TALIESIN: I don't know a lot about where I came from. I wasn't particularly interested. Well, I don't know. 
ASHLEY: Wait, how old were you? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
TRAVIS: Young. 
SAM: Old enough to talk? Old enough to wear clothes? 
TALIESIN: Old enough to talk, old enough to wear clothes, but-- 
LAURA: Old enough to walk around. 
LIAM: Toddler? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Get into trouble? 
TALIESIN: Seven, eight? I don't know. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Old enough that I didn't really-- It was a long time ago. I woke up in a fucking desert. I got sent to a fucking orphanage, and that's where I spent the rest of my life. It's been a couple decades since, ish. 
MARISHA: But you're skipping over the juicy bits. See, we talked, because when we were in Hearthdell, I think that's where we were. 
SAM: Did you just throw up in your mouth? (laughter) 
MATT: Art imitating life. 
MARISHA: We were talking to the elder, Elder Abaddina, and we asked about-- You showed them the helmet. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the Hishari. 
MARISHA: It's the Hishari because they wanted-- It was this branch-off group who was trying to mimic the Ashari, but they called themselves the Hishari. 
LAURA: Oh, right! 
ASHLEY: Added the H. 
LAURA: You sort of mentioned it. 
SAM: I remember we talked about this a little bit. 
LIAM: Yeah. They were-- 
TALIESIN: We did. 
SAM: But they were a cult. 
LIAM: -- coasting on the reputation, yeah. 
TALIESIN: I mean, you know, it depends on your point of view I suppose, but sure. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But that's not the cult that you were in. 
TALIESIN: That is the cult that I was in. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay. 
LAURA: Okay, so you were in the Hishari. 
TRAVIS: You were jettisoned slash evacuated from their bowels by yourself or with others? 
TALIESIN: As far as I know, just me. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
ASHLEY: You said you were dimensionally what? 
SAM: Challenged. 
ASHLEY: Challenged? 
TALIESIN: I mean, I was-- 
ASHLEY: Jettisoned? 
TALIESIN: I was barely old enough to talk and walk. I really don't have a particularly clear memory of it. It's kind of bits and pieces. I don't even really have a clear-- I don't even have a really clear notion of what my parents really looked like other than damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: And now you're trying to find out the mystery of who did it and where they went? 
ASHLEY: Who done it. 
TALIESIN: I mean, I just-- Honestly, I'm here with this group because I heard the word Ashari, and it piqued my interest. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it before, and then I hear the word Ashari come up, and that kind of clicked a thing. 
TRAVIS: Has anyone ever tried to find you or locate you or reached out to you or--? 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
SAM: Do you remember enough about your-- Are they dead? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Very dead. 
SAM: Do you remember anyone who survived this incident that Imogen can use her mind powers to find in the world? 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
LAURA: We can't really do that anymore, can we? 
TRAVIS: Not with that attitude. 
LIAM: I know that it's different for every person, but our parents are really the people who raised us. I've got a dad that I don't know. He's out there somewhere, I guess, but that's not my dad. 
MARISHA: We were actually very close to where the Hishari settled down in Issylra. 
TALIESIN: I didn't really know that at the time. 
MARISHA: No, and we were in such a hurry to get back to all of you. 
SAM: A hurry. 
TALIESIN: But it's okay, because I got some people that I'm going to talk to when we get back. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Gonna get a little bit of a down low to Thollo, if I recall was the name. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm trying to figure out where the fuck I came from. And at the moment, we have more pressing issues. I get that. 
SAM: You know who can help with that a lot. The gods. If you ask them for your favor, they might be able to guide you to where, you know, to the answers that you require, like my god has given me a lot of answers so far. Maybe you could, too. 
TALIESIN: Or, you know, nah. 
SAM: I'm just saying, they can do a lot of stuff for people like us who are lost. Well, people like you who are lost. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: They can give you a direction or answers or a focus or-- 
TALIESIN: I have direction. I'm getting answers, and I'm very focused. 
SAM: I feel like we should redo the vote just in case anyone has changed their mind. 
LIAM: After that talk? 
TRAVIS: Persuasive, yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I still don't-- 
SAM: All in favor of the gods. Hey, look at that. 
LAURA: Oh, that's great! 
TRAVIS: Changing minds, FCG. 
LAURA: That's great. 
SAM: That's right. A few more to go. 
LAURA: I believe it more. 
ASHLEY: Wait, but-- 
LAURA: Predathos is bad. 
SAM: I know, but if it kills you, I understand why you'd be hesitant. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Ludinus is bad. 
TALIESIN: Ludinus is bad. 
LAURA: We know that they're bad people. 
TRAVIS: You're Predathos is bad? 
LAURA: Do we want to support-- 
MARISHA: I'm with Chetney. Do we have actually any confirmation that he's bad? 
TRAVIS: The name Predathos is a little heavy handed. What if it's just Carl? And Carl was the best, most omnipotent, benevolent being and the other gods were jelly, so they were like, fucking throw Carl in the closet and send him to the moon. 
TRAVIS: We all know that Ludinus is a problem. We all agree that this is something that has to be taken care of. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LIAM: He is bad. It's not a gray area. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: He orchestrated the assassination of the woman you just met yesterday. 
MARISHA: He's bad. But-- 
LIAM: He's bad. 
SAM: You were going to say something, Fearnie? 
ASHLEY: I don't know, I had lots of things, but I was worried about the Predathos thing with you, and I was wondering if Predathos dies, what's going to happen to you? But I guess-- 
SAM: Because if you get your power from the red moon and the red moon dies or goes away or whatever, what does that do to you? But then also, aren't you Ruidusborn? 
LAURA: You're also Ruidusborn. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but, it feels different. It's like a different flavor, I'm not really sure why. 
LAURA: Maybe because you were born in Feywild. 
ASHLEY: Maybe. 
TRAVIS: Double-edged sword. If the gods die, what happens to FCG? 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Nothing. 
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure nothing. 
SAM: I know, but what if I get my entire life, what if FRIDA gets their life from a god? 
TALIESIN: I don't really, I mean, doesn't seem to make even the slightest lick of sense there since there was life-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ We don't know ♪ 
TALIESIN: -- before them, there is life after them. 
TRAVIS: ♪ We don't know ♪ 
LAURA and TRAVIS: ♪ We don't know, oh-oh-oh ♪ 
TALIESIN: I think what we need is information. I think the data is essential that we do not have, so let's just keep our minds open. 
LAURA: Let's just keep looking for flowers. 
TRAVIS: Okay, check the sky since we're having this amazing. 
MATT: Sure, make a perception check for me. 
TRAVIS: Oh, first roll of the game! Eat it! 11. 
MATT: (chuckles) Aside from the slightly trailing bits of fog and mist that roll through the blanched treescape that surrounds you in places and the ever curling dead valley that stretches on, nothing immediately catches your attention to worry you. 
LAURA: We should get on with it. 
TRAVIS: Succotash. 
ASHLEY: Wait, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Hmm? 
ASHLEY: So since your parents were, you saw them taken away, what's the thing, what's the thing with you and not being into parents? You know? I feel like you get mad at them. You're mad at all of them. 
TALIESIN: I like your parents, or I like your nan. 
LAURA: Nana's great. 
ASHLEY: Nana's great. 
TALIESIN: I just, I come from a place and a particular, I'll say where I've lived, the people I've known do not have the best track record. So, you know, I feel like it's important to keep a little bit of an open mind when it comes to how people were raised because in my experience, most of them are kind of shit. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: It's easier to be there for folks when they're there for you. 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: And I like found family. Found family is fucking great. That's the way to go. The people you are randomly, you know, just assigned to. Even the people who ran the house that I was fucking raised in weren't that bad. I mean, they were exhausted, which is fair. But that's my could've been worse. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Are we surrounded by monsters right now? 
TRAVIS: No, we're actually-- 
MATT: Roll initiative. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's a terrible thing to say about your friends. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: With the trees being on fire, and you know, demons flying about, we should probably keep going so we don't, you know-- [metallic clang] 
LAURA and SAM: Whoa! (laughter) 
SAM: (tongue trill) 
TRAVIS: (cuckoo clock noises) (laughter) 
MATT: I'm going to keep a slide whistle back here, now, just in case. 
LIAM: FCG, you okay? 
SAM: I'm sorry, but that was actually, that's how I fart. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (tongue trill) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
ASHLEY: Please fart all the time. 
TRAVIS: That is a compacted toot. (laughter) 
LIAM: Let's find more of these forget-me-twats. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: There y-- (groans). 
TRAVIS: That was well done. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, so. Who is helming this next leg of the journey? 
SAM: Where are we headed? 
LAURA: Is it a survival? 
SAM: Do we have a direction? 
MATT: Yes, you have a direction that you're traveling. 
MARISHA: It was northwest or something. 
TALIESIN: Grey Valley. 
LAURA: Is this a survival roll, or a perception roll? 
MATT: It could be either with different difficulties. 
LIAM: I'm just going to be on threat detection. I'll do that. Not looking for flowers, but looking for-- 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: If she gave me, she gave me the directions, so I can helm it, if you want. 
LAURA: Yeah. All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm down. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: I'll be trying to help us through the, if there's-- What's the ground like? Is it a path, or is it just overgrown foliage and full? 
MATT: There's no carved path. The landscape here is shale and dried brush, long-dead forest floor, faint layers of ash, and whatever fallen, brittle parts of the blanched, long-dead trees have fallen and become scattered bits of white strips amongst the dirt. It is hilly and thicker in some places than others. And occasionally there's broken bits of mud and thick bog that you've had to sludge through. 
LAURA: Can I assist you, then? Since you know the direction to go, can I help you out and try to find the way of least resistance to go the direction that you're pointing? 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: All righty. Make a survival roll with advantage because of your help. 
SAM: Oh, survival. 
ASHLEY: Can I also Guide? 
MATT: Hmm? I'll let you do Guidance for this one. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to help you out by squinting my eyes in the sun and looking. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: You look like you're smoking a cigarette. 
ASHLEY: That's what I was trying to go for. (laughter) 
MATT: Pensive stare. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
SAM: And a 19. 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: A 19, okay. And a perception check from you. 
LIAM: Yeah. Reroll my one. That's better. (li lu noises) 24 for me. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: (li lu noises) 
SAM: Oh, I got a four on the Guidance, too. 
MATT: Great, dang, okay. So. The topography here definitely has a few natural traps in the way that it's built. There are areas where the hills come to some sort of a valley, and you can see in this space, this would be a good place to ambush or a good place to hide and prepare for things that aren't watching their path. You manage to expertly guide everyone away from these certain regions, heading almost on the northern side of the journey where it's a bit higher, which does give you a little more of a, at least a visual plane look at you at times, but it also is the safest route to take. As you're all carefully ducking between larger rocks and bits of stone that are jutting out of the ground and using thicker parts of the dead tree forest to try and stay low and hidden, nothing yet seems to catch eye or ear of you. You do see, as you're on the higher ground looking down to the valley, occasionally these little faint, glowing wisps that drift through the trees. You take a moment and focus and you swear they look like people. And the more you focus in the distance, they look more like soldiers, like the ghosts of long-dead warriors who died on a battlefield and are ever lost wandering the expanse of this space, occasionally drifting and vanishing within the mists. Occasionally, you see another one dart through, then three of them run before (light whooshes) vanishing into the air. 
LIAM: How many do you guesstimate-- Does he guesstimate that he sees? 
MATT: At times you see one or two. At the moment, you see 15. There's one moment where the mist you swear looks like dozens of them rushing towards each other and then it's just the mist. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MATT: But far enough to the south of where you stand, where you don't feel like there's any particular danger, just a somewhat creepy glance into a part of history forced to relive itself over and over. 
LIAM: Thank you. Are they in our path or they're off? 
MATT: They're on the south end side, not in your path. You managed to avoid expertly an intersection point. Carrying on for another couple hours or so, hearing the occasional shrieks of flying beasts in the distance, seeing the shadows, keeping some sort of a low-flying hunting pattern. You manage to avoid their paths as well until eventually another scent of burning catches your collective noses, like a distant forest fire, a bit of charcoal, almost like the smell of burning meat. 
TRAVIS: Can I give it a more specific wolf nose? 
MATT: Yes, you may. Go ahead and make a perception check with advantage. 
TRAVIS: 18. 
MATT: 18, okay. There definitively is one direction where the wind is continuously blowing in pulses and when it comes from that direction, you gauge it's further in the path in the direction you've been traveling, but it continues a slight southern arc. You can get to, or one of you or more of you can go to a precipice that breaks beyond the forest tree line to try and get a view in that direction, but you will be exposed in doing so. 
MARISHA: I'll send Pâté. 
MATT: Okay, Pâté curls out. "Don't worry. Let's do it-- hey!" 
MARISHA: (grunts) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check for him. 
TRAVIS: Poor Pâté, he's getting shorter and shorter and shorter. 
MARISHA: He's fine. 
TRAVIS: Getting fucking Nerf football-ed out there. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Harsh, but fair. 
MARISHA: What is it? 
TRAVIS: I've wanting to talk about... 
MARISHA: Using my perception check, yeah? 
MATT: Pâté's perception. 
TRAVIS: Can we talk about our relationship? 
MATT: 15? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That's the best you've ever rolled for his perception. 
MARISHA: That's pretty good. 
LIAM: How high'd it go? 15? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Wait, is it familiar or mine? 
LIAM: Familiar. 
MATT: It's familiar's. 
MARISHA: Okay, even though I'm looking through him? 
MATT: Correct, it's still his eyes. 
MARISHA: It's still his eyes. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: Then-- 
TRAVIS: First time jitters. 
LIAM: Think of all the times the cat ate shit. 
LAURA: Literally. 
MARISHA: I feel like-- Oh, it's magical darkness doesn't impede his vision. Then 11. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's... 
LAURA: That's bit more accurate. 
MARISHA: That's more like it. 
MATT: There we go. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Worried there. 
MATT: He has a hard time pinpointing much beyond just a few different trails of wispy smoke that seem to be drifting and occasionally being blown away in the slight short bursts of wind and air that coast through the valley. You can see some of the trees creaking and moving with it, but nothing particularly catches his eye. 
MARISHA: Should really get a familiar with actual eyes. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Instead of just sockets. 
SAM: Isn't he made out of dead parts? Couldn't you get some eyes and add them? 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Eyes go bad pretty quick. 
MARISHA: They do, that seems to be the thing. 
LAURA: They're magical. 
TALIESIN: They're the first thing to go. 
MARISHA: Yeah, they're little magical-- 
SAM: You keep swapping them out. 
LIAM: You're really crafty. I mean, even I can't tell if it would make him more or less unsettling. 
MARISHA: Probably more. 
TALIESIN: Would they have to be tiny eyes to fit inside? Would you need-- 
LAURA: Like rat-sized eyes. 
MARISHA: I'll-- 
TALIESIN: Raven-sized eyes. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we should get-- 
MARISHA: -- meditate on it. 
TALIESIN: Bigger eyes, anyway. 
MARISHA: I'll think about it. 
LAURA: Bird eyes-- 
MARISHA: We'll see. 
ASHLEY: We should do bird eyes, eagle eyes. Something real good. 
TALIESIN: Might be too big. Baby eagle. 
MATT: "I did a pass for you. Any of that useful?" 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: "'kay." Curls up onto your shoulder. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: What's up, Pâté? 
MATT: "(exhales)" 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Scritch, scritch, scritch. 
MARISHA: Do you want to ride with you for a little bit? 
MATT: "Sure!" (swoops) Latches onto your shoulder, curls up on the top of your head, starts digging the little bony fingers in the top of the hat. 
TRAVIS: He's got a tight grip. 
MARISHA: And it's great, the scalp massages. 
TRAVIS: I don't think he knows how strong he is. 
MATT: "(laughs)" 
TRAVIS: That smell. 
MARISHA: It's a little musty. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: "It tastes like leather." 
TRAVIS: (sucking impact) (yelps) (laughter) 
SAM: Pressing on. 
LAURA: Some of us, should we check it out or just-- 
ASHLEY: I can check. 
TRAVIS: That's fine. 
SAM: Let's just go. 
MARISHA: Let's just go. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: What could go wrong? 
MATT: All right. You continue following the path that you've been pushing forward towards. 
SAM: Yeah, of course. 
MATT: But that scent keeps catching your nose and eventually you begin to gather what would be a more direct source of it. You come upon what looks to be a unique part of the topography, a large piece of historically sundered ground, a site where a large hill was once cloven into two shallow cliffs. You can see it leaving a broken crevasse of earth and stone that worms its way through at this, looks like a large half circle-like perspective. You can see the barren telltale trees, the valley surrounding all through it. It looks like it holds importance and you can see signs of more recent construction dotting one of the edges of the chasm, like there is a structure built within it. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Into the cliff face? 
MATT: Inside of this crevasse, against one of the cliff faces in the middle of where the two halves of the hill still reside. 
TRAVIS: That's nuts. 
LAURA: And you said it looks like it's been sundered like it is visibly obviously something beyond just a canyon or a ravine or something. 
MATT: It looks like a large hill that has the shape except for one big cleft torn through the center of it. 
LAURA: I mean, we got to see what that is. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, especially, yeah. 
SAM: That's where the smell's coming from? 
TRAVIS: It seems to be coming from that direction. 
SAM: Squirrel! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: How far away? 
MATT: About a mile and a half. 
LAURA: Do you see any flowers around there? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: It's going off-- 
SAM: Do we have a spyglass? 
TRAVIS: The cooking meat smells very off putting. 
LAURA: We have spyglass. Did you give it back? 
SAM: What happened to our spyglass? 
LIAM: I gave it back, I gave it back, I think, right? 
ASHLEY: Why did, where did you get it? 
SAM: From the-- 
LIAM: I didn't say that out loud. That was Liam. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that was Liam. I have one. 
SAM: Oh! You do? 
TRAVIS: Meat pouch. 
ASHLEY: It's gone. 
SAM: (gasps) 
LAURA: Well, it's got to be in one of your pockets. 
ASHLEY: I'm looking in my fur and it's not here! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I don't have one. Somebody took it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Do you suspect someone among us? 
ASHLEY: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: I'm going through my pockets looking for it. 
SAM: All right, whoever took it, just admit it. 
TRAVIS: What's it made of? 
SAM: Chetney. 
TRAVIS: What's it made of? 
ASHLEY: It is a spyglass made out of whatever spyglasses are made out of. Probably metal, probably some glass. 
TRAVIS: Then don't look at me! I don't mess with that stuff. 
LAURA: Was it whose? 
SAM: Ashton? 
ASHLEY: I was borrowing it from Xandis and I was going to return to him the next time we saw him, but I can't now. 
TALIESIN: Sadly, I cannot take credit for this one. I was really hoping. 
LIAM: I, um. 
TRAVIS: Yes? 
TALIESIN: Wait a minute, is it in the hole? 
LIAM: I might have borrowed it back. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LIAM: To Xandis. 
TRAVIS: Unbelievable. 
LAURA: (laughs) You stole from her? 
ASHLEY: How rude. 
LIAM: Well, I just really like Xandis. 
LAURA: Yeah. They were good. 
SAM: More than Fearne? 
TALIESIN: More than a spyglass. 
TRAVIS: The treachery. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's all right. 
SAM: Is it? 
ASHLEY: I'm proud of you for getting away with it. That means you're getting better. 
LIAM: It feels like good trade for sending Xandis in a crashing sky vehicle into the ground. 
LAURA: We still did more-- 
ASHLEY: I did have one. I thought it was just an extra one. 
SAM: I think we found out that they were okay. 
MARISHA: We saw them scurrying away. 
LAURA: Sure. 
LIAM: Case closed. 
TALIESIN: Cheap at half the price. 
TRAVIS: We don't have a ship. 
TALIESIN: That's true. 
SAM: Working on it. 
LAURA: All right, somebody else look. 
SAM: We're being torn apart and betraying each other now? 
TRAVIS: Can I go--? 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: Got the sun in my eye, I can't see anything. 
TRAVIS: The crevasse and the shearing with the structure around it, the rigging, that's like a mile and a half away? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: On the horizon. 
LAURA: I don't see any flowers, though. (yawning) But we should check out-- 
SAM: Oh, is this boring you, Imogen? 
LAURA: I don't-- sorry. 
LIAM: Are there any trees, dead trees around us? 
MATT: Many. 
SAM: Wait, why are you two particularly tired? 
LIAM: All right. I'm going to climb up a dead tree and see if I can spot some blue. 
ASHLEY: Did you stay up real late? 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Were you doing something together that was--? 
MATT: Go ahead and climb to the very top to get peak point. Are you trying to stay somewhat hidden at the peak of a very blanched white tree? 
LIAM: Not anymore, no, not in this moment. 
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and step up there and make the perception check. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck yes. 
SAM: Festering sore on your neck. 
MARISHA: Oh, I just have those everywhere. 
SAM: Oh, okay. (laughs) 
MARISHA: I had them the whole time. 
LIAM: Hey, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Bruise easy. 
LIAM: I'm sorry, I'm sorry I stole back the spyglass. I need to be the spyglass, could you help me? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I can. I will Guide you. 
LIAM: Thank you, I'm sorry. 
ASHLEY: I do nothing. 
SAM: (laughs) You're not going to cast Guidance? 
ASHLEY: No. (laughter) 
SAM: Amazing! Petty non-Guidance. 
TALIESIN: Pettiness is kind of our love language. I'm into it. 
LIAM: I totally feel it, I feel it. 
ASHLEY: I got you, I got you. 
LIAM: It's really mellow this time. 
ASHLEY: You're going to get what you're looking for right now. 
MARISHA: It's getting more nuanced. 
LIAM: That is a 26. 
SAM: Wow, it worked. 
LAURA: Good job. 
ASHLEY: I know. I'm there for you when you need me. 
TALIESIN: It's just a bag of oregano. (laughter) 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: Getting-- 
MARISHA: These are Altoids. 
MATT: A direct sight down from, well, quite a distance. You can't make any strong details out. You do not see any immediate blue color. It's not a flower that grows naturally and forever through the space. What you do recall is it specifically adheres to places of extreme cursed magic, places of intensity through death and loss. And there are spaces within here supposedly that carry it in the direction you've been traveling. You're uncertain of the sources. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So you don't see any in the vicinity. 
LIAM: Okay. Nope. No pussy willows. 
LAURA: But they come from what? Cursed places? 
TRAVIS: Don't do it, Matthew. 
LIAM: That's what they said. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Ignore the blood lust. He's markings shit off. Just saying. 
LIAM: I'm running out of-- 
TALIESIN: The challenge rating-- 
TRAVIS: So is he! (laughs) 
TALIESIN: -- is ticking higher, higher. 
TRAVIS: Pit fiend. (impacts) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What? No! We got to leave him. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I mean, we should check it out, right? 
TRAVIS: 100%. 
LAURA: That's 100% cursed magic that made that giant cleft in the hill. 
TRAVIS: That's not the part that's bothering me. It's the structure. 
MARISHA: It's the house. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: The structure. Because, okay, refresh me, GM. We learned that the Greylands was like stomping grounds for war. Big war, but it wasn't the Calamity. 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
MATT: No, the Grey Valley was part of the war between Drassig and Zan Tal'Dorei-- 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. 
MATT: -- centuries back. This was the last stand of the son of the first King Drassig who made a pact with the demonic forces, a demon prince in particular, to gain power to try and win. Still failed, but the sheer power that was unleashed and the death that followed that battle cursed this valley and that is where it currently sits today. And it's considered a space of more than normal rampant fiendish, demonic power and influence. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It's a mile and a half away, we could definitely just hoof it, or anybody that can fly could make probably quick work of it and look awesome while they're doing it. 
LAURA: Oh, you mean just go check it out real fast. 
TRAVIS: You? 
TRAVIS: That is so-- 
MARISHA: You shouldn't go alone. She shouldn't go alone. 
LIAM: (sneezes) 
LAURA: Bless you. 
LIAM: Excuse me. 
SAM: Oh, are you allergic to butt-- buttercups? 
LIAM: (laughs) Not that I know of. 
TRAVIS: No, don't do that. No, that's six-- 
TALIESIN: Stop it, Matt. 
TRAVIS: Technically, it's not. 
TALIESIN: We can't control them. 
TRAVIS: We just keep walking, we just keep walking. 
TALIESIN: We're just walking. 
LAURA: I can fly. 
TALIESIN: No, I think we stick together. 
LAURA: Oh, stick together. I have this fear that there's more of those-- 
MARISHA: There are demons everywhere. 
LAURA: Yeah, and what if they spot me and then I get-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: -- shot down. 
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? It's aerial combat. That'd be amazing. 
MARISHA: (nervous noise) We'll go together. 
TRAVIS: Think how awesome you'll look. Ah, Jesus, all right. We walk. 
MATT: All right. So are you continuing to just push west? Are you heading towards the hill? Are you looking beyond that? 
LAURA: Heading towards the hilly. 
SAM: The clefted hills. 
TRAVIS: The south, south. Towards the barbecue. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: The hill shaped like a giant butt. 
MATT: Stealthily, I assume, or-- 
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was going to say. 
TALIESIN: Domicile. 
LIAM: We're creeping. 
MARISHA: Domicile. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're creeping. 
MATT: I would like a group stealth check as you head in that direction. 
ASHLEY: Okay, wait, I think I brought Pass Without a Trace. 
TALIESIN: Sorry, I'm out of toys for this. 
LIAM: Yep. We're going in. 
ASHLEY: I Pass Without a Trace. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you do? 
MATT: Pass Without a Trace. So everyone add plus 10 to this. 
LIAM: Stealth. 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god. 
TRAVIS: 37. 
MATT: Jesus. 
LAURA: Why? 
MARISHA: Natural one. 
LAURA: Me too. 
MARISHA: Ugh! 
TALIESIN: Me three. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: No way! 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: What? 
SAM: Three ones! 
LAURA: Three nat ones?! 
TRAVIS: Tell me we got some north of 25s here. 
SAM: I have natural 20 for a 30. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay, 37 and a 30. 
LAURA: But each natural one counts as two. 
MARISHA: Two failures. 
LAURA: Two failures. 
SAM: What you got? 
ASHLEY: 14. 
SAM: Okay, that's... 
MARISHA: With the 10? 
MATT: With plus 10? 
ASHLEY: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Eugh. (groaning) 
ASHLEY: I rolled a two. 
SAM: And what you got, Or? 
LIAM: 27. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Nope, we failed that shit. 
ASHLEY: We're fine, we're fine, we're fine. 
SAM: It's fine. 
ASHLEY: Don't you smile over there. 
TRAVIS: He's happy. 
LAURA: Oh, we're so fucked. 
TALIESIN: He finally gets to spend all these little check marks he's been putting up for every time we make a bad pun. 
LAURA: This is karma, you guys. 
LIAM: This perineum's about to tear. 
MARISHA: Every time someone made fun of him. 
TRAVIS: No, don't, don't! 
LAURA: No! Stop doing it! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm going to throw a bean bag at you. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Have they installed that trap door yet? Shit. 
MATT: You get about halfway through the distance to the cleft of this hill. There is a moment where you emerge from one area of very thick trees to a bit of a clearing, and you immediately curve over to the sides of it. Around that time, it would be Orym and Chetney to pick up the first sound, the (squawking) Crack into the area above you. One of the tall trees splinters at about 15 feet down from the top and for a brief moment, you see this shape dart down after impacting it and begin to curl up, wings. (wings flapping) You hear, behind where it came from, another (squawking) and you see a secondary winged being that's now darting down. You can see, at a brief glance, these long, spindly-looking bodies of a dark grayish purple coloration. You see these long claws dangling at the end and these white feathered wings that seem to not match the rest of their body. Their heads with these elongated necks, with vulture-like beaks that are covered in teeth. And these yellowish, sickly eyes that are set deep within the head. Unlike any birds or creatures you've seen, there are elements of odd stretched humanoid features, but also this odd mimicry of bird-like physicality. They are both very much now circling around for another round. What are you doing? 
SAM: They found me! 
LIAM: Very direct dive-bombing on our location, yeah? 
MARISHA: They for sure have seen us? 
MATT: Very much so, and you can see them both spinning and circling on your current location. 
MARISHA: Feels like a harpy, looks like a harpy. 
TRAVIS: I'm using my bonus action to-- (transforming grunts) Rawr. I tear off my head and there's a wolf there, but little Chet's still hanging out. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm saving the rest of it as I run under a tree to get some cover. (snarls) 
LIAM: How far off are we from the structure inside the cliff? 
MATT: About half a mile. 
LIAM: Half a mile, Jesus. Scatter! 
LAURA: Scatter? 
SAM: Scatter? Someone stay near me! I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians around myself. 
TALIESIN: Good call. 
MATT: Okay. What form do the guardians take? 
SAM: Well, these are demon birds that are swooping down? 
MATT: Seems to be. 
SAM: What do birds not like? 
MARISHA: Windshields. 
SAM: They're sheets of glass. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Reflective things, they don't like reflective things. 
LIAM: Sliding doors. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Sliding doors. 
SAM: They're sheets of glass. 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: My god. All right. You put up this array of somewhat spectral, shifting sheets of glass that continue to circle around you as the secondary one backs up (screeches) into this screeching dive towards you as the first to show any sort of sign of immediate aggression. 
SAM: Oh no. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: What happens when it enters that range? It has to make a saving throw? 
SAM: I think when it gets within 15 feet, it's a wisdom 15 save. 
MATT: All righty. That is going to be a 12. 
SAM: Hey! It fails. That means that it gets-- 
MATT: 3d8? 
SAM: 3d8 radiant damage. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LAURA: Great. 
SAM: Okay. Maybe it doesn't like radiant because it's a bad thing. Seven. 
LAURA: Do these look like the same demonic creatures-- 
SAM: 11. 
LAURA: -- that we saw earlier or is it more natural looking? 
TRAVIS: That would be good to know. 
MATT: They definitely do not appear to be natural, by any means. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: As this one dives in quickly, you can see it has human-like long arms with fingers at the end with bits of tattered feathers. They almost didn't emerge properly. Parts of the wax and bone are poking through and the feathers (crack) off to the side. The face has elements of it coming out the sides and there's this elongated beak and those weird sickly eyes staring at you as it swoops down towards FCG. This is definitely not natural. 
SAM: 16 radiant. 
MATT: 16 radiant damage. As it swoops, a burst of light (screeches). It doesn't stop its descent towards you, though, and it's going to attempt to strike at you with its beak and its talons. So the beak is going to be a nine to hit. 
SAM: Miss! 
MATT: And natural one on the talons. 
SAM: Yeah! 
MATT: As the flashing of spectral glass gets in the way, it smashes through one of the windshields and spins out, hits the ground, tumbles a bit before picking up again, smashing through a few of the branches and getting a bit airborne from that point. 
SAM: Its weakness is glass! Everyone pull out the glass that you have on you! 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: I'm nothing but glass, I'm going to make a straight run towards this thing. 
MATT: All right, it is now up in the air about 15, 20 feet. 
TALIESIN: About 15 or 20 feet? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) 
MATT: There's trees everywhere, but-- 
TALIESIN: Well, okay. 
MARISHA: Can I throw a Darkness on its face? I can cast Darkness-- 
SAM: Does it move with the target? 
LIAM: Doesn't that lock in space? 
MARISHA: It does. 
LIAM: It goes with? 
MARISHA: It goes with, if you cast it on an object. 
LIAM: Mm, I don't think you can do it. 
SAM: Does it have an object? 
MATT: "A point you choose within range. If you choose an object you're holding or one that isn't being worn or carried." So it has-- 
LAURA: Mm. 
MARISHA: A point you choose. Can-- 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: Be its head? 
TALIESIN: It got out of-- (laughter) 
LIAM: In this case, its-- 
SAM: He already said no. (laughter) 
LAURA: Alive. 
LIAM: -- its head is an object that it's carrying. 
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly. 
MATT: Yeah. It cannot be an object that's being carried. 
LIAM: Right. 
ASHLEY and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to try and hold until something is within 40 feet of me and I'm standing ground trying to cover everybody who's made of paper. 
LIAM: Yeah, tracking them and waiting for them to drop, getting ready to react. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to use Catapult. I'm going to pick up a rock from-- 
SAM: Ooh, nice. 
LAURA: -- the ground and chuck it at the bird that's flying. 
MATT: Okay, the one that-- 
LAURA: FCG just hit, yeah. 
MATT: You got it. That one is the closest. The other one's circling around as that one's pulling away. So roll for an attack on that one. 
SAM: You going to Twinned Spell? 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Kill two birds with one stone. 
LAURA: I did that at 2nd-level-- 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: -- because that's the spell slot I was on. 
MARISHA: That was pretty good. 
MATT: That's actually pretty great. 
LAURA: It's a dexterity save. 
MATT: Dexterity save. That is going to be a 14. 
LAURA: That is a fail. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Nice! 
LAURA: So that is 4d8 damage. 
ASHLEY: Noice! 
MATT: Slick. It fires off quickly, and as it's pulling away from the blast, swooping back up to begin shifting around to a secondary attack, crack! 
LAURA: 22 points. 
MATT: How much? 
LAURA: 22 points of bludgeoning. 
MATT: 22 points, dang! Another burst of feathers-- (poof) (squawking) You see it spiral down again as it loses about 10 feet of height and is now starting to pick itself back up, while the other secondary one is spinning around, now attempting to swoop in for a strike. As you are the one that just unleashed the recent strike, it's going to attempt to dive bomb you. 
LAURA: Okay. I cast Mage Armor when we got to this place, so my AC is higher. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to pop off a Mirror Image, too. 
MATT: Okay. Mirror Image is on you. Is anyone protecting you nearby? 
LIAM: I said I was tracking, so I was about to pipe up and say I make a run and jump and I want to Bait and Switch. Leap up, grab her by the shoulder and get the shield up in front of the thing. 
MATT: Okay, and you said you were waiting for it to descend? 
TALIESIN: The second that it's within reaching distance, yeah. 
MATT: Okay, it's going to come down. It looks like it's diving straight towards you, and then scoots up. As soon as it gets right over you-- 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MATT: -- it hovers and (infuriated screeches). 
TRAVIS: What the fuck? 
MATT: This horrible screeching yell. Every creature within 20 feet, which I think would be you three right now, have to make a constitution saving throw for me. 
TRAVIS: Is this a vrock? 
LAURA: Right? 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
LAURA: Nine. 
LIAM: 15. 
TALIESIN: 12. 
MATT: All right. Both of you managed to cover your ears in time, but you, Imogen, unfortunately, as it pierces the inside of your mind, it seems to almost push past your psychic boundaries and you crumble to your knees, stunned. 
LAURA: Stunned, okay. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
SAM: Is she bleeding from her face or anything? 
LAURA: Just my ears. 
LIAM: I'm going to say that I finish the Bait and Switch then and land and then-- 
MATT: Push her out of the way? 
LIAM: Yeah, nudge her back, standing in front of her crumpled form and she will add something to her AC in a moment. Three to your AC. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to rage and take a full run at this fucking thing. What am I going to be doing when I rage, you ask? Oh, that's fun. 
LAURA: (mockingly) Oh! 
TALIESIN: The rainbow flicker starts hitting everything. I'm very shiny and very sparkly. 
MATT: Okay, and I'm going to run full speed-- 
LIAM: What about Ashton? 
TALIESIN: -- and hit this thing and I'm going to run, jump up, and literally let the momentum do a full flip right into the fucker's head. 
MATT: Go for it. Make the strike. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to do this reckless, fuck it. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah! That's more than makes any sense. 
TRAVIS: When in doubt-- 
TALIESIN: 29 to hit. 
TRAVIS: -- reckless. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: Then that's-- Because this is fun. 
TRAVIS: Drakkar Noir. 
TALIESIN: That's 2d6. 
TALIESIN: 3d6 because an extra d6 doing this shit. That's five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. It's 11 points plus-- It's 23 points of damage. 
MATT: 23 points of damage on the first strike. 
TALIESIN: It also has to make a DC 17 strength saving throw. 
MATT: Which it fails with a 15. 
SAM: Hey! 
TALIESIN: It gets pushed 25 feet directly away from where I just charged it. 
LIAM: Wah! 
MATT: All right, so as you full-on golf swing or over the head swing it, you slam it and it gets pushed directly away, skidding on the ground a little beyond where Imogen was tumbling, its wings out as it's trying to get back onto its feet. You can now see that long spindly body and its weird human-like haunches that end in these talon-like claws. It's-- (irritated snarling) 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
SAM: See, it's vulnerable to glass. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to basically stay within about 10 feet of the two of them and take a defensive position with the three of us. 
MATT: Okay, that one was knocked on the ground, so it is definitely within combat range if anyone were to rush there after your leaping arc on the first one. But who's up next? Who wants to-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to extend my wolf claws out through my Chetney hands, wearing my wolf mask. You'll see I'm going to scratch my forearms. You'll see flames come up, and before I take off running, I'm going to swipe at one of the trees that are all dead and stuff to see if I can get it to catch. 
MATT: Yeah. Flame begins to curl up the side of this tree as you dart away. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you big bitch! Come get me! 
MATT: (laughs) I'll use all 35 feet. I'll try and close the distance on the vrock with my Lady Deathstrike claws and my wolf mask. 
MATT: This is most terrifying Halloween trick-or-treater experience ever. 
LIAM: Is this like a wolf hat? Is that what you're saying? 
TRAVIS: It's a wolf head, everything else is on delay. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: But I'll say yeah, you can just get up into range of the one that was knocked back. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. I'll get the rest of it out, and I'm actually going to try and grapple this thing. I'm going to try and shove my claws inside of its body. 
MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check on your end. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: This will make-- 
TRAVIS: Poor decisions. 
MATT: This will make an athletics as well. 
TRAVIS: An 18. 
MATT: A five. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: You definitely full-on tackle and hold this thing in. You are currently grappling around its body and holding the side over the nearby trees right now as it's trying to right itself again, but it can't get its feet and hands up in the air and it's (frantic screeching) 
TRAVIS: (growls) What are you? (growls) That's my turn. 
MATT: It smells pungent. 
SAM: Boop. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: The other one that was hurt now turns around and is able to regain itself and is going to swoop down to you-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: -- since you're the one that's pinning the other one. 
SAM: Chetney, no! 
TRAVIS: (snarls) 
SAM: It's only going after the ones who believe in god. 
TRAVIS: (howling) 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: It's a 13 to hit, I believe does not. 
TRAVIS: It does not. 
MATT: Its talons, natural 20. 
TRAVIS: (waggling tongue) 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs! (boof) 
MATT: That spell. 
TRAVIS: That spell. 
SAM: I hate that fucking spell. 
MARISHA: Shut up, Sam Riegel! 
MATT: It's 21. 
TRAVIS: I'm not afraid. 
MATT: 21 still hit? 
TRAVIS: Oh yes. 
MATT: But it is not a crit. 
MARISHA: That is not a crit. 
MATT: It is not a crit. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Crit! Not a crit. 
MARISHA: Not a crit. 
MATT: (laughs) You take 11 points of slashing damage from the talons reduced to five-- 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: -- because you're in your wolven form. It's trying to harry you from above. You guys haven't gone yet. 
MARISHA: So are there two of them nearby where Chetney is? 
MATT: Two of these entities, yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: On the ground. 
LIAM: You're holding one, right? 
MARISHA: On the ground. 
MATT: About 30 or so feet from where you're standing. 
MARISHA: Is he in the middle or are they on one side of him? 
TRAVIS: (bestial snarls) 
LAURA: Take another drink. 
MATT: He's holding one and the other's above slashing from the air. 
MARISHA: Oh, he's holding one. 
MATT: He's grappling one, yeah. 
LAURA: Take it off. 
MARISHA: He's grappling one. 
LAURA: Take it off. Now. 
MARISHA: Then I'm going to hit two Eldritch Blasts at the one that's flying. One's a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! Smash. 
MARISHA: The other is 17. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MATT: 17? 
TRAVIS: What? 
MARISHA: And a natural 20. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh. Both hit. 
SAM: Is that better? 
LAURA: Yes, so everybody doesn't think that that's what's going on. 
SAM: You never know. 
LAURA: It's not. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Give me something big. 
TRAVIS: I never see them. 
MATT: For the best. 
LIAM: It changed by the time you caught on. 
MARISHA: 18 plus four, 22 for the crit. 
MATT: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Dang. 
MARISHA: That is very cocked. Ooh, yeah, yeah! 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MATT: The crit was the one being grappled or the one that's in the air? 
MARISHA: I'm hitting both to the one in the air, not the grappled one. 
MATT: Oh, both. 
MARISHA: Both to the one in the air. 
MATT: All right. Got it. Got it. 
TRAVIS: Second one in. 
MARISHA: So 22 for the first one and 11 for the second. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: So 33 total damage. 
MATT: The one up top, both impact, and you watch as a spray of dark, now blackened feathers from the impact of the Eldritch Blast, go (flitting) spreading out and hitting the nearby trees with a splatter of black viscera. You watch as the creature's two halves hit the ground before they both burn into a black ash. 
MARISHA: I got one! 
LAURA: Ah! 
MARISHA: I got one! 
SAM: Thank goodness for you. 
ASHLEY: Nicely done! 
MARISHA: You got this, Chet! 
LAURA: I mean, I didn't see it. 
TRAVIS: Yee-haw, yee-haw! 
ASHLEY: Oh, he's-- You're riding on one? 
LAURA: Can I be un-stunned yet? 
TRAVIS: Holding on to this thing. 
MATT: It has now come back to its next turn, so you are now unstunned. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Oh, that was it? 
MARISHA: It was one turn. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: Fearne? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over to-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: You're on one, one of them's dead. 
TRAVIS: I'm holding one down. I'm wrastling it. 
LAURA: The other one's dead. 
ASHLEY: The other one's dead. Chet, this might hurt a little bit. 
TRAVIS: Promise? 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to cast Burning Hands. 
MATT: (laughs) All right, what level? 
ASHLEY: Let's see here. Let's do it at-- 
TRAVIS: No wax this time. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: You got it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh, is that a cantrip? No, that's a spell-spell. 
ASHLEY: It's a spell-spell. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay, dexterity save of 18. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Me too? 
MATT: Both of you. 
ASHLEY: Both of them are dead, so-- 
TRAVIS: Saving throw or it's just dexterity? 
ASHLEY: Saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: It's a nine for the creature. 
SAM: Nice. 
TRAVIS: A 24 for me. 
SAM: Hey! 
ASHLEY: Woo! All right, so 3d6. 
TRAVIS: Hurt me. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Ya. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Nice, nice. 
ASHLEY: Seven, 11 points of damage. 
MATT: 11 points of fire damage too it. 
TRAVIS: Five for me. 
MATT: As you release this torrent of flames out towards both of them-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, wait. I think I do one more. 
SAM: Because you cast it at a higher level? 
ASHLEY: Did I do 3rd-level or 2nd-level? 
LAURA: You said 3rd-level. 
ASHLEY: I did? Okay, so I need to do two more. 
SAM: Two more? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Hurt so good ♪ 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: ♪ Come on, baby, make it hurt so good ♪ 
ASHLEY: That's an extra eight points, so 19 total. 
MATT: An extra eight points, all righty. 
MARISHA and LIAM: ♪ Sometimes flames don't feel like they should ♪ 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: ♪ You make it ♪ 
TRAVIS: Ugh-ugh. 
MARISHA: ♪ Hurt so good ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Ba-do-do-do-do ♪ 
MATT: As Chetney uses this creature like a shield, pulling it in front as you're grappled to it, the flames engulf you both, you resisting the majority of it. So it would've been 19 points of fire damage, instead you'd just take nine. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Five and nine. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: Go Fearne! 
LAURA: Woo! 
MATT: The creature, however, is extremely singed, and you can see now the feathers are burned away, the wings are thin and singed. It's (snarling) trying to pull free and it's growling as it's trying to grasp air to make it screeching noise, and is currently failing. It's in a rough space. 
TRAVIS: Use your words. 
LAURA: Can I walk up? Oh, unless you were going to. 
SAM: I was just, before you kill it, I was just going to cast Speak with Animals and say: Tell us where the nether lilies are! 
TRAVIS: No! 
LAURA: Marked another one! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (chittering) (screeching) I need you to make a constitution saving throw, all of you. 
TRAVIS: Surely, not me. 
SAM: All of us? 
MATT: Everybody's within 20 feet of it, which is, actually it'd be everybody but you because you fired from the back; everybody else approached. 
TRAVIS: Is this magic? 
TALIESIN: Also, I'll say that at least you two are within 10 feet of me. 
MATT: No, this is technically not magic. 
TALIESIN: So you get a d4 to your save, and you get a d4 to the save. 
LIAM: Oh, I do? 
TALIESIN: Yep. Anybody's within 10 feet of me gets a d4 to the save. 
ASHLEY: Oh fuck. (laughter) 
MATT: Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Seven. 
MATT: Seven, okay. 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: 18. 
LIAM: 13. 
MATT: 13. 
TALIESIN: 23. 
MATT: 23. 
TRAVIS: 12. 
MATT: 12. 
LAURA: She's far away. 
SAM: 11. 
MATT: 11, all right. Both of you are stunned. 
ASHLEY: What a horrid sound. 
MATT: As the screech cuts through your mind and your consciousness like a hot knife, and for a minute your eyes are stinging pain and you have to close and tense your eyelids to try and not be driven mad from this sheer pain in your mind. 
LAURA: Right as it screeches, I want to reach forward and strangle it around the neck and cast Shocking Grasp. 
MATT: All right. Is it s ave on its end? 
LAURA: That is an attack roll. 
MATT: Okay, make an attack roll. 
TALIESIN: Add a d4. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 16 plus 10. 
MATT: That hits, roll damage. 
LAURA: Nine additional lightning points. 
MATT: Nine additional damage, all righty. How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
LAURA: Ooh, I want to strangle it until its neck starts to singe and I'm going to keep squeezing. 
MATT: (snarling) Until its head goes (cracks) from its body. 
MATT: As its neck begins to give away. 
LAURA: My neck cracked as I did that. 
MATT: You feel its body actually begin to crumble away into ash under your grasp, both of your grasps. As it begins to go limp within your hands, it falls into this small smoldering pile before it dissipates into the rest of the surrounding dying forest floor. 
MARISHA: That's right! (claps) 
TALIESIN: Have we pissed anything else off around here? Doing a scan. 
TRAVIS: So enthusiastic. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: She's very capable. 
LIAM: Well, the things just screamed a ton, right? 
LAURA: That's true. 
TRAVIS: That's not news. (chuckling) 
TALIESIN: That's a 15. 
MATT: 15? You do hear another screech in the distance, a screech that heard and is responding. You get the sense that this spot will likely be-- 
TRAVIS: Descended upon? 
MATT: Swarmed or descended upon. 
TRAVIS: Plus, there's a tree on fire, so if we book it, we could get off the X. 
LAURA: Yeah, we should head inside, yeah? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Yeah. 
LAURA: Book it. 
LAURA: (deeply) Yeah. Mm. 
TRAVIS: (gags) (laughter) 
LAURA: Who am I?! 
LIAM: What campaign is this? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (head explosion) 
MATT: Are you going stealthily still? 
LAURA: Quickly. 
SAM: We got to hurry. 
LAURA: Quickly, stealthily. 
LIAM: Yeah, I guess we're going-- We're ditching-- Ah, we can't get both. 
SAM: We hurry. 
MATT: Either you hurry and make a full run, or you're trying to be stealthy while trying not to be seen. 
LAURA: How many trees are on the way to the thing? Or is it flat? 
MATT: There's many trees. 
TRAVIS: Still about a mile? 
MATT: Yeah. It's about a half mile from here, and still a dense forest around. It's your call. 
LAURA: Maybe we sprint. Half mile's not too bad. 
LAURA: Let's run. 
TALIESIN: Hardly nothing. 
MARISHA: We're going to the-- 
LAURA: We can do that so fast. 
MARISHA: The structure? 
MATT: That's just where you guys are heading towards. 
MARISHA: Yeah, okay. 
LAURA: That's if we're running at a easy pace, that's what? A four minute run? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Let's just run. 
SAM: Shifting into second gear. 
TRAVIS: See what good stealthing does. We're booking it. 
ASHLEY: Bob and weave, bob and weave, bob and weave. 
LIAM: Let's go, R2. 
SAM: (fast wheel spinning) 
MATT: All right, a full run. It's cocked. Okay. 
LAURA: (groans) 
MATT: You all begin to bolt as a group through the forest, rushing as best you can. Your feet crashing into the dried leaves and underbrush. Darting through, you hear the screeches continue. Two more follow up from where you heard that one that you had picked up on earlier, Ashton. As you glance back over your shoulder, you can see more of those winged shapes-- (swooshing) heading over in the direction of where you had that recent scuffle in the center of this valley. Weirdly, they roll really bad perception and didn't see you on the way. 
TRAVIS: Hey! 
MATT: After a few moments, you begin to slow your pace, feeling like there isn't an immediate hurry. Still glancing over in that direction, you can hear the squawking sounds and see them circling over that portion where a little bit of a plume of smoke is starting to build up off of the burning tree. You see now, you're about maybe a quarter mile away from this cloven hill scape. 
LAURA: The new structure that's being built in the dented hill scape, the cloven hill scape, what is the shape of the structure? 
MATT: You're a little bit closer now. 
LAURA: Being built, yeah. 
MATT: As you look over-- It looks like a small fort of a surprisingly beautiful build, crafted from light stone and copper colored edges. It looks less like it's being built and more like it's sustained some damage. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Is there scaffolding around the-- Or is it just the structure itself? 
MATT: There's the structure itself and you can see there are a few points along the edges of the cliff where almost like little torch towers, almost like little distant beacon fires could be set. But they're currently alone and cold. 
TRAVIS: That's wild. 
MARISHA: You said it was in the side of the-- 
MATT: In the base side of one of the-- would be the southern side of that hill cliff. 
MARISHA: Roughly how far down? 
MATT: It's at the base of it and the actual cliff-- The closer you get, you can see it's-- It's not like a perfectly smooth side. It looks like erosion over time has settled in and there's a little bit of a rocky base. It's a little more of a casual climb from the center of that crevasse valley. So this cleft happened, probably, a long time ago. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: The structure looks like it's been built more recently. You're uncertain how recently, and then has definitely sustained damage and parts of it look to be crumbled or at least impacted. 
LIAM: It doesn't look Ashari in design, does it? 
MATT: You can make a perception check to see if you can make out any details. 
LIAM: That's low for me. 19. 
MATT: 19. The architecture does not give you the natural aesthetics of the Ashari people. 
TRAVIS: What about the Hishari? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
TRAVIS: That's fair. Now that we're within a quarter mile, is that burning meat smell even more concentrated? 
LIAM: Ooh. 
MATT: It's a bit stronger. 
TRAVIS: Is there any trail of smoke coming up from this structure? Like something that's actively burning? 
MATT: You see a couple of small plumes that emerge from within the base portions of it. 
TRAVIS: Barbecue's getting real strong. 
MARISHA: You said it was pungent. Is it like, "Ooh, what a nice sirloin!" or like that smells like-- 
SAM: Burning hair, yeah. 
MARISHA: -- people. Yeah, burning hair. 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Great. Great. 
SAM: We're still missing some Ashari people, right? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Who again? Do we remember who? There's a few people. 
LIAM: One of my sisters. 
TALIESIN: Bernie? 
SAM: Is that Bernie? 
TALIESIN: Bernie. 
LIAM: Baernie. 
TALIESIN: Baernie. That's right. 
SAM: Baernie? 
MARISHA: Baernie. 
SAM: Then some other-- Just sort of scout Ashari? 
LIAM: Yeah, they said a handful of people came out. 
MATT: Yeah, a group of volunteers. 
LAURA: Some of them might've been who we fought. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Some of them made it further. They could potentially be in there if they were taken prisoner or something. 
TRAVIS: We should hurry. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I can take five of us if we want to jump and Feather Fall. Two of you can get down on your own. 
LIAM: Am I remembering that right? Was it Baernie who was sent out? 
MATT: Baernie, indeed. 
LAURA: Wait, it's down? I thought it was-- 
MATT: You all are far enough away where you're just on the outskirts of where the hill begins to rise up from the direction you're traveling. You can barely see the edge of where the structure is towards the center of the crevasse that's visible from your current perspective. You can't get quite a good look. You can just make out the outskirts. 
MARISHA: We're at the bottom? 
SAM: So we either walk in or we can go up and drop down. 
MATT: Yeah, whatever direction or path you wish to take. 
MARISHA: I thought we were on the cliff, looking down, but not necessarily. 
MATT: That is a path you can take, but you're also-- Currently, where you're walking now is more in line with the ground floor of where the crevasse opens. 
MARISHA: I got you. Okay. 
MATT: Otherwise, you wouldn't even be able to see it from where you were standing, it would be within. 
MARISHA: I see. Okay, great. 
MATT: Anyone here have-- are proficient in history? 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: Actually-- 
MATT: Go ahead and roll history for me. 
TRAVIS: I have an ability. This is new. Grim-- Grim-- 
MATT: Grim Psychometry. 
TRAVIS: Psychometry. "When making an intelligence history check to recall information about the sinister or tragic history of an object you're touching or the current location," I have advantage on the roll? 
MATT: Okay, so-- 
TRAVIS: Could I do it as well? 
MATT: Yeah, go for it. 
TRAVIS: I don't know what else I'll fucking-- 
MATT: Roll history check with advantage. 
TRAVIS: Natural 20! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: For a 23. 
MARISHA: Hey! 
LIAM: 25. 
MATT: 25. Great. You-- 
TRAVIS: Hey, feature. 
MATT: -- recognize this site in your general knowledge of Tal'Dorei and learning through history and being mindful of different places of worrying dark power. You never thought it would cross your path before, but you recall not long ago on this site, a structure was built called the Iridon Bastion. It was an extension of a Platinum Dragon temple that was built in the center of this space to place sentinel over the Abyssal powers that suffuse the Grey Valley. More or less, it was designated as an early warning system for any sort of Abyssal incursions. It was intended to be a-- For the mindset of those who were beneath the Platinum Dragon, not the best place your piety could assign you, but nevertheless, an important site for being mindful of a region such as this. So seeing it actively in disrepair is a little concerning. You, glancing past this and tapping into the hemocraft magic that you've been expanding through experience, your vision goes from the ashen whites and grays, the colorless hues of this landscape, to a filter of deep blood crimson, like you're witnessing this through a red stained glass window. There upon this side, you can see the structure where it once fully stood not long ago. You see signs of people walking along the walls. You see perimeters being walked. You hear screams echoing, shouts. Bursts of flame and dark energy. You watch as one of the towers crumbles and falls in, caught in a half-toppled state against one of the other larger platforms. One by one, the screams are snuffed. Not more than a few days ago. (gasping) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: (swooshing) Your vision comes back to its familiar coloration. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit, I just had a trippy-- 
SAM: You're drooling. 
TRAVIS: -- thing, yeah. Sorry. This is new. Like days old. There were people here, some kind of battle or contest. 
SAM: You said it was Platinum Dragon? 
TALIESIN: Platinum Dragon. 
SAM: That's a god, right? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yes, it is. 
TALIESIN: Pretty well known one. 
LAURA: So-- Without them, the Platinum Dragon may be-- 
SAM: Or without the magic that was-- 
LAURA: Helping to defend this place. 
SAM: Yeah, maybe. 
LIAM: They were keeping a threat at bay and-- 
MARISHA: Right, and now-- 
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at it. 
LAURA: This doesn't seem like something we can beat if an entire army of Platinum Dragon soldiers got taken out by these things. 
SAM: We don't need to beat it, we just need to get in and get the panty petunias and get out of there. 
LAURA: Goddamn it. 
LIAM: We don't know that they're in there. 
TRAVIS: Alliteration, it should be worth two. 
MARISHA: I agree. 
LIAM: This isn't about chrysanthebums, okay? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We are fucking dead. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Nice knowing you. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That was a good one. 
SAM: But you're right. We're just here for flowers. But if this is god stuff, shouldn't we at least take a look? 
LAURA: We should and if your sister's in there, then we definitely should. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's entirely possible everybody involved is long gone by now. 
LAURA: How many places like this exist across Exandria, where the gods block access for fiendish entities to enter this realm? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
LIAM: More than one. 
SAM: I'm searching my memory banks for an answer. 
MATT: Roll a religion check. 
SAM: Okay! That's 12. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: I don't know. 
MATT: Probably a few. 
SAM: Probably a few! 
LIAM: Does my 25 tell me if this was a one of a kind site, or one of multiple? 
SAM: Ooh, I get advantage. 
MATT: From what you would understand, there are many sites throughout Exandria-- 
SAM: Five! 
MATT: -- that are designated towards where the boundaries are thin. The Ashari looks over the elemental boundaries. There are other fortresses built at places where outer planes of different types of challenges and dangers occasionally push through. So this isn't a unique spot, necessarily. 
LIAM: Multiverse is porous. 
TRAVIS: Get in there. Let's do this. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: We should be sneaky once we get in there, though. No more bashing in. 
LIAM: I always forget because I never had it. How long does Pass Without A Trace last? 
ASHLEY: It lasts for an hour, but because I got stunned-- 
SAM: Oh yeah, does it wear off? 
ASHLEY: It might disappear since that was a constitution-- 
ASHLEY: That was a concentration-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Saving throw, though. Constitution saving throw. 
MATT: Right, you didn't take any damage. The stun just prevented you from acting, but it didn't break the spell. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So technically-- 
SAM: Nothing prevents her from acting. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: So technically it's still up. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, yes. 
MATT: So yeah, you would still have it up because it wasn't that long of a journey. So if you guys make one more group stealth check. 
ASHLEY: I still got it up. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Still got it. 
TALIESIN: See if we can have-- 
LAURA: Oh wah-ha-ha-ha-ha. 
TRAVIS: ("The Sickness") Ooh wah-ah-ah-ah! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's not like her. 
LIAM: Rerolling a one. 
SAM: Cocked. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
SAM: Terrible. 
LAURA: I assume I don't have this 18 AC. 
TRAVIS: 39. 
MATT: 39. 
LIAM: No, that was one moment. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MARISHA: 25. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: 16. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: 26. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: 22. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: 33. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Natural 20. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MATT: For a total of? 
TALIESIN: For a total of 27. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 37. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Da-damn. 
TRAVIS: (quiet exhale) 
MATT: As you begin to embrace the soft parts of the dried crumbly underbrush, you have now gotten a better sense of how to move through here without making as much noise. You also find the bits of your clothing or outfits that also blend in with the monochrome landscape and lean into those being the ones that face the sky. Are you approaching from the ground floor or from the above part of the crevasse? 
MARISHA: I think we said ground. 
LAURA: Yeah, just because-- 
MARISHA: Ground makes sense. 
LAURA: It seems weird to go up-- 
LIAM: So we got a crevasse-- 
LAURA: -- the hill to drop down. 
LIAM: That's down here, right? You said? Okay. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Is it just one entrance or does it look like there's some way to sneak in that's not just the front door? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Well, I mean there's the entrance of the valley where that comes into the center of where this split hill is. You assume there's another side to it somewhere that you don't see. 
LAURA: But probably-- 
TALIESIN: It's also fucked up enough I'm sure there's lots of points of entry at this point. 
LAURA: Yeah, with it being so fucked up, yeah. 
TRAVIS: If somebody can drop in, it might be smart for one or two people to go up high so they can see in. 
SAM: SWAT team style. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Repel down, smash in through the window. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
LAURA: It's a big fort. I don't want to be separated from everyone, but yeah. 
SAM: We should use our numbers to our advantage, though. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: But if you want to go with Laudna, I would understand. 
MARISHA: I feel like-- 
TRAVIS: You want to stick together or what? 
LAURA: I mean, she's got Feather Fall. She can help a couple people out. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Do you want to half and half it? 
TALIESIN: Let's just make sure that there's some muscle with both ends of this. 
LAURA: This is why we're splitting up, oh god. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Just-- okay. 
TRAVIS: I'll go with you, if you want. I'm still-- (growls) 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: I'll go up. 
MARISHA: I'll go up then. 
TRAVIS: I'll stay down. 
LAURA: I'll go up. 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: I'll stay down. I'll stay down. 
TALIESIN: I'll go up, I guess. 
SAM: I'm staying down. 
MARISHA: Great. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: All right. So. You are splitting off into two different groups. 
LIAM: Which means the up team is scrambling up the side? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: We're going up the hill. 
MATT: So up top is the two of you. 
LAURA: And-- 
MATT: Laudna. 
LAURA: Laudna and-- 
SAM: Ash. 
MARISHA: Ashton. 
LIAM: Two sorcerers and the two melee fighters. 
MATT: Then you are team down below. 
TRAVIS: Team fucking awesome. 
SAM: We're down low. Down low daisies. 
TRAVIS: On the DL. 
LAURA: But he's still a wolf. 
MARISHA: Team on the up and up. 
MATT: Right, because you're still in your wolf form. 
TRAVIS: (growls) 
MATT: All right, is Mister out? 
ASHLEY: (swooshing) Yeah. 
MATT: (monkey chitters) 
MARISHA: I'm going to keep Pâté with-- Team down low. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: So I can check in on them if need be. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Pâté was with Chetney so I'll keep Pâté with Chet. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, over here. 
MATT: Sounds good. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: "Ooh." (laughter) 
TALIESIN: "Oh. Right." 
MARISHA: Together, they're just the worst noises. (laughter) 
SAM and TALIESIN: "(growl)" 
MATT: (panting) 
LIAM: There goes Tim The Tool Man. (laughter) 
LIAM: (grunts) 
MATT: So. Pressing on towards, we'll say-- We'll go with the climbing crew first, heading up to the top of the crevasse. Stealthing through, the brush gets thinner as you get towards the edge of the cliff and the trees stop about 15 or so feet from the edge of the cliff line. So you're going to have to take a little bit of a brief leap of faith to expose whoever's going to glance over and take a moment to peer it. 
LIAM: I'm super short. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. You creep up to the edge and glance down from above and it's about, maybe, no higher than about 100 feet at the top of this hill from where the base of the crevasse is. It's not a massive ravine or anything, it's just where this hill has been split and the fall is shear at the top, but it tends to level off and become a crag decline until it reaches the bottom and there's only about, maybe 30 or 40 feet across before the other side of this cleft hill climbs back up on the other end and you get a better view of the structure. It is a small fortress. It isn't a massive thing built. It is definitely an outpost, if you will. Make a perception check for me. 
LIAM: That's 20. 
MATT: 20. Glancing down at the site, it definitely looks like the aftermath of some terrible battle. There are blood smears spread across parts of exposed stone. You can see torn limbs strewn about in places, left across the region. Remnants of the guardians of this bastion used them as decoration. Placed on pikes on the jagged rocks as trophies or signs. You can see small impish demons gnawing on or playing with leftover bits of rotting viscera. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: Many of the stone walls have been pushed inward or have fallen. There is still one large portion of this that still stands. But elements of the exterior, ancillary structures, have been partially or completely destroyed. Looks like much furniture, interior parts of the structure of the bastion have been pulled out. There are a few rough roof sections of the still standing stronghold, looks like there's been piles of materials set upon there. There are a number of dark figures that wander around this makeshift, what I can only describe as a demon encampment. 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
MATT: That is now, for the time being, set itself in the corpse of this once bastion of good. 
MARISHA: I am going to get into Pâté's head-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Say: Oh, Pâté. Let them know it doesn't look good. We see lots of dead bodies and dancing imps. 
MATT: "There's a lot of dancing bodies and dead imps." 
MARISHA: No, reverse it! 
MATT: "Sorry. It's real bad. There's dead bodies and dancing imps." 
MARISHA: Yeah, good boy! 
MATT: "Yeah, no worries." You get a glance, with a 20, which isn't bad, and they're not trying to hide themselves. You do also see tall demon warriors, about three of them with massive two-handed swords and blades sheathed on their back wings. Some are keeping watch and looking around. You can see one is currently pulling and dragging materials over to a section. You see there are some metal cages set here. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (sigh) 
MATT: Three that you can make out set on two different of the structure's roofs and one in the center of the rubble. You can gather they hold humanoid captives currently. 
MARISHA: (groans) Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: You watch as one of these larger fiends saunters up to one of the cages and grabs it and shakes it with a (growls). You hear a couple of yelps from the inside. "(menacing laugh)" Releases it and goes walking. You can see there is what looks to be a piece of broken stone, like a platform in the center of the space where a large glowing circle about 15 feet across has infernal looking runes in it that pulse and glow. You can see other lines being drawn by some of these smaller impish creatures that are carving across the ground, drawing points. You can see there's one other one of these circles partially drawn by two of these weird impish creatures on the top of the center rooftop. They're building something, preparing something. 
TRAVIS: (scoffing) Oh. 
MARISHA: Great. 
LAURA: (nervous stammering) How far down did you say it was? 
MATT: From where you are up top, to the full bottom it's about 100 feet, but it is at a slight decline. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LAURA: And the fortress itself, how big is it? 
MATT: The standing part of it? It's probably about 60 feet tall at the highest part of the roof, maybe about 30 or 40 feet across from the width of it, or the base of the still-standing structure. There are other parts-- 
LAURA: It's 30 to 40 feet in that courtyard area that they all are? 
MATT: Yeah, but the area where they are, which is even further from where that is, probably another 80 or so feet out from there. 
LIAM: How big a drop from our location to the roof? 
MATT: To the roof? The roof is on the other side. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So it would be an arc or a glide to try and get there. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. The courtyard is how big across? Can we get a general idea of how-- 
MATT: I can just show you the layout. 
LAURA: Yes! 
SAM: Ooh! 
TRAVIS and LIAM: Yeah! 
MATT: Since you have-- 
MARISHA: Drop that map! 
MATT: You have successfully stealthed your way into the outskirts of this, so you have the opportunity to look out and plan. 
TRAVIS: Yes! Let's go! 
LIAM: Give me the map, give me the map. 
SAM: This preview of what could happen-- 
MARISHA: Give me that map. Give me that map. 
SAM: -- is brought to you by WizKids, maybe? 
LIAM: Give me that, give me that, give me that map. 
SAM: It says at the start of combat. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
SAM: But this is the map! 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
SAM: The Tomb Takers are out for blood, literally. This dark and mysterious group is now available for pre-order. Find them and many more Critical Role miniatures at WizKids.io/CRMinis-- 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh my gosh! 
TRAVIS: Fucking hell dude! 
SAM: -- and your local game store. 
TRAVIS: Get out of here, bro! 
SAM: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
LAURA: Yes! Oh god! 
MATT: Some of these impish entities are in the process of repair-- 
TRAVIS: (maniacal laugh) 
MATT: -- with this one here. 
LAURA: Repair? 
TRAVIS: There's a chain hanging! There's a chain hanging! 
LIAM: There's chains! 
SAM: Are those-- 
MARISHA: There's what hanging? 
TRAVIS: (squeals) A chain! 
SAM: There's chains. 
MARISHA: A chain? 
SAM: Marisha, are those-- 
MARISHA: Oh sure, there's a chain. 
SAM: -- your necklaces that he chopped up or something? 
LAURA: Wow! 
MARISHA: You know, I can't confirm nor deny. 
TALIESIN: That's how far it is. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see that. 
SAM: What the fuck is that? 
MARISHA: Oh! What is that? 
LAURA: That's those pit-- 
LIAM: That's the motherfucker! 
LAURA: Are those pit fiends? What are those? Just big-- 
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no. I don't think so. I don't fucking know. 
LIAM: They're Abyssal. 
SAM: (lisped) Abyssal. 
LIAM: Jerks! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay. Scary. 
TALIESIN: All right. All right. 
MARISHA: Big 'byssal bitches! 
LAURA: Are they fiends or demons? Devils? 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Matt. 
MATT: From what you've heard referring to this space, demon has been used quite a bit. 
LAURA: Demons. Demons. 
SAM: Okay. Okay. 
LAURA: There's a big one up top. Where are we in relation to this? 
MATT: You are up on the other side of a cliff up here. 
LAURA: We're up here? 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Where is the ground crew? 
MATT: The ground crew would be over, coming in from this side of the valley, if you were to enter. 
LIAM: Three cages. One on the tower, one on the rock, and one down-- 
ASHLEY: Where's the third one? 
SAM: I don't see it. 
LIAM: Down by the stairs. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: By that other green meanie. 
TRAVIS: By the chest. 
TALIESIN: Wouldn't it be amazing if we could get those cages open? 
SAM: I see it. I see it. 
MATT: Orym. You see another shadow approach. Aerial. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MARISHA: Ah! 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: Small wings, comparatively. But this corpulent humanoid figure seems to lurch and glide with an awkward movement until it hits the center of the space. You see about 13 or so feet tall, this dark furred humanoid demon creature with massive, long, clawed arms, these little, furry wings that set upon its back. Its jaw is wide like a mimic of a horrible ape-like grimace with massive tusks and teeth that pour out of the center of its long, distended, wide jaw that wobbles as it walks forward. 
LAURA: What the fuck? 
TRAVIS: (snaps) 
MATT: These little tiny legs that curl up from underneath that look like they shouldn't be able to sustain its weight as it shifts oddly as it steps. 
TRAVIS: I've always wanted to see one. 
MATT: As it looks around, "(linguistic snarls)" it starts barking orders, and you watch as it draws this blade, this beautiful silver-looking-- 
LAURA: No! 
SAM: Aw! 
MATT: -- weapon with a crossguard that looks too small for its grasp. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (gasp) 
MARISHA: It stole it! 
MATT: As it points and barks orders around, the other demons seem to look towards it and nod and it goes about its business. 
LAURA: Does anybody speak-- 
SAM: Oh, oh, oh! 
LAURA: Ah! 
TRAVIS: Oh! He's bigger than I thought he would be! 
LAURA: No! What?! It's so big! 
TRAVIS: He's fucking terrible! (screams) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) Travis. No! 
TRAVIS: This is great! 
MARISHA: I'm assuming they'd be speaking Abyssal? 
TALIESIN: Cool. Cool, cool cool. Cool, cool. 
MARISHA: I can speak Shadow Cant, which-- 
TRAVIS: They're speaking Staten Island. 
MATT: Which? 
MARISHA: -- hasn't been relevant ever. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's why they call it Shadow Cant. (laughter) 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Shadow Cant. (laughter) 
MATT: Does anybody here speak Abyssal? 
TALIESIN: No. 
SAM: Not yet, but maybe when we get closer, I can cast Tongues. 
LAURA: Pick it up. 
SAM: I mean, are we close enough to hear their talk? 
LAURA: Are you guys? 
MATT: You aren't close enough to hear any specifics of language at the moment. You can hear occasional barks and shouting, (growls) but nobody really can make out any of the specific language. 
SAM: I mean, I'll cast Tongues on myself, so I can hear what they're saying. 
MATT: If you want to. Okay. 
SAM: Sure, if I'm close enough to hear things. 
MATT: Well, you've also managed to stealth pretty well as you all carefully dodging from rock to rock. 
ASHLEY: We're down low? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: I'm down low with you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Three cages, maybe more of them inside the castle. 
ASHLEY: I can speak Infernal. 
TALIESIN: We can't actually see. 
LAURA: Yeah, I don't know. 
ASHLEY: It's probably Abyssal. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he said Abyssal. 
TALIESIN: Cages are possible allies, maybe they're fighters. 
MARISHA: Pâté can speak Infernal. 
LIAM: We've been soaking in the view from our perch for a minute or so. Are they Ashari in the cages? Do I recognize Baernie or others from home? 
MATT: Unfortunately, you're not close enough to make out the details. You'd have to get closer. 
LIAM: Got you. Got you. 
SAM: Am I picking up any words or commands that might help us in our planning? 
MATT: You hear the large one bark a couple of things in Abyssal out to others. Phrases you make out are, "Hurry." 
LAURA: (whispers) Hurry. 
MATT: "I must feast soon." 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: (gasps) Oh god! 
MATT: "Prepare, then celebrate." 
MARISHA: So they're trying to-- 
SAM: Fearne! 
MARISHA: -- summon something? 
SAM: They're going to cook somebody right now! 
MARISHA: Cook somebody? 
TRAVIS: Can we ask, you said they were drawing runes and lines and circles. 
LAURA: Like here, there? 
MATT: There's one there that looks complete. There's one that's being drawn up here at the moment. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: We've got a little down here. 
LAURA: It's just a barbecue. 
LIAM: Two littles up here. 
LAURA: They're setting up a barbecue. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You might've said this-- 
LIAM: Three mediums. 
TRAVIS: -- which side of the crevasse are y'all on? This side? 
MATT: They're on this side, over there. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Towards-- 
MATT: They had to come down-- 
LIAM: So we're over here? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: On foot, we are coming from--? 
MATT: This direction. 
TRAVIS: Okay. From Marisha, from right here. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Ugh! 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Ugh! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: That's what you need at the end of the day. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: This guy. 
SAM: So we got to move quick! How do we-- 
LAURA: Yeah, we got to move! 
MATT: The guard stop and starts rattling the cage. (snarls) 
LAURA: (groans) 
LIAM: We better agree on something pretty quick because something's about to happen here. 
MARISHA: Wait, can we still send messages? I know we couldn't do it from far away. 
LAURA: We can send messages, I think, up close. Yes, I did it. 
SAM: How far away are we from them? 
LAURA: I did it to our group. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: They're 100 feet? 
LAURA: So you should let them know-- 
LIAM: That's believable. 
MATT: If you progress a little further in, you can maybe get within 150 feet of them. 
SAM: Okay. Oh yeah. Message is 120. So we'll try to get within. 
MARISHA: I can still communicate through Pâté. 
LAURA: Yeah. I mean, I can do a thing that affects-- 
SAM: Can Pâté talk to you? 
MARISHA: I communicate telepathically with Pâté and then Pâté is with you guys, so he can-- 
SAM: But if I tell Pâté something, can he tell you? 
MARISHA: I can hear it because I'm looking through his eyes. 
SAM: Oh! Well, then I'll say: Pâté. Pâté, they're going to eat somebody real soon! They just said that. So we got to move like now in the next 30 seconds! 
MATT: You hear that through his senses. 
MARISHA: Apparently, FCG could understand that they're going to eat some people. They're going to have a little feast. 
LAURA: So we have to attack them. 
LIAM: How are we getting down there? 
MARISHA: They said there's a lot of guys! I feel like we need a distraction or try and take them out one by one? 
LAURA: (exhales) Yeah, you're right. 
MARISHA: If we attack all at once, that's going to be bad, right? 
SAM: Fearne, what's our plan? 
LAURA: Big distraction? I don't have a big distraction. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: These little guys are drawing. Is this little guy drawing, that was there? Oh no, he moved. 
MATT: He moved over. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: If we got them all to run towards us, maybe the group from above could swoop in and undo some of the cages. So what if we make a big racket? 
ASHLEY: A big racket? 
SAM: Then get at least some of them to come towards us? 
TRAVIS: Sure! 
ASHLEY: What do we see? What do we see? 
MATT: Who's taking point from your perspective? To keep eyes out 
SAM: Do you mean on Perception-ing? 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: Which one of y'all is good at seeing? 
SAM: I'm listening. 
ASHLEY: I got pretty good-- 
LAURA: You got good perception. 
ASHLEY: -- pretty good perception. 
LAURA: Yeah, you should check it out. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to check it out. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Guide yourself. 
SAM: Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
SAM: See with the light of the Changebringer. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: I'll cast Guidance on her. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Ooh! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: All right. That's not bad. 28. 
MATT: 28. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: From the inside, you do notice, amongst the strewn about bits of the previous holders of this stronghold, there are also signs of that blackened ash that was left behind from the demons you encountered previously. This wasn't a one-sided battle, meaning that there was a lot lost on their side, too, though the victory eventually came to them. You can see them figuring out, there are a couple of straggler demons that are wandering the areas, keeping eyes out, and some of the winged creatures that are in the distance, they're cruising by. Fearne, what you do notice is one of them that's walking along, it has its blade out and it's like (snarls) walking along one of the upper cliff, rocky sections of this hill, away from the rest and (huffs) acts like it hears something and turns away to its left hand side. It storms over to the edge of this little alcove. 
ASHLEY: To the edge where they are? 
MATT: Of an alcove on this part of the cliff. 
ASHLEY: Is that the side that they're on, up top? 
TRAVIS: No, they're over here. 
ASHLEY: Oh, they're over here. So it's nowhere near us? 
SAM: Wait, what's it doing? 
ASHLEY: The part that he hears? 
MATT: It's walking over this direction. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: He's going in. No, no. It's not at us. He's looking at something. 
TRAVIS: But there's more than we see on the map. 
SAM: But maybe we go take him out. 
TRAVIS: That's what he's saying. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Let's go take him out. 
LIAM: The crevasse wall, there's no way, because I can't see it, there's no way to go along the edge, like this, to get closer or-- 
MATT: You'd have to get across the other side to do that. I mean, if you want to go all the way around, you could try and enter the other side of this, but you'd have-- 
LIAM: That'd be a long walk? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: We can see this tower from where we are? 
MARISHA: I mean, because she's-- Imogen's-- 
LAURA: Right? 
MATT: From where you are, you can see down into this, yeah. 
LAURA: I mean-- 
MATT: Fearne. 
LAURA: -- I can just try. 
MATT: This other demon entity that's walking along, one of the sentries peeks into the side. You watch a hand grab and pull it into the shadow-- 
LAURA: (gasps) Somebody's helping us! 
MATT: -- and, silently, you see a flash of flame inside and you see for a second, as it tries to leap out, it gets pulled back in. 
SAM: What? 
MATT: Then, isn't there anymore. 
LAURA: Wait, what? 
MARISHA: Maybe it's more Platinum Dragon people. 
LAURA: Or the Ashari! 
SAM: Or it's the rift from the abyss that other creatures are coming out? 
TRAVIS: That was up on this part or in that-- 
MATT: Up in this area of the cliff side. 
LAURA: That took one of the imps out? 
TRAVIS: Who's here? 
LAURA: Or that big thing? 
MATT: It took one of the mid-range, not quite as large as these, but one of the other sentries that was walking along. 
ASHLEY: It looked like it was trying to get out of the alcove, but got-- 
MATT: Got pulled back in. 
LAURA: So something pulled it in? 
MARISHA: If he used Flame-- 
TRAVIS: How far is your-- 
SAM: Detect Thoughts? 
LAURA: Detect Thoughts. 
SAM: Mine is-- 
LAURA: It's not super far. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. Never mind. 
MARISHA: Isn't Platinum Dragon fire stuff? Right? 
SAM: 30 feet. 
LAURA: It's 30 feet. I could double the distance, but that's still not very good. 
MATT: Now, Fearne, you rolled a 28. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I did. 
MATT: A moment passes and you see a figure begin to emerge from that dark bit of shadow, hiding along the rock. You see a humanoid, not larger than any of the largest of your crew, but you see this deep, red skin, you see a mane of gray, like a lion mane of hair that meets with a beard, and these handle bar horns that curve at the front, a cloak of dark black and tattered velvet, and folded, leathery wings on its back as it leans against the rock and peers over in the direction of the fortress. 
SAM: What? Demon that's on our side? 
LAURA: Do you recognize it? 
TRAVIS: That's awesome! 
ASHLEY: Did-did-did you see that? 
SAM: No, no! I'm listening to them talk! 
LAURA: We should help out! 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: While they're doing that! 
LIAM: One of the demons just got yanked into an alcove, and then this red human figure-- 
TRAVIS: Awesome! Awesome! 
SAM: I'll tell Pâté. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I grab Pâté. 
SAM: I'll tell Pâté. Yeah, tell Pâté what-- 
ASHLEY: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! We just saw, we just saw. Look at me! Look at me! 
MATT: "What's going on? What is it?" 
ASHLEY: Oh, you can't look at me. You don't have any eyeballs yet. Okay. 
MATT: "No. I'm in your direction, though." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Tell Laudna and everybody else that there is something that's kind of helping us, that looks like a demon also. 
SAM: A good demon? 
ASHLEY: A good demon? A good demon. It looks like a little bit of a lion, has gray hair, was interesting looking. I think we have help. 
LAURA: Can we see it from our vantage point? 
MATT: You do not. 
LAURA: Oh, interesting! 
MARISHA: Okay, I relay the message. Apparently, Fearne was-- 
MATT: Actually, make a perception check, if you'd like to. 
MARISHA: Fearne was shaking Pâté. 
SAM: Should we make a distraction, get people over to us? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: What? 
LAURA: 16? 
MATT: Nope. 
SAM: Blow something up? 
TRAVIS: Well, I can go invisible afterwards-- 
LAURA: It was really good for me. 
MATT: That was, yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Well done! 
MARISHA: I relay the message. 
LAURA: Okay, go like this. 
MARISHA: Good guy. What do I have? Spit? 
LAURA: Just a little drool. 
MARISHA: That's gross! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: You were really into-- 
TRAVIS: We could just ask for help. 
MARISHA: I was really into it. 
LAURA: I feel like we need to act! We need to jump in and give him an opportunity-- 
SAM: Talk to the Ashley. She's really good at it. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Okay, what are we-- 
ASHLEY: (sarcastic laugh) 
LAURA: Wait, what are we doing? 
MARISHA: Are we distracting? 
LAURA: Are we going? Are we trying? 
TRAVIS: We're going to create a distraction. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: And draw them out. 
MARISHA: Should we try and go drop down to the cages? 
SAM: You're good at distracting! Do something distracting! 
LIAM: Can you get the four of us down? Because we're S-O-L. 
MARISHA: I can get the four of you down. If we can try and aim for the cages, that'd be awesome. 
LAURA: The minute we actually make the jump that we go to do this, I'm going to try to hit that top tower. 
MARISHA: With a boom boom? 
LAURA: With a-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ With a boom boom boom ♪ 
LAURA: I don't know if it'll make any noise. 
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: ♪ Say way-oh, way-oh ♪ 
LAURA: It'll be like a psychic sphere. It's not like a Fireball. So it might not make any noise to anyone that's not around that. I'm not sure. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: I've never done this before. 
MARISHA: I can also drop some Fireballs, but that is definitely very loud. 
SAM: While we're talking, I'm going to Sympathetically Bond myself to these two. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Boom boom boom ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Let me hear you say way-oh ♪ 
LIAM: You'll have to aim-- 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
LIAM: Aim really carefully amongst the friendlies down there. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: ♪ (mouth tuba-ing) ♪ 
LAURA: That's why I'm trying to focus on that area. 
SAM: All right, all right. We got to go! 
LAURA: Let's go! 
SAM: They're going to kill and eat somebody. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait. Where are we going? 
SAM: We're just going to make a distraction, blow something up or break something or set something off. 
LIAM: Laudy, you're gliding us? 
TRAVIS: Act like a damsel. Act like a damsel in distress. 
MARISHA: We're going to jump and then I'm going to cast Feather Fall. 
SAM: Shake your tail feathers! 
TRAVIS: I'll act like I'm attacking you. 
ASHLEY: Help! 
TRAVIS: (growls) 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MATT: So you shout, "Help!" 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: (growls) 
ASHLEY: Help! 
MATT: You hear Fearne start shouting, "Help!" 
SAM: Oh, Fearne's shouting, "Help!" and he's attacking her. 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: At this point-- 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: All the entities, all at once, (whooshes) turn in that direction. 
LAURA: Ooh, I hit them before they move on the top. 
MATT: Okay, what are you hitting them with? 
LAURA: I'm doubling my distance with a sorcery point. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to hit the top tower, avoiding the cage with a Synaptic Static. 
SAM: What is that? 
MATT: Woo! 
LAURA: It is a 20-foot sphere. 
LIAM: Cool shit! 
MATT: 20-foot sphere, you could definitely get-- 
ASHLEY: What?! 
MATT: -- all of them in it without catching the cage. 
LAURA: Great. So that is a intelligence save for all of them. 
MATT: Intelligence save for all of them, okay. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
TRAVIS: What was the distraction for? 
SAM: Yeah, now they just know where we are. 
LAURA: I know! Well, I was trying to say that. 
MARISHA: They looked up at us, I don't know. 
ASHLEY: We made a boo-boo. 
TRAVIS: You want them there. 
SAM: Oh well! (laughs) 
LAURA: I wanted those ones to stay there so I could hit them in a bubble. 
SAM: Ah. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
MATT: That is-- 
TRAVIS: Do it! 
MATT: An eight on the big guy. On the two smaller ones (laughs). Yeah, they all fail. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: They just totally fail. 
LAURA: Then they all take 8d6 psychic damage. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
SAM: Damn! 
LAURA: They all have muddled thoughts for a minute. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LAURA: During that time, it rolls a d6, and subtracts that number rolled from its attack and its ability checks. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: That's great. 
LAURA: As well as its constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: Okay, I'll put this one-- 
TALIESIN: (whistles) 
MARISHA: Dang! 
MATT: All right, roll damage for that. 
LAURA: Ah. 
LIAM: Does that have an auditory effect, or was that a silent attack? 
MARISHA: It was a silent? 
MATT: This does not make any noise. It is just internal and mental. 
SAM: The folks on the ground might not even know what happened. 
TALIESIN: They don't know shit. 
SAM: That's great! We're working as a team. 
LAURA: Okay. 10. And 19. 26. 33 points of psychic damage to all of them. 
MATT: All righty. (goopy impacts) Both of their heads splatter. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Just (wet splatters) The bodies (shunk) and then sift into black ash-like sludge. The one here (groans), begins to scratch at its eyes for a second before falling to one knee and blinks out about, looking confused, and looking for whatever struck it while the rest of them below, the larger central leader. "(speaking in Abyssal)" You hear it saying, "Go, whoever that is, bring it back." These figures begin to walk. 
LAURA: Oh my. 
MATT: Fly over. 
TALIESIN: And we're taking our leap? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Let's take our leap. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Takin' our leap! ♪ 
MATT: This one leaps over into the center space. 
TRAVIS: Jesus! 
MATT: And begins to glance over in the direction, like-- 
TRAVIS: That is scary. 
MARISHA: It is terrifying! 
MATT: As it lands, you watch its central form, this massive belly that it holds, and its fur shakes a bit, and you see its legs have to set its hooves to hold itself in place. It seems more comfortable in the air than the ground. It is a wide, frustratingly grotesque entity.
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: Are we doing this? 
TALIESIN: We're going. 
LAURA: You get down and try to get this person out of the cage up here. 
MARISHA: As we run and we're about to bolt off the cliff, I'm going to do my Transformation of Dread, and for a second, I'm going to get on all fours, almost like my hound. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: As I jettison myself off the cliff. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: And right-- 
LIAM: As you prepare, Orym backs up like 15 feet, and gets into a little sprinter's position aimed at the edge, and I wait for your go. 
MARISHA: Go! 
LIAM: Okay. Then he starts sprinting. 
TALIESIN: We're going! 
LIAM: I'm going to do a long jump. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Just out into nothing, and I'm hoping on a wing and prayer. 
LAURA: You were like. 
MATT: (patters) Leap. As you coast off the edge in a large arc, using your leaping capabilities to try and make the distance, make an acrobatics check for me. 
LIAM: Is the Feather Fall coming? 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: She said distractedly. 
SAM: That's a confidence. 
TALIESIN: Hm? 
LIAM: Oh, that's a 25. 
MARISHA: I want to see your arc. 
LIAM: I don't know, it's invisible! 25, I rolled a 25. 
MATT: 25. You dart off at a wide arc, and you think you probably won't make it at the distance you're running. You're going to hit hard. 
LIAM: Yeah. Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, no. Feather Fall. But I just-- I wanted to make sure he gets his full arc before casting it. 
LAURA: So that it falls at that arc? 
MARISHA: Yeah, 100%. 
MATT: Yeah, I understand. Okay. You're doing this stealthily? 
LIAM: I mean, I didn't yell, "Cannonball!" 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "Bombs away!" 
MATT: So you keep-- 
LIAM: I'm not saying anything. 
MATT: You throw out the Feather Fall. 
MATT: We're all jumping. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're-- 
MATT: You're all-- 
MARISHA: We're all jumping. 
LAURA: I think we ran along the edge a little bit before we leapt off, because we can't get as much an arc as him. 
MATT: Got you. So all of you run up and off the edge. 
MARISHA: We're trying to get to the cages. 
MATT: Right. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Just for the heck of it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: ♪ Just for the heck of it ♪ 
MATT: The four of you roll a stealth check for me. This is to attempt to not make a large commotion in leaping off the edge and knocking rocks down that begin to tumble below and make noise. That is-- 
LIAM: Is Pass without a Trace still a thing? 
LAURA: Nah, and we're not within the range of-- 
LIAM: Got to be close? 
MATT: Well. 
LAURA: Of Fearne. 
MATT: Let me see. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. Really? 
LAURA: Did you get a one? 
TALIESIN: Of course. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: No, again? 
TALIESIN: Again. 
MATT: All right, so what'd you get? 
TALIESIN: I got a one. 
MATT: A one, okay. 
LIAM: 22. 
MATT: 22. 
LAURA: 19. 
MATT: 19, okay. 
MARISHA: 20. 
MATT: 20. 
MARISHA: This is not without Pass Without Trace, right? 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: Correct. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. You hit a section of the edge, Ashton. Your foot kicks a stone that tumbles down. As it cracks down, you all leap in the air, and as many of your peaks end prematurely, but then the spell catches and you begin to glide, still at a rapid pace, to the point where it's a little nerve-wracking at how fast it's coming at you, but not enough to the point where you're going to break an ankle if you land. Have the others of you make acrobatics checks for me as well. The stone does tumble down and you see the large creature look over in the direction where the stone comes to rest. (stone thuds) And steps forward for a second and looks up at the edge of the cliff, but you've all arced over just high enough-- 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: -- that it misses looking past you as you all begin to head down towards the top of that. Yeah, you-- 
LIAM: Orym-- 
MATT: You already rolled your acrobatics. 
LIAM: As he's flying, though, he throws Gust down, and once I feel her magic kicking in to try to prolong it further, and I'm going to use Seedling to shoot a vine out towards the upper lip of that tower. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. Which pulls you, and you land at the top of the tower without issue. 
MARISHA: Nice! 
MATT: The rest of you, acrobatics? 
MARISHA: Acrobatics? 
MATT: It's not a high DC, thankfully. 
TALIESIN: Eight. 
MATT: That's not great. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
MARISHA: Um. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Rolling real bad. 
MARISHA: 10 total. 
LAURA: 17. 10 is the base DC you needed. 
LAURA: Woof. 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: So both. With that. Laudna and Imogen dart down, catching the top of the cage and landing. Ashton, and you gliding down just out of range. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to click that little thing on my hammer right there. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Well, actually, a little higher. 
MATT: Little higher? 
TALIESIN: Just so I can still get a little bit of a leap. 
MATT: All right. The rest of you watch as Ashton glides down, misses the lip, and then just stops in the middle of the air. The hammer itself just held in place. 
LAURA: Oh, sick! 
MARISHA: Put the Immovable Rod in your hammer? 
TALIESIN: Fuck yes. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Sick. 
LAURA: (laughs) That's awesome. 
LIAM: That's sick. 
MARISHA: That's fun. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's really fun. 
LIAM: That's fucking sick. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt-- Clearly, I'm a little higher up, obviously. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt, if possible, I assume that Feather Fall is still on me because I haven't landed? 
MATT: Let me look at basis. 
TALIESIN: I'm curious. 
MATT: It lasts for one minute. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going to attempt to-- 
MATT: And you haven't landed, so. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt to throw myself and click, basically in one smooth motion, try and get another leap going. 
MATT: Almost like. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Trying to (groans) lift up and unclick? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Make an athletics check for me. 
TALIESIN: All right. Come on, roll better, I believe in you. Hey, there we go! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: 24. 
MATT: 24. 
TALIESIN: There you go! 
MATT: You pull back once, twice, takes some momentum and then kick up, arc up, miss it for a second, and then land down on the top of the tower without issue. 
LIAM: (Inigo) "Who are you?" 
SAM: Their team's great. 
LIAM: "Who are you? I must know." 
MARISHA: Wow. (laughter) 
SAM: I hope we're going to be okay. 
LIAM: (Westley) "Get used to disappointment." (laughter) 
MATT: Meanwhile. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: Heh! That's how it done, fuckers. 
MATT: As you're shouting, "Help," and you are-- 
SAM: Menacing her. 
TRAVIS: (growls) 
ASHLEY: Um, help, oh no! The two flying entities-- 
ASHLEY: It hurts! 
MARISHA: Oh, the-- 
MATT: -- go into a full flying arc. One of them blade out. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Another one leaps out with its claw towards you. 
SAM: As soon as they-- 
MATT: They don't even say anything. 
SAM: As soon as they show themselves or get within range, may I cast Command at one of them? 
MATT: You may. 
SAM: All right. Because I speak their language, or at least they can understand me because Tongues still is going. I will shout, (roars) at them, which, as we all know, in Abyssal, or whatever language we're speaking, is the command: Mime. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Mime? (laughs) "Mime" at the demons?! 
SAM: Mime! 
TALIESIN: The worst part is its going to be Infernal mime, which is somehow worse. 
MATT: Abyssal, technically. 
TALIESIN: Abyssal. Abyssal mime. 
MATT: Yeah, a wisdom save for both of them. 
SAM: Wait, I can cast it at two different people? 
MATT: Oh. 
SAM: I thought I-- 
MATT: You can affect an additional creature at 2nd-level. Sorry, I misunderstood. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: If it's just one. 
SAM: Oh, I didn't know I could do that. Then I'll cast it at 2nd-level and target both of them. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: It's a wisdom 15. 
MATT: Wisdom 15. It's cocked. Natural one. And (laughs) natural two! 
SAM: Hey! 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: They're not open and strong on this one. Both of them flying forward, they both land. Look at each other. One of them goes. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: They're stuck in a box! 
MATT: The other one goes. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh yes! 
SAM: It's windy! 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
SAM: It's real windy! 
TRAVIS: Yes! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's solid. 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Uh-oh, no. 
SAM: Let's go with it! Do we attack them or do we run? What do we do? 
ASHLEY: Should we try to go into that alcove? 
MATT: You got one round, this lasts. 
SAM: We got six seconds! 
LAURA: Oh, you better do something with them! 
ASHLEY: We should go in that alcove then go find that person? 
SAM: Maybe we should. Should we just leave these guys and go? 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
SAM: We're going to go. 
TRAVIS: I love it. 
SAM: We're just going to run. 
MATT: Run towards everything? 
SAM: I guess? 
TRAVIS: No, I think we're going to run up towards the alcove and try to make our way up towards the demon guy that got pulled into the thing? 
TALIESIN: Cool, cool, we're in the middle of everything, that's cool. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: We could try to kill them real quick. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: No, let's go. 
MATT: So you go rushing up at the side, in which turns into a climb. So I'm going to need athletics checks from three of you as you're now attempting to climb up the side of this hill-- 
SAM: Maybe one of us should go to the alcove. 
MATT: -- to get to the alcove. 
SAM: The other two should kill these guys. 
ASHLEY: Yep, yep. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You want to do that? 
ASHLEY: Yep, yep. 
TRAVIS: I'll stay. 
LAURA: No, you will die. That's two of them against you. 
TRAVIS: Please. I'll stay. 
ASHLEY: I'll go, I'll go to the alcove. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You have a well-oiled machine and an Erector Set. 
TRAVIS: Go with Fearne, yeah. 
SAM: I'll go with Fearne. 
TRAVIS: I can turn invisible. It's fine. 
SAM: Okay, I'll go with Fearne. 
TRAVIS: If shit goes downhill. 
SAM: We're going to go. And I'll stay. 
SAM: We're going to go. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: This is so dumb. 
MATT: The two of you go rushing up to the alcove. Athletics checks from both of you. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: While Chetney, you stayed there. Are you still only partially transformed? 
TRAVIS: No, I got everything out. 
MATT: All right, you're full wolf now. 
TRAVIS: But I'll take the scythe out and utter the magic word for Turmoil. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: 14 to see if I can get up the hill. 
ASHLEY: Wait, did you say athletics or acrobatics? 
MATT: Athletics. 
ASHLEY: Shit. Okay. (laughs) That would be a 13. 
MATT: A 13, okay. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: It's not a challenging incline, but it's definitely going to slow you down a little bit. You both start climbing up, slipping, as some stones fall from underneath your weight. You get about halfway up the alcove. 
ASHLEY: It's a little hard with hooves. 
MATT: So you have like one more round before you can get to where it is when the spell wears off. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: As you're both partway up the side of the cliff, keeping an eye out, you can see the shapes of your friends darting and gliding across the cavern. You continue to climb up the wall, look past, just as both these creatures, one of them that is now in the process of doing some good scene work of washing dishes. (laughter) 
MATT: Stops. (laughter) 
MATT: The other one looks at it again, and they both glare back at you. 
TRAVIS: Oh, was that six seconds over? I was going to make an attack! 
LAURA: Yeah, it's that fast. 
TRAVIS: Yeah? Okay. 
LAURA: Can you attack before they stop miming? 
MATT: They both pull their blades that they had laid out. They both reach down because they dropped their blades to mime. They pick up their blades. 
LAURA: Attack them, attack them, attack them! 
MATT: They're about to dart straight towards you as we go to break. (exclaiming) 
MATT: It's about that time. So we'll be back here in a few minutes with what will be initiative because we are now engaged. (groaning) 
MATT: Pick it up from there. We'll see you here in a few minutes. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

I'm here with you. Now, open your eyes. (gentle whimsical music) (gentle whimsical fades) (squirrel squeaking) (dramatic music crescendos) You must, you are the chosen one. (dramatic music fades) (mysterious music) 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. (gasp) Could anything be more perfect? The cuteness! It's overpowering. Can you put donuts in this? Only one way to find out. You need this? You probably need this. Roll an investigation if you want. It's basically perfect. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
(adventurous music) 
Are you saving the world or are you hurting it? We were told they were dangerous, otherworldly horrors. Their faces looked perfectly human. We don't have to be defined by our past. It’s the actions in the hardest times, what we choose to do, that's what defines us. You know, the thing about people that leave us, they can always see what we do. Remember that. Time isn’t running out for you, not while I'm on watch. Don’t close your eyes this time. I want you to see everything. I won't. 
(Ominous Music) 
Hi. We're the narrators of Midst. What's Midst? It's very simple. It's a weird surrealist fourth wall breaking reality bending science, fantasy space western about a small, doomed planet floating in a cosmic ocean of spooky darkness. Upon whose alien landscape an ensemble cast of characters, including a crotchety outlaw, a freakishly virtuous cultist and a weird, diabolical bastard, make awful decisions and fight like hell to survive when the moon falls out of the sky and a large number of terrible things happened in rapid succession. It's exciting, it's funny, it's scary. It's got neat sound, weird music, amazing visuals, and every episode comes with bonus content you can read and examine. Midst is performed solely by yours truly. As the three of us narrate all the action, play all of the characters, and bend a lot of the rules about how telling stories is normally supposed to work. Midst is pretty fun, very strange, and it feels like VR for your brain. We believe you'll enjoy it. Or maybe you won't, but there's really only one way to find out. You're going to have to listen to Midst.

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Let's all roll initiative. (clamoring) 
SAM: (party horn) 
LIAM: You always go with the classics, Marisha. 
MARISHA: You know, I'm tired. (laughs) 
LIAM: Solid choice. 
TRAVIS: Matt, on that previous six seconds-- 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: -- in addition to getting the scythe out, can I say that I took the dodge action? 
LAURA: Good or bad? 
LAURA: Is it really good? Is it high? 
MARISHA: It's a 20. 
MATT: Yeah, we can say you took the dodge, because you didn't do anything else for that turn. 
LIAM: First is scarier. 
MARISHA: I didn't want this. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. So, 25 to 20. 
MARISHA: 22. 
LIAM: 24. 
LAURA: Woo! Woo! 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MATT: All right! 
LAURA: All right, all right, all right. 
ASHLEY: 21. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
SAM: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
ASHLEY: So it's-- 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Orym, Laudna, Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Orym, Laudna, Fearne. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: So there's two people on that gate. 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
LAURA: 17. 
SAM: 18. 
LAURA: Oh? 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, two people on that gate? Wait, what, who's with-- 
SAM: You don't know that. You don't know that. 
TRAVIS: FCG, 
TRAVIS: Imogen, Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Orym, Laudna, Fearne. FCG, Imogen, Fearne. 
LIAM: Well, she's standing right in front of it. 
SAM: You don't know-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: -- where she's standing. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: 15 to 10? 
TRAVIS: 14! 
TALIESIN: 13. 
SAM: Whoa, we all did really good with the Rollies. 
LAURA: Not bad. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: And that's how they are. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh shit. 
LAURA: What? 
ASHLEY: No, just, what are we doing? (laughter) 
SAM: "What happened? Nothing, we just sucked." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Yeah, here comes the poo rumbles ♪ (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I just realized what we did. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Oh yeah ♪ 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: He just ran over there. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: We just left Chet. 
MATT: As they both have their blades at the ready and Chetney sits there ready to try and avoid their assault, we're at the top of the round. Orym, you're up first. 
LIAM: Oh man. 
LAURA: What is this number? 
LIAM: All right, I'm going to start running, pitter patting along the wall, and I'm going to be making a leap for green guy down below, but as I go, what do I see in the cage? 
MATT: In the cage, you see two figures. One looks to be a female soldier of some kind, most of her armor gone, she's wearing the underneath gambion of the armor, cuts to the face, arms bound, and she's looking at you desperately. To the right of them, you see a small gnome figure, themself bruised and beaten, also chained, who is wearing tattered Tempest Blade garb and armor. 
LIAM: Okay. (sighs) Then I'm going to make eye contact with them, but not say anything. Get a running jump, and then land here, and I am going to flip in the air and land and stab this thing in the back. 
MATT: Go for it. Make an acrobatics check for me. 
LIAM: Okay. That is a 17. 
MATT: 17, no worries. You land and then come right down with the blade as quickly as you can upon the still befuddled demon creature that stands before you, very tall before you. 
LIAM: Yep. Slashing down its back as I go. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LIAM: That is a 27 to hit. 
MATT: 27 definitely hits. 
LIAM: Yeah, okay. So these are just little probing hits. I'm not pulling out the big guns yet. That's a nine. These come as I spiral slash down, so I immediately come for the second slash. 
MATT: Full on the Levi spiral slash, I love it. 
LIAM: I probably don't hit with the second, which is a 15. 
MATT: 15 does hit. 
LIAM: Woo! 
MATT: He's a big figure. 
LIAM: Ah, okay, so it'll go down his backside abyssal ass as I land on the ground, and that is-- 
TRAVIS: Back stab his ass. 
LIAM: -- also nine. 
MATT: All right, so nine and nine damage? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So total of 18. All right. Both blade strikes carve into the back. (groans and snarls) Then he takes a step forward. (heavy footfalls) He looks back. 
LIAM: I'm actually going to roll through his legs, so that I'm in his eyesight, and just: 'Sup? And that's the end. 
MATT: Roll through up to this point. 
LAURA: How much did you just do, 18? 
LIAM: Just 18. 
LAURA: To the big guy? He had taken 30-something before that? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: I don't think so. I won't know. 
MATT: Takes the hit. (groans) Looks back, and makes eye contact with you, You see as he makes eye contact with you, you see the piercing red coloration of the eyes. But they both cross for a moment, and he has to shake his head. 
LIAM: Oh, he's still a little confuse-y. 
MATT: He's still a little brain numbed from what Imogen struck him with earlier. 
LIAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, that's it, I'm done! 
MATT: All right? All right. Finishing your go, Laudna, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
MARISHA: What does this gate look like? Does it have a lock on the door? How can I get this gate open, this cage? 
MATT: As you're looking at the front of it, you can see there is a door opening to it. These cages are not fiendish in nature. They were probably built for the bastion and then have been co-opted once it's been occupied. So there is a locking mechanism on it, a big iron lock that is clasped. 
MARISHA: I'm going to try and pick the lock. I've got lock picking tools. 
MATT: Got lock picking? Go for it. All right. 
MARISHA: That's-- 
MATT: Go ahead and make-- Are you proficient with lock picks? 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: So make a dexterity check for me. 
MARISHA: Just straight dex. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Okay. (sighs) Okay. Natural 20! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LIAM: Ah! 
MATT: No shit! 
MARISHA: It's a little cocked, but this is-- 
TRAVIS: Is it? Is it? 
MARISHA: It's barely-- 
MATT: Nah, nah, not really. 
SAM: Silvery Barbs. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. (laughter) 
MATT: Thank you, Sam. How's it feel? 
MARISHA: It was just leaning a little bit. It's tired like me. Oh, natural 20! 
MATT: Natural 20 for a total of? 
MARISHA: Oh, 22! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: 22. (laughs) 
LAURA: Wow. 
LIAM: Oh wow. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: How about more than plus two? 
TALIESIN: We're there. We're there. 
MATT: You get down-- 
LAURA: Give Marisha some coffee! 
MATT: You pull out your lock picks. 
MARISHA: I had some. 
MATT: It's a large lock, and you can see the two figures are looking at you, spooked. They look terrified. As you approach in your full Form of Dread-- 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, I'm in full Form of Dread. 
MATT: As you clamber down the side of the cage, and up to the edge of it, they're both-- (cowering) 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. (laughs) 
MARISHA: I'm a good guy! I'm good, I'm good! 
TRAVIS: I'm going to eat your guts! 
MARISHA: (raspy breaths) (laughter) 
MATT: You get down quickly, picking the lock, and you catch some of the tumblers, but there's the last one you can't quite get, and you realize there's just not enough space for your long bony finger. 
MARISHA: No! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: Then you get up close, and then, tink! (clicks) 
MARISHA: Yes! 
MATT: (hinge squeaks) It unlocks and you pull the latch off. 
MARISHA: Great! 
MATT: The door isn't open, but it's unlocked. That's your full turn to do that. 
LAURA: Sweet. 
MARISHA: So it's unlocked, it's not open. Okay, that's my turn. 
MATT: Correct. All right. After Laudna, Fearne, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: (snaps fingers) 
ASHLEY: Going to continue climbing up. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Oh look, he extended it out! 
ASHLEY: Am I getting close to the alcove? 
MATT: You do. You get up to the alcove right there. As you glance inside, the figure that you saw earlier, it was not at the edge of the cave, it is not visible. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: You just see these eyes up here in the darkness that glow, and a voice goes, "Who are you?" 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: I am a friend. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I am a friendly. I am not with these people that are down here, and I do have another friend with me, but we're friendlies. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Friends of the devil? (laughs) Demon. 
ASHLEY: Okay. That would be... Shit, sorry. No way. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: 19 plus 11. That's 30? 
LAURA: 30? 
ASHLEY: 30. 
MATT: Ooh! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The doubt, the doubt. 
ASHLEY: That's not-- 
TRAVIS: Can't be right. The doubt. 
MATT: I'm like-- 
LAURA: "Is that good?" 
MATT: I'm like, hmm, it's going to be not an easy DC. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MATT: Never mind. We're all right. 
TALIESIN: Hard to judge you. 
LIAM: (as devil) "You are adorable." 
MATT: The entity steps forward a little bit into the light and says, "We are no friends, but for now, we are not enemies." And you hear the scraping sound-- 
ASHLEY: I'll take it. 
MATT: -- as he drags his blade across the stone behind and he puts his hand out to push past your shoulder. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: That's my-- 
LIAM: Fucking devil man! That's our friend down here-- 
SAM: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: That's with the two. So if you could help us-- 
TRAVIS: No! No! 
MARISHA: Oh, he is a demon dude! 
LAURA: Oh what?! He's so cool! 
TALIESIN: Half demon. 
MATT: Using the Obann model because it's the closest I could find to what I wanted. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh, it is Obann! 
MATT: But imagine a massive lion's mane of grayish hair that mixes with the long, heavy beard, and these horns that stick out like handlebars, almost. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
LIAM: Is he the other camp? Is he a devil? Is he a devil man? 
TALIESIN: Hot boy Dune'. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: He doesn't like these guys? 
MARISHA: Devils versus demons. 
LIAM: Devils don't like demons and demons don't like devils because it's rules versus anarchy! 
SAM: I've never understood the difference! 
TRAVIS: Abyssal and the Hells! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Then as a bonus action, I'm going to have-- 
TRAVIS: Vampires don't like werewolves. 
ASHLEY: -- Mister throw some flaming shit at the two that are in front of Chetney. 
MATT: All right. Mister would probably be over here on the precipice here. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: (monkey shrieks) (whooshing shit pellets) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So he's going to attack the one that's closest? 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: That would be a 25. 
MATT: 25 definitely hits! Roll damage for Mister. 
ASHLEY: All right! (contemplative bumbling) Okay. 
TRAVIS: (harrumphing) 
ASHLEY: It's cocked. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Okay. Six points of damage. 
MATT: Six points of what damage? 
ASHLEY: Damage. (bumbling) Fire damage. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, fire. Fire. 
MATT: Oh, fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Got it. So, the flaming poop (impacts). It burns, and does a bit of damage, but you see it shrugs it off with a-- (annoyed grunt). Knocks it off the front of its slightly blackened left pec before it turns around at Mister. Both of them are focused on Chetney, and then one looks back at Mister, and looks back at you, and notices where the two of you have run up off the side of the cliff. So one's still focused on Chetney, one's taken stock of where the two of you are. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, so you used your action to persuade this entity-- 
TRAVIS: Nice! 
MATT: -- to consider you, for at the time being, an ally. 
MARISHA: Dope, dope, dope, dope. 
TRAVIS: A non-enemy. 
LAURA: No, it's stinky, it smelled like a-- 
MATT: Finishing your go, Fearne, it brings up to FCG, with Imogen on deck. 
SAM: I'll give a quick nod to the devil, demon guy, the handsome fellow. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Just to show him that I mean him no harm. And I will bonus action. I'm going to use my-- I'm bonded to Chetney, so I'm going to give him a Bonded Blessing, is that what it's called? 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
SAM: Yeah, Bonded Blessing, so you get a d6 on any roll this round. 
TRAVIS: Nice! 
MARISHA: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
SAM: Ah, I get a little stress for that, but it's okay, I'll take it. Then I will start rolling around counterclockwise if I can get over there, yeah-ish. As I roll, I will cast, I can do this, right? Yeah, I will cast, not Toll the Dead, but Scramble the Dead! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: At the one that the poo monkey already hit. 
MATT: Okay, you got it, so it's (whooshes). 
SAM: So I'll project at it, mentally, the AOL loading sound, you know-- 
MATT: (AOL loading sound) 
SAM: I'm trying to fuck with its brain with computer noises. 
MATT: Sure. 
SAM: Let's see if I hit. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: One. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Aw! 
MATT: Is it a roll to hit, or is it saving throw? 
SAM: It's a wisdom saving throw! 15, I don't have to roll. 
MATT: That's a nine. 
SAM: Hey, nine fails! So 2d12 because he's already-- 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: -- injured. Six, 12, 18! 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: 18 points of necrotic damage? 
SAM: Necrotic. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Is he okay, does he take it? 
LIAM: They hear the sound that a fax makes when it connects. 
MATT: You see with, actually, he was holding the blade in this hand, so its other hand it puts in its head, and it's like (pained groans). It looks like it definitely hit it for a hurt. Now it looks directly towards you. 
SAM: (gasps) It wasn't me, it was the devil guy! 
TRAVIS: "It wasn't me." 
MATT: All righty, does that finish your turn? 
SAM: Yep. 
MARISHA: ♪ In the shower ♪ 
MATT: Finishing your go, FCG, Imogen, you're up. 
TRAVIS: ♪ It wasn't me! ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ Banging on the sofa ♪ 
LAURA: I don't know. No, I'm going to do it. Okay, where I'm standing, I'm going to hold my hands out and (grimaces), and as I do, rocks around me from the rubble and the ruins start to rise up, and it's going to rise up, and start circling around my head. 
TRAVIS: Whoa, ooh, whoa! 
LAURA: And I'm going to cast Minúte Meteors. 
MATT: Oh, nice, okay. 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: What? 
SAM: Minúte Meteors? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Shut your-- 
MARISHA: Ba baby meteors! 
SAM: Are you sure it's not Mínute Meteors? 
LIAM: Mínute Meteors, yeah. 
LAURA: Mínute Meteors. 
LIAM: They take a minute to make. 
LAURA: They do, you know? They're mini meteors-- 
MATT: I like minúte better. 
LAURA: But they last, I like Minúte Meteors, they're tiny! 
MATT: Because they are also tiny meteors. 
LIAM: Of course. 
LAURA: I thought that's why it said that's minúte. 
MATT: Look, she's the caster, she can name it what she wants. Minúte Meteors it is. 
SAM: Minúte Meteors. 
LAURA: I'm going to shoot one at the one that Orym's fighting. 
MATT: Right there? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: You see it's currently trying to, it has its blade now at the ready, and it's getting ready to try and swing at Orym, but it's also a little bit off-kilter. Its brain's still a little jostled from your strike earlier. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
MATT: As you gather the stones, they spin at a rapid sound almost causing that faint sound of wind, around your head, as you focus, and lob one towards the entity. Is that an attack roll or a saving throw at this point? 
LAURA: It has a dexterity save. 
MATT: Dexterity saving throw. Natural one. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: They're rolling like dog shit at the beginning of this encounter. 
LIAM: That's definitely not an area, right, on the-- 
LAURA: Then it takes, it's within five feet of the point, so I would do it on his back-- 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: -- if he's big, yeah. 
MATT: So as it strikes and explodes the blast of flame, is it flame, or is it a bludgeon-- 
LAURA: It's a flame, fire damage. Got it, so roll damage on that. 
LAURA: So that's nine points of fire damage. 
MATT: Okay. (impacts) It singes the back of it, it shrugs it off a little bit, but still takes the hit. 
LAURA: Mm. 
SAM: Fire. 
LAURA: Fire. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Fire bad. 
LAURA: I'm going to send a second one at his back. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I can fire two of them. 
MATT: You get two, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so another save on his point. That's going to be a 16. 
LAURA: Fails. 
MATT: Fails. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LAURA: Eight points. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: All right. Total of nine points of fire damage to it from both strikes. (impact) You're almost forcing him to dance. You're shooting at the ground, it's like (impacts) "(groans)." It's glancing up at you now, making a note that there's more beyond just the tiny man that struck its back. 
LAURA: Okay, well, he's also muddled still. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Don't worry. 
LAURA: I feel like Orym is watching this Ruidusborn sorceress throw small red moons. 
LAURA: (laughs) That's fun. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) Are you going to stay put, Imogen? 
LAURA: Can I hop down? I don't want to die. Is it possible to get down to the tower without dying? 
MATT: Yeah, you can leap, that's not too big of a leap. 
LAURA: Would I be passing within his range of motion if I tried to-- 
MATT: At that height? No, but he can fly. 
LAURA: Okay, if I tried to keep going past him, would it put me-- 
MATT: Pass him this way? 
LAURA: Yeah, would he-- 
MATT: You would likely be within his weapon range. 
LAURA: Okay, then I'll stay where I am. 
MATT: Okay. Finishing your go, Imogen, the winged entity over here that walks past Fearne glances over, and sees the one that's looking over towards FCG. 
LIAM: Can you cast a spell-- 
MATT: Drags out its blade, and you can see it's this massive curved looking saber that has these barbed hooks on the front and this blackened metal glance about it. As he pulls it out, you watch as it glows with a strangely bright light that hovers along the blade edge, as the wings, expand, and it goes into a dart, full-on flight. (whooshes) 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: Down to that creature, and (whooshes) arcs upward with its blade-- 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: In attempt to strike it. 
MARISHA: So hot. 
MATT: That's going to be-- Ooh! 
TRAVIS: What is that sword? 
MATT: That's good. That's going to be a 24 to hit. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
MATT: Let's see. Yeah. Oh, no, sorry, I looked at the wrong number. That is a 26 to hit. 
LAURA: (cackles) 
MATT: Another attack for-- 
TRAVIS: We need to communicate-- 
MATT: -- same one. 
TRAVIS: -- that person is on our team. 
MATT: All righty, so. 
TRAVIS: To the rest of them. 
LAURA: Hmm? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: That is going to be. 
SAM: Fearne might want to tell the rest of us that-- 
MATT: 13 points. 
LAURA: He's a good guy? 
SAM: Well, you guys, at least-- 
MATT: Sorry, he rolled 10 plus 10. 
MARISHA: You all know-- 
MATT: 23 points of-- 
SAM: Actually, no, we-- 
MATT: -- slashing and radiant damage. 
LAURA: It is Minúte Meteors, you fuck. 
SAM: I didn't know! 
MATT: Plus four, 27 points of damage total from that strike. 
TRAVIS: 27 on one strike. 
MARISHA: Pâté is with Chetney still. 
MATT: The other strike. 
SAM: Yeah, but we communicated though-- 
TRAVIS: Just slashing damage, or any other kind? 
MATT: Slashing, and then radiant, and fire. 
TRAVIS: Radiant and fire? 
MATT: Yeah, the fire was reduced, but-- 
TRAVIS: Hey. 
LIAM: We're funny. 
LAURA: That's a new one-- 
TRAVIS: Slashing, radiant, and fire damage from that dude's sword. 
TALIESIN: Hot. 
SAM: Is that all from the same strike? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: 33 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: On the second one?! 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Wait, how much? 
TRAVIS: That's 60 points of damage in two slashes! Yeah, from that sword. 
LAURA: Whoa, I'm glad he's not attacking us. 
SAM: Should we just leave? 
MARISHA: Yeah, (laughs). Does he need us? 
MATT: You know what? Actually, he's going to expend a 2nd-level slot to Divine Smite that-- 
ALL: Oh! 
MARISHA: He's a paladin! 
LIAM: He's a devil pally! 
MARISHA: Devil pally. 
SAM: Oh, but a bad paladin. 
MATT: For three, and because it is a fiend, it's an additional d8, so, on top of that, it's another-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, actually. 
LAURA: Yeah, because he's a devil. 
MATT: 13. 
SAM: Or a demon? 
LAURA: He's a devil. 
MATT: For another 24 points of radiant damage-- 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: -- on top of that. 
LAURA: Devils come-- 
MATT: So, he-- 
TRAVIS: 84 points of damage?! 
MATT: Yeah, the entity that it struck on the side, the large winged beast that takes the hits, it (impacts). As it strikes across the second blow of its blade around to the center, it actually carves through half of its wing, and where it cuts through, the light seems to leave, and linger for a second in the wound before it fades, and flames burst out it for a second. The creature, (snarls) turns around, and looks at it. (growls) It's wiping some of the dark blood from its mouth, it looks hurt. 
TRAVIS: After 84 points, yeah. 
MATT: It's furious and it looks at the other one, and gives a whistle, and turns back towards to focus on this. The one that's focused on you now is distracted in who it's going to go after, but that's going to finish the winged creature's turn. Chetney, you're up, with Ashton on deck. 
SAM: So, he dealt 84 points of damage to the one that we had already damaged? 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: And he's still okay? 
MATT: He's hurt. 
LAURA: Ruh-oh. 
SAM: Whoa. So, a hundred-- 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
SAM: At least a hundred plus points of-- 
LAURA: Rut-roh-- 
TRAVIS: So my turn is before both of these guys, right? 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: This is the one that took all the heat? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: This is the one that took all the beating. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
LIAM: He's talking about this one. 
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action to cast Blood Curse of Bloated Agony at the one that didn't take all the smack. 
ASHLEY: What, who's that? 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: He has disadvantage on strength and dex checks, 1d8 necrotic if he takes more than one attack on his turn. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: I will run up, and take two swipes with-- 
MATT: All right, you rush up, and take-- 
TRAVIS: -- Turmoil. 
MATT: Go for it, first strike with Turmoil. 
TRAVIS: Now, it's a natural 19, that's a 29. 
MATT: 29 hits. 
TRAVIS: The second one, that's a natural 18 for 28. 
MATT: Yep, that's it. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Amazing ♪ 
LAURA: Yeah, I know. 
TRAVIS: d6... Three, four. 
TALIESIN: Thank god. 
TRAVIS: Hmm? 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: 13 plus Turmoil does 1d8 thunder damage. Yup. 
TALIESIN: They're making-- 
TRAVIS: 16 points of damage, three of that is thunder. 
MATT: Three of that is thunder? All righty. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I forgot to, and three points of Crimson Rite shit, so, 19 total. 
MATT: What kind of damage from the Crimson Rite? 
TRAVIS: Fire. 
MATT: Fire, okay. 
TRAVIS: Unfortunately. 
MATT: It's okay. Done with that. All right. 
TRAVIS: Second one. 
MATT: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: As you rush up with Turmoil, and carve upward with your first strike of the blade, the scythe carves through its upper torso. As it splits open-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- black demonic blood sprays out, and seems to dissipate into just black smoke in the air before it impacts much around. As it crumbles into ash and falls to the ground-- 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: -- spilling. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: One down. 
LAURA: Nice! (oohing) 
LAURA: Nice. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: He only had 140 points of-- 
TRAVIS: Can I take that second, after that first swipe and just-- 
MATT: Yep, you still have-- 
TRAVIS: -- redirect it towards-- 
MATT: -- enough movement to move in, and do the second strike, which does still hit him, so. 
LAURA: So you were attacking the one that he had already attacked? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes. Four, five. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Okay. (inaudible) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: 13, 19 points of damage, six of which is thunder. 
MATT: Got you. 
TRAVIS: Again, just the three for the fire. 
MATT: Understood. 
TRAVIS: Which is probably meh. 
MATT: (laughs) It's meh, one point of damage. 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: (impacts) (grunts) 
TRAVIS: (sizzles) 
MATT: (snarls) All right, that-- 
TRAVIS: I'll use any other movement just to stay in his melee, but just slide around. 
MATT: You got it, you have-- 
TRAVIS: Give the old wolf nod-- 
MATT: There you go. 
TRAVIS: -- towards the guy with the wings. (deeply) Where is-- hi-- (snarls) 
MATT: (hoots) Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Huh, hoo. 
MATT: Finishing your go? 
TRAVIS: It does. 
MATT: Ashton, you're up. 
TALIESIN: Just taking a quick peek in the cage. Are they bound by the hands, or are they-- 
MATT: Yes, they're both bound by their hands. 
TALIESIN: They're both bound by the hands? All right, I'm just going to make an offhand. They're still locked up, let's deal with that at some point. I'm going to take a, I'm going to rage, and I'm going to head down, and get right behind that winged motherfucker. 
TRAVIS: You're going to rage? 
MATT: All right-- 
LIAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Make an acrobatics check to try and land without taking any damage. 
TALIESIN: Hmm? 
LIAM: That's what I was going to-- they're manacled in the cage, is that what you got? 
TALIESIN: Yep, yep. 
LAURA: Manacles or tied? 
MATT: It looks like, so, they're not manacles, it's probably, I think, rope or chain. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: But you haven't looked too directly, but you would probably see, it's probably a heavy chain that's been bound, and sealed with heat. 
TALIESIN: Acrobatics check? 
LIAM: Son of a bitch. 
TALIESIN: Do I get to use Probability on that? 
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: Use it-- 
TALIESIN: That's a acrobatics or athletics? 
MATT: Acrobatics. 
TALIESIN: Motherfucker, that's five. 
MATT: Five, all right, that's fine, you still land. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: With a heavy hit. Take six points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to three because you're raging. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, boo. I'm going to get in a nice little position behind this fucker, so that we are both on either side, and I'm just going to take my first swipe with my sparkly rainbow fucking hammer. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: Right at that cut that happened on the back, I'm just going to try and open that up. I have advantage because you're wonderful. 
LIAM: I'm waving my sword at his dick! 
MATT, LAURA, and ASHLEY: (muffled laugh) 
TALIESIN: All right. That's 11, 12, 13, plus a whole bunch of, yeah, that's a 23 to hit. 
MATT: 23 definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: Oh, let's do some damage. (thinking noises) 
SAM: Oy. What can I do? What can I do? 
LIAM: I can't see my halfling-- 
TALIESIN: Remembering how to do this. 
LIAM: -- over the tower. 
MATT: It's right over here. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice. 
LIAM: It's right over here. 
MATT: He's so tiny. 
TALIESIN: 11. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: 11, oh, that's 23 points with the first hit. 
MATT: Nice. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
TALIESIN: (gun cocks) (impacts) Right across the back, and-- 
MARISHA: Kill it. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: Kill it! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another hit, and I'm just going to try, and get that pommel right in that space-- 
MATT: All right, go for it. 
TALIESIN: That's opened up on the back. That's 14, 16, 26 to hit. 
MATT: All right, roll damage. 
TALIESIN: That's 18 points of damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: (impacts) 
MATT: (impacts) (snarls) (grunts) So, it's now between both, it looks over its shoulder towards you, and now sees that it's being assaulted from above, and also seeing you with the stones. It's also looking to the two other figures that aren't there around you, (laughs) as it's still little dazed. Does that finish-- 
LAURA: At the end of its turn, it gets to make a saving throw to see if it-- 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: And that's the end of my turn. 
MATT: All righty, finishing the end of your turn. Finally, we get to the rest of-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, they're at the-- 
MATT: They all rolled, like I said, dog shit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Really low initiative. First up, we have the main figure in the center, who's now seen the scenario around. Those of you, actually, yeah, its range here, yeah, 120 feet. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Whoa. 
MATT: All of you feel in your mind, a voice go, "Ah, welcome, glad you could join the feast." 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: Then you hear it begin to grunt outward. "(snarls)" You understand it as saying, "Gut them if you wish, but they taste better while they're wiggling." 
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus. (laughs) 
MATT: And is going to-- 
TRAVIS: What is that thing called, by the way? 
MATT: Huh? 
LIAM: Donkey Kong. 
TRAVIS: What is that creature called? I've seen it in-- 
MATT: Well, as a player? 
TRAVIS: Nah, that's all right-- 
MATT: Because you wouldn't know, you've not encountered this entity. But it's going to turn, and its tiny-- 
LIAM: That's a sword, right? Did you say that's a sword? 
MATT: Yeah, it has a sword in one of its hands. As it spins around, and looks up at the top of the mount. At first, it's looking past this way, and was seeing this battle in the distance. Then it hears all this commotion up top, turns and sees that there's an attack closer to home. Grins, chuckles. Its outline of its body shimmers. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: And it vanishes. (yelling) 
MARISHA: It can fucking disappear. 
LAURA: Oh no! (screaming) 
TRAVIS: (yells) (shouts) Run! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (shouts) Fly down! (laughter) 
LAURA: (screams) Let's jump down! 
MATT: Just. 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
MATT: The two figures that are in the cage give a short screech, and crouch down as the cage itself bows and creaks, the metal-- (groaning) 
MATT: -- bending under the weight of this entity as it, on top. 
LAURA: Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: He's a big boy! 
LAURA: (grumbles) 
MATT: (growling) 
LIAM: Right on top of our casters! 
MATT: It pulls its blade out with the beautiful crosshilt, this beautiful, platinum- looking blade in its grasp. I mean, that's its action-- 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: -- to teleport. But it is there. Finishing its go. The front door to the standing structure, kicks open, and the stonework presses a bit as another one of these figures-- 
SAM: No! 
MATT: -- muscles its way from the inside of the structure. 
LIAM: Another one? 
ASHLEY and LAURA: No! 
MATT: And looks around. 
LIAM: Oh! 
SAM: He was just in there taking a shit. 
MATT: Doesn't see anything. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: But hears commotion over there, (laughs) and just, not extremely intelligent, is going to fly over those boats, a few feet there. Then, seeing the commotion over here, it's going to fly over, and head over to the front of FCG. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM and LAURA: Did it break? 
ASHLEY: It's fine-- 
LIAM: What'd you break? 
ASHLEY: This is fine. 
MATT: Anyway-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: -- that one, that's his full double action to get there. This one's going to stay focused on you, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Yep! 
MATT: That's going to be two attacks against you. Oh, one bite attack, and sorry, and one greatsword attack. 
SAM: Oh no, Chetney! 
MATT: So, that's going to be-- 
SAM: Chetney! 
MARISHA: Chetney, Chetney, no! 
MATT: -- against you, 19 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
LAURA: You got him. 
MATT: With the bite, it's going to be 22 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: All right, so-- 
SAM: The gods will protect you! 
MATT: (laughs) The bite is going to be-- 
SAM: Just believe! 
MATT: -- nine points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Then the greatsword-- 
LIAM: Clap your hands if you believe in the Prime Deities. 
MATT: It's going to be 12 points of slashing damage, that's all reduced by half. 
TRAVIS: Got it, so it's 10 total. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (sniffs) 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: He seems pretty intelligent-- 
TRAVIS: Actually, that seems like be 22, so it should be 11. 
TALIESIN: He's super smart. 
MATT: 11. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay, so. I'll take it. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: The rest of them, not so much. Can't run my thing, but-- 
MATT: That one darted over there, that's currently standing over there. 
TRAVIS: Nine, and-- 
MATT: That's going to do it. That finishes their go, and-- 
TRAVIS: It's 21, whatever. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Doo doo! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Too many, too many gooshes! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Goosh, goosh. (laughter) (laughter) 
MATT: This one here. It flies up to the top. 
LAURA: Ah! 
MATT: While this one also darts over to the side over here. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
SAM: Oh, imps? 
MATT: Tiny-- 
SAM: What, there's tiny ones? 
MARISHA: Aren't those like old cockatrices but tinies? 
MATT: Oh, that's the tiniest I can find. They're not all-- 
TRAVIS: Cockatrices! 
MATT: They're all representing these creatures, they're their proxies. 
TRAVIS: ♪ ("Super Mario Bros. Theme" in beeps) ♪ 
SAM: (grunts) 
MATT: That one. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Do the Mario! 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: That one's going to be, it's not quite close enough to do that. It's going to just go invisible. 
SAM: Come-- 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: Put that there. This one up here lands. (growls) Looks over towards you, and you hear the chattering of teeth and slobber, and you glance over your shoulder. As it looks at you, its eyes go wide, and it almost seems to press all of its muscles intense with this horrible bulging. (screeches) In your direction. 
SAM: Oh god! 
LIAM: What's your problem, shorty? 
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw for me. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Are you within 10 feet of me? 
LIAM: Yeah, because I'm on the other side of that one. 
MATT: Technically, the creature itself is a 10-foot distance, and so, he's between you, so, no. 
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: It's a six! 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: It's a six. 
LIAM: I will use my one reroll as a fighter. 
MATT: Okay, Indomitable. 
LIAM: The Indomitabitabitable. 
MATT: Do it again. 
LIAM: Come on, don't do the same thing. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: It's a nine. 
LAURA: Oh, I thought that was a six again, I was. (gasps) 
LIAM: It's a nine, cool. 
MATT: A nine. The fiendish essence of this tiny demon, for a moment, represents the entirety of the doom that washes over you from the presence of this kill box you've waltzed into, and you are frightened. 
LIAM: I have advantage against being frightened. Would I roll again? 
MATT: Yes, you would roll again. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
LIAM: Would I roll again for both those? 
MATT: Sure, yeah, yeah-- 
LIAM: Because if I had used Indomitable-- 
MATT: That's true. 
LIAM: I would've rolled twice-- 
MATT: That's true. 
LIAM: So, that is, that's eight, so that's dog shit, so I have one more chance. 
MATT: Okay, that's true, yeah, you have one more, because you do have advantage on this. 
TRAVIS: No poo! No poo! 
LIAM: That is a 16. 
MATT: 16. 
LIAM: Woo! 
MARISHA: Wowsers. 
SAM: Just took four rolls. 
MATT: Four rolls. But that doom from this creature doesn't match the tragedy you've suffered, and the strength and bravery you've found in the dark points of your life. You just push past it, and growl back at it. It withdraws a little bit on the side of the wall. That's going to finish its go, and that's rush up there. 
LIAM: Long day, Shorty. 
MATT: (laughs) Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: Oh jeez. 
SAM: Oh no. That means it's almost our turn again. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: I don't know what to do. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to continue to just slash-- 
TRAVIS: This is such a good one! 
LIAM: -- I'm going to keep working with Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Rolling at advantage. First attack is a 27 to hit. 
MATT: Okay, that hits. 
LIAM: That is just seven points of damage. The second slash is a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MATT: Ooh! 
LIAM: So, it's a 30, and that's doubled as four, the six is, all right, that's 10. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Still going, he's still there? 
MATT: So, that was, sorry, so, the first one was? 
LIAM: Seven? 
MATT: Right, seven. 
LIAM: Seven and 10. 
MATT: Seven and then 10 are the two damage hits here. (slashes) Yeah, he's still taking the hits. He's starting to look a little rough. 
LIAM: A little rough? 
TALIESIN: Jesus. A little? 
LAURA: Gosh. 
TRAVIS: He's an overachiever! 
LAURA: Yeah, dude, the last one took a hundred points, at least, and this one's at 76. 
LIAM: I thought you guys had-- 
TRAVIS: 145. 
LIAM: -- whaled away on it. 
TALIESIN: They did whale away on it. 
LAURA: We did. We took 59 down on him. 
SAM: ♪ Whale away, whale away, whale away ♪ 
LIAM: All right, all right, all right. 
TALIESIN: Getting close-ish. 
LIAM: Sorry, sorry. 
TALIESIN: No, no. 
LIAM: Nah. Nah, I'm saving my resources. I'm going to stand my ground, that's it, done. 
MATT: Okay. Finishing your go, Orym, that brings us next to Laudna, with Fearne on deck. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh? 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh! 
MARISHA: Uh-huh, so, I popped the lock. Would it take my action to take the-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: Does dislocate a lot of things. (laughter) 
MARISHA: A little hip-hop beat. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) So stupid. 
LIAM: Actually, can I jump in, and do one last thing? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: That I think is more in line with seeing this thing on top of both of you? I'm going to run under the green guy's legs, use my movement, and spring up, chancing an attack on my backside. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm going to land next to Imogen, but with my back pressed to hers, and I'm going to use my Ashari, the Zeph'aeratam moves to spin us around, and put her to the side, and hold my shield up in front of her. She is going to get an additional Bait and Switch. Your AC is going to go up to, add an eight to your AC. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
SAM: Damn. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
LIAM: But as long as we're back to back. So if you get out of here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: But-- 
MATT: The Bait and Switch is part of your movement? 
LIAM: It's not. 
MATT: It's just a-- 
LIAM: There's no wording to it, let me get it for you. 
SAM: It's not an action. It's just a thing that happens. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, there's no, it's not a bonus, it's not action. "When you're within five feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one die, and switch places with a creature." 
MATT: Oh yeah, okay, yeah, just wanted to double check that. So yeah, that's good. All right. 
LIAM: That's it, now I'm done, sorry. 
MATT: So you both swap out. 
LIAM: Sorry, Laudna. 
TRAVIS: That's great. 
SAM: Look, he's doing it! He's doing his Aramente! (laughter) 
MATT: All right, that's good to note. 
TRAVIS: Starting to believe. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: It does get a strike on you as you move out of the-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: -- out of range. It does get a minus six against those. By the way, it has to try to make a saving throw. 
LIAM: Is it minus six? 
LAURA: Yeah, at the end of his turn, so. 
LIAM: So, we're rolling. 
MATT: At the end of his turn. 
LAURA: Has he taken his turn already? 
SAM: ♪ Takin' his turn ♪ 
MATT: Oh, right, because he didn't-- I was confused with the other one, so, actually, I'm going to go back and do his turn-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: First while you're on the ground, which would've been striking both at you-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: -- since you were the first on that one. That would've been a-- 
LIAM: Is it minus six, or minus a d6 roll? 
LAURA: Minus a d6. 
MATT: Yes. It would've been a 20, minus five, so 15. 
LIAM: No. 
MATT: Then the second one is a 18 minus two. So yeah, both of those strikes went wide. 
LIAM: Sorry. 
MATT: End of his turn, he's going to try and make the save, which is intelligence, you said? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: No, that's a six. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: So now it's going to take its attack of opportunity against you as you move out of its combat range. 
LIAM: Minus that d6. 
MATT: Yeah, it misses again. He is just too (grunt) (whoosh). 
LIAM: (dodging noises) 
MATT: Just swinging in the air at phantoms. 
LAURA: Great. 
LIAM: Okay, sorry, I'll shut up. Marisha, you're on deck. 
MATT: All righty, Laudna. 
MARISHA: Okay, I want to open this gate. Is that going to take my whole action to just remove the lock, and open it? 
MATT: No, it's just you've already done that, so you just (creaks) pull it open. I will say, it doesn't take much, but you have to give a heavy tug, because of all the weight that's now put on the cage. It's almost pressing down on the door-- You (heaves) open it up with a bit of a shove, rust gets knocked off of it. 
MARISHA: Okay, other important question, does this cage have a bottom? 
MATT: Does this cage have a bottom? 
MARISHA: Yeah, or is it just a-- 
TRAVIS: Does it have a floor? 
MARISHA: Does it have a floor, or is it just one-- 
MATT: Oh, no, it has a floor, it's a built-in metal floor, yeah. 
MARISHA: Built-in metal floor, okay. 
SAM: It's a cube. 
MARISHA: Okay. That's good to know. That changes what I want to do, because I don't want to electrocute these people. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Hmm! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: They're expendable. 
MARISHA: Okay. I, yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: They're electricity Ashari. 
MARISHA: They're electricity Ashari? 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
MARISHA: What if they just jump right at the right time? 
LIAM: Ah, so, one was-- 
TRAVIS: One, two, three! 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) Work on your timing! Okay. I've opened the gate, and you said they've got their binds? 
MATT: Yeah, chains that look like they've been fused together through heat. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Chains that have been fused through heat. 
TRAVIS: Cut their hands off. 
LIAM: Melt their hands off. 
MARISHA: I can't do anything about that, but the gate is open! It's their problem now. I am going to Quicken a spell-- [metallic clunk] 
MARISHA: -- and cast Mirror Image on myself. 
TRAVIS: That timing is wild. 
MARISHA: So that I have that. Then can I move? I've opened the gate, 
MATT: Mm-hmm. Quickened a spell. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: You can move. 
LIAM: Slappa da bass. (laughter) 
SAM: Most of Marisha's turn is recapping what she's already done. 
MARISHA: I'm trying to think. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I'm just going to-- I don't want to be near this big guy. Can I jump down to the little shit guy? 
MATT: Over there? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: You can. You might end up incurring a attack of opportunity. As to go over the wall will get you within his five-foot range. 
MARISHA: You know what? Better idea, I'm going to go in the cage. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yes, yes! 
MATT: Okay! Okay! 
MARISHA: I open the gate. You're free! (laughter) 
MATT: As you step in, they all go: "(whimpering)" They're confused on who to be scared of. (laughter) 
SAM: Can we leave? 
LIAM: (scarily) You're free! (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's safer in here, trust me. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: They come back in with you. 
MATT: You still have an action. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Huh? 
MATT: You still have an action, if you want to. That's all you're going to do? 
MARISHA: Oh, I still have an action? 
MATT: Yeah, so you quickened the spell to-- 
LAURA: But then you didn't cast anything. 
MATT: -- to cast Mirror Image on yourself. 
MARISHA: Well, I cast Mirror Image. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Correct, but you still have your action. 
MARISHA: Then I opened the gate. Okay, well then, if I still have an-- I thought-- Okay. Then... Oh god! Can I attempt to freeze the metal that is binding them? Do a Ray of Frost-- 
TALIESIN: Try to know. 
MARISHA: -- on the fused thing. 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
MARISHA: To see if it's brittle enough to break? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
MARISHA: That's all I got. 
LIAM: Here go their hands. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to do a Ray of Frost on their metal things. 
MATT: To which one of them? There's the taller female soldier and there's the small gnomish Ashari soldier. 
MARISHA: Which one looks like it has more hit points? 
TRAVIS, LIAM, and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
MATT: Roll the dice. I mean, the bigger one's bigger. 
MARISHA: I'll do the soldier. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Trust me! (spell casts creepily) 
MATT: "Ah!" (laughs) They just scream as you continuously burst-- 
TRAVIS: Liquid nitrogen on them. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT: Terrifying and necrotic energy into this, which ends up turning into a cold frozen scenario. All right, roll cold damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: My wrists! 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: 10 total. 
MATT: 10 damage to it? Okay. They take five damage just from the contact of the freezing energy. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Looking at you, (sighs) they're going to attempt to slam it into one of the cage bars to see if they can break it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Will it shatter their wrists? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (scream) 
MATT: That's actually pretty good! 
LIAM: It's a teaching moment. 
MATT: All right, so natural 18 with their additional strength on top of that. That is going to bring it to a 20. 
MARISHA: Oh? 
MATT: 20 of it would be the DC to try and break these chains. So the ice brought the DC lower. It would've been 25. 
MARISHA: Oh great! 
MATT: So they (shattering) break the chains off their wrists and-- (soft groan) 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: So they have their wrists free. 
SAM: Hey! 
MARISHA: Hey! 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
LAURA: Great. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Hey! 
LIAM: ♪ Together, we'll break These chains of love ♪ 
MARISHA: I did a thing! 
ASHLEY and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: You go over and start playing the piano. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn? 
MARISHA: I guess so. 
MATT: All right. Fearne, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right. All right. 
SAM: Oh shit! Oh shit! I got to come up with something to do. 
ASHLEY: All right. I really don't have anything else but fire. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to shoot out Scorching Ray. 
TRAVIS: Nothing? 
ASHLEY: I know. I didn't prepa-- Well. 
SAM: She's a fire gal. 
LAURA: You know, she does fire! 
ASHLEY: Just got a lot of fire. 
TRAVIS: Go for it. Do it! 
LIAM: I looked in my spell closet and there's nothing I want to wear. 
ASHLEY: There's just nothing I want to wear. All right, so Scorching Ray. 
LIAM: It's really getting to be a problem. 
ASHLEY: I'll do one to the closest to me and then two at the one that's by Chetney. 
MATT: All right. So roll for the first one that's closest to you. 
SAM: Pew pew pew! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 26. 
MATT: Jesus! That hits, yeah. 
ASHLEY: 23? 
MATT: Hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. And 26 again. 
SAM: (sonic boom) 
MATT: Dang. All righty! 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: There are more gooshes than normal. 
ASHLEY: So first hit is six. 
MARISHA: I think we're just attuned to the goosh. 
ASHLEY: Second is another six points of damage and third is five points of damage. Da-maj. 
MATT: All right. All right, cool. So (fire blasts) all three rays (fire blasts) bursting. The first one, the one that's still closest to you by FCG, and the other two slamming into the one that's by Chetney. Each of them impact and they just shrug it off a little bit. You can see there's black char marks where it hits and a bit of the skin is crackled. So they take damage, but not as much as you would like. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I know, I know. Okay. Then, for bonus action, (groans) I'm going to have Mister come over to me, get a little closer. 
MATT: (monkey hoots) 
ASHLEY: But also as he's going, to hit some more flaming shit at the guy next to Chet. 
MATT: Next to Chet? All right. Go ahead and roll attack. (monkey chitters) As he's floating through the air, this flaming monkey-- (whooshes) 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: John Woo. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: Doves burst into flame behind him and then fall to the ground. 
ASHLEY: 24. 
TRAVIS: Motorcycle jumps in the air for no reason. 
MATT: 24 hits. 
ASHLEY: 24 hits. 
MATT: Yep. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's nine points of damage. 
MATT: Nine points of damage to that. All right. 
LAURA: How long does Feather Fall last? (laughs) 
MATT: One minute, or until you land. 
LAURA: Okay, great. 
SAM: Is it concentration or anything? 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: It's done. It's good. 
MATT: But once you land, it finishes. 
LAURA: Okay, cool. 
ASHLEY: All right. That's my turn. 
MATT: Do you want to move or stay put? 
ASHLEY: I would like to try to start to make my way this way. 
LAURA and MATT: ♪ Makin' your way ♪ 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: But steering clear of the dude. 
MATT: Right, so it's 10 feet to get down there and then 20 feet to get over here. 
MATT: That's about as far as you can move on the 30-foot movement. 
ASHLEY: I can go 35. 
MATT: 35? You can move one more this way, if you'd like. 
ASHLEY: Boop! Perfect. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'll stay. That's it. That's my turn. 
MATT: All right. Finishing your go, that brings us to FCG, with Imogen on deck. 
LIAM: Letters! 
SAM: I don't want this guy to hurt us. 
LAURA: I'm so scared of this guy. 
SAM: What'd you say? 
LIAM: No, I just was excited for Letters to do his thing. 
SAM: I don't know. I don't know what to do. I don't hurt people and no one's in need of healing yet. So-- 
LAURA: We will be!

TRAVIS: That pendulum is going to go like-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. It is going to-- 
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know. 
MATT: It's all bad. 
TRAVIS: We're like, "Stop!" 
MATT: So what are you commanding him to do? 
SAM: I'm commanding him to-- I'm looking at my menu here. 
LIAM: Send him away. 
LAURA: I feel like you should have Banish, but he might not have taken it today. I think we talked about this. 
SAM: I don't know what I'll do if I do that. I could. I speak his language. Yeah, let's try it. Maybe it won't work, maybe it will. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) 
SAM: Betray. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: Nice! 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: (gruffly) OshKosh B'gosh! 
SAM: I don't know if it is powerful enough to do that, but we'll try. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Betray. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Not me. 
MATT: Blades out towards you. 
SAM: Oh no! He's going to betray me, isn't he? 
MATT: (laughs) Goes, (growl), glances back at the big man who is making the orders. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Just looks at you. That's all. You don't know what's going to happen until it gets back on his turn. 
LAURA: (squeals nervously) 
SAM: Now, with him maybe not going to attack me, I'm going to go motor past him, past Fearne, and go as far as I can towards the others. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Now he's just checking his email. 
MATT: That would have been better. Here? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. I will say the Betray action, in this context-- 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: As you move past, the blade is ready to strike you as you left the combat range. 
SAM: (stutters nervously) 
MATT: He betrays his commander by letting you walk. 
SAM: Oh! Nice! 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: But the command ends. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Got it. (laughs) Then, as a bonus action, I will also give one of those nice d6s to Fearne to use in the futch. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
MATT: All right, so you get a Bonded Blessing to you. 
ASHLEY: I will take it. 
MARISHA: Unnecessary abbreviations. 
SAM: Yeah, it's my new thing. 
MATT: Yep. There you go. 
LIAM: That word wasn't short enough for you? 
LAURA: Yeah, Sam's thing. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh--

MATT: Finishes your go. 
LIAM: One point two syllables. 
MATT: All right Imogen, you're up. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: I forgot to roll an extra d8 for fire damage because of Mister. 
MATT: Oh yeah! Then roll that. 
ASHLEY: Just for-- 
SAM: Just for Mister's attack or for all of them? 
ASHLEY: It's because it's extra fire damage because of my enhanced bond. 
SAM: Yeah, of course! 
ASHLEY: An eight! 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: All righty! 
ASHLEY: So we'll do that to the one closest to Chet. 
MATT: You got it. Okay. 
SAM: Nice! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: So now, Imogen? 
LAURA: (sighs) I'm so scared of this guy. 
MATT: (deep growls) 
MARISHA: He's scary. 
SAM: Yeah, for sure. 
MATT: (intimidating growls) What are you doing? 
LAURA: (crackling energy) I'm going to Lightning Bolt him straight to the face.

TRAVIS and TALIESIN: ♪ 11, 12 ♪ 
LIAM: ♪ Doo doo doo doo doo ♪ 
LAURA: That's not great. Oh, that's not great. Five. There's a lot of shit. Five, seven, 11. 
MATT: Liam, no! 
LAURA: 18, 20. 
TRAVIS: That a d8? 
LAURA: 20 points. 
MATT: What is it? 
LAURA: 20 points of lightning damage. 
MATT: 20 points of lightning damage. 
SAM: That's good, it's something! 
LAURA: It's not good. That's not good. 
SAM: Maybe he's-- 
LIAM: Vulnerable? 
SAM: -- susceptible, vulnerable to-- 
TRAVIS: Look at these high standards over here. 
MATT: The lightning bolt blasts through and he seemed to take the hit. (grunts) (gruff scoff) 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Brushes away. 
LAURA: Is he resistant to lightning? 
MATT: There's a burn mark where the energy struck through him, but as just wipes his hand, it casts off. He takes some damage, but not as much as you're used to dealing. 
LIAM: (sinister laughs) (groans) 
LAURA: Fuck! 
ASHLEY: Damn it! 
MARISHA: So that was lightning? 
MATT: Leans forward towards you. "Nice!" Smoke (poofs) out of its mouth-- 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: -- as it gets right up close to you with its claws out. 
TRAVIS: Ooh, baby! 
MATT: Blade at the side. 
LAURA: Great. 
LIAM: The green guys are resistant to fire. The gorilla's resistant to lightning. 
LAURA: He's probably resistant to flame, too. Yeah. Lighting, all of it. 
TALIESIN: I would assume. 
LAURA: (groans) Okay. 
TALIESIN: Anybody got some radiant? 
LAURA: I'm going to (energy buzzing), and while I'm staring at him, one of my meteors is going to fly off and try to hit the imp that's standing on the corner. 
MATT: Over there? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: That's sweet. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: That is a dex save? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: That is going to be 17. 
LAURA: Fail! 
MATT: Fail? All righty! 
LAURA: So that is, I don't remember what it is. 2d6. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Oh. Oh! (gags) So one point of fire damage to him. 
MATT: One point of fire damage to him. Okay. (weak blast) (snarl) It jumps back for a second (whooshes) and lands back on a perch. 
LAURA: Poof! Again! (laughs) 
MATT: Second one to him? 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. Fail. And that is going to be a 21. 
LIAM: My AC went up! 
LAURA: So he takes half of half of six. 
MATT: Okay, so three. So one. 
SAM: One. (laughter) 
MATT: Two points of fire damage. (squawks) (growls) 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: He seems pissed off. 
LAURA: I should have just gotten away. Oh god. 
MATT: All right, so you going to stay put? 
LAURA: I'm going to stay next to Orym because-- 
MATT: Okay. You got it. 
LAURA: He's got-- 
MATT: Finishing your go-- 
LIAM: What's your total? 15 plus eight? 
SAM: Oh yeah! The man of the hour. 
LAURA: He's probably still going to kill me. 
MARISHA: Come on, save us! 
SAM: Come on! 
LAURA: I should've moved. 
SAM: What's your name? 
MATT: Dart forward and go in for strikes (whooshes) across the one that's up against you, Chet. 
TRAVIS: He gets advantage, right? 
MATT: Yeah, for the direction he's here. He's going to position himself at a pincer point like that. So that's an advantage on each strike. 
TALIESIN: Look at that. Yeah. 
MATT: Well, you are technically, for the time, being considered allies, so he does get the advantage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: Mm! 
TRAVIS: And that persuasion. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: 20. 
MATT: Which is great because one of them was a natural one. 
MARISHA: That's good. 
MATT: So that one hits and the second strike-- 
SAM: Chetney, ask his name! 
MATT: Both hit. 
LAURA: Oh god! 
MATT: Here we go. Okay, the first hit is... 10, 12. 30 points of damage on the first hit. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: Jesus! Why are we even here? 
MARISHA: Why are we here? 
TRAVIS: To witness. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: To witness his glory. 
TRAVIS: To witness his reign! 
LIAM: Hail Satan! 
LAURA: We need him. We need him up there. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Please? We need help. 
SAM: Goosh. (laughter) 
MATT: 26 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: 56 points! 
MATT: He's going to not smite this one. He's just going to hold on, still-- 
TRAVIS: So powerful! What's your name? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Did it go in the trash? 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Damn it! (laughter) 
LAURA: Your dice? 
MATT: The voice gurgles past as it looks over towards your wolven form and just goes, "Do your part." 
ASHLEY: I am needed. 
TRAVIS: His name is Do Your Part. 
SAM: Oh, okay! 
MARISHA: Is it Dooya, first name Part? 
TRAVIS: D apostrophe Y-U. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What's his name? 
MATT: He's unamused. 
SAM: His name's Do Your Part. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I didn't say that, I didn't say that, I didn't say that. 
MATT: Is going to (whooshes) fly up with a second strike and stay within the melee range, but just is gliding in the air right above like (whooshes). 
LAURA: Nice! 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: That's going to finish his go. That brings us to Chetney, with Ashton on deck. 
TRAVIS: I forgot last time with Curse of Bloated Agony, on his second strike, he should take a d8 of damage. 
MATT: Correct! Damage, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Which is just three points. 
SAM: Take the whole thing. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Three. All right. 
TRAVIS: I will take two more strikes with the scythe. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, not very good! First one is 17. 
MATT: 17 hits. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it does hit! Amazing! Second one is 20. 
MATT: Yep. Both hit. 
TRAVIS: Amazing! That's three. 10! 13 plus five. 18 plus-- 
SAM: Don't worry. You'll fall off the little-- 
TRAVIS: Three points of thunder damage. So 21, three of which is thunder. 
MATT: 21 and three. 
TRAVIS: The second one. Seven. 10 plus five is 15 and six points of damage, so 21 total in the second one. 
MATT: 21 in total? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: How much of that was fire? 
TRAVIS: Three. 
MATT: Three. It's already reduced? 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: So it'd be one. So that'd be 24? 
TRAVIS: Oh no, three of that was fire. 
MATT: Oh, three of it was. 
TRAVIS: So 21, 20, 19. 
MATT: 19. Got it. Cool. All right. (blast) 
TRAVIS: Oh, he's immune to fire. 
MATT: He's looking hurt, looking real hurt between the two of you striking back and forth. (whooshes) (pants) 
SAM: Oh, he's looking real hurt? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'll do, for the bonus action, I will just renew Blood Curse of Agony on it. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (blast) 
MATT: You got it. All right. Finishing your go, Chet, that brings us to Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I'm noticing I'm alone, so I'm just going to take another swipe at this fuck. 
LAURA: You can do it! 
LIAM: Put your back into it. 
TALIESIN: That's 19 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah, 19 hits. 
TALIESIN: All right. That's not bad! 17 points of damage? 
MATT: 17 points of damage to that guy. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) Then-- 
MATT: He's looking real rough. 
SAM: (worried noise) 
LAURA: Yep, yep, yep. 
TALIESIN: Then, let's go for one more good slice across the back, just trying to cut him open with the glass hammer. That's 15, 20, 22 to hit. Then... Come on! 19 points of damage? 
MATT: (grunts) The second hit of the hammer just knocks him off the side and then ends up being impaled on the rocks down there. (cheering) 
LIAM: Yeah! 
MATT: Before he just crumbles into black ooze that burns into ash. 
LIAM and LAURA: (boinging) 
TALIESIN: I'll be right back! I'm going to go straight for that fucking imp! 
LIAM: Whack-A-Mole! 
MATT: (squawks) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Right. Also, is that circle glowing? 
MATT: It's incomplete. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
MATT: It's not glowing. 
LIAM: Yes, Imogen shut that down. 
LAURA: It's the one thing I did before I died. 
LIAM: Thank you for your sacrifice. 
TRAVIS: Is there a door into the, from your side, Matt? 
MATT: There is a door enters from that space, yes. Does that finish your turn? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Get in that door ♪ 
TALIESIN: That's... (thinking noises) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Take the stairs ♪ 
TALIESIN: Reminding myself if there's anything else I can do. Yeah, that's everything I can do. 
MATT: All righty. Now-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: The central leader of this, on top, who's squatting on the cage. 
TRAVIS: Thaddeus. 
MATT: It's grinning at this point. It's going to begin with a Horror Nimbus. 
SAM, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: A what? 
MATT: You see, as it's grinning towards you for a second. 
LIAM: What was that phrase again? 
MATT: -- these sparks of light, like-- 
MARISHA: Horror Nimbus? 
MATT: -- begin to spark around it, like this swirling stream of strange prismatic lights begin to swirl around it, bursting like small fireworks in your face. I need both Orym and Imogen. Technically, Laudna, you are hidden from the top of the cage-- or actually, the cage top is open, so you can see it. So yeah, I need the three of you to make wisdom saving throws for me, please. 
LIAM: Ugh. 
LAURA: Is this against being frightened? 
MATT: It is. 
LAURA: Okay, so we get advantage. 
LIAM: All right, so advantage. 
MARISHA: I'm immune to being frightened. 
MATT: Yeah. So you ignore it. 
LAURA: I have advantage against being frightened. 
MATT: Prisoners get advantage because-- Wait. No, they don't get advantage. They're susceptible. 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MATT: That is a success for one of them. 
LAURA: A wisdom save? 
MATT: And a natural 20. I'm rolling so well for everybody else. (laughter) 
MATT: So yeah, wisdom save. 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: 18. Okay. 
LIAM: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
SAM: Hey! 
MATT: None of you are frightened from the Nimbus. Holding back. 
TALIESIN: We've seen shit. 
MARISHA: We've seen some shit. 
MATT: You have. 
LAURA: I see Laudna all the time. 
MARISHA: It's true. You've seen me! 
MATT: Is going to just unleash on you. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (shouts) 
LIAM: Built up a tolerance. 
TRAVIS: It's those fucking meteors, man. 
SAM: But AC is plus eight, right? 
LAURA: Yeah-huh. 
MARISHA: Yeah, with Orym. 
SAM: Yeah, you're going to be fine! 
MATT: That's one bite and two claw attacks against you. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
SAM: It's fine! 
MARISHA: Have you taken any damage? 
MATT: That is going to be a 24 to hit. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
LIAM: Goddamn it! 
LAURA: Yeah, that hits! 
TRAVIS: (yelping laughs) 
MATT: 26 to hit. 
LIAM: Fuck! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Fuck your monster! 
MATT: And a 27 to hit. 
LIAM: Son of a fuck! 
MATT: It all comes around now! 
TRAVIS: All three! 
MATT: All the bad rolls come around for this round. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no! 
SAM: You're going to be fine. 
LAURA: I am just paper. I am-- 
SAM: You're going to be fine. 
LAURA: I have less health than Laudna and she looks like a stick. 
SAM: Let me look. Let me see how far away you are. 
MATT: Bite strike. 
TALIESIN: You got this? You got this? 
TRAVIS: At least if you go down, maybe you'll explode and take him with you. 
LIAM: (exhales) 
LAURA: (explosion) 
MARISHA: Damn it! 
TRAVIS: And everybody else that's on the top. 
SAM: Goddamn it, I'm not close enough. 
MATT: So what you watch, first it bites down because you're right there (crunches) for 32 points of piercing damage. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: Into you and lifts you up in its jaws like Audrey II. You see just Imogen's legs kicking from inside as it takes both of its claws and digs them into her back in its attempt to tear her open from the back outside. 
LAURA: It might succeed. 
MATT: So this, the first claw strike is going to be-- 
ASHLEY: No, no, no! 
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage? 
TRAVIS: You're going down. 
MATT: The second one is going to be-- 
LIAM: It's getting close here. It's close. 13 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: See? You're fine! 
LIAM: Barely. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: I don't like that at all! 
LIAM: Barely up. 
TRAVIS: (wails) 
TALIESIN: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: Heal her! 
SAM: I'm not! I'm trying to get over there! 
MARISHA: Heal my girlfriend! 
SAM: I've got no fucking-- What? What was that? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: This is Marisha! 
LIAM and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: What? Did you hear that, guys? 
MATT: So Laudna, all you see is this creature loom down a shadow and then Imogen is gone. You hear muffled screams and a spatter of blood (splat) across the top of the tower before she slumps down onto the ground, pulling yourself free from its grasp. 
MARISHA: Okay. You all do definitely hear Laudna go: No! 
MATT: You are also splattered. 
LAURA: Oh, I'm right in front of the cage, too. 
LIAM: Splattered. 
LAURA: So I see dead-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
LIAM: He's-- 
MATT: The creature is now licking its lips. You see the inside of its teeth are all crimson. It's like (slurps) (growls) 
LIAM: Blade's still in hand through all that, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. Didn't strike with the blade this time. 
LIAM: No, I got you. 
MATT: Just went for dual claws in there. 
LIAM: I got you. 
MATT: It's going to stay put. It's enjoying its current position of lording over everything-- 
LIAM: Shit. 
MATT: -- on the top of this tower. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: That finishes its go. Now the other individual's going to go. The one that's over there is going to make a strike at both of you. One against you, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Hey! 
MATT: Natural one. 
TRAVIS: Eh! 
MATT: It's good to have that balance. Against the fiend friend over there, that will actually hit with a 19. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: It's going to deal-- That's 14 points of slashing damage to him. 
LIAM: Fuck. 
SAM: Not Zeville! 
MATT: That is a double attack, though, so it does take 1d8. 
TRAVIS: 1d8. Thank you! Four points. 
MATT: Four points. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (slicing) 
TRAVIS: (energy building) 
MATT: The curse within swells and he detonates (explosion) outward-- 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
SAM: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: My curse worked! 
MATT: -- sending innards out onto the ground before it crumples to the ground, like a burst water balloon in slow motion. 
MARISHA: Wow! That's cool! 
TRAVIS: Did my part. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Do ya? 
MATT: The fiend ally, the one flying overhead, looks down at you. "Well done." 
TRAVIS: Now the big one! 
MATT: "Do not give me orders!" 
TRAVIS: It was a request. 
SAM: What's his name? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No, it was a request. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. This one, however. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: Going to step up onto here over the two of you. 
LAURA: Look how big his wing is. 
MATT: He's going to make a-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: It doesn't like being commanded. 
SAM: Sure! 
MATT: It's not too worried about Miss Fire over there. It's going to focus entirely on you with its strike with a sword and then a bite. 
ASHLEY: That was my ploy. 
MATT: That's going to be a 20 to hit. 
SAM: Yep! 
ASHLEY: I'm not dangerous. 
MATT: Then bite is going to be 17? 
SAM: Miss! 
MATT: 17 misses. Okay. 
MARISHA: Hell yes! 
MATT: So you take, from the big sword strike, 10 points of slashing damage as it brings its blade down onto you. 
SAM: (grunts) 
MATT: Then as it pulls the blade back, it tries to reach to grab and bite you into its jaws and you duck out of the way and its claws scrape across your metal exterior. No impact. 
SAM: Amazing! 
MATT: Yeah, it's going to hold itself down right there. This imp over here that's in front of you is going to... It's going to turn invisible and vanish. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Ah. 
TALIESIN: Well, fuck you, too! 
SAM: Speaking of, Matthew, there was one-- 
MATT: I know. I have it right here. 
SAM: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: Which is going to appear right here. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Uh-oh! 
MATT: Look at you. 
SAM: Ah! 
MATT: (screeches) 
SAM: Well, that's cute. 
MATT: Make a wisdom save, please. (laughter) 
LAURA: So cute! (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: What was that roll? 
SAM: It didn't even roll! It kind of-- 
LAURA: It just plunked. 
TRAVIS: (dink) 
LAURA: You went-- 
SAM: Oh, that's a nine. Okay. Wisdom saving? 16. 
MATT: 16. Doesn't even phase you. 
SAM: Yeah. He's cute! He a little cutie pie! 
MARISHA: Once again. 
MATT: He's going to-- 
MARISHA: Like another Pâté. 
SAM: That's right. 
MATT: -- fly back this way. It looks dejected, like (sad squawks). 
SAM: Aw! 
MATT: (fluttering) Flutters off another 10 feet away. 
SAM: Hey, you can do better! Just believe in yourself! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Have you thought about trusting a higher power? 
TRAVIS: Oh, come on! (laughter) 
MATT: All right. The two individuals in the cage that are freed are too scared with the proximity of that entity to try and leave, especially after seeing what happened to Imogen, and are looking to you for any sort of guidance. 
MARISHA: Did they both break their-- 
MATT: No, only one of them did. 
MARISHA: Just the one? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
MATT: Yeah. There's no lock on it. It looks like the chains are fused, like something heated them to the point where they're just holding it there. 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm nervous! 
MARISHA: Welded it together? 
LAURA: Me too! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I wouldn't want to leave either. I don't want to leave. 
TALIESIN: There's a lot of glass up there. 
MATT: The other cages, you can hear clattering and movement in the middle of this chaos and a voice say, "Hey! Help! Help!" Top of the round. 
TRAVIS: On the ground? 
MATT: On the ground over there. The other cages are now shouting for help in this circumstance. Orym, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Can you point to the cages? Sorry. 
MATT: Yes. Right there. 
TRAVIS: Oh! I didn't even see that one! 
MATT: And right there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we got two more. 
LIAM: Okay, so splattered in blood, his good friend in a heap. Orym, under his breath, says: Fuck this! He's going leap up and cling on to the side of this thing's leg, and I'm going to start hacking at its sword arm. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm going to cut that blade out of its fucking hand. 
MARISHA: Cool! 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Is this a disarm thing? 
LIAM: Yeah, it's a disarm thing. Okay, so that is a 26 to hit. 
MATT: That does hit. 
LIAM: It's a strength save. 17. 
MATT: 17. 
TRAVIS: Uh, I need to hit him with a curse. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: That is an 18. 
LAURA: Uh! 
TRAVIS: Oof! 
MATT: Sorry! 
LIAM: That's fine! That's fine! 
MATT: It does the strike, though. 
LAURA: What does your curse do? It takes the hit, it's goes-- (grunts) 
LIAM: Yes, so that is-- All right, let me do the damage. This is nine plus the superiority die. So that is a total of 13. 
MATT: 13 damage from the first strike. (slicing) (growls) 
LIAM: Second slash. That is a 17. I'm sure it misses. 
MATT: 17 just misses. 
LIAM: Just misses. Action surge! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go! 
LIAM: That should hit. That's an 18. 
MATT: 18 hits. 
LIAM: Disarming strike. 
MATT: Okay, another roll. 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: The same exact roll. Another 18. 
LIAM: Okay, that is 12 damage total. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Last slash. Natural 20. 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LIAM: Five double 10, 16 plus double this. 
MARISHA: Double this! 
LIAM: That is 20 total. 
MATT: 20 points damage. 
LIAM: It's got to beat a 17 strength. 
MATT: Another disarming strike? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: 14. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MATT: As you carve, slash repeatedly into the wrist, it pulls its arm away with the blade and looks like it's getting ready to strike. As it bring its arm down towards you, you put the blade up and end up cutting through two of its fingers. As you do, it pulls its hand back in pain. The fingers arc off and burst into flame and then dust while the blade slips out of its grasp and-- (whooshes) 
SAM: Oh no, where's it going? Oh! (reverberating thwack) It sticks into the rock down there. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
LIAM: Then, I'm going to push off of its leg-- 
SAM: I'm going to go get its fucking sword. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Drop down to here. 
LAURA: Oh god! (laughs) 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LIAM: Pull up Imogen and swing her around and trade places again. It's my last superiority die. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Bait and Switch. 
LAURA: Am I on the ground and you're just yanking around my-- (sickly groan) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Or am I standing? 
MATT: I am considering you-- it was more for the narrative of you falling out, but you still have hit points and it didn't knock you down, so you just get back up. 
LAURA: (strained) Okay. 
LIAM: You get a nine added to your AC. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Then I just look to Laudna. Get her out of here! 
MARISHA: (stressed) Ah! Okay! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's it. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes Orym's go. 
SAM: I'm in a cage! 
MARISHA: I'm not a bamfer! 
MATT: Laudna, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
MARISHA: Fuck! 
ASHLEY: Shit! 
MARISHA: (stressed shout) Okay! Okay! Fuck! All right. I am going to-- Okay, I got a plan. I'm going to hit this motherfucker with a Shocking Grasp. I'm going to not use-- 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh fuck! He's standing on a metal thing. 
MATT: He is. 
MARISHA: No, I want this to work. We're all going to take a little bit of damage. I'm going to grab the metal cage and I'm going to channel the Shocking Grasp through it to try and use that to get advantage. 
MATT: Yeah, you can definitely do that. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: I'll allow that. 
LIAM: The people didn't leave though, right? 
SAM: Nope. They're going to die. 
MARISHA: No, they're still-- Wow! 
TRAVIS: Doubles? Double shit dice? 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh man! 
MARISHA: Quicken Spell! I'm going to do it again. It was a 14. Unless a 14 hits. 
MATT: Nope. 
MARISHA: Quicken Spell. I'm doing it again. Wow! 17? 
MATT: 17 just misses. 
LIAM: Just misses. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (groan) 
TRAVIS: Four rolls! 
MATT: That sucks! You reach over and grab the cage, and as you try and pulse through the metal-- 
TRAVIS: Oh man! 
MATT: As it rockets up into the top, the entity-- 
TRAVIS: It grounds the shock. 
MATT: -- reaches over and grabs the nearby stone, seeing what you're trying to do, and grounds it back into the stone. 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
MARISHA: Okay. That was my action-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: -- and my bonus action. Fuck! I was going to use that to try and get away because he can't take reactions if I hit him! Am I able to run and grab Imogen and throw ourselves over the edge? 
TRAVIS: You're still standing, by the way. 
MATT: If she lets you, you can. 
LAURA: Wait, you're going to throw me over the edge? 
MARISHA: I can do another Feather Fall on us and we can at least get off this tower. 
ASHLEY: Get out of there? 
SAM: Just check that. 
LAURA: You can cast Feather Fall on this turn? 
MARISHA: It's a reaction. 
LAURA: All right. I mean, if you-- Yeah. I trust you. 
MARISHA: Get the fuck out of here? 
LAURA: I trust you. 
MARISHA: All right. We're going to have an Aladdin moment. Do you trust me? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. Run, and we're going to jump off the edge. 
LIAM: Just fall off the side? 
LAURA: Except I can't run on your turn. 
MARISHA: Fall off the side. 
LAURA: So I'm waiting for you to push me. 
MATT: Essentially, yeah, you're allowing her to push you off the side. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: You're forced movement, which means technically he can't get an opportunity attack against you, but he can get it against you. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: So as you dart past and push her-- 
MARISHA: That's what I was trying to avoid, but it's fine. 
MATT: I know. That's how it goes. As you run beneath the cage, it kind of chuckles, "(sinister laughter) "Oh, no, you don't!" you hear in your mind, As you push Imogen off the side, you feel the shadow loom over it as its mouth slowly behind you (growls) opens to try and catch you from the side. 
MARISHA: As we're trying to jump-- 
LAURA: I have a potion. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (strained grunt) 
MATT: That's going to be a 22 to hit? 
LAURA: I have a potion in front of me I think things got moved around. 
MARISHA: Shield. 
MATT: You have Mirror Image. Oh, you Shield? 
MARISHA: Oh, and I have Mirror Image! I have Mirror Image! 
MATT: It's up to you. Well-- 
TRAVIS: It's still up, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah, I haven't used it yet. 
SAM: I don't have any potions. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a 19. So it hits the Mirror Image. 
MATT: 19. (crashing) It bites down on a version of Laudna that isn't there, and as it (whooshes)-- 
LAURA: I got a greater potion of healing. 
MATT: -- shimmies and vanishes out of existence, you are a foot in front of it as the jaws snap around nothing. 
TRAVIS: Dope shot. 
MATT: You both-- (whooshes) 
SAM: What, you missed? He missed? 
MARISHA: He missed. My Mirror Image. 
TRAVIS: Yep. Mirror Image. 
SAM: Whoa! 
LAURA: Amazing! 
MATT: You both leap off the side. 
TRAVIS: ♪ A whole new-- ♪ (screams) 
MARISHA: Can we-- 
SAM: Wait, on that side? 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no! Let's go this way! Let's go this way! 
MATT: She's on the edge here. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, she's on the other side. 
MATT: If you're going to push her, you have to go this way. 
MARISHA: Can we at least go back? 
MATT: You can go back this way. 
MARISHA: That way? 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that. 
SAM: They're gone! 
MATT: You're casting Feather Fall as a reaction? You both gently land off the battlefield, this way. (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's it? 
SAM: I can't heal her. 
MATT: No damage taken. 
LIAM: Nice! 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: You have a potion, yeah? 
LAURA: I have this potion. 
MARISHA: Okay. Cool. 
LIAM: So you should have-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: "I have this." 
LIAM: -- eight good hit points. 
LAURA: I have this potion, which is, yeah, not going to do much, but it's something. 
MATT: All right. Does that finish your turn, Laudna? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: God, I love the multi-tiered maps! 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Matt, this is fucking great! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Fearne, you're up. FCG, you're on deck. 
SAM: Oh god! I'm on deck? Jesus. What am I doing? 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. So I see the guy up top, above me, and I'm going to cast Blight. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's-- Bippity, boppity, boppity. It's a con save. 
SAM: Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. 
MATT: That's going to be a 16. 
ASHLEY: Did it hit? That's a miss. So, all right, here we go. 
TRAVIS: Taliesin, remember on this side of the tower, there are two chains going all the way down. Just in case. 
ASHLEY: 18 plus five. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, because I'm going to-- 
SAM: Is 23. 
TALIESIN: -- try and deal with this fucker. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's my next plan. I think there's even a chain-- 
ASHLEY: 23 plus 15. 
TALIESIN: -- to get up to him. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 38 points of damage. 
MATT: 38 points of necrotic damage? Oh, he does get-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Against that guy there? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: It does have advantage on saves. 
ASHLEY: Say again? 
MATT: Against magic. He has advantage on saves, so I'm going to roll again. Oh, even worse. Yeah, so-- 
ASHLEY: Okay 
TRAVIS: Dude! 
SAM: Great, great, great! 
TRAVIS: Hey, that's awesome! 
ASHLEY: All right. All right. 
MATT: All right, so as you look up and cast Blight, you watch as the area around its face, this muscular and plump-looking demon suddenly (sucks) shrivels inward. You watch as his features get gaunt and the flesh seems to go black and veiny around areas. (coughs) It coughs for a second, taking a pretty heavy hit. 
ASHLEY: All right. Then, as a bonus action-- 
SAM: A bonus. 
ASHLEY: A bonus. I will bring Mister closer to me and he's going to shoot a Flame Seed. 
SAM: Nice! 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 23? 
MATT: 23. All righty. 
ASHLEY: 10 points of damage. 
MATT: 10. All right. For-- 
TRAVIS: Hand! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: -- five points of fire damage against him. Got it. (annoyed grunts) Does that finish your turn? You want to move? 
ASHLEY: Yes? Yes. Will he get an attack of opportunity? 
MATT: If you move out of his combat range, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'll stay. I'll stay. 
MATT: Okay. Finishing your turn. 
TRAVIS: He does get one-- 
MATT: (screeches) 
TRAVIS: -- attack of opportunity instead of multiple. 
MATT: (heavy wings flapping) 
SAM: What was that? 
ASHLEY: Oh really? 
SAM: Something's happening. 
MATT: A familiar screech echoes through the sky-- 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: -- as winged entities-- 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: -- that you had previously seen floating above-- 
TALIESIN: What the living fuck? 
LIAM: Rocs? 
SAM: Or whatever they are. 
LAURA: Oh, those harpy thingies, those things that attacked us before? 
LIAM: Vrocks! 
TALIESIN: What the hell? 
MATT: This one stops to observe. 
MARISHA and LIAM: Vrocks! 
TRAVIS: Let's rock! 
MATT: This one swoops down to you and is attempting to grab you with its talons. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: This is going to be a contested strength. Or this would be your athletics, which you have advantage because you're raging. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Versus his. 
MARISHA: Jeez Louise. 
MATT: Woo! 
TALIESIN: Okay, this is contested, so do I get the probability d4, or no? On this? 
MATT: Does it say versus-- Is it ability checks, does it say? 
TALIESIN: No, saves. Fuck! 
LIAM: There's nothing quite like the battles when we realize we're in over our heads. 
MARISHA: I know! 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right, and this is athletics? 
LAURA: Yeah, the switcheroo of the "We're having fun" to "We're fucked." 
TALIESIN: Natural 20! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go! 
MATT: Natural 20! Great! It attempts to grapple you with its claws and talons. You kick it off. It does make two attacks, so it's going to make another one with its beak to try and damage you then because it can't seem to grab you. That's going to be 17 to hit. 
TALIESIN: Nope! 
MATT: Nope. Just (whooshes) freaks out now and swoops over on this side and is now above, harrying you with its wings. (whooshes) This one that moved here is going to (whooshes) swoop down. 
SAM: Oh god! 
MATT: With its other action and block that path there. 
SAM: More birds! 
MATT: (squawks) It's still up about, maybe a little bit higher in the air. 
TALIESIN: What the fuck is going on? 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Finishing that go-- 
SAM: Jesus! 
MATT: FCG, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
SAM: Holy bajolie! 
ASHLEY: Oh boy! 
TRAVIS: I think. 
SAM: (laughs) Handsome devil man, we need you over here! I'm going to look up at the demon above me and I will shoot a-- 
TALIESIN: What the fuck-- 
SAM: Shit, what can I do? I can't cause very much damage, but I guess I got to try. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (like FCG) Believe in yourself! 
SAM: I do! But there's no one to heal yet. No one around me is injured. (groans) Goddamn. 
TALIESIN: You have radiant. He's fucking-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: So I'll shoot a Sacred Flame up at the demon above me. 
MATT: Okay, the one right there? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. That's a wisdom save? 
SAM: Dex 15. 
MATT: Dex 15. Fail! 
SAM: Great! 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
SAM: Oh, it's not a weapon attack, though. Ugh! Terrible! Oh, terrible! Four points of radiant damage. 
MATT: Four points of-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: (whooshes) "(snarls)" Snorts it out of one nose. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Snot rocket. 
LAURA: A little radiant snot rocket. 
MATT: (snorts) (small fire whoosh) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: And I got to keep moving. I'm going to just keep moving. I'm going to take the opportunity attack. I'm going to keep moving. 
MATT: Okay. So you move past here. 
SAM: Just trying to get over towards this tower as far as I can go. 
MATT: Get you to about there. It does get a strike against you as you move past with its blade. 
ASHLEY: I should've gone. 
MATT: Natural 20. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: That hits. 
LAURA: It's coming back around! 
TRAVIS: Pendulum. 
TALIESIN: This is so bad! 
TRAVIS: Pendulum. 
MATT: 14. 18 points of slashing damage to you (impacts) and you get the distance because a little bit of movement is added from you being swiped in the back with the blade and it gives you a slight boost at the cost of a heavy bit of pain that's now struck through your system. But that's your movement, that's your action. Still have your bonus. 
SAM: Bonus action, I can't dash because I'm not a rogue. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: There's very little I can do with bonus actions, so I will not do anything. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your turn, FCG. 
SAM: That's it. 
MATT: Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: I want to take this. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: I'll move this for the sake of this. 
TALIESIN: Yay, bonus action! 
TRAVIS: Hm! 
MATT: Because it's fun. Now, because we're moving over to the side of things-- 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: -- I'm going to-- 
LAURA: Seven, eight. 
MARISHA: Ah, Zaddy. 
SAM: Oh, there goes Mister. Sorry. 
ASHLEY: No, I brought him with. I brought him closer to me. 
SAM: No, he's gone. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LAURA: Is it this many plus four? 
LAURA: Oh, I missed one. 
LIAM: Plus the number of dice it is. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. Oh wait, I think I miscounted. 
LIAM: Oh, look out for the ladies! Ah! 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
LAURA: Four. 
MATT: Just for the fun of it. 
LAURA: 10. 15. 18. 18 plus-- 
TALIESIN: Ooh. I don't like any of this. 
MATT: Put that there. 
LAURA: 20, 22. 23. 
TALIESIN: This is all bad. 
MATT: Here. 
LAURA: 26. Okay. 26 points of healing. 
LIAM: That's pretty good. 
LAURA: From this potion. 
ASHLEY: Nice! Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Destroyer of worlds. 
MATT: I know. 
LAURA: How far away would you say I am from that big guy? Can I still see his butt from my vantage point? 
MATT: I'd say, from your current vantage point, no, unfortunately. You'd have to move out a bit and then you'd have partial cover, but-- 
LAURA: Can I back up so I can still see him. 
MATT: This way? 
LAURA: So I can see him just a little bit? 
MATT: Yep. About there you'll see him. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Foof! 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Oh man! 
LAURA: I'm 120 feet away, would you say, or am I more than that? 
MATT: You are-- 
TALIESIN: That's got to be less than 120 feet. 
MATT: Yeah, this is 85 feet. So yeah, you are fine. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LAURA: I don't know if this is going to work. I'm going to put both hands on the side of my head and stare at him, and I'm going to shoot out a Psychic Lance and try to-- 
MATT: Okay. Intelligence save? 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LAURA: Get him with-- Yes. 
MATT: He has advantage. 
LAURA: Okay, great. 
LIAM: Oh wow! 
MATT: So this going to be an 18. 
LAURA: 18 is a save. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Meets it, beats it. 
LAURA: So he takes half damage and he's not incapacitated, so. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Two, three, four, five, six, seven. 
TALIESIN: I don't know what the fuck to do. 
LIAM: Got a lot going on on this map still. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Seven. Yes, we do. 
TALIESIN: I feel like we're missing something. 
LAURA: I know. 
MARISHA: We got to get these people out. 
SAM: Maybe their weakness is song! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I think we need to get that knife. 
LAURA: 21. So 11, or 10-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. We got to get that blade. 
LAURA: -- points of psychic damage. 
MATT: Okay. You got it. (grunts) "Ah! There you are!" 
TRAVIS: What? 
LIAM: There you are. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Ugh, god! I'm going to... Fuck off! 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: Hide! Hide! 
LAURA: Yeah, he's going to see me wherever I go. 
MARISHA: Laudna says. 
LAURA: I'll move back as far as I can towards the building so that he-- 
MATT: Puts you back to where Laudna is, right there. 
MARISHA: (wails) 
LAURA: I feel like I'm just putting you in danger by stepping right next to you. 
MARISHA: I just don't want anything to happen to you! 
LAURA: Well, we're both fucked. Let's be real. 
MARISHA: (sighs) 
MATT: Your fiend fellow friend. 
SAM: (shouts) What's your name? 
MATT: Doesn't even respond. Just going to unleash on this bastard here. 
SAM: Darryl? 
MATT: I keep knocking shit over. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! 
MATT: There we go. 
TRAVIS: That is the biggest game of Operation ever. 
SAM: Julio? 
MATT: Oh god! Whatever! That's fine. 
TRAVIS: That's fine. He's up. 
MATT: It's good! It's fine! You get the idea. Carves past (slicing) with the blade twice. That's shitty. 13 misses. 
TRAVIS: That's shitty! 
MATT: And a natural one. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: He biffed that round. Obviously. (laughs) As he's (groans) on the side. Goes to strike twice, and the entity sees him flying forward, now watching him take down his compatriots, and the demon takes its blade and parries the first strike and then kicks him off the side as he's flying, and the second strike goes wide as he hits the rock and has to ready himself back on his feet. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MATT: So that finishes his go. 
SAM: No! 
MATT: Chetney, you're up, with Ashton on deck. 
SAM: Elmer! 
TRAVIS: That's me! I am going to double... I'm going to run and use my bonus action to continue 70 feet, but I'm going to race. Yeah. 
LIAM: Loping across the battlefield. 
MATT: 55, 60. 
TRAVIS: Run up that up onto the platform. 
MATT: 65. 70 will get you right up on top of the platform. 
TRAVIS: Can I see the sword? 
MATT: Yeah, you can see it stuck in the ground there. 
TRAVIS: Amazing! Yeah, that's my movement. I'm going to use-- 
MATT: You can see it. It's this beautiful, cruciform blade, center blade there. 
TRAVIS: I can't quite reach it? 
MATT: Sparkling rubies encrusted in its hilt. 
TRAVIS: Cool! 
MATT: Beautiful polished metal. 
TRAVIS: That was my movement and my action. 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Meh, meh, meh. And yeah. 
SAM: I mean, he's stole it off of someone he killed here, right? 
TRAVIS: That's going to be my-- 
MARISHA: Hmm? 
LAURA: I think so. Yeah. 
SAM: He stole it off of somebody. 
TRAVIS: -- turn. 
MATT: Okay, finishes your go. 
LIAM: Some monstrosity. 
MATT: Ashton, you're up. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! I'm turning around and I'm going to book up the parapet. I'll use the chain if I have to, if that speeds me up. 
MATT: Okay, he's going to attack of opportunity on you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, whatever! 
MATT: It's going to attempt to grapple you. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Actually, I'll use my action to hold strikes in case something comes within... 
MATT: Did you move and then bonus action to get there? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Right, because you have-- 
LIAM: Cunning Action. 
MATT: -- Cunning Action. Then, yeah. Then you can use your action to hold it. Got it. All right. Attempt-- 
TALIESIN: Is that a reaction that they can take? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: You can take an attack to grapple. Doesn't do any damage, but it can attempt to hold you in place. So it's contested athletics. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Once again. 
TALIESIN: I have advantage on that. 
MATT: You do. 
LAURA: I do. 
MATT: Though he got a natural 20. (groaning) 
MATT: You can still roll a natural 20 as well. Right there. 
TALIESIN: Or I won't. 
MATT: Okay. So as you try and dart past-- 
MARISHA: Fuck! 
MATT: -- it reaches out (grunting impact) and holds you in place. Your speed is brought to zero. 
SAM: Gosh darn it. 
TALIESIN: But I can still attack? 
MATT: Yes, you can. 
TALIESIN: Oh! Wait! Actually. 
MATT: (squawks) It's trying to lift you up, its wings (flaps) 
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Fly it! Just get a new mount! 
TALIESIN: (sighs) That's actually insane, isn't it? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: So is it holding me, or is it? 
MATT: Yeah, its talon's wrapped around your arm and underneath your other elbow and it's holding you from moving away. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) Fuck! 
TALIESIN: Yes. Yes, it is. 
MATT: You can use your action to try and break free, if you want to. 
TRAVIS: Quite. Quite. 
MARISHA: A real pitch. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
TRAVIS: Could beat the shit out of it. 
TALIESIN: Or I can just beat the shit out of it. 
TRAVIS: Also possible. 
TALIESIN: I'm just going to beat the fucking shit out of it. 
MATT: Go for it! 
TALIESIN: Actually, that'll be an interesting thing. 
TRAVIS: When in doubt. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Beat the shit out of it. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a hit at it. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Let's not fuck this up. Yeah, that's 28 to hit. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something really interesting here. Let's see. Let's take 20 points of damage. 
MATT: 20 points of damage. All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm also going to push it five feet with the hit. 
MATT: Oh, that's true! 
LIAM: That's fun. 
MATT: Crack! 
LAURA: Cool. 
MATT: (crashing) That breaks your grapple on it. 
TALIESIN: Fuck right off! I'm going to head back up to where I'm going. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT: Okay, so getting at the top? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: All right. Make athletics check to try and clamber up the side with your hammer in one hand. You're almost having to toss the hammer in the air, climb up, and then re-catch it. 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: This is athletics advantage as well? 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: All right. Thank god! Fuck! 12? 
MATT: 12? It's going to get you-- 
TALIESIN: There's a chain, man! 
LAURA: How did it know where I was when I Psychic Lanced him? 
TALIESIN: So I do have also, I have 40 feet. 
MATT: Are you going up a level? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Which-- Do you mean? 
MATT: Are you. going up to where this guy is, or are you going off the side? 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to get as close to that fuck as possible. 
MATT: Okay, because there isn't a chain on this side of-- 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: There isn't? I thought I saw one. 
MATT: It's off this side and this side. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I thought there was a chain-- 
MATT: That's okay. 
TALIESIN: -- to get up there. 
MATT: A 12 is going to be tough. 
TALIESIN: I do also have stone earth walk. I don't know if that makes that a little easier or not. 
MATT: No, I understand. I'm just saying all your movement, right there. You can't move any further. That's going to take the rest of your turn to get there. 
TALIESIN: So I can't reach-- 
MATT: You are within melee range. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to take one more shot with the hammer, then. 
TRAVIS: Big whammy! 
TALIESIN: Big whammy. 
LIAM: I believe in Rod. 
TALIESIN: That's cocked. 28 to hit. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: All right. That's not bad. 22 points of damage. 
MATT: 22 points of damage. All right. 
TALIESIN: (explosion) 
TRAVIS: Jeez! 
TALIESIN: Just as I flip the hammer up, get up there, hit it hard, 28 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Dude! 
MATT: (grunts) 
TALIESIN: About fucking time! 
MATT: (growls) Growls off to the side. "Not ripe yet." 
TRAVIS: Not ripe yet? 
LAURA: What? Oh, ripe! Ripe! 
SAM: Ripe. Ripe. 
MATT: That finish your turn? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Fix it in post. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Was that? That wouldn't have been 25 feet in a straight line, would it? 
MATT: No, that was a crooked, upward line 
TALIESIN: Okay. That was crooked up, right? Yeah. I was like, "Yeah, there's no way I could have pulled that off." 
MATT: But good looking out. 
TALIESIN: I was just trying to do something. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
LAURA: Nice. 
TRAVIS: What do you mean, "Fuck?" That was great! 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: It's not what I want. 
TRAVIS: You smashed and pushed and then climbed and smashed some more! 
MATT: Okay. After striking it in the back, the creature glances back at the two of you and goes-- 
SAM: I push and I kick. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: -- (growls) "Your hunt is next." (whooshes) And leaps off the side. You both get the opportunity attacks on it. 
TALIESIN: I'm taking that opportunity attack. 
MARISHA: What'd he say? Your aunt is next? 
SAM: Yep. 
MATT: Your hunt is next. 
MARISHA: Oh! (laughs) 
SAM: It hates Ashton's aunt. 
MARISHA: Hates aunties. 
TRAVIS: You guys got to work on your Abyssal, all right? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Your Abyssal sucks. 
LAURA: Why? 
TALIESIN: Oh, you actually get a d4 also to attach to that. 
LIAM: For the hit? 
TALIESIN: For the hit, because you're within 10 feet of me. 
MATT: Yeah, that hits. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! Is there anything I can goddamn do with this? 23 to hit. 
MATT: You both hit. Go ahead and roll damage. 
LIAM: Little nine for me. 
MATT: Nine? Okay. 
LAURA: ♪ Little nine ♪ 
TALIESIN: Can I do any of this? No. No. Fuck! Not what I wanted. 17 points of damage. 
MATT: 17 points of damage. All right. 
TALIESIN: Shit! 
MATT: Both strike at it as it leaps off the tower. (whooshes) 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MARISHA: You got to be shitting me! 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
SAM: Oh my god! 
LAURA: He took landing damage, though, for sure! 
MATT: Yeah, he does. 
LAURA: Oh, he did? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Wow! 
MATT: He flew about 30 feet, little wings (laughs) and then fell the rest. So hits the ground, (impacts) rock and shale go firing out, splintering all directions, and the ground quakes on the impact, cracking beneath it. 
TALIESIN: The fuck are we going to do? 
MATT: He does take... That would be 16 points of bludgeoning damage, but it is resistant to non-magical. That brings it to eight. 
ASHLEY: Ugh! 
MATT: Lands. "Let's finish what we started!" 
ASHLEY: No! No! 
LAURA: Why? 
MATT: It's going to use its Horror Nimbus once again. 
LIAM: No! 
MATT: But you all are immune to it for the next 24 hours-- 
LAURA: Great! 
MATT: Because you all succeeded against it. It's now going to attempt to claw strike you (whooshes) for, that's going to be 16 to hit. 
ASHLEY: No! 
LAURA: It hits. 
ASHLEY: No, it doesn't because you have a plus eight! 
LAURA: No, I do not because I'm not next to Orym. 
MATT: Had that next to him. 
LIAM: She's got to be next to the shield. 
LAURA: I've got a AC of 15. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! 
MATT: That'll be-- 
SAM: I'm trying to get to you! 
MATT: 10 points of slashing damage. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm! 
MATT: Second claw strike. That's going to be a 27 to hit. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm! 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
MATT: For-- 
MARISHA: Already used my reaction. 
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage. 
LAURA: Uh-huh! 
MATT: Then the bite strike against you. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: This is-- 
MATT: That's going to be another 17 to hit. 
LAURA: That hits. 
TALIESIN: (gibberish) 
LAURA: Yeah, I am nothing, y'all. 
TALIESIN: This is fucked! 
SAM: Powerful. 
TALIESIN: This right here is fucked. 
SAM: Miss Independent and fierce. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay. 
LIAM: Glass cannons unite. 
LAURA: It doesn't matter, Matthew. 
SAM: It might if it pushes you past-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: 37 points of piercing damage. 
LAURA: I am unconscious. 
MATT: It is currently chewing the no longer moving body of Imogen within its jaw. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (chomps) 
TRAVIS: Oh boy! 
SAM: We got to get her out of the jaw. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy! 
MARISHA: Laudna fucking rages! 
MATT: As it's doing so, its eyes connect to you. 
MARISHA: To me? I just, like-- My Form of Dread expands even further as I look at it with intense anger. Let's go, bitch! 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. 
SAM: Dread-er? 
MATT: Its go. 
SAM: Hey, Matt? 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: Just out of curiosity, before you move on, from where Travis is looking is where I'm looking, there's a little gap in the towers there. Can I see what just happened? 
MARISHA: There's a nice little through line! 
MATT: Yeah! Yeah, you do. 
LAURA: Nice! 
MATT: You very much see what happened. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: That's clutch. 
SAM: Good to know! I can't do anything, but at least I can see! 
LAURA: No, but it's good to know that you knew! 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. With that, this gentleman here is now focused on the two of them. He's going to, with a grin, unleash on your fiendish ally at the moment. Two strikes against him. That hits. 
SAM: Get me over there. 
MATT: Yeah, that's even higher. That hits. So both strikes on him. 
SAM: Oh my god! It has long range. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
ASHLEY: So let's do this. 
MATT: 11 points on him. 
MARISHA: Healing Word? 
ASHLEY: I should've done that. 
SAM: Yeah, but it's 60 feet. 
MARISHA: Misty Step? 
SAM: Yeah, I'm 100 feet away. 
MATT: 15 points. So 26 points of damage to your fiend fellow. As he strikes with his claw, or yeah, with the big old claw swipe, and then with the great upward, the winged fiend (whooshes) takes both hits and (growls) looks like he's taken a couple hits. 
TRAVIS: You mean the fiend? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: But is still standing stalwart and furious. With that, both of these gentlemen here... Oh, no. They're not until later. 
MARISHA: Does it say anything in the spell about that? Like, does it-- 
LAURA: It's just a psychic, it doesn't come from an area. 
MATT: That one over there comes over to you. 
SAM: Yep. 
MATT: Tiny guy. (squawks) It's going to attack with its beak and its talons. 
SAM: Get off of me! 
MATT: (laughs) For a natural 20. 
SAM: Oh, well, all right, fine. 
MATT: And a 12. 
SAM: Miss! 
MATT: All right, so the natural 20, you do take 13 points of piercing damage as it strikes out with this beak-- 
SAM: Get off of me! 
MATT: Why'd I say beak? I'm looking at the wrong one there. That was the-- 
SAM: Mind your own beak! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All I heard was-- 
LAURA: Do you have a plan? 
MATT: Sorry. 
ASHLEY: I don't have a plan. (laughter) 
MATT: I was looking at the wrong sheet. 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: Instead, that is-- 
LAURA: It was Fearne! 
ASHLEY: So do you have a plan? 
MATT: It's nine points of piercing damage. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Is that literally what they said? "Do you have a plan?" 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
SAM and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
SAM: That's A+ level D&D. (laughter) 
SAM: Hey, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. (laughter) 
SAM: Do you? 
MARISHA: No. No. No plan. 
MATT: Then appearing back on the cage where the other one was, a much tinier little gnarled-looking impish creature appears and goes "(snarls)" looks at you both and sees that you've both resisted fear earlier-- 
LIAM: Just spattered in gore. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Just flies away. 
SAM: Oh, he just left the fight? 
MATT: Yep. Just like, "Nope." 
SAM: Oh nice! 
MATT: Doesn't even engage. 
LAURA: I don't want to fight them. 
MATT: (snarls) 
LAURA: I like imps. Imps are so cute! 
MATT: Orym, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
LAURA: Imps are cute. 
LIAM: Okay, Orym hops to this side of the tower, looks down, sees what he sees. 
LAURA: (chomps) (squeaks) 
LIAM: Fuck! And he leaps. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
LIAM: I'm going to stab. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: (whooshes) 
LIAM: You just tell me what that means for damage to me. 
MARISHA: No! 
MATT: You can make an acrobatics check to try and reduce it a little bit. 
LIAM: Natural one, which I'll reroll. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Come on. 
ASHLEY: Halfling! 
LIAM: What is that? That's such a tiny-- 
LAURA: That's a natural 20. 
LIAM: What is that? That's not a 20. That's a 17 plus... That's a 26. 
MATT: 26. Okay. So you reduce the damage a little bit. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So the full fall would've been, so that would be 6d6 bludgeoning damage. I'll reduce that by one of the tiers, so it's only 5d6. 
SAM: A-goosh! 
MATT: So you take 22 points of bludgeoning damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Yikes! 
MATT: From the impact against the creature as you're coming down with your blade. 
LIAM: I'm hoping that's a stab. Can I ask, since Laudna's on the other side of this thing's head from me, is it at advantage? 
MATT: I'll allow it. 
LIAM: Thank you. 
MATT: Since you took that much damage as part of the impact. I'd say the advantage is less from her helping you and more the sheer weight of you coming into it as part of the strike. 
LIAM: I am a minute meteor. (laughter) 
LIAM: That's a 24 to hit. 
MATT: 24 definitely hits. 
LIAM: All right. That's not going to be much. That is 10. Then, I yank it back out and then I shove it into what- ever this thing's ear hole is. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: So this is not an advantage now because there's no-- 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Okay. That's a natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Woo! 
LIAM: It's 12. 12 total. 
MATT: 12 total? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. Double strike. (slicing) 
SAM: Is he dead? Did he die? 
MATT: Carving through, you're starting to see it's seeping its dark Abyssal blood in places. It's showing some heavy wear and it's like (growls) trying to reach over the back, towards you. 
LIAM: Just for flavor, my shield hand, where the fingers wiggle go out, I try to dig that into the fur of this thing and that's the end of my turn. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Did it spit me out because he got stabbed in the ear? 
MATT: Yep. (spits) 
LAURA: That's good. 
MATT: (impacts) There you are. 
TALIESIN: Every little bit. 
LIAM: If I give him vertigo. 
MATT: All right. Laudna, you're up. Fearne, you're on deck. 
LIAM: His inner ear is all fucked. 
LAURA: (gags) 
TRAVIS: Laudna's up. Fearne on deck. 
MARISHA: I'm going to dump a Blight into him. I'm going to burn my 4th-level spell. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's a con save. 
MATT: Con save. 
MARISHA: Please fucking fail. 
MATT: That is with advantage. 
MARISHA: With advantage. 
MATT: That's going to put it at a 20. 
MARISHA: Okay, great. Is that half damage? 
MATT: Half damage, yeah. 
MARISHA: (long, heavy sigh) Advantage on con saves. 8d8, okay. Seven, 10. 
LAURA: It's got advantage on all saves. He had advantage on intelligence save, con save. 
MATT: Magic resistance is a bitch. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MARISHA: 18, 26, 34 damage. 
MATT: 34 damage reduced to half, would be 17. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: 17 points of necrotic damage. All the blood that's pouring out of its jaws it tends to dry up and burn away as one of its eyes dims, and you see these parts of its fur began to fall out like it has this patchy, heavy, infected mange that appears on the side of its face. (snarling) 
MARISHA: I'm going to do my last Quickened Spell that I can do unless I get more sorcery points, which I might end up doing. I'm going to try this fucking again, the Shocking Grasp. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: So as I'm sucking his life force, and then I'm going to chamber it and pump it back through as a electric shock. 
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack. 
TRAVIS: Through his A. 
MARISHA: (groans) Why?! 
MARISHA: Natural one. 
ASHLEY: No! 
MARISHA: I just want to get away from him. 
TRAVIS: The dice are talking. 
LIAM: ♪ Sail away, Sail away, Sail away ♪ 
TRAVIS: That pendulum. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: (rhythmic breathing) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
LIAM: We're getting some rough rolls. 
MATT: I know. 
TRAVIS: Play the game, play the game. We're good, we're good. 
MARISHA: Can I just-- 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I was going to try and drag Imogen's body away, but Orym is there. 
LIAM: Curb stomp, y'all. 
MARISHA: Can I just, with my Form of Dread, tower over top of her and shield her with my body as much as I can? 
MATT: If you want to. 
LIAM: "With my body." 
MATT: So you move over and lean over and shield her? Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Stand between it and her? 
MARISHA: Yep, that's it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: Fucking why not? 
SAM: He'll use you to beat her. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah. I just-- 
LAURA: Ow! Ow! 
MARISHA: -- enraged a terrifying-- 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: Grab you like Loki. 
ASHLEY: I believe that I probably saw through what happened? 
TRAVIS: ♪ I believe ♪ 
MATT: You don't yet, actually. You're still up over on this side, so you'd have to come around to do it. 
MARISHA: Also, side note. 
LIAM: Oh god. 
TRAVIS: We can't see anything. 
MARISHA: Pâté was with Chetney. I want to have Pâté keep following group two, by the way. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Group two is scatter-fucked. 
SAM: I mean, you've seen me-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: -- try to get over there. 
MATT: We'll say he's loose in that area. I can't find the mini at the moment, but-- 
MARISHA: He might be-- 
SAM: You know which way I'm trying to go. 
ASHLEY: I do. 
MATT: This one will do. 
ASHLEY: I feel like it-- All right. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to make my way to FCG, 35 feet. 
MATT: All right. So you move over here. That guy does have his opportunity attack on you as you move to FCG. 
ASHLEY: That's fine. That's a person. 
MATT: Squeeze past that rock in that direction. 
SAM: Then you'll be able to also fly? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Gets one swipe at you-- 
SAM: After your turn? 
MATT: -- with the greatsword as you move past for a 16? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: You duck underneath. It hits off the back of your breast plate, scrapes off hits the stone. 
LAURA: You should make this go away. 
MATT: You keep pushing through, squeeze between the stones, and there you are. 
ASHLEY: All right. Okay. Now I'm going to Wild Shape into my big bird, my shoebill. 
MATT: Okay. Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Into Big Bird. 
ASHLEY: (squawk) 
SAM: Is that an action? 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Oh, because you're not that kind of-- 
ASHLEY: I know. 
LAURA: So you can't do it? 
SAM: But if he did that, I don't-- (pigeon coos) (laughs) Okay. 
ASHLEY: I didn't need to do that now. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
LAURA: What, so you can't-- 
ASHLEY: Because I can't also fly him. 
SAM: If you turned before you moved. 
LIAM: Well, you can move me, you just can't do-- 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. If you turned before you moved then you could use your movement. 
TRAVIS: Speed? 
ASHLEY: (sighs) That would've been really smart to do that. 
MATT: If you want to do that, we can-- 
ASHLEY: Is that okay? 
MATT: Yeah, that's fine. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. That was the plan, I just didn't think about the-- 
LIAM: This isn't The Hague. 
SAM: Order of operations. 
ASHLEY: Order of operations. 
MATT: The 16 attack on this form as you leave it, does that hit your bird form? 
ASHLEY: Stand by. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Probably. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: It's going to make it drop. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Depends on how many hit points your bird form has. 
SAM: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: Does it have more than 20? 
ASHLEY: It has more than 20. 
SAM: Okay! 
MATT: Okay, yeah. Takes 12 points of slashing damage-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. That's okay, that's okay, that's okay. 
MATT: -- as you get struck on the way through. What's the fly speed? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 80. 
LIAM: Yes! 
MATT: 80. 30, and you're trying to fly where? 
ASHLEY: I'm trying to pick up FCG. 
TRAVIS: Grab FCG? 
SAM: By the hair. 
MATT: So, 30, action to grab and pick up. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 is about here. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Does that feel good? 
SAM: That's great! 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: You're being held right there by Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Mister can also do some things. No, wait. Is Mister still out? 
MATT: Mister's still out, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. So what I'm going to have Mister do-- 
MATT: (monkey hoot) 
ASHLEY: -- is, if he's coming along with me, can I have him shoot some flame seeds at the lock? One of the locks on the cages. 
MATT: Okay, sure. 
ASHLEY: To try to start to melt it. 
MATT: So it'll glide over. What's his fly speed? 
MARISHA: Nice. 
MATT: Mister's fly speed is-- 
ASHLEY: Mister's fly speed is-- Sorry, hold on. 30 feet. 
MATT: 30 feet, okay. So he gets about there and he can fire. 
ASHLEY: Flame Seed is 60 feet. 
MATT: So yeah, that should be within range. Yeah, within range. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: It's going to be a hard hit, but we can see if he can do it. 
ASHLEY: Oof. 13. 
MATT: 13, unfortunately-- 
ASHLEY: Wait, can I add your six to a-- 
SAM: Yes, let me look. 
TRAVIS: Bonded Blessing? 
SAM: Let me look how long it lasts. 
MATT: Well, technically you're bonded to her. This would be Mister. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Oh, yes. 
MATT: That's still on you, unfortunately. 
ASHLEY: That's okay, that's okay. Okay, that's the turn. 
MATT: All right. So you fly over that way, finishing your go. This vrock is going to fly up once more-- 
SAM: Oh jeez. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: -- to the top. 
LIAM: Are you ready to vrock?! 
MATT: It's going to try and grab you again. 
TALIESIN: Fine. 
MATT: It's trying to harry you at this point. 
LIAM: What a petty B. 
MATT: Another athletics check on your end. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: All right. So out of curiosity, can I-- Okay. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I can't counter this. This is not like an attack that I can counter. 
MATT: No. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
SAM: All right. 
ASHLEY: Okay. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: All of my stuff just doesn't help. 
TRAVIS: Ragé. 
TALIESIN: 19. Wait, hold on, sorry, 19. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: 19. 
MATT: 19. Okay, you succeed to break free from its grasp, it's going to attempt to use its second attack to try and grab you once more. Its last attempt. All right, make another attempt to be free. Beat an 18. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 24. 
MATT: 24, yeah. You're too strong, but it's what his tactic is. This one here is going to dart down actually from ahead and attempt to strike that gentleman over there. Natural 20. 
LAURA: Ugh. Oh, that's good. That's the red guy? 
MATT: That's against him. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: The second one misses. So it gets the first strike of it. It's going to be 18 points of damage to him. All right, so he takes 18 points of damage from the flying creature there as it swoops back up. He's going to take an opportunity. Actually, it'll stay within combat range, it doesn't want to take the opportunity attack. They're just now ganging up on him. 
TRAVIS: On what was his name? 
MATT: On him. 
TRAVIS: On-- 
LAURA: (laughs) On him. 
MATT: On him. 
SAM: Leon Stephan. 
LAURA: Oh god, there's two of them? 
TRAVIS: Leon Esteban. 
TALIESIN: Vrocks. 
MATT: All right. FCG, you're up. Imogen, you're on deck. 
SAM: I think I'm within 60 feet of Imogen. 
MATT: I believe you might be. Yes, you are. 
LAURA: Oh yes. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: It's tight, but yes. 
SAM: May your unending belief in the Changebringer heal you! I'll cast Healing Word. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: She rolls her eyes in unconsciousness. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: Begrudgingly heals. 
SAM: I will waste a 1st-level Healing Word on you. 
MATT and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: Thanks. 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: You get four points. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: But you're up, right? 
MATT: Imogen is conscious. 
LAURA: Yep. 
LIAM: Absolutely. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: If he hits her, she dies. 
LAURA: I will die again, but that's okay. 
SAM: For sure. 
LIAM: But you won't auto crit. 
MARISHA: But you won't-- Yeah, exactly. 
LIAM: On death saves. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: This round. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: That's my bonus action. My action-- Boy, I can't do much, I'm being held aloft by a bird-Fearne. I will use my-- (machine whirring) I'll fire a bolt, a bolt thrower. I'll fire at the big guy. 
MATT: At him? Go for it. 
SAM: Whoa, that's terrible. Nine. (laughs) Nope. 
MATT: Nine, unfortunately- whee!- goes wide. All right. 
SAM: That's all I got. 
MARISHA: Does that thing ever hit? 
MATT: Finishing Imogen's turn-- 
SAM: No. 
MATT: Sorry, FCG's turn, Imogen, you are up. Literally conscious. 
TRAVIS: Does it ever hit? 
MATT: You're on the ground still, coming to. Your whole body aches in terrifying pain, but you're back in yourself. You look off to the side, your face pulled up from the stonework and the creature is looming right above you, cackling and currently-- 
MARISHA: Laudna is right above. 
LAURA: Laudna's right above me. 
LIAM: Laudna's on top of her. 
LAURA: I see the creature past Laudna? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- This is dumb. 
TRAVIS: That's what you want to wake up to. 
LAURA: I'm going to reach over as I'm on the ground and grab a hold of the creature's foot and try to cast Shocking Grasp on him as well. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
MATT: Okay, roll an attack. 
MARISHA: Just want to get away. 
LAURA: ♪ Just want to get away. ♪ 
LIAM: ♪ I want to get away. ♪ 
SAM: Wow. 
LAURA: Wow, that went far. 18? 
LIAM: ♪ I want to fly away ♪ 
MATT: 18 just hits. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: Okay. So that's 2d8 damage. 
MARISHA: Then bitch, you better run! 
LAURA: ♪ 2d8 ♪ 
LIAM: Do I also take it? 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: No, it's a single target. It was the metal conductivity earlier we were talking about. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: She was using the metal, which went through other things. 
TRAVIS: That's the sound they make. (electrifying stutters) 
LAURA: That's 12. (electrifying stutters) 12. 
MATT: Points of-- 
LAURA: Lightning damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Can't take reactions 'til the start of his next turn, finally fucking. 
MARISHA: That's all I've been trying to do! 
MATT: So it gets the hit, shrugs it off a bit. 
LAURA: Okay, that's fine because-- 
MATT: But still cannot take reactions. 
LAURA: Yes, and I am going to use another-- I'm going to Quicken a spell. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I am going to cast Invisibility on me and Laudna. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, no way! 
SAM: That works. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LIAM: Good move. 
ASHLEY: Good move. 
MATT: I'll say this is Laudna because it's the banshee. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
MARISHA: Wowzers. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
LIAM: Wow. 
MATT: You are still on the ground. 
TRAVIS: Holy crap. 
MATT: Conscious. 
LIAM: Don't move. They'll never know we're here. 
LAURA: Yeah. In her head-- 
TRAVIS: Don't breathe. 
LAURA: -- I'm going to say: Run away. 
MARISHA: You do the same. 
LAURA: I'm going to use my movement to get away from him as far as I can. 
MATT: Okay, so half your movement to get up. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Then 15 feet this way? 
LAURA: I'm going to run back this way. 
MARISHA: ♪ Run towards-- ♪ 
MATT: This way? 
MARISHA: ♪ -- the healer. ♪ 
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to run back towards, I don't know if I could see FCG, but I'm going to head back towards the map. 
MATT: You only have 15 feet of movement. 
LAURA: Okay, well then, I'm behind him. 
MATT: If you go around him, you're still in combat range with him, otherwise you have to move a little wider. 
LAURA: Well, he can't take a reaction. 
MATT: That's true, yeah. 
LAURA: So I want to get away. 
MATT: Okay, so go there? 
LAURA: ♪ Away, away, sure. ♪ 
MATT: All righty. That finishes your turn-- 
MARISHA: Damn. 
MATT: -- Imogen. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh god, please, I hope that works. 
MATT: This entity over here angrily is going to unleash on this gentleman, against him on this side. He's going to strike twice frustratedly. 
TRAVIS: Come on, dope sword. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Come on. 
LIAM: Yes, go, Neo. 
MATT: That hits as well, barely. Bad low roll, but still hits. First hit is going to be-- 
TRAVIS: Slice and fire and radiant, all... at once. 
MATT: Yep. Will be-- 
SAM: Are you Percival de Rolo? 
MATT: 16. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: 22, is going to pump a 3rd-level slot into that. 
TRAVIS: Divine Smite. 
MATT: Yep, Divine Smite. 
LAURA: Could I have pulled Laudna with me? 
LIAM: You could only move half speed. 
MATT: Not really. 
LAURA: Yeah, not with my speed. 
MATT: You would've barely moved. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: That will be. 
TRAVIS: (grunts) We're safe. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LAURA: Just back up five feet. (laughter) 
MATT: 45 points of damage on that first strike against. 
LIAM: Strike you with the fury of power gaming! 
MATT: (chuckles) 
TRAVIS: Fuck! 
MATT: The second strike. 
MARISHA: Come on, Joaquin. 
ASHLEY: Wow. (laughter) 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: That's pretty good. 26, 32. 
LIAM: Carry the 20. 
MATT: He's going to use a 2nd-level slot to Smite again and add-- 
TALIESIN: How much damage did you take on that jump? 
LIAM: (noises of uncertainty) 
ASHLEY: 20-something. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: That'll do it. 
SAM: Skaboosh! 
MATT: Carves him down and then turns to this entity here. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: Doesn't give a shit and takes off 60 feet in this direction and is going to be darting over this way. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: Does get an attack of opportunity from that vrock over there, which does hit for-- 
LAURA: You're a griffin? 
LIAM: No, the duckbill. 
ASHLEY: Shoebill. 
MATT: 11 points of damage to him. 
SAM: A shitty bird. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm sure he has protection because he's amazing. 
MATT: All righty, finishing his go, Chetney, you're up, with Ashton on deck. 
TRAVIS: Well, everybody's coming this way, which is awesome. I'm going to try and run through. Will it cost an action or a bonus action to pick up the sword as I run through the portal? 
LAURA: You grabbed the sword, Chetney? 
MARISHA: He's doing it right now. 
MATT: I'll say you can pick it up pretty quick, you can do it as part of your action. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll snatch it up as I'm running by, and then I'll hit the brakes right-- I'll try and jump this little chasm, if I can, on my way to that cage. I'll pause here, if I can. 
SAM: Going to go bust out some-- 
MATT: Pause right there? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'll take the scythe and I should be able to, yep, see the horribleness that is hopefully 60 feet away from that point. Can we get a ruler? Can I get a ruler? Putting it through, 60 feet is just at the edge of him. 
TRAVIS: So I need to get closer? 
MATT: Well, it depends. I don't know what you're trying to do. 
TRAVIS: I was going to cast a spell that's 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet, is it a radius? 
TRAVIS: It is, it is. So I'm going to wind up the scythe and I'm going to cast Shatter through that little line like a lacrosse stick. 
MATT: What's the radius on it? 
TRAVIS: It's 10 feet, 10-foot sphere. 
MATT: -- is just short enough to not get you in the blast radius. (laughter) 
LIAM: (groans) 
TRAVIS: I can put it wherever I want to, so I could shorten it, if I needed to, but yes, perfect. Shatter, and I'll send it that way. 
MATT: All right. What's the constitution save? 
TRAVIS: 14. 
MATT: 14 is yeah, he succeeds; he has advantage on it. 
TRAVIS: 17 points of thunder damage. 
MATT: Thunder damage, reduced to-- 
TRAVIS: It's loud and hopefully gets his attention turning this way. I'll use the rest-- 
MATT: (rumbling thunder) 
TRAVIS: That's my whole speed, and my bonus action would be, can I use my bonus action to keep moving towards the cage? I can, as a cunning action. 
MATT: Yeah, if you want to. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll keep coming towards the cage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Can I see who's inside of this one? Or which side the door is on. 
MATT: The door's on this side. 
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, can I run up for the door? 
MATT: Go up to the door, yeah, and it is latched like the others, and you see there are two figures in there. One is a half-elven girl with blonde hair in a pixie cut that's dirty. You can see her arm-bound in chains, and she is glancing over with a tense jaw as you approach, pulls away, still dubiously looking towards you, and there's a soldier who is on the ground leaning on one leg, looks like they're heavily injured who is squinting and looking up in the direction of you as you approach. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Let's be honest, I'm not the worst thing you've seen today. I'm going to get you out. That'll be the end of my turn because I can't do anything else. At the end of your turn, a voice seems to push into the back of your mind. "Rise in glory. Take what you've taken and together, we will do great things." (laughter) 
MARISHA: No! 
LAURA: Oh my god, you got another one! 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MARISHA: Not another one! 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Why you? Why every fucking time? 
TRAVIS: That's three! 
SAM: But it seems like a good guy sword. 
TRAVIS: Trifecta! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I am whole! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Sweet home intelligent sword ♪ 
TALIESIN: Nothing bad can come from it. 
MARISHA: What? 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
SAM: Maybe this one's a good guy sword. 
ASHLEY: It sounds like one. 
LAURA: It sounds like it. 
TRAVIS: They always start that way. (laughter) 
MATT: (laughs) Truth. All right, that finishes your turn, Chetney, Ashton, you're up. 
TRAVIS: What are the fucking chances? 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to-- Oh fuck, how are we going to do this? 
LAURA: How do you-- 
TALIESIN: How do I want to do this? Do I want to just be-- You know what? Let's be blunt, fuck it. The time for trying to be cool looking is over. I'm going to head over to the edge of that fucking wall, take a look down. 
MATT: (patters) 
TALIESIN: Fuck, and I'm taking the jump and I'm going to try and land-- 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: -- and clip that motherfucker right in the head. 
MARISHA: Yeah, come on! 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Ooh. That's a badass move! 
MATT: Are you attempting to-- 
MARISHA: Come on. 
MATT: -- slow your fall? 
TALIESIN: How? 
MATT: An acrobatics check to try and land carefully. 
TALIESIN: Oh! Sure. 
LIAM: Orym double takes. 
LAURA: Come on, come on. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a hit and then the three points of contact. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Just trying to come straight down and get that three point left. I do not have-- 
TRAVIS: The old airborne school fall. 
TALIESIN: Do I have-- 
MATT: Not in acrobatics. 
TRAVIS: 20 miles an hour. No problem. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: All right, let's see what happens. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: No, that's eight. 
MATT: Okay, no worries. 
TRAVIS: Knees, hip, elbow. 
TALIESIN: It's fine. I'll take it. 
MATT: So as part of the fall, you do take-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, top rope. 
MATT: 26 points of bludgeoning damage, but you are raging, so it's halved to 13. 
TALIESIN: 13 points? Why was I even worried? 
MATT: But you (whoosh), leap off the top, hammer in the air. (intensifying zooms) 
LIAM: Terrifying. 
MATT: (crashing impact) 
TRAVIS: Dude! (explosion) 
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack. 
TALIESIN: Do I have advantage because of Orym or not? 
MATT: No, because he's just there. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: But you can take a reckless if you want to. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm taking it reckless, fuck this shit. 
MATT: Go for it. Give yourself advantage. I'd say jumping off the top is pretty reckless. 
TALIESIN: Somehow, it still sucks. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. It is. 
TALIESIN: 16, for some strange fucking reason. 
MATT: 16 misses. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MARISHA: No! 
MATT: As you leap off the top-- 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: -- the creature glances up. "I know your tricks!" Steps back with its arm, as you (heavy impact) Hit the ground, leaving a secondary crater (crashes) Right where the one he had left, cracking the ground even further. Stones fly and then tumble to the ground around you. It sumo lands its other foot. "(growls)" 
TALIESIN: Hi. I'm going to take my second shot. 
MATT: Go for it. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
LAURA: Who is this? 
MARISHA: Ashton versus big baddie. 
TALIESIN: Much better. 16, 26, 26 to hit. 
MATT: 26 definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: All right, I am going to take my fucking shot. ♪ Am I going to do anything else ♪ That's-- Yeah, let's hold off on that. Because it doesn't really-- Yeah, fuck it. I'm also going to burn some of the ring to add, I know it doesn't do shit, but I'm adding that 1d8 of fire damage. 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to add a chaos burst because why the fuck not? Add a-- 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Let's add... 2d6 lightning damage to this, too. 
MATT: All the dice. Do it, do it. 
TALIESIN: 10 lightning damage. Eight lightning damage, excuse me. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Then. Yes! That's what I'm talking about. 15, 25, 27 points of bludgeoning damage. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
TALIESIN: No, I'm sorry. Seven, 19 points of damage and then eight points of fire damage. 
TRAVIS: So 27 total. 
MATT: Right, the fire's reduced by half. 
TALIESIN: Fire is reduced by half, though. 
MATT: Okay, got you. 
TALIESIN: (pfft) 
MATT: "(growls)" 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take your tusk and turn it into a fucking tankard. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (claps) (laughter) 
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn? 
TALIESIN: Yep! 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: Amazing. 
MATT: It's now its turn. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
LIAM: Up! 
MATT: It is furious. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: But it's also looking pretty hurt. 
SAM: It's going to try to get away. 
MATT: It's going to look at you-- 
MARISHA: No, no, no. Don't let it go. 
MATT: -- and grin and it's going to watch as its outer form-- 
ASHLEY: (shouts) No! 
MATT: -- begins to shimmer. 
LAURA: No, no, no! 
MATT: (vibrates) 
TALIESIN: Do I have anything I can do about that? 
MATT: It's going to teleport. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: What happens with me on it? 
MATT: You fall to the ground 10 feet. 
LIAM: (groans) 
TRAVIS: Stick your finger in its ear! 
MATT: 120 feet. 
LIAM: This doesn't count as-- It's definitely not-- No, it doesn't. I don't need to ask. 
TALIESIN: We don't get a reaction hit to that, do we? 
LIAM: The amount of times Fjord got out of a pinch. 
MATT: Unfortunately, no. So that's 85 to there. 
LAURA: Right into the jaws of our red buddy. 
MATT: It's going to teleport over to here. 
SAM: Jesus! 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MATT: You do take one point of bludgeoning damage, falling onto the ground. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: From on top. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You can see its wings starting to flap and it's definitely making an escape. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: ♪ Makin' an escape ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: Nice. 
TRAVIS and SAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Oh, I love it. 
SAM: ♪ Downtown ♪ 
MATT: This vrock's also begin swooping with it. They're following their leader. 
LAURA: You little bitches! 
MATT: That brings us now-- Now the people over here begin to leave the cage. Feeling safe from this point now. 
TRAVIS: Where'd that scary bitch go? 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: They're going to start climbing down. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: To the inside to get away from the battle. 
SAM: She electrocuted us then left. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Open, got us out, took our spot, electrocuted us, threw us back in here. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: I don't know where the ladies are. 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: Got Ash here. There's no enemies. I'm not going to make it, but I would go in pursuit. So I think that Orym would, with his boots of striding and springing, I would use movement and action to run and bolt up as much of this rock face and up to the top of that wall. If I can make it over it and land on the other side, great, if not, I'll get as far as I get. 
MATT: That's your movement right there to get for your 30 feet leaping up over there. 
LIAM: Yeah. I'll use that as my running start to do a full leap, 20 feet to the top of that rock and skip again and go 10 feet up to the top for the final of my 30 and if that's as far as I get, that's where I'll be. 
MATT: Yep, that's as far as you get, up to the top and you can see where it has appeared on the opposite side and its wings are flapping. 
LIAM: That's all I can do. 
MATT: All right, finishing your-- 
LIAM: There's no baddie. I can't see the map. There's nobody down below of me is there? 
MATT: Nope. 
LIAM: Okay, good. 
MATT: You do see red wings. Laudna. 
MARISHA: Well, we already said there was a big winged guy who was helping us. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Big winged guy ♪ 
MATT: Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to dart towards FCG and this cage. 
MATT: 30 gets you about there. Do you want to double move? 
MARISHA: Yeah, why not? 
MATT: Okay, that'll get you invisibly over to this cage side there. 
MARISHA: Is that where the door is? 
MATT: The door would be on this side here. So about five more feet to get over to where that door is. 
MARISHA: As I run by, can I be like: FCG! 
SAM: (yells) Who's talking to me? 
MARISHA: I'm invisible, but Imogen is really hurt, but also invisible. She's-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: She's near where Ashton is. 
SAM: Okay, I'll let her come to me and I'll give her a hug of healing. 
MARISHA: Yeah, let her feel around for you. 
SAM: She can see me, right? 
MARISHA: Yes, exactly. But go in that general area. 
TRAVIS: I may have cast Blindness on her. I'm not sure. 
TALIESIN: I kind of want to try and kill this fuck. 
MARISHA: Is it the bonus action to dart? Do I still have an action? 
MATT: Well, it was a movement and then it was an action to get over there, your rest of your movement. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: So you have a bonus action still. 
TALIESIN: I take a-- 
MARISHA: Casting anything drops my invisibility, right? 
MATT: It does. 
TALIESIN: I have a 25% chance. 
MARISHA: I'll hold. 
MATT: You'll hold? Okay. Finishing your turn, Laudna. Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: Boo. 
ASHLEY: May I-- Okay, I want to be able to drop-- 
SAM: Leave me! 
ASHLEY: -- my form, but-- 
MATT: Because FCG-- 
ASHLEY: -- still cast a spell because I can drop it with a bonus action? 
MATT: I think so, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'd like to fly towards the big boy over here. 
SAM: (shouts) Leave me here! 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: So I can be within-- 
SAM: (yells) 
ASHLEY: Within 30 feet of him. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah. Your movement is-- 
LAURA: She takes you with her. 
MATT: -- 60, right? 
ASHLEY: 80. 
MATT: 80? Oh, yeah. You can definitely get there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Then drop? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Get him, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Then I'd like to cast. I'm going to cast Blight again at 5th-level. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's a con save. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Has advantage. 
MARISHA: He has advantage on those. 
LAURA: He's got advantage all his damn saves. 
TRAVIS: But-- 
MARISHA: But-- 
MATT: He rolled really bad. 
SAM and MARISHA: Ooh! 
MATT: He rolled a six and a four. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA and MARISHA: Ooh! 
MATT: So even with his bonus, that puts him at a highest of 12. 
ASHLEY: Okay, it was 18 that he had to hit. 
MARISHA: Kill this motherfucker! 
ASHLEY: All right. Help me keep count. I got to do this. I got nine of them. So we've got seven. Seven plus 15. 
MATT: Seven plus 15? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: 22. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Plus seven. 
TRAVIS: 28. 
MATT: 29. 
TRAVIS: 29, sorry. 
ASHLEY: Plus five. 
SAM: Seven plus 15? 
LAURA: You got one more. 
SAM: No. Oh, yes. 
TRAVIS: It was 22 plus-- 
ASHLEY: Plus four. 
LIAM: 38. 
ASHLEY: 38. 
MATT: 38. How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Fearnie! Fearnie! 
ASHLEY: All right. Okay. I didn't think this was going to happen. 
MARISHA: All night. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. I'm going to-- I'm going to, what is it? Okay, it's necromantic energy. It's going to whoosh all over him. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Just a beautiful glitter and just fluff and then it's going to cause a lot of pain. It's going to hurt real bad. 
MATT: It starts flying up a little bit and looks at the weird glittery energy, and it looks back at you. "(snorts)" It's about to take off in a flight, as its wings suddenly (swooshes) get pulled back and it falls to the ground. You watch as these black vines reach up from the ground. (impacts) Wrapping around it like it's tethering it to the floor, as it gets pulled down, you hear in your mind, "(growls) I'll find you. I'll kill you. I'll eat you and wear you. I'll--" Right at that time, the vines are digging into its body and you see it digging under its skin and its flesh and it's tearing through in places before its eyes go to a pale, sickly white and then suddenly the vines just tear it apart from the inside out. (wet explosion) Slivers of it splash onto the ground and then burn away into smoke and ash, leaving chunks of tusk and bone in the ground behind as it vanishes. 
LAURA: Tusk is on the ground still. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. No, that's mine. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab both the tusks. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: If I can. 
MATT: The rest of the vrocks definitely take off. The intensity of the current threat seems to, in the moment-- 
LIAM and SAM: (sighs) 
MATT: -- be quelled. The winged fiend figure was about to dash in the direction and sees the entity fall apart, relaxes and lands back on its feet. The wings (flutters) coming to rest upon its back. 
ASHLEY: You. Who are you? 
MATT: Looks around to make a-- Take in the current scene. "It seems there is no immediate danger." It's walking towards you. (footsteps) While it's doing so, what do the rest of you do? 
LIAM: Orym's shouting from the top of the wall. Imogen! Laudna! 
SAM: I'm going to get down off my little stoop and also look around for Imogen. 
MARISHA: We're here. 
LAURA: I'm over here. 
ASHLEY: We're safe! 
LAURA: I'll start walking towards FCG. 
SAM: Get over here. 
TALIESIN: I'll help you up. 
TRAVIS: Can I take a long fingernail and start to lock pick the lock on this cage? 
MARISHA: I will do the same-- 
MATT: Go for it. 
MARISHA: -- on the other one. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a moment to start cracking all of the rocks that have the sigils on them. I'm walking around powdering that shit. 
MATT: Go for it. With every heavy impact, they crack and sunder and whatever lingering fiendish energy was currently bound to some of these ritualistic circles, it fades and dissipates with its destruction. 
TRAVIS: 29. 
MATT: 29? (lock turning) You release that one and open it. 
MARISHA: Seven. 
MATT: Seven. You're having a rough time with that one. 
MARISHA: Oh, fuck it. It already worked once. Ice, freeze it. 
TRAVIS: Freezing. 
MARISHA: Freeze the lock. 
TRAVIS: Liquid nitrogen. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: It takes you a moment, but with them sitting back, you manage to with the help of your friends, to break open the lock and open the door. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: Indeed, within these cages, there are a number of figures. You see two members of the Tempest Blades. Jennis, who you have seen before, though it's been a bit. Erana, who is a person you've seen around, but not had a lot of interaction with. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: And indeed, Baernie. Who is in the process of tending to what looks to be a dislocated shoulder, but is still remaining stoic in the face of recent events. 
LIAM: Okay, and invisibility dropped on you two? 
MARISHA: It would've with me casting the spell. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: It hasn't dropped on me, but I'll drop it myself. 
LIAM: Okay, if I see that, then I bolt into a run towards Maeve. I slide down on my knees. 
MATT: Baernie, you mean? 
LIAM: Baernie, I mean, yeah. 
MATT: As soon as Baernie looks over and sees you, runs up and gives a massive grasping hug and picks you up and then "(groans)" Just still holds onto you with the other arm and sets you back down, but holds you. 
LIAM: Take it slow, take it slow. 
MATT: You can feel there's a heaping sob into your shoulder and then the control takes over and she pulls away and looks at you. You can see the dirt smears in her face and those vibrant brown eyes that look back at you. There's a combination of... Of fear and trauma that is now fading into a warmth and a... A thank you of reunion. 
LIAM: Take a minute. 
MATT: "I knew they'd come for us. I didn't think it'd be you." 
LIAM: Oh, it was just chance. We got home. I got home. And my friends and-- Tempest sent us out. Just in time, looks like. 
MATT: "I think so." 
MARISHA: Do I see the other two who were up top? 
MATT: You do. These are two-- Well, one of them was Jennis. The gnomish Blade that you saw earlier. 
MATT: That was up in my cage? 
MATT: Yeah, that was up at the top there when they first arrived. Then the other two figures there are amongst the crowd here are two Iridon Bastion soldiers that were taken prisoner as survivors from the assault-- of the original place named Uwon and Diedrich. 
LIAM: Catch your breath. Let us just take stock of this. 
MATT: "Indeed." 
LIAM: Is everyone okay? 
SAM: Need some healing there? 
MARISHA: Help her, FCG. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, unless we're going to take a little resty rest right here, then, in that case, save your spells, you know? Are we taking a little-- 
SAM: I don't know. 
LAURA: -- resty rest? 
SAM: That's a good question. 
TRAVIS: We will. 
LIAM: That tracks. 
TRAVIS: We got two more people in my cage as well. The pixie haircut and the soldier looking. 
TALIESIN: I can take a-- 
MATT: The pixie haircut was Baernie. That's the one that he's been talking about. So, yeah, you freed all the survivors. 
MARISHA: Five in total? 
MATT: Total of five, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Hell, take a rest. I don't know. This place is kind of nice. Maybe we can set up a headquarters or something. 
LAURA: As long as nothing comes back. 
MARISHA: I'm going to look at the druids. 
MATT: The horned figure-- 
SAM: Oh, yeah, him. 
MARISHA: This guy. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know. 
MATT: Who's walked towards you. Approaches. 
SAM: Tomas. 
MATT: "I'm Teven Klask." 
TRAVIS: Teven? 
MARISHA: Teven Klask. 
MATT: "What are you called?" 
ASHLEY: Me or us as a group? I'm Fearne. All of us, we're the Bells Hells. Pleased to meet you. 
MATT: "Bells Hells." 
SAM: Hells, yeah, Hells. We got something in common. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Do we? 
ASHLEY: Well, what are you doing here and why were you fighting against them? 
MATT: This entity is not acknowledging any of you, for the most part, it's just focusing on Fearne. "I'm one of the many champions of my patron." 
LAURA: Patron. 
MATT: "Some who watch his domain and others like me that act as his agents through many realms. To some I am known as the Retribution of the Hells. A disruptor, an assassin, a scout. Me? I just do what is necessary. To whom do you owe fealty?" 
ASHLEY: That all was so... Hot. What did you just ask me? I'm just really-- 
MATT: "To whom do you owe fealty?" 
SAM: Who's your god? 
TRAVIS: To whom do you get filthy? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Myself. I don't know. Who were you a patron for? 
LAURA: Of. 
ASHLEY: Of, of. 
LIAM: Who's your patron? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Who's your patron? 
MATT: Gives you a keen look through your words and gives a knowing nod. "You are outside of the knotted weave." 
LAURA: The knotted weave. 
MATT: "I kneel to Asmodeus." 
TRAVIS: Asmodeus, the Lord of the Hells. 
TALIESIN: That makes sense. 
LAURA: Oh fuck. 
LIAM: Devils versus demons. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: "While I know not the details. something brews in Exandria that has left my Lord shaken, and me with the unique orders to, unless hostility greets me, treat with those who walk under the light of the Primes or outside of it. So you are lucky today we meet on common ground. The future, I do not know if it holds quite such grace." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: So you're working to help the gods? 
TRAVIS: He's only talking to Fearne. 
MATT: Just looks over in your direction. 
ASHLEY: So you're looking to help the gods? 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "I am looking to help my god. And in some ways, all of the gods in this moment remember they are brethren." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: I've sworn fealty to a god! (laughter) 
SAM: We had a vote about it and everything. Me and Chetney, actually, over here, the Wolfman, are the most godly among us. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Awoo. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I've met-- Oh god, what was her name? The Raven woman, the Matron of Ravens. 
MATT: "(grimaces)" 
ASHLEY: Oh, you don't like her. (laughter) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, I was neither here nor there, but. 
MATT: "This armistice has historical precedent. Do not feel nervous. Enjoy it while it lasts, lest you seek new interests in your future. There are many gifts that can be granted on certain paths." 
SAM: Do you want to follow Asmodeus? 
ASHLEY: What does that entail? 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: If I were to follow Asmodeus, like what-- 
MATT: He leans in a bit closer and he's tall, like a good, like six and a half, seven feet tall. 
LAURA: Nice. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Leans in close enough-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
MATT: -- where you're looking up at him a bit. 
ASHLEY: Sir. (laughter) 
MATT: "An eternity of purpose, strength, and pleasures--" 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: "-- for those who fall under his shadow." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Wait, I heard "pleasures" and then I didn't hear the rest because I just got really distracted. I'm so sorry. What was right after "pleasures"? I really actually didn't hear it. 
SAM: For those who fall under his shadow. 
ASHLEY: For those who fall under his shadow, okay. 
MATT: "You walk in the mud of the lowly demon princes. They are outside the divine order and likely stir in the wake of these times. Pay them no mind. They are chaos without meaning." 
ASHLEY: Ugh, yeah. I felt that, I felt it. 
MATT: Takes your hand. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: Without breaking eye contact and gives it a kiss. (gasping) 
MATT: Your knuckle burns. 
SAM: Fire and fire. 
MATT: But you, burning doesn't frighten you. 
ASHLEY: It's like putting your tongue on a battery. 
LAURA: What's a battery? 
MATT: Pulls away and on your center knuckle, there is what looks like a burned symbol of almost like a tattoo of a black horned crown. (gasping) 
SAM: Oh shit. 
LAURA: That's not good, is it? 
TRAVIS: It's great. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Just-- I don't know if I wanted that to stay there. What is this? 
MATT: "We are allies today. Perhaps, in the future, we will be allies again. The path is open. All you need to do is ask for his aid. Do you accept these terms?" 
ASHLEY: I just feel like this is a lot of information right now. 
MARISHA: Is it because you're fiery and flamey? He's not looking-- 
SAM: And awesome. 
LAURA: Yeah, in your head, you just hear: Maybe you should just make out with him. 
TALIESIN: He's giving you his phone number, just take it. 
SAM: It doesn't seem like too much of a commitment. It's just a help, it's just a help if you need it. 
ASHLEY: Listen. 
TALIESIN: Text him later, Jesus. 
ASHLEY: I feel like I'm wanting a little excitement. 
MARISHA: Do it. 
ASHLEY: And I really like what your god's about, like the pleasure thing, and I've really been trying to put like self-care before, you know, like caring about myself. Pleasure, make it all about me. Let's do it, I'm in. I'll take his hand. 
MATT: "This pact is sealed." He closes his hand around yours with the other like elongated clawed fingers, looks at you with a smile. "We will meet again." 
ASHLEY: Promise? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Unbindingly." Releases your hand, looks back and grasps the side of his blade, which is sheathed in the side now and turns back to the rest of you. "Your leader is wise. You stand where you stand not cut down because of her wisdom." 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm, thank you very much, thank you. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: Just so you know, she's had excitement before. 
TALIESIN: (discouraging noises) 
ASHLEY: It's true, but you can never get enough. 
SAM: Where will you go next in your protection of your god? 
MATT: "Maybe you'll find out if we continue to walk similar paths." (wings flapping) He lifts up into the air, the wings spread out, the blade at the side, still looking down upon all of you, his shadow cast down in the space where you stand glancing up. "The sky goes red to the south." Looks over to you. "I think our destinies are entwined." Looks up and whispers something under his breath and you watch his fire (flames erupting) ignites him and he is gone, like a paper burned in a fireplace. 
LAURA: I think I saw his perineum as he left. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Did you just flirt with a champion of Asmodeus? Holy fuck! 
LAURA: Wow! 
ASHLEY: I don't know who Asmodeus is, but that whatever that was, that was something. 
TALIESIN: How common is baseline knowledge of the very vague notion of Asmodeus? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was like-- 
MATT: I mean-- 
LIAM: Fall under your shadow. 
MATT: The base notion of the devil in our modern time. 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
MATT: Not everyone really like knows a lot, but everyone kind of knows like. 
TALIESIN: That'd be shit I'd be into. 
SAM: You didn't make any-- 
TRAVIS: Lord of the Hells. 
SAM: All you promised was that like you're keeping this as an option for later. You didn't swear eternal. 
LAURA: Fealty to Asmodeus. 
ASHLEY: It's like a promise ring, right? I mean, you're just like, not even that, we were just like, "Maybe." 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: A great, flaming, Duke of Hell is one day going to wake you with a giant voice that's just going to say, "You up?" It's going to be, I'm so-- 
TRAVIS: The ability to call for help just from your knuckle is really valuable. 
LAURA: You kiss it and he'll show up? Is that what happens? 
TRAVIS: Probably got to tongue it. 
LIAM: That's just like you're SAG eligible. 
TALIESIN: Don't, too soon, too soon, too soon, too soon. Got to wait a day at least. 
MARISHA: Do you feel like more powerful? 
TRAVIS: You got to make them want it a little. 
MARISHA: How's your fire magic? Is it like more, does it have more oomph? 
ASHLEY: Let's see. I'll produce a little flame. Produce Flame. Kaboosh. 
LIAM: Fireball. 
MATT: It's a cool flame. 
ASHLEY: I think it's more powerful. 
LAURA: It looks more powerful. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it does. 
SAM: Does the group want to take a new vote about who's pro-god now? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Now that she's going to bone a champion of another. 
SAM: Yeah, she's pro-god. We got three now. We started with one, we got three. By the end of two days from now, you're all going to be pro-god. 
TALIESIN: "God" is a very stretched term here, I think, but, you know. 
MARISHA: Does it bother you, FCG, that it's a Betrayer God? 
SAM: I don't know nothing about the gods! I just learned about mine like three days ago! 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's a Betrayer God. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I track my vote since one of them tried to hit on my girl. 
LAURA: Is she really, though? 
ASHLEY: Well. Listen. 
LIAM: She's kind of a free spirit, Chet. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: A rolling stone. 
TRAVIS: I don't make the rules. 
ASHLEY: I'm a rolling stone. I blow with the wind. 
MARISHA: So antiquated, you old-ass man. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: So wise. 
TALIESIN: Well, this just got very interesting. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: I have so many questions. I'm honestly kind of confused as to what just happened, but I'm here for it. 
LIAM: Well, hold up. Orym turns to Baernie. What did happen? 
MATT: Baernie sits up a bit, still cradling her shoulder a bit. 
LAURA: Should help her. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: She's got a dislocated shoulder. 
SAM: Oh, sure. I'll pop it back into place. 
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: As you go to reach for it, she says, "It's fine. I can use my hands now." She touches her shoulder and you see as a faint green glow begins to appear and faint leaves begin to weave and tether from the sides of the shoulder before it pops back in in a smooth, painless way. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Sweet. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: "I volunteered, and helmed the expedition to come here to collect the means of helping the Voice recover. We knew the dangers that were inherent, but we knew at least this Bastion would be a point of safety. We did not know that it had fallen." She looks back and makes eye contact with the two of the surviving Bastion members who are both in the process of gathering what remains of their friends they can and identifying what they can. "We... fell. Some of us fled. Some of us were captured. I know not where the others wound up. Some others were slain, but we were saved for something else. A celebratory feast, when they brought through the rest of their... The rest of their group. (sighs) He referred to himself as Extovass the Gluttonous." 
LAURA: That's what the big guy was? 
SAM: Exlovass? 
LAURA: Extovass. 
MATT: "Extovass." 
SAM: Extovass. 
ASHLEY: Extovass. 
MATT: "Seemed himself to kneel to a prince of some kind. He used the name Vrudauliun." 
LAURA: Vruidaluin? 
MATT: "Vrudauliun." 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: "Regardless, we were working on some way of trying to escape with a few unfortunate failures and were running low on options. So we're very thankful that you came when you did. We're uncertain if the feast and what we were to be," Looks back towards the broken stone sigils that you had broken and says, "If we were the key or just part of the merriment. But regardless, we're safe now. And I believe," She looks over and you can see Jennis has found in one of the piles of collected materials that were left in these large piles, two backpacks that look torn and tethered. 
LAURA: Oh, yes! 
MATT: Opens up inside and you can see the large bundles of the blue perennem that they had already previously collected. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
MARISHA: Fantastic. 
TRAVIS: Lucky. 
SAM: The flowers? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: The pee peonies? 
MATT: "Certainly." 
MARISHA: The gooch gladiolas. 
SAM: Yes. 
LIAM: Bearded lilies. 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
SAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: I should've given him more temporary hit points. 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: That's what it was. 
MATT: Yeah. Just keep adding temporary hit points. 
LAURA: Oh no! (laughs) No wonder he was so hard to kill. 
MATT: "I would say resting here would not be the safest or most comfortable. Are you all still good to travel?" 
LAURA: Heal me. 
SAM: I can heal y'all now. Sure. 
MARISHA: With these two bags of theirs and the 30 of ours-- 
LAURA: We could get back. 
MARISHA: -- is that enough flowers for-- 
MATT: "I think so." 
TRAVIS: Should we search the interior of this just to make sure? 
SAM: Sure, sure. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Can you teleport us back? 
TALIESIN: Take a look and see what else this place has. 
SAM: No. 
TALIESIN: That sword you picked up. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. Does this belong to you, Jennis, or Baernie, Uwon, or Diedrich? 
MATT: They look confused. "Not any of us, no." "I've not seen that blade before." 
MARISHA: Oh shit. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Why don't we have it identified? 
LAURA: Yeah, maybe FCG can identify it. 
SAM: I sure can. 
TRAVIS: I'll put it in the bag of holding. 
LAURA: (groans) Why every time? 
MARISHA: Yeah, every time. 
SAM: I'm on healing duty. I'll do that later. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Priorities. 
LAURA: I can't teleport us back until tomorrow, potentially. 
MARISHA: Maybe we just hike it. 
MATT: "It would be too far to hike." 
MARISHA: Well, maybe we teleport in the morning. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA: Unless you guys can do a tree thingy? 
TRAVIS: Has this circle been destroyed? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, no, we should definitely fuck that up. 
TALIESIN: Wrecked everything. 
MATT: Baernie says, "I'm-- While I am of a fair level of druidic capability, I have divided my training across multiple practices and fear that I... I lack the focus and level of capability as some of my sisters. I cannot get us back. But I hope you have that capability and if not, maybe we can request them to meet us if we have a way of contacting them." 
LAURA: That's interesting. If we can make it until morning, then I can teleport most of us back and then communicate to open up a tree to help you all out. 
MATT: "Well. I would say, given what has transpired here today, this is likely not a safe place to make camp." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "What I can help with, follow me." She gets up. They gather whatever materials they can scavenge. They wait a few moments longer for the remaining soldiers of the Bastion here to bury that they could find and give the death rites of the Platinum Dragon to those who fell here in defense of the valley in Tal'Dorei. There is a solemn funeral. The words speak of the sadness of loss, but the acknowledgement of what it means to give your life to protect the realm. That true heroism is remembered for those that didn't balk when the threat of destruction came. And when they fell, they did so so others could live and laugh and be free far from here. As they lay their symbols down, cover with dirt and give their final rites. Your group falls behind Baernie, further down the crevasse. To where she stops at one outcropping. Lifts her hand, concentrates, and you watch as the stone itself carves magically, in moments. (scrapping) Building a small cavern where there was none previously. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: You all step in. She closes it behind. 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: Lanterns (flares) light up around. You have a tight, but comparably safe, enclosed space for the evening's rest. Tired, beaten, but successful in many degrees. You take the things that you've learned, the people you've helped, and the hope that you carry into what you bring back to Keyleth and the Ashari of Zephrah in the morning. That's where we'll finish up the night's episode. (relieved groaning) 
MATT: We'll pick up on that return next session. 
LIAM: We got all the papunias, guys. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That pendulum swung hard. 
MATT: It really did. I was like, "This battle's going to be a full-on pushover," and then it started looking good. 
TRAVIS: Good balance. 
LIAM: Oh man. 
TRAVIS: Good balance. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: That's tough. 
LAURA: Man. 
TALIESIN: Would've been a pushover if we hadn't kept punning. 
LAURA: Yeah, we gave him all those hit points. 
MATT: Yeah, I think at the end he had like 25 temporary hit points after all that. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: I was giving him two every notch. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Holy cow. 
MATT: Good game, you all. We'll pick up there next time. 
LAURA: That was fun, Matt. 
ASHLEY: That was so fun. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful map. That was a great map. 
MARISHA: What the hell. 
TRAVIS: That's my fave. 
MATT: That's fun. 
LAURA: Oh my god, and you might've made a pact with Asmodeus? 
SAM: I love it. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: The Lord of Hells is great. 
ASHLEY: I'm the leader of the group now, I think. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It was time. 
SAM: She's a cloven hooved fire lady. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM and ASHLEY: Makes sense. 
MATT: Oh yeah. There were many facets beyond just the persuasion. The persuasion check was so high, and then the rest of that package, he was like, "This is the one I talk to." 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
MARISHA: That's so funny. 
ASHLEY: I was in charge. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Not of this world, Fearne Calloway. 
MATT: Well, Teven Klask, Retribution of the Hells, is on your speed dial, girl. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MARISHA: Does it, like an avatar? You can summon him. That's cool. 
LIAM and TALIESIN: Ring, ring. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: You up? 
ASHLEY: Oh, hi. 
TRAVIS: 'Sup, bae? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: The Retribution. 
SAM: Is he friends with Zerxus? 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Do we need to collect champions? 
LAURA: Is that what we need to do? 
SAM: Maybe or become. 
LIAM: He might report to Zerxus. 
TRAVIS: You gasped. Like that's an easy thing to do. (laughs) (gasps) We should. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) That's a great idea! 
SAM: Do we get to fuck a bunch of champions? 
TRAVIS: Wherever those people are. 
MATT: Pokémon this shit, just get more tattoos on each knuckle and be like Link in Tears of the Kingdom with all the sages. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Excuse me. 
LIAM: Get your Purvan, Fearne. 
TALIESIN: 10 rings. (laughter) 
LAURA: Get in, we're fighting gods. 
MATT: Yeah. You should get that Raven Queen-- oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh. (laughs) 
MATT: Anyway. 
TALIESIN: There's a Raven Queen chaser in one of these card packs? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Shit, a hologram card. 
ASHLEY: Oh man. 
MATT: Well, excited to pick up from here next time. Good game. Thank you all for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)
