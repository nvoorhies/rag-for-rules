Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (garbled) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: Just like-- Oh god. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Well, before we start tonight, we do have some announcements to get through. First up, our first sponsor tonight, NordVPN. Which means a visit from our favorite French magician-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh yeah. 
MATT: -- Nordo the Nagnificent. 
LIAM: There's so much going on before he even says anything! 
SAM: Oh shit. I was supposed to have a laptop for this. I'll do it on my phone. ("French" grunting) Oh! Oh! 
MATT: Should we just start again? 
SAM: (regular voice) No, no, keep going, this is good. ("French" accent) Oh, sorry, Matthieu. I was busy doing something very interesting. Very interesting indeed. 
MATT: It feels like you want me to ask what you-- 
SAM: I was hacking into the email of my fiercest rival, the horrible magician known as Twilight Sparkle. 
MATT: Why? 
SAM: Because, parce-que, the annual-- 
TRAVIS and LAURA: What? 
SAM: That's French for "because." The annual equine magic Super Bowl is coming up and I will not place second again, so I am trying to figure out which trick she is planning so I can beat her once and for all. 
MATT: By hacking her email? 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: Look! 
LAURA: Oh, your hair is so terrible. 
SAM: Look, NordVPN has a super secure dark web monitor feature, which gives you alerts about your credentials that appear on underground hacker websites. Did you know that? Their free NordPass password manager generates and automatically (crunch) fills in-- (noises of alarm and protest) 
SAM: -- strong passwords. 
ASHLEY: That almost went in my cup. 
TALIESIN: That is edible. 
SAM: Sorry. French, what is French for "sorry"? 
TRAVIS: Pardonnez-moi. 
SAM: Pardonnez-moi! (laughter) 
SAM: But my rival does not use NordVPN, which is basically an invitation to read her emails. Ha ha ha! I just need to figure out her password. Hmm, what could it be? Marisha, what is your password? 
MARISHA: I don't feel comfortable telling-- 
SAM: This is for magic! It's very important, please! 
MARISHA: Okay, it's KenTuckEverlasting. 
LAURA: That's so cute. 
MARISHA: I don't know why, why would I have the same as her? 
SAM: It didn't work! Why would she have the same one as you? 
MARISHA: I don't know! 
SAM: Quick, Ashley, what's your password? 
ASHLEY: One. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Two. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Three. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Four. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Five. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Six. 
SAM: Uh-huh. Oh, it also didn't work! Travis, what's yours? 
TRAVIS: I'm embarrassed to say it. 
SAM: Just say it! 
TRAVIS: It's FrenchPeopleSuck1789. 
SAM: What? You bastard! But it worked. I'm in. Hm, ooh. 
MATT: Nordo, maybe you should just come up with your own thing, trick, and not worry about what this Twilight Sparkle person is going to do. 
SAM: You're right, you're right. By the magician-- I have to eat some oats. By the magician's code, you're right, I should not read her emails even though she could have protected herself with NordVPN so easily. Why, right now, there's an exclusive NordVPN deal. Go to nordvpn.com/criticalrole and get extra subscription time. A two-year plan plus four months for free. Try it risk free now with a 30-day money back guarantee. But I will close the email now. Except, mon dieu, what's this? She, Twilight Sparkle, has been invited to the set of Critical Role on the next NordVPN ad? And I will have to do a magic battle with her right here on this stage? 
MARISHA: Oh wow. 
SAM: The next time NordVPN sponsors our show?! 
LAURA: (concerned warble) 
SAM: Matt, cognac to you. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Are you turning into a rabbit? 
ASHLEY: You're turning into a horse. 
LIAM: What is going on with that wig? 
TALIESIN: Is that horse? 
ASHLEY: He's turning into something. There's a subplot here. 
LAURA: Are you turning into a horse or a rabbit? 
LIAM: It's a mane? 
TALIESIN: It's like anime cosplay from '94. 
MATT: So, Liam! You got something to talk about, buddy? 
LIAM: Oh boy, accent free. 
SAM: (crunch) 
LIAM: (sighs) I'm sorry. Celery is hypnotizing. We are thrilled to show off something that has been cooking for a while. The first of our-- scrub it out of my brain-- Vox Machina Origins dynamic bust from our friends at Dark Horse Direct! Featuring the beloved twins, Vex'ahlia and Vax'ildan. These designs are based on the Critical Role Vox Machina Origins comic books from Dark Horse Comics, and they're full of little details, like on the side-- 
LAURA: Ah! 
LIAM: if you look it real close, there's a little Trinket carved into the side of the barrel. Also, that is alcohol. 
LAURA: Pretty cute. No, it's orange juice. 
LIAM: That's OJ. 
TALIESIN: If you lick it, nothing's going to happen. 
LIAM: That's Fanta. They are limited to 1,000 units and are available for pre-order now exclusively at Dark Horse Direct. There's going to be a dynamic bust with the best buddies for life, Grog, Pike, and Scanlan. 
ASHLEY: (Pike) Yeah! 
TRAVIS: (Grog) Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
LIAM: The big guy and the little ones, that's also going to be available for pre-order, and after that Keyleth and Percy busts coming soon. Busted! Check them out at Darkhorsedirect.com. 
MATT: Perfect. Thank you, Liam. 
LIAM: Busting, busting! 
MATT: There it is, couldn't hold it. Marisha. 
TALIESIN: Makes me feel good. 
MARISHA: We dropped our official series trailer for Candela Obscura: Chapter Two this week. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: (beeping merrily) 
MARISHA: That's the vibe. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Join us as we return to the war-torn Fairelands with the Circle of Needle & Thread on August 31st on Twitch, YouTube, and in Cinemark theaters, you guys. 
SAM: Dude. 
MARISHA: Go watch it. You got a little oats right there. 
SAM: Oh, you're right, I do. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You can buy tickets now at cinemark.com or at critrole.com/events. Also, I wanted to say real quick, we released, a little bit ago, in case you missed it, a little BTS couple of videos for the first chapter. There is a Crafting a Mystery video featuring Matt Mercer. Yeah, it's great. Then the session zero, so you can get to watch how everybody built their characters. 
SAM: Wow. 
MARISHA: Get a little peek at that. 
SAM: Did they know they were being filmed for that? 
MARISHA: Yes, they did. We're ethical. 
ASHLEY: What?! 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: In the meantime, you can also listen to the official soundtrack for Candela Obscura. 
MATT: Yay! 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: With music by Colm R. McGuinness. 
MATT: Yeah, Colm! 
TRAVIS: Colm, oh dope! 
SAM: Did he add the R? Is that new? 
MARISHA: I think he did. Yeah, I don't know, it makes it very sophisticated. 
SAM: Sure. Colm R.R. McGuinness? 
MARISHA: Colm R. McGuinness. (laughs) These 12 haunting tracks will immerse you in the Fairelands and it's out now on all major digital musical platforms. 
TRAVIS: Yes, nice job, crushed it. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Well done. Well done. 
MARISHA: (beeps and boops) 
TRAVIS: Boop! Aw, you kept going. 
LIAM: Sam, you look like a goth Sonic The Hedgehog. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'd take off your-- 
MATT: A really bad Shadow cosplay. 
SAM: That would be a cool game. 
TRAVIS: I think it's a horse, or a donkey. 
ASHLEY: I think he's turning into a horse. 
LAURA: He looks like Sebastian from Stardew. 
TRAVIS: Are you a mule? 
MATT: Oh my god, he straight-up does. 
ASHLEY: Oh, he totally looks like Sebastian. 
MARISHA: Are you romancing Sebastian? 
LAURA: I haven't romanced anyone yet but I think I'm going to go for Elliott. 
MATT: I think this concludes our announcements. 
MARISHA: Oh, you went moody peach boy? Oh, the tragic writer. 
ASHLEY: I was kind of into Sebastian. 
LAURA: But Sebastian's pretty good, too. 
TRAVIS: Matt, make it stop! 
MATT: Nah, Krobus all the way. Anyway, I believe that concludes our announcements. 
SAM: Abigail? 
LAURA: You know one! 
MATT: Abigail was the first one. She's fine. 
MARISHA: She's the gamer girl. 
MATT: She's fine. Without further ado-- We're hoping to start our night. Let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. (laughter) 
MATT: So last we left off: Bells Hells, upon coming to Zephrah and finding the Voice of the Tempest, Keyleth herself, still ailing from the unhealing wounds left by Otohan Thull during the solstice event, you discovered a possible way to help heal these wounds, traveled to the Grey Valley to recover the flowers that could be used to make this herbal balm, defeated demons that had torn through. Fearne made a pact with the devil. 
SAM: Oh god, that's right. 
TRAVIS: A devil! 
MATT: A devil. It's fine. 
ASHLEY: Demon daddy. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Daddy devil. 
TRAVIS: ♪ These broken wings ♪ 
MATT: Managed to save some survivors of both the overthrown bastion in the Grey Valley and some of the original volunteers of the Air Ashari that had gone out to try and do this beforehand. Gathering these things, as well as an interesting weapon that seems to be talking to you-- 
SAM: Oh, that's right! 
TRAVIS: A noble blade. 
MATT: You recovered over a night's rest, returned to Zephrah, and watched as indeed, Keyleth was able to recover the majority of her strength within a short time, speaking out to the people of Zephrah and giving thanks to your troop, and specifically to you and those of Zephrah that put their lives on the line as well. Receiving a new title, and celebration ensuing here in the middle of Zephrah, you all spoke with her and figured out a number of possible paths in the future. One that involved discovering the strange broken harness that was found in the old tower of Ludinus over in Molaesmyr as well as strange power that seems to reside within Ashton that has a strong tie to the Primordial Titans that existed even before the gods arrived. Taking these possibilities in hand, you stepped out into the celebration of Zephrah, and it is here that you all have the day to yourself. 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
LAURA: Bless you. 
TRAVIS: Stop it. 
MATT: -- to finish any errands you like and continue on to the next leg of your journey of choice. As you step out into the bright midday light-- 
SAM: (sneezes) 
ASHLEY: Stop it! (laughter) (laughter) 
MATT: What would you like to do? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: So pronounced. 
MARISHA: I still can't-- 
TALIESIN: It's been so long. 
ASHLEY: It's been so long. 
SAM: Wait. This is the same day? 
MATT: Same day. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: We haven't taken a long rest? 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: We took-- 
MARISHA: ♪ Taken a long rest ♪ 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: Let's not start another whole one. 
SAM: ♪ Taking a long rest downtown ♪ 
LAURA: Wait, didn't we take a long rest right before we came here? 
SAM: I have full everything, so we must have. 
TALIESIN: We should be full. 
MATT: You took a long rest before the last session. 
LAURA: We took a long rest, and then we bamfed in. 
MATT: Correct, so it's the same day. 
LAURA: So we haven't fought anyone or anything. 
SAM: Oh no, I'm out of spells. 
MATT: You did cast a lot of spells last time. You scried and-- 
SAM: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it was. 
MARISHA: And you prayed to your god eight times. 
SAM: Why are you laughing about that? 
TALIESIN: You argued with your god. 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: And it's not the morning anymore. It's early afternoon. 
LIAM: Late morning, midday? 
MATT: Getting close to midday at this time. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Zephrah. 
LIAM: That's where we are. 
SAM: I hardly knew ya. 
TALIESIN: You learned a word. 
TRAVIS: What's this town made of? 
TALIESIN: Zephrah? 
TRAVIS: Let's go get turnt! (laughter) 
LIAM: You want to get turnt tonight in Zephrah? 
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to make up for lost time. 
MARISHA: I mean, we're here for a minute, right? We have a day. Do we have a day? 
LAURA: Yeah, I think the staff still needs to-- 
MARISHA: Charge? 
LAURA: The staff still needs to charge. 
LIAM and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
LIAM: How do you charge it? 
LAURA: Well, you can do it. 
LIAM: Bet I could. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: This episode has already been so GIF-able. Okay, carry on. 
ASHLEY: Off to a good start. 
MARISHA: I know. 
LIAM: I'm not entirely sure where we're going next. I know where I want to go, but I don't think that's where we're going to go. We're going to figure some stuff out. 
SAM: Where do you want to go? 
LIAM: Well-- 
TRAVIS: Where the people are? 
LIAM: -- I want to see-- The people are here, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: I want to see them dancing. 
ASHLEY: (like Travis) Oh. 
LIAM: I refuse to go down that hole. 
TRAVIS: Walking around on those-- 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: What's that word again? 
LIAM: Feet. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: (shouts) Where do you want to go? 
LIAM: I want to know what happened at ground zero, where-- 
LAURA: Mm! We can't go there yet! 
LIAM: I know that, I know. So I'm going to follow your lead, because you're smart, for where maybe we should go next. 
LAURA: Really, Chet's the smartest of all of us. 
TRAVIS: Right here. 
LIAM: I know, but he's also the most dangerous. 
TRAVIS: And handsome. 
LIAM: So I default to you as the second most intelligent member of Bells Hells. 
TALIESIN: We're aware that that's kind of terrible. 
LAURA: I don't think that's true but, nope, that's definitely not true. That can't be true. 
LIAM: I'm just going from the roleplaying, Imogen, less about the actual stats. 
LAURA: You're smarter than me. 
LIAM: That can't be right. I-- 
MARISHA: Did it make-- Oh, go ahead. 
TRAVIS: Speak. 
MARISHA: Did it make anyone else a little sad or concerned that Keyleth was like, "Go get allies!" And we were like, "We don't have any!" 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was a bummer. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: It was a bit of a bummer, right? 
TALIESIN: Is no one else used to not having friends? Is this just a problem that we're going to have? Did you all have social lives before the moon started fucking-- 
TRAVIS: Not really. 
LAURA: No. I mean-- 
MARISHA: Moon fucking? 
TALIESIN: The moon fucking. 
TRAVIS: I was a small circle kind of person. 
SAM: He outlived a lot of his friends. 
TRAVIS: That's true. 
SAM: She out-died a lot of her friends. 
MARISHA: That's also true. 
SAM: I killed mine. 
TALIESIN: Fair. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I have tons. 
SAM: Oh, you do? We've never heard about your friends, your pals back home. 
ASHLEY: You met some of them. 
MARISHA: There's Floppies and Flumpers. 
ASHLEY: Bompers and Peepers. 
SAM: I thought those were pets. Those were pets, though, right? 
ASHLEY: They're still friends. 
TALIESIN: Pets can be friends. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: They're very-- 
LAURA: Dorian, he's a friend. 
ASHLEY: Dorian's a friend. 
LAURA: And all the people that y'all were with before. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you talk about the people that you abandoned to hang out with us, that was pretty cool. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TALIESIN: I'm just being a fucker. Don't mind me. I'm going to be over here. That was mean. 
MARISHA: You have friends here. 
MATT: (sneezes) 
LIAM: Friends and family all over this town. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Stop it! 
ASHLEY: Shh! 
LIAM: Stop it, Matt! 
SAM: God, Matt. 
TALIESIN: Stop it. 
MATT: Goddamn it. (laughter) 
LIAM: Do you see what we're doing over here? 
MATT: Sorry. Shh. 
ASHLEY: We've got Deanna. We've got FRIDA. We've got friends. We've got lots. 
MARISHA: Well, we have our goal. Right? 
SAM: No. What is our goal? 
MARISHA: To fix the-- 
LAURA: We're going to fix that harness. 
SAM: Oh, fix the harness. Yes, that's right. 
LAURA: Fix the harness, go to the Shattered Teeth. 
SAM: Shattered Teeth. 
LAURA: Suck up some energy. Get stronger, if that's how it works. Then we can fight Ludinus and be on his level. That sounds absolutely perfect. 
LIAM: Sort of. 
LAURA: Fly to the moon, talk to the people that live there, defeat them. 
TRAVIS: It kind of just writes itself. 
SAM: Profit. 
TALIESIN: All of this is insane, but the only more insane thing is going right back to where we were with nothing changing and expecting anything to go well. We need to do something, even if it's not enough. 
TRAVIS: It's true. 
SAM: Okay, but for today, we can't do any of that. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: Right now? 
SAM: So do we need to buy anything or fix anything? 
LIAM: We have to pick up some gear that we had commissioned here. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm going to visit my family before we go. 
ASHLEY: Okay, yeah. I was going to say, is there anywhere in Zephrah that you really missed? And you're like, we need to go here, go check it out. That was your favorite place to go. 
LIAM: Yeah, for sure. 
TRAVIS: Do they have base jumping here? 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LIAM: They do, actually. 
TRAVIS: Parachuting? Some thrill? 
LIAM: They don't call it that, but. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I've never done that, and I'd love to. 
LIAM: Do you want to try that? I pick out two people flying overhead in the-- What are they called again? 
MATT: The gliders. 
LIAM: Gliders, to be specific. 
MATT: You glance up and you can see there are these two contraptions that look like spread wings with a semi-translucent leather stretched between the elongated finger elements of it. But there are people riding them, controlling them through the air as they're gliding on air currents. Two of them are rotating and shifting overhead. 
SAM: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god, yes. 
TALIESIN: I would actually. 
TRAVIS: If we have time, that's where my coin's going. 
SAM: Seems like we have time. 
LIAM: I mean, I know it seems like I'm hot to trot to get out of here, but I wouldn't mind a full day and night. It'd be pretty cool. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
LAURA: Oh wait, the staff is charged up. I just remembered that from last time. 
TRAVIS: What? 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: We don't have to stay here. 
LIAM: Oh, you charged it up already? 
SAM: Oh, we can-- 
LAURA: (laughs) Charged it up real good. 
SAM: We can go then? Oh, well then, we're going to go then. 
TRAVIS: Fuck! (laughter) What?! I just signed my waiver! 
SAM: No, they have to pick up stuff. I need to go-- I actually need to do some shopping too, so maybe you have a couple hours to go kill yourself up there. 
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh baby! 
MARISHA: Didn't you say there was a spa situation here? 
LIAM: Did I say there was a spa? 
MARISHA: Am I projecting? 
TRAVIS: Are you trying to manifest a spa? 
LIAM: Yes, there are spas here. 
TALIESIN: Look at these people. 
LAURA: I think that we're gathering-- 
TALIESIN: There's a fucking spa here. 
LAURA: -- Keyleth would have opened a spa-- 
MARISHA: Yes, right. 
LAURA: -- in Zephrah. 
TALIESIN: Everyone's so fucking relaxed. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: No answer? No to the-- 
LIAM: There is the-- 
MARISHA: I'll go with Chetney. 
LIAM: There is a spa. It's called... 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
SAM: The Pig and Whistle. 
MATT, MARISHA, and LAURA: (laugh) 
LIAM: The Whistling Pig. 
MARISHA: Ooh! Because then you're clean as a-- 
TRAVIS: It doesn't make any sense. 
MARISHA: -- as a whistled pig. 
LIAM: Doesn't make any sense for this town. 
TRAVIS: The branding is crap. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Maybe I'll look into it. 
SAM: Maybe you can ask around. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I can ask around. 
TALIESIN: Built over a natural hot springs. 
TRAVIS: Should we meet back for lunch or dinner or anything like that? 
LAURA: Let's meet up in a couple hours because I think we probably should get a move on. 
TRAVIS: (scoffs) Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yep, yep. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: So you two are going hang gliding? 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll go hang gliding with Chet, I guess. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Why not? 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: ♪ Already creeping out of the group Towards the shop ♪ 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: ♪ Quietly ♪ 
MARISHA: Imogen? Fearne? 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Are you going? 
LAURA: I could fly. 
MARISHA: Well, we know that. (laughs) 
LAURA: I'll just hang out next to y'all. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, this is good. It'll be like there's a little redundancy for safety. 
LAURA: Yeah, exactly. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, true. 
TRAVIS: If you can keep up. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
LAURA: We'll find out. 
TRAVIS: We will. 
ASHLEY: I did want to get a little shampoozled, but I'll go shopping with you guys. See if there's anything that I can pick up. 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: I need some stuff. 
ASHLEY: Have fun, be safe. Not too safe. 
LAURA: All right. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: We'll figure out a spa. Maybe that'll be the afternoon activity. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: What? 
LAURA: I don't think there's time for a spa. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LIAM: We are leaving today? 
LAURA: We're leaving today. 
MATT: Where are you going? 
LAURA: I'm sorry, Orym. Where are we going? 
TRAVIS: D? 
SAM: We're going to my friend, D. 
TRAVIS: Dancer or-- 
SAM: Or one of my friends whose name starts with a D. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: Yes, that's right. 
MATT: Where are they? 
TRAVIS: That all right? Yeah. 
LAURA: They're on the Nicodranas-- 
SAM: I will have to sleep and find out where they are. 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: They're on the coast. 
ASHLEY: Menagerie Coast. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So we're leaving tomorrow. 
SAM: We'll have to sleep and find out where they are. 
LIAM: So that means we are staying? 
LAURA: Because you saw it. You saw where-- 
SAM: I saw a room for Dancer, and I saw-- 
TRAVIS: A beach. 
SAM: -- a place. 
LAURA: But you saw the beach. So you could send us to that place that you saw specifically, right? 
SAM: Maybe. 
LAURA: You saw it. 
SAM: I did. 
LAURA: That means you can go there. 
MARISHA: Do you want another go at it? Is that what you're trying to tell us? 
SAM: It wouldn't be unwise to have another go. 
ASHLEY: I could help out, too. 
TRAVIS: Plus, it's been a minute, so they've probably-- 
MARISHA: Moved. 
TRAVIS: -- moved from (laughs) 
LAURA: It's not been that long. I know it seems like a long time, but it was really only an hour ago that you checked in. 
TRAVIS: How long does it take you to walk up and out of sight at a beach? Oh my god. 
LAURA: Maybe D sat down and took in the-- 
ASHLEY: It is kind of, it depends on how deep the sand is. 
LAURA: The ocean breeze. 
ASHLEY: You know, sometimes it's hard to walk in it. 
MATT: That's valid. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
SAM: Why don't we go shopping and we'll reconnoiter and then we'll figure out what we're doing. 
ASHLEY: We can, right. 
SAM: Oh, we got to go talk to Keyleth again, too. 
LAURA: About what? 
SAM: Oh. Well, we don't really have a plan with her. She said she was going to go find out-- She said she was going to take a nap. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Then she said she was going to go find out if she has allies that could help us or something. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: But then we never really decided, okay, so will you reach out to us? Or will we meet you back here in a day or? 
LAURA: That's true. 
MARISHA: I thought that was like-- 
TRAVIS: Understood? 
MARISHA: A long-term goal. 
SAM: But then how is she going to talk to us or tell us? 
LAURA: How would we find her again if she's gone and we're gone? 
MARISHA: With feeling. 
TRAVIS: We're the powerful and mysterious. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: Right. 
SAM: But, because long Sending still doesn't work, right? 
LAURA: Right. 
SAM: So maybe we should have a plan with her? I don't want to gum up the works or nothing, but. Just go hang gliding. We'll figure it out later. 
MARISHA: All right. That sounds good. 
MATT: (laughs) All righty. So Ashton, you snuck out of here in the midst of these conversations. 
TALIESIN: I did. 
MATT: Where are you off to? 
TALIESIN: I was heading towards Fanny Z's. 
MATT: Fanny Z. 
TALIESIN: But about halfway through as soon as I had some cover from the group, I found myself a corner and sat down and began to have a very intense panic attack. So I'm going to-- 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: I'm just going to take a minute and get my shit together and yeah. Probably, you know, come up behind once I, you know. I'm going to take about five minutes before going anywhere. So. 
MATT: As you sit for a minute in the throes of this panic attack, just hearing the sound of laughter and cheers and music echoing in the distance in the main center of the town. You sit there staring at the ground, and you can see the bits of stone and shale that have come to rest in this little alcove in the side of the city main street. As you feel the waves of anxiety come through and you can feel and hear the beat of your heart in your ears, you swear you see the stones (rough pulsing) shift in the ground as you do. You look and focus, and you're not sure if that was your mind playing tricks on you or not, but the very least, it doesn't help the sense of anxiety that's curling in. You take a deep breath. (exhales) A few moments pass before you begin to reclaim a semblance of control of your situation, trying to process some of the thoughts before realizing that now's maybe not the time to process. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) I stand up and a quick (slap) popping back in, and just head at speed towards the shop. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Just focused. 
MATT: Rushing up, your entire goal controlling the direct focus in your mind, you come up to the outside of the lavish shop of Fanny Z. Push through the front doors into the shaded interior, the smell of pleasant perfumes and incense catching your nose and the lights as you see on the far wall, Fanny Z is in the process of finishing up a dark-colored outfit stitching in a heavy portion before they pinch it off with their teeth. (thread snapping) Turn back. "Oh, hello, darling." 
TALIESIN: Hi. 
MATT: "Hi. Do you need it now?" 
TALIESIN: Unless you've got a little bit more to do, I'm happy to wait a minute. My friend's probably catching up behind me. 
MATT: "Two minutes. Two minutes." 
TALIESIN: Cool, cool. 
MATT: "You all right?" 
TALIESIN: Oh, just uh... I don't know. I'm trying to figure out who I'm going to be. New clothes and new a lot. 
MATT: "It's funny, sometimes it's the first step to figuring out who you're supposed to be." 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm starting to figure that out. I'm looking forward to, I don't know. I can't wait to see what you did. 
MATT: "Well." Go ahead and a couple of hand stitches on it before finishing tying a knot, pulling it through, and snipping it. They spin the stand around and you can-- Well, you describe to me what we see upon the stand. 
TALIESIN: It's-- Where to start? I'll start, tall boots with lots of brass buckling go up to the knees and a pair of black pants that have stripes down the center that seem to shift color depending on where you're standing. From a dark blue to a light blue, they kind of have a shimmer. 
MATT: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: It goes all the way up through that wonderful, was it a bodice that everybody, or the-- 
LAURA and MARISHA: Corset? 
TALIESIN: Corset that everyone bought has been modified with similar thread that goes from a blue to red to pink shift. 
TALIESIN: What? 
MATT: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: That's one of the strange five-sided symbols that Ashton drew on their jacket and had dreams about. Then black gloves with more brass bits and pieces. Then a shirt which also has the blue shimmery design, but when you notice just off center the whole thing is actually the Hishari symbol. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: On the chest. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: From the back of the jacket. All of that tied together with a sleeveless black trench with metal pyramid studs. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: A black exterior and deep crimson lining. 
MATT: "Well, what I can say, honey, is you gave me some pretty specific notes." 
SAM, ASHLEY, and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I showed the back, yeah. It was in there. 
MATT: "And giving notes this specific means that you have a pretty clear idea of who you want to be. Am I wrong?" 
TALIESIN: Do you believe in fate? 
MATT: "(laughs)" 
TALIESIN: Or no? 
MATT: "I believe people believe in fate." 
TALIESIN: Well, chaos has a funny sense of humor. I'm going to put it on. 
MATT: As you put it on, a couple of things here and there that Fanny has to adjust slightly once it's actually on the client, but it fits snugly and it feels-- Well, tell me, how does it feel? 
TALIESIN: I feel seen. I feel... It feels like a uniform. It feels just, I don't know. It feels important. 
MATT: Mm. It's about this moment-- Who else was planning to go? Was it you? 
LIAM: I'm going to Torth the blacksmith, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. All right. So we'll come to you shortly. 
LIAM: But is Ash, are you also going to Torth the blacksmith? Liam is asking Taliesin. Or was it all here? 
TALIESIN: This was my only place I need anything. 
LIAM: Yeah, okay. 
MATT: Yeah. So as you are taking in the moment, looking through this, we come to you. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Orym, as you approach the exterior of Torth's place. 
LIAM: Are you going to wait out here? I'll just be a minute. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, go for it. Go for it. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand out here and people watch. 
SAM: I'm here, too. 
ASHLEY: Oh yes, that's right. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: Cigarette? 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: All right, well, I'll leave them to smoke. 
LAURA: Can I see the picture? 
LIAM: Torth! 
LIAM: "Hi! Hey. Come on in." 
LIAM: Hey, we're back. 
LAURA: Yes! 
LIAM: In one piece. 
MATT: "I'm not surprised, necessarily, but happy to see that you managed to stay alive, wherever you were going." 
LIAM: Well, I'm-- 
MATT: "There's quite a commotion going on down in the town there. Is that what you folks came back to?" 
LIAM: Yeah, we had a bit of a dust-up. 
MATT: "Hmm." 
LIAM: Outside town. But it's fine for the time being. I'm sorry for the rush job. My friends and I are heading out I think maybe as early as this afternoon. 
MATT: "Hmm." 
LIAM: Was that enough time? 
MATT: "This afternoon? Yeah, I can probably... I think I can do it by the afternoon, yeah." 
LIAM: So not ready yet, but-- 
MATT: "Not yet, but soon." 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: "Give me about..." Looks over at the supplies and you can see is in the process of doing finer details and folding. He goes, "Eh, about four hours." 
LIAM: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Looks sturdy so far. 
MATT: "I think you'll be happy." 
LIAM: Okay. All right, I'll be back. Thanks. 
MATT: "See you in a bit." 
LIAM: Sorry, I thought we were done. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's fine. 
LIAM: (coughs) You guys want to (coughs) go see my family with me? I think we have a couple hours to kill and (coughs) it'd be the time to do it. 
ASHLEY: Why are you coughing? 
LIAM: You know, it's just the elevation. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I really wanted to see if we could get some of that blue flower poultice because I think we should have it with us just in case some of us get a little bit of the ooze or something happens again. 
SAM: I also was looking for some ivory strips and incense. 
ASHLEY: Oh! (exhales) 
LAURA: (laughs) In your ears. Do you have an ear hole? 
SAM: Nope. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Well, my mother-in-law is an herbalist, and she and one of my-- (laughs) Sorry, it's so out of context seeing you... Never mind. 
ASHLEY: Just live a little. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I'm trying. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) Stupid. 
LIAM: Did you try your mouth and it didn't work? 
SAM: It has the same effect. (laughter) 
SAM: It just-- 
TALIESIN: Which is none? 
LIAM: I got it. 
SAM: It doesn't do anything. 
TALIESIN: It's leaving little grease spots, maybe. 
LIAM: Hmm. All right, well, let's go visit my family. I think we can take care of the poultice request. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: They might have some cloves if you really need some more smokes. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! I'm going to flick my cigarette down and put it out with my hoof. 
MATT: (ash hissing) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Let's go. 
LIAM: Remember, fighting forest fires starts with you. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's true, that's true. 
LAURA: Do you just leave the cigarette butt on the ground in Zephrah? 
LIAM: She stomped it out. 
ASHLEY: I spit on it just to make sure it's out. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MATT: You're the worst. 
ASHLEY: Fire's out. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All right, to your family. 
LIAM: Okay, so I lead Letters and Fearne off, and I'm holding Fearne by the pinkie and I'm walking them towards Nel's house. 
MATT: Okay. A short time later, you come upon a modest, but very quaint abode. It looks like a series of trees that were grown probably long before even her generation in the family that were grown tall and then were bent inward and then slowly intertwined about 15 or so feet up to create this domed sort of structure, and the house was built upon that on the outside and so it has this central core that is natural and then everything's been shaped around it. Within a short walk and approach to it, you can already get a sense of all the wonderful smells that come out from the exterior, the fresh flowers. You can see there's flower beds and herb gardens that completely encompass the hillside right behind it. It's this constant shifting swath of color and shape that swirls up and around this large domed structure. You can see the shape of a woman darting around on the inside before she stops, almost sensing the presence of your arrival. You see Nel, the older half-elf woman look through the door. "Ah, you're here." 
LIAM: Hi, Mom. 
MATT: "Hello," and comes in, gives you a hug on the shoulder for a bit, looking at the rest of you. 
LIAM: Boy, we're not going to be here as long as I would like. I think we might be leaving later this afternoon, maybe tomorrow, if we're lucky. 
MATT: "Understood." 
LIAM: These are my friends. We didn't get a chance last time we were in town. This is my dear friend, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Hi. 
MATT: "Hi, Fearne. I'm Nel." 
ASHLEY: Very nice-- 
MATT: "Pleasure." 
ASHLEY: I've heard so much about you. 
LIAM: My friends are so unique. Fearne is not from here. Not from anywhere near here. 
MATT: "I was going to say. You certainly carry an otherworldly spirit about you." 
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you. Thank you. 
LIAM: I blew pretty far afield this time. What do we got? Yep, looks about right. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Looks about right. 
ASHLEY: I forgot Chetney was your dad. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Then my other friend, the one smoking out of their ear. This is Fresh Cut Grass, who's not from now, really. 
MATT: "Where are you from then?" 
SAM: When am I from. I don't actually know where I'm from, but I'm from a long time ago and I was sort of brought back to being a short time ago and now I'm with Orym and all of our friends and we're making a difference. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Oh, my goodness. Well, I've only ever seen one other like you before, so..." 
SAM: What, who, what, where, when? 
MATT: "This is one of the Tempest's friends travels with one, not much of a speaker, but definitely carries a similar vibe." 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: Wait, what? 
LIAM: I've only seen that one and I was younger a couple times, but... 
MARISHA: D! (gasping) 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: There's another one, though? 
MATT: "That I've seen. We don't get many visitors of your assemblage this far up the mountain, but it's a pleasure to have you here." 
SAM: Well it's been an honor to be here and to see a little bit of your culture and your people and yeah. We don't really know where we're going next. We need some guidance, honestly. I wish I could reach out to my god to help us, but I can't anymore today. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Maybe tomorrow. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: I can't. 
MARISHA: Not today. 
SAM: Are you religious? 
MATT: "Not in the classic Exandrian sense, no. I am very much a believer in the natural capability of Exandria's natural world." 
SAM: When you have to make a tricky decision, how do you make it? Do you flip a coin or do you ask someone else for guidance, or--? 
MATT: "I might ask friends for guidance. I might ask the Voice for guidance, if it's something I feel important enough for her wisdom and input. Sometimes I just rely on my life's experience. I've experienced quite a few wonderful and terrifying things in my years, and all of those experiences form my opinion and my confidence to make many of those decisions myself." 
SAM: It's very mature. 
ASHLEY: I like it. 
MATT: "Well, if you're traveling with Orym, I'm certain you're having your own unique experiences, too." 
SAM: We sure are. 
MATT: "Maybe in time you won't need to flip a coin or ask your god. Maybe you'll just know the right choice to make." 
SAM: Boy, that would be something. 
LIAM: It's pretty amazing seeing Leeta come into her own. 
MATT: "You're telling me. (laughs)" 
LIAM: I'm sure you're very proud. 
MATT: "Extremely. It's all that a mother could hope for is to watch their children rise and become greater than they ever could. I feel pretty accomplished in my years. So they've really proven themselves." 
LIAM: I look forward to following her lead. 
MATT: "From what I hear, you've already done quite a bit." 
ASHLEY: It's true. I don't know what we would do without Orym. 
MATT: "What's the wildest thing you've seen Orym do in your travels?" 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: "He'd be too bashful to say anything himself, but being his compatriots." 
ASHLEY: That's true. 
SAM: He's been inside several creatures. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's true. 
TRAVIS: No, Laura, no! 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
SAM: Like his whole body. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: We're going to make it happen. 
SAM: He falls off of things from time to time. 
TRAVIS: Read into that. 
MATT: "Don't we all?" 
SAM: Nearly dies but then is... 
LIAM: I'm small. 
SAM: He's small. I don't know if you knew that about him. 
MATT: "Thank you for informing me." 
LIAM: It gets windy up here and I-- 
SAM: Didn't you fall off a skyship? 
LIAM: Because I'm small. (laughter) 
LIAM: Good gust of wind is all it takes, Letters. 
SAM: What else have you fallen off? You've fallen off a lots of things. 
LIAM: Just skyships, mainly. 
SAM: Just skyships? 
TALIESIN: There was a crate once. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "Well, this has been wonderful. Thank you. We can talk later." 
TRAVIS: Put a mom's heart at ease. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Normally pretty agile. Is the family all home? 
MATT: "They'll be arriving in a bit, I think, as the day progresses. They're in mid merriment or at least trying to avoid it." 
LIAM: Okay, well I'm tempted to wait but I don't know if we have the time, so I was wondering if you wanted to visit Derrig and Will with me today for a minute. 
MATT: "I would. I very much would." 
LIAM: You know, it's been years and somehow I feel like I miss them more now than I did year one. (tearily) I miss Derrig's advice a lot. We have done all right, but doesn't always feel like it. I miss having that steady hand on my shoulder, you know? 
MATT: She kneels down to you and puts her hand on your shoulder as you say that. "The wonderful thing about Derrig and one of the reasons I fell in love with him was he didn't always get it right, but he was always willing to admit when he was wrong and learn from it. He didn't always know the right thing to do. He didn't always know the right choice to make, but he still made a choice. I know you miss him, both of them. And now you know I know how that feels." 
LIAM: He was a good son. 
MATT: "And when I look at you, he still is." 
LIAM: Oh man, Nel. Let's go say hi. 
MATT: "We will." 
LIAM: All right, so I hook Fearne by the pinky again with mine and take Nel's hand in my other and start walking off. Come on, Letters. 
SAM: I'm coming. Are we going to see living people, or--? 
LIAM: No. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Following the path that Nel and Orym guide you away from this little neighborhood to a winding path that curves around the edge of this one part of the mountain range. As it spins around the outside, this beautiful view of the valley and canyon below. You can see just barely in the distance to the east, the blue waters of the ocean. To the north you can see the beautiful northern mountain ranges and the storm in the distance of. Just the full breadth of this area, the Dividing Planes of Tal'Dorei. As they guide you down this winding path, the flowers begin to become more robust. Colors of all manners, more so than those that surrounded the herbalists abode when you approached. They are overflowing with life and vibrance. Eventually, this decline as the path continues down, evens out. You can see there's a smaller platform. Here there is this beautiful-kept half mountaintop valley that is all fenced flowers and a number of stacked stones marking hundreds and hundreds of lost loved ones. As you step out, you begin to see there are others, other mountaintops, that are all connected by these small land bridges, these bits of stone, these rope walkways. But there is a portion of Zephrah on this northern side that is a beautiful series of memorial plateaus. One connected to the next. Much of it is still open for those to come and write history themselves in the future. It's beautiful. Within a few moments, a familiar space comes into view. 
LIAM: I know it by heart. 
MATT: Here you see a cairn-like stack of stones with the name Derrig carved into it. You see a now weathered breastplate that's been set on the base of it and has been, I'll say, chiseled into the sides of the base stone. Then immediately to the right of it, of a similar height, his son's name, Will, with his blade placed into the dirt right before it. 
LIAM: It's my family. 
ASHLEY: Hello. 
LIAM: I walk up to Derrig's grave and just sort of run my thumb along the edge of that armor that I've seen so many, many, many times on him and off here. Hi, Dad. Been too long. I should have come by the last time I was home. I'm not sure why I didn't. It's real good to see you. I think about you every day while I'm out there trying to make decisions, always asking myself, "What would Derrig do?" I look back at Nel. I know it wasn't always the right decision, but it was always... It was always good. I'm trying to do that in my everyday. Anyway, thanks for watching over. God, you should see your girls. The three of them as like to each other as they can be and off in three different directions. You did good. So did they. I place my hand on the stone. Anyway, we're heading out. I don't know how soon I'll be back. I don't know if I'll be back. Thank you for the 10,000th time, thank you. I sort of swivel and kneel at the blade, next to it. Hey, you. I see you every night. So it's not as long a goodbye. It was really good to see you when I did. Not the circumstances I would've imagined. Welcome all the same. Gosh, honey, I'm doing this for you, but it's so much bigger than you and me. I'm scared, Will. I don't know if we can be enough. I know you'd be right here on the line with me. That helps. I'm going to do our dad proud, and you. I know I'm... just sort of blathering here. I miss you. I love you, and I'll see you soon. 
ASHLEY: But not too soon. Sorry. 
LIAM: It's all pretty brief, Fearne, any way you slice it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Thanks. 
MATT: "Of course." Nel steps up and quietly brushes some of the moss off the top of each stone. Bends in, gives it a quiet kiss. The wind picks up a little bit in a burst. Bit of a warm gust. You take in a few more moments of silence. "Well, would anyone like some biscuits or tea?" 
LIAM: Yes, ma'am. 
ASHLEY: Yes, ma'am. 
MATT: "I don't know if you--" 
SAM: No, but I'd love to learn your biscuit recipe! 
MATT: "Well, of course, yes! Let me show you. Come, come!" With that, Nel and Orym, FCG, and Fearne, you all trek back up the winding path away from the lands of memory. 
LIAM: As you wheel away, Orym places his hand on your metallic shoulder. Life's messy. 
SAM: Yeah, but it's really great! I mean, I know that they're gone, but think how lucky they were. Both of them! All of them in the cemetery. Even if you're poor, you still get to enjoy food and smell beautiful smells. Even if you're lonely, you get to see the beauty of the world and enjoy breathing. And these folks, they had you to know! They knew you! What a treat! Every single day, they knew you. 
LIAM: Well, that's where I was going with it, Letters. Life, it's beautiful, and you're part of that. I'm glad we have you. I'm glad I have you. 
ASHLEY: I'm really glad I have you. 
LIAM: Actually, that would be, I'm glad I have you. 
ASHLEY: I take Orym's hand and I squeeze it and I give it a kiss. I care about you very much. I'm sorry you lost someone you love. 
LIAM: It's all right. They're with me forever. Can I climb up? 
ASHLEY: Of course! 
LIAM: (soft pitter-patter) 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
SAM: You want a smoke? 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: Maybe later. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
SAM: I got to get rid of them. (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh. Mom! 
MATT: "Oh, yeah?" 
LIAM: Fearne is wondering if there's any of the poultice made for the Tempest left over. 
MATT: "There was a bit. I believe it was being held at the Tempest's. You'd have to talk to her." 
LIAM: Oh. Right, right, right. 
MATT: "Based on how much she's able to recover in time. But, yeah, speak with her. If there's any leftover. 
LIAM: Okay. We'll take the biscuits, then, for now. 
MATT: "Biscuits do better anyway." She leads you on to the room. So we have Laudna, we have Imogen, and Chetney. 
SAM: (wind whooshing) 
MARISHA: Base jumping! Base jumping! Base jumping! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Fucking adrenaline-- 
LIAM: Death kite! 
MARISHA: I'm so excited! 
TRAVIS: -- crew! 
TALIESIN: I'm definitely walking in that direction, too. 
LIAM: Death kite! 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: So-- 
TALIESIN: I get to witness. 
MATT: Following where these individuals are doing their loops, they're like sentry paths around over the entire town of Zephrah. 
TRAVIS: We're the shit! 
MATT: You see them eventually-- (laughter) 
MATT: They keep touching down at this one precipice that's on the western side of the town that rises up and there's a few ladders that climb up as well as a steep bit of rocky edge with some rope grab handles on the side that lead you to the top, and there's a platform that goes out about 15 or so feet. Right around there, you can see there are a number of these foldable structures that are currently hanging on the edge. It looks like there's a number of hooks, many of them are empty, but there's about four or five of them that are currently held. It looks like a storage peak at this point. 
TRAVIS: My hands are sweating. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: You can see one of them is still up, another one has landed. As you approach, you can see it's this older, well, younger-- (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Ah? 
MATT: -- halfling gentleman with a massive gray goatee that completely obscures his mouth. So it's like nose and (poofs). 
TRAVIS: (poofs) 
MATT: The hair is pushed back in this fright wig type of style from the wind blowing it and a set of tinted goggles that are over the front of his face, as he's in the process of folding down one of these devices. As you approach, you can see he's in a sleeveless, leather tunic and almost like a medieval flight suit vibe to it, as you all begin to approach. He stops as he's folding over. "Oh, hello! Can I help you? "Don't recognize you." 
TRAVIS: No, no! We're visiting. 
MARISHA: Yes. We're tourists! 
TRAVIS: Our friend Orym of the Air Ashari. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: "No, no--" 
LAURA: All of them are of the Air Ashari. 
MARISHA: Savior Blade of the Tempest. You may have heard of him. 
TRAVIS: Newly. Newly. 
MATT: "I'm aware of who this Orym is, aye." 
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, look. We saw your contraption here and we were wondering, is that a thing that we could try out? 
MATT: "Oh, you just want to walk up and try a skysail? Is that what this is about?" 
TRAVIS: A skysail? 
MARISHA: Oh, it sounds even cooler! 
TRAVIS: It does! It really does! 
MATT: "It's not really a recreational thing. It's sort of--" 
TRAVIS: How do you use it? 
LIAM: Lies. 
MATT: "We use it primarily for keeping watch and making sure everything's nice and safe, put together." At which point, you see the other person behind doing a full loop-the-loop, going, "Whee!" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh, safe and put together, huh? 
MATT: "It's very, very complicated techniques we've learned and honed after years and years of training." 
TRAVIS: Right. 
MATT: "To ensure that the--" (person 2) "Woo!" (laughter) 
MATT: (halfling) "Sh!" 
TRAVIS: You know what, Laudna? I would be so interested to learn. I always say acquiring a new skill is-- 
MARISHA: Absolutely, and of course-- 
TRAVIS: -- the spice of life. 
MARISHA: It's always wise to immerse yourself in the culture. 
TRAVIS: Yes. Oh yeah! 
MARISHA: In order to broaden your horizons. 
LAURA: Of course. 
MARISHA: Right? 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
MARISHA: You know, that's how you perpetuate the lives of the Air Ashari. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Would you like to make a persuasion check, please? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: (laughs) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: (raspy breathing) 
MARISHA: Do I get assistance? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yes, yes! 
MARISHA: Can I? Can I? 
MATT: Yep. You get assistance. 
TALIESIN: Corpse and almost corpse. 
MATT: Or you could both-- 
SAM: Come on! Come on! 
TALIESIN: Rolling for it. 
SAM: This is important! 
LIAM: Yeah, the soon-to-be corpse. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: 19! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Before and after photo. 
MATT: 19? 
MARISHA: Uh huh. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: "Well, recreationally, these are usually reserved for days of celebration." 
TRAVIS: Oh! We're celebrating! 
LAURA: Today! 
MATT: "I've been hearing music from the town." 
TRAVIS: You have! 
MARISHA: The Tempest! She's healed! 
MATT: "So I can give you a celebratory discount." 
TRAVIS: Oh snap! 
MARISHA: (excited gasp) Oh! 
TRAVIS: Your hand just broke. 
MARISHA: So. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Ah! 
LAURA: Ah, ha! 
TRAVIS: I don't know if they got solos, or if you want to go tandem. 
MARISHA: Oh, I mean, what do you recommend? 
MATT: Well, we can fit all three of you on one with your size there. 
LAURA: Oh! No, I'm-- 
TRAVIS: Imogen! Come on! 
MARISHA: Are you sure? 
LAURA: You know, I think I'll-- 
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? Look, y'all can saddle up. 
LAURA: I look over the edge of the cliff. Mm, no. Y'all are fine. Y'all just go. 
LIAM: Sail! 
LAURA: Y'all-- 
TRAVIS: Are you sure? 
MARISHA: Will you be here, just in case anything bad happens? 
TRAVIS: You got to do what makes you tremble! 
LAURA: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Tremble! 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: How about y'all just suit up? 
TRAVIS: Okay! Apparently, doesn't like a little spice in her food. 
MARISHA: If anything happens to me, promise me you'll move on. 
LAURA: Nothing's going to happen to you. 
MARISHA: Find somebody else and-- 
TRAVIS: What? 
MARISHA: Imogen's my girlfriend now! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh! Snap! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
LAURA: As you say it, I crack her wrist back into place removing your five rings. 
TRAVIS: (wails) 
MARISHA: Thank you! 
LAURA: You're welcome. 
TRAVIS: It's like that. Oh, I know the rough stuff. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Nice! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: "Well, my name is Ulli. Nice to meet you, girlfriends and all! 
MARISHA: Hi, Ulli! 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: "Put about five gold apiece for about 10 minutes of a ride." 
TRAVIS: 10 minutes? 
MARISHA: What?! Make it 20. 
LAURA: How long does it take to get over to, you know. If we wanted to-- I mean, not that I'm going to go, but if we wanted to go down over there, how long would that take? 
MATT: "Oh, if you go in a straight shot there, take you no more than maybe 35, 40 seconds." 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh, that's great! 10 minutes is great! 
MARISHA: We could do a few big-- 
LAURA: Loop-dee-loopies? 
LAURA: Yes. Aerial loops. 
MATT: "Certainly! Let me go ahead--" 
MARISHA: Little sky tour. 
MATT: "-- and get your devices." Walks over to the edge, and you can see where all the ones that are hanging over, he reaches further over the side and pulls up a rope and pulls up, you can assume these to be training skysails. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: They have brighter wing tips. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I want my parabolics. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: They have special weighted bottom to it and it looks like some sort of an extended tether. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TRAVIS: (spits out laugh) 
MARISHA: Is this for insurance purposes? 
MATT: "Oh, this is for when we train the newcomers to make use of the skysails, make sure they don't get themselves killed. Outright." 
MARISHA: Sure. 
MATT: "All right? It's a very dangerous thing you're asking about and I'm not about to be liable for this." 
TRAVIS: As he's talking, I backhand slide a very small chisel blade to Laudna, just in case the tether's too tight. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: He goes and starts folding it out. The other one swoops up and lands and you can see there's this elven woman, looks to be in her human equivalent of a mid-20s or so, short brown hair that's almost cut to a buzz cut, except for the very top, it's slicked back. She has her goggles on. 
MATT: (elf) "Woo! Who are these people?" 
TRAVIS: We are your newest stunt pilots! 
LAURA: We're tourists. 
TRAVIS: Yep! 
MATT: "Ulli, are you serious?" (Ulli) "Shh!" Gives half the money to her. (elf) "All right." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Money talks! 
MARISHA: It's true! 
TRAVIS: Money talks. Do we get goggles? 
MARISHA: Yeah, do we get the cool suits? 
MATT: "No." 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Do we get call signs? Do we get cool pilot names? 
MARISHA: (gasps) Can we make one? 
MATT: "Look, for a--" Looks over at the other individual. "For an additional charge, suits and titles can be provided." 
TRAVIS: I mean, we're here. 
MARISHA: We might as well. I mean, it sounds like a good deal. 
TRAVIS: (jingling coin purse) 
MARISHA: Do we get a little souvenir? 
LAURA: Do we get to keep the goggles? 
TRAVIS: You got pilot wings that they hand out to kids? 
MATT: "For the extended, all-inclusive Skysail Adventure package." 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: With video? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Put a GoPro right in front of my face. 
MATT: There's a little GoPro orb attachment. (laughter continues) 
TRAVIS: Riders will jump! Jump! 
MARISHA: Jump! (laughter) 
MATT: But it's improperly framed and only catches the right side of your face the whole time. 
MARISHA: Why is this green screened? We've got a beautiful background! (laughter) 
LAURA: Air Ashari! (laughs) 
MATT: "That'll be about 20 gold apiece for the run." 
LAURA: 20 gold? 
MATT: "But you keep the goggles." 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Keep the goggles! 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: You got it! 20 gold apiece. I got it! I got it! 
MARISHA: You got it? 
TRAVIS: I invest in life experience. 
MARISHA: We don't normally do little adventures together. 
TRAVIS: No, we don't! This is it though! 
MARISHA: This is going to be great! 
TRAVIS: This is how we bond! 
MARISHA: This is it. All right. 
MATT: The elven woman taps her foot pretty heavily towards the halfling fella and he goes, "(sighs)," gives her half the money, and goes, "All right. Don't get them killed." She walks off and starts taking her jacket off and heading off to the rest of her day. He's like "(sighs)." 
MARISHA: What's our call signs? 
MATT: "What do you want them to be? You paid for it! What's your call sign? Unless you want me to give you one?" 
MARISHA: I just-- (stammers) Yes! Dealer's choice. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
MARISHA: You know, it's something that's of the people. 
TRAVIS: You're the air boss. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: "Right, right, okay. You, Snappy Twig." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: SP! 
MARISHA: SP! 
TRAVIS: Snappy Twig! 
LAURA: Wait. Snappy SP? 
ASHLEY: SD? 
LAURA: Did you say SP? 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Snappy Twig. ST! 
TRAVIS: ST! 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
LAURA: St. Laudna? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Snappy Twig Laudna. Saint Laudna. Got it. 
MARISHA: (gasps) St. Laudna! 
TRAVIS: St. Laud. 
MATT: "Certainly! Yeah, see? Choose your own call sign! Do you want to pick one or do you want it to be provided?" 
TRAVIS: Snappy P is eligible. 
LAURA: No, you provide it.  
MATT: "You are Sunray Sally." 
LAURA: (gasps) I like it! 
TRAVIS: SS! 
LAURA: Imogen. All right. 
MATT: "All right. All right. And you?" 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (growling fancily) Arr. 
MATT: "Sure. (rolling tongue) Arr it is." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Amazing! 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Capture the essence. 
TRAVIS: Arr to ST! (radio static) Arr to ST! Prepare to depart! 
MATT: You see the look of-- 
MARISHA: This is ST. (tongue rolls) I copy! 
MATT: -- sinking regret on this halfling man's face. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Why are they talking into their hands? 
MATT: You see him breathe loudly, this heavy sigh. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's what the pine cones are for! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I forgot we picked them up off the ground. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Chet's holding a wooden building block. (laughter) 
LAURA: (radio static) 
MATT: Brings over the training skysail, the bright, bright red tips on the sides of the skysail wings, you can see there's a handle portion at the front, there's bars that spread out. That's where your feet go. The bars on the side are quite long and go back, so where two or people can hold onto it, simultaneously. "Now do any of you have experience with any sort of flight?" 
MARISHA: I mean, we have-- 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Been in the air. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: "Sure. You put your hand up. You'll be the guiding pilot. Are you going to--" 
LAURA: Are you doing this? Is he wrapping you into this now? 
LAURA: (stammers) How about I'll just make sure they don't die? 
MATT: "Great! Do that. So are you riding independently or are you going as a group?" 
TRAVIS: I feel like we got to go solo so we can at least dog fight. 
MARISHA: I kind of think so. Oh, that's a good idea! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes. All right. 
MATT: "All right, perfect! Here, go and step here." 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: "Who's going first? You first?" 
TRAVIS: No. Ladies. 
MARISHA: (hyperventilating) 
TRAVIS: Chivalry! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: "All right. Snappy Twig, come here." 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: "Up front, hands on the bars right here." 
MARISHA: Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Is there a lessons? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Are you giving me a crash course? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Yeah. Completely." He gets right in front of you, shows you where the bar is. "Put your hands on here." 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: You feel on your suit, there's tugging feelings, and he clips into your suit. You realize he's not going to let you do this by yourself. 
MARISHA: Oh! Okay, but we can still dog fight, right? 
MATT: "What?" 
MARISHA: Yeah, with-- 
LAURA: Just-- Mm-mm. 
TRAVIS: Just get-- 
MARISHA: All right! Let's go! ST on board! 
MATT: "All right. So hold on tight now. The enchantment here needs--" You can see, you're paying attention to this, he puts his thumb across the back of the bar, and as he does so, you can see the handle itself has faint glow that emanates, and the wings hinge outward (unfurling) into a wider position. As soon as it does, the wind hits them and you feel it lift slightly before it settles in. You can see it's still tethered to the edge of this platform. 
MATT: "All right. You ready?" 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: "Okay." Goes and reaches this cable that runs through these hooks on the sides, pulls it, you feel (metal clinking) and the latch that's holding it goes under and the whole thing (whooshes) goes into an immediate dive. 
MARISHA: (shrieks) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: (whooshes) 
TRAVIS: Yes! Yes! 
MARISHA: (shrieks) 
MATT: "Pull up! Pull up on the bar! Pull up on the bar!" 
MARISHA: I am a Snappy Twig! (laughter) 
MARISHA: I don't have upper body strength! 
MATT: Make a strength check for me. 
MARISHA: (shrieks) 
TALIESIN: You're practically a god. It'll be fine. 
MARISHA: Just a straight strength check? 
MATT: Strength check. 
TRAVIS: That's a big negative. 
MARISHA: Saving throw, or just add-- 
MATT: Just strength check. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Oh! That could've been worse! 
MARISHA: Minus three is 16. 
MATT: Oh! 
LIAM: Hey! 
SAM: That's pretty good! 
LAURA: Minus three! 
MATT: Surprising yourself, the adrenaline spikes through your maybe living system, and as you pull back on the bar, the resistance isn't enough to overcome your determination and the wings (whooshes) end up curling up as the wind picks them even further and you arc upward into a large updraft. (whooshes) 
LAURA: Let's go, St. Laudna! 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MARISHA: (shrieks) 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: So for the length of your 10-minute ride, what do you want to do? 
MARISHA: Well, I don't want to do-- 
LAURA: Are you really tethered? 
MARISHA: I'm-- 
LAURA: Is she tethered? 
MATT: You glance down where this is. That rope that was attached to it is what he pulled at that point. She's riding with him, so you're not tethered. 
LAURA: Oh! So he's on the thing as well? 
MATT: Oh yeah! He clicked into her outfit, so he's on it with her. 
LAURA: Got it! 
LIAM: Ah! 
TRAVIS: What am I cutting there? 
LAURA: I don't know. 
MATT: That's a good question. 
TRAVIS: (shrieks) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Help! 
MARISHA: Okay, well, I'll do a few loops and wait for Chetney. 
MATT: All right, go ahead. 
MARISHA: Is he getting in? Is he getting in the air at the same time? 
LAURA: I don't know if they're going to let him. It's a onesie. 
TRAVIS: It's only one at a time. 
MARISHA: Oh, it's one. Oh. 
MATT: Yeah, he's up with her, so it's one at a time. 
LAURA: Aw! 
TRAVIS: Is there an extra craft on the dock? 
MATT: There are a number over the side, yeah. 
TRAVIS: I mean, I really don't see-- 
LAURA: You know, Chet, you got to live a little. 
TRAVIS: That's what I'm saying. I'll go over to one of the other, what are they called, sky sweepers? 
MATT: Skysails. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever. I'll go over and-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Try and drag one of them over a little bit. Get it lined up nice and center. 
MATT: Okay, okay. Now, you did watch him set up the other one as you were-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, yeah. 
MATT: -- sailing through. They're both going in the air, doing loops and doing fun bits. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: On the bar. (blows raspberry) 
MATT: Yep, begins to glow a bit. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it glows a little?! 
LAURA: Oh, it worked! 
MATT: Yep. The wings shift outward. 
SAM: Oh shit! 
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Well, how the fuck do they hook in? Are there any-- 
LAURA: Just run! You just run and jump, Chet! 
TRAVIS: Are there any handy little dangles? 
MATT: No, you're just on the-- You got to scoot it up to the edge and just let it fly. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let it fly! Bombs away! (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Wait, you don't have to wear a suit? 
TRAVIS: (uncertain mumble) 
LAURA: Yeah, he just went! 
MARISHA: No, we're in the suits, right? We got suits and goggles. 
MATT: You got your suits and goggles. 
ASHLEY: You're wearing a suit. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MATT: When you were waiting your turn. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: So, Laudna, as you go, they're like, "All right, now you got to pull up," and then you hear that voices. "What's he-- Oh shit! "He-- What?!" 
LAURA: That's his name, after all. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I go: All right! We're going after (rolling tongue) Brrr! And do a hard 180-- 
MATT: (laughs) "Wait! What are you doing?!" 
ASHLEY: (trills tongue) 
LAURA: I'm going to put my goggles down and run and take a flying leap off the cliff myself. 
SAM: Oh gosh. 
MARISHA: (screams) 
MATT: "Oh god, they're all going to die! Oh my god! Oh god, I'm dead. Oh my god! Oh no!" (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (adrenaline groan) 
LAURA: As soon as I've gotten down to fall down to about their level, I hit Fly on myself. So I'm like-- 
MATT: (whoosh) You take out. Make a strength check for me. 
LIAM: That's telekinesis, Kyle. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: 14. No. 14, yes. 
MATT: 14, yeah. You pull them, you pick up as well. You're trying to override your current trainer. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Make another strength check for me. 
MARISHA: Oh jeez. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Don't fail me, Beau. Okay, nine. 
MATT: Nine. He got a seven. 
MARISHA: Ha ha! 
MATT: So he's like, "Ah! What are you doing? What are you doing?" (laughter) 
MATT: So what are you doing? 
TRAVIS: Meet me in the middle! 
MARISHA: All right! 
TRAVIS: Meet me in the middle! 
MARISHA: Are you going to go left or right? 
TRAVIS: (frantic) Not right now! 
MATT: The skysails pick up the (wind whooshing), start coasting around each other in the middle of this open airspace. 
TRAVIS: Oh god! Oh god! 
MARISHA: When I feel like I have Chet lined up, I'm going to do a Prestidigitation where I fling out a bunch of sparks that look like missiles, and I'm going to try and shoot him in his face. 
TRAVIS: Why would you do that? (laughter) 
MARISHA: We're dog fighting! (laughter) 
MATT: All right. Are you trying to avoid this? 
TRAVIS: Yes. (laughs) 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: I'm trying to bank and roll. 
MATT: Okay, got it. Contested dexterity checks, please, as you're trying to operate this device in the middle of the air. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay, okay. Just straight dex check? 
SAM: ♪ Highway to the ♪ 
MARISHA, SAM, and LAURA: ♪ danger zone ♪ 
MARISHA: Ooh, it's bad. 
TALIESIN: Do a barrel roll! 
TRAVIS: 12. 
MARISHA: Six. 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
TALIESIN: There we are. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Bank and roll. 
TRAVIS: (skysail zooming) 
MATT: Big avoidance. (soft pows) Sparks going out. You coast up and you now see they're pseudo dog fighting in the middle of the space. 
LAURA: What the shit? (laughter) 
MATT: You also hear, "What are you doing? Oh go! Hand off this! I'm taking this right back. Here, just do this." 
MARISHA: We got to get him. 
MATT: (frantic) "Get who?!" 
MARISHA: This is war! 
MATT: "(terrified screams)" (laughter) 
MARISHA: Flip around and go for round two! 
MATT: (whoosh) You bank around. You get a glimpse up. The wind is hitting his face to the point where you're now pushing back the bushy goatee and you see broken teeth and a scream on his face, going, "(frantic scream)" Eyes wide. 
LIAM: Clarifying question. Do the people of Zephrah see Leisure Suit Larry, the Banshee of Inisherin, and Jean Grey flying through the sky? (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah. Oh, this is all-- Remember, you guys saw them from Zephrah, which is what led you to that point. So the people that are celebrating are watching an air show now with sparks and all. 
LAURA: Prestidigitation, Prestidigitation. I'm shooting stuff at Chet, too, to try-- 
SAM: Oh! 
TALIESIN: For fuck sakes. 
TRAVIS: What?! 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
LAURA: Teamwork! 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
MATT: (laughs) Chet, what are you doing? 
TRAVIS: I take out the horn of silent alarm, and I'm like: (inhales) (silent blow) (laughter) 
MATT: Your ears are ringing with the loudest alarm. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's right! (laughter) 
MATT: I'll say make a wisdom saving throw for me. 
LAURA: Oh god. Oh! (goofy laugh) 19. 
MATT: 19, okay. So you're used to shutting off noise from the inside of your mind, and as the horns go off, as much as it's about to cause your eardrums about to burst for a moment internally, you push through it and keep focused. 
LAURA: Ha ha! 
MATT: All right, so-- 
TRAVIS: I'm getting teamed up on. Got to get low, got to get fast. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Just push it into a dive. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ah! 
MATT: You go into a full dive, and it's this moment you realize you haven't really looked down up to this point. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: It is straight mountain valley down for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of feet before there is broken cliff side and smaller farmstead abodes and little outcroppings that lead into farmland that's been cultivated and built this high up in the middle of this mountain range. You can see these wide fields, and then broken cliff edges, and then further fall into heavy, heavy forest below. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: You're just (wind blowing) falling. Your cheeks are rattling behind you. 
TRAVIS: What goes down must come up! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Not yet. Not yet! (laughter) 
MATT: Make another strength check for me. 
SAM: Come on. 
LAURA: I'm dive bombing after him. 
TRAVIS: (screams) It's a six! (laughter) 
MATT: You go to pull up. 
LAURA: This is how Chet dies. 
TALIESIN: Practically gods. Oh! 
MATT: You go to pull up and it, oh, this is going pretty steep. You start-- 
TRAVIS: (panicked grunts) 
MATT: -- you're arcing, you're arcing. You're not in a complete dive, but you're still going down. You're just pulling up slightly. You see it's getting close. It's one almost like a windmill structure. It's on the edge of this cliff that's getting closer and closer as you're arcing up. 
MARISHA: Holy shit! 
MATT: You see this one person who's out there in the process of watering a small bank of garden on the outside of it. They look up and go "(screams)." Just trekking towards them. What are you two doing? 
LAURA: I was diving after him. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: We got it! Yeah, Chet, what was my trainer's name again? 
SAM: Ulli? 
MATT: Ulli is what you heard. 
MARISHA: (shouts) Come on, Ulli! 
MATT: (shouts) "Ah, what do I do? They're going to-- oh god!" 
MARISHA: We're going after him. 
MATT: All right, make another strength check. 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Oh, even worse. One total. 
LIAM: Woof. 
MATT: One total. He resists and pulls you out of the air. He's like, "We're going right back right now! Your friend's going to die. You're under my tutelage!" Is now pulling you away from pursuing and trying to get you back-- 
LAURA: Laudna! 
MATT: -- to the top of it. 
LAURA: I got him, I got him! 
MARISHA: You're going up to, Chet? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MARISHA: I look up on my trainer. I'm sorry, Ulli, but I paid 20 gold for this, and I put bees in his face. (laughter) 
MATT: "(screams)" Now, mind you, he's-- (laughter) 
MATT: He's connected to you, so he can't go anywhere. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: Is that a spell or do you just have bees? (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's Infestation. 
SAM: Oh, okay. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You were saving them for later. 
MATT: Into an inventory. 
LIAM: I have seven silver of bees. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Cross that off the inventory. 
MATT: "(garbled screams) Ow, my eyes! Ow!" 
MARISHA: Sorry! 
MATT: Coasting down towards, now it's Chetney hovering and pulling up. You quickly behind. 
TRAVIS: Altitude! 
LAURA: How close am I? 
MATT: Huh? Well, what's your fly speed? 
LAURA: I don't know. (laughter) 
LAURA: How do I know-- wait. It's in my spells. 
MATT: It would be in the spell, yep. 
SAM: Are two guys walking across the street holding a big plate of glass? 
LAURA: 60 feet! (laughter) 
SAM: Right next to the windmill. The guy with a basket full of tomatoes. (laughter) 
LAURA: 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet? Okay, so full dash. At your dive-- 
TRAVIS: Terminal velocity? 
MATT: Yeah. The skysails are a pretty decent speed. 
ASHLEY: Mach five? 
MATT: Oh no, actually. Fly speed of 60 feet. You're not catching up to him is the thing. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You are, I'd say you're about-- 
TRAVIS: Always chasing. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: About 80 feet behind him. 
MARISHA: Until she's suddenly not! 
LAURA: 80 feet behind him? Okay. If I see him, is he about to hit? If I see he's about to hit. 
MATT: He's got one more shot. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Oh man. 
LAURA: I'm going to say something if he looks like he is. 
TRAVIS: (whoops) 
MATT: You're holding an action. 
TRAVIS: (louder whoops) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (shouts) Whoa! 
SAM: You got this, you got this. 
LAURA: Chet! Would you like to-- 
TRAVIS: I'm licking all the sticks. Ah! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Hitting all the dials! 
LAURA: In your head, you hear: Would you like some help? 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Maybe. (laughter) 
SAM: You got this, Chet. 
TRAVIS: I can make it! I'm going to pop and pull with everything I got. (howls) 
MATT: All right, one more strength check. 
LIAM: Welcome to Zephrah, Mr. Hunt. 
TRAVIS: Oh, 16. 
MATT: 16. Incoming! You hear the wood creaking a bit. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: The person under goes "(screams)." 
TRAVIS: I'm also wearing the butcher's bib. So it's like (intense splatters) (laughter) 
LIAM: Ooh! 
MATT: All the farmers below are hearing the screaming, look up and then see (squelchy impact) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Skywriting, the worst skywriting. 
MATT: You are full on crop dusting with blood across Zephrah right now. 
LAURA: Disgusting. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (screams) (screams) 
MATT: As you pull up just in time, the bottom of the skysail just nicks the top of the windmill. About five or six different shingles of the roof go flying, scattering off into the field. 
LAURA: We'll fix that. 
TALIESIN: No, we won't. 
LAURA: No, we won't. 
MATT: As you curl up just in time to see coming back towards you Laudna and a screaming halfling. 
SAM: Oh god! 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
MARISHA: I look at Chet and I go: Are we going left or are we going right? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: (bee buzzing) 
TRAVIS: (shouts) Left! 
MARISHA: (shouts) Left! (laughter) 
MARISHA: When I have that, yes. 
MATT: Just barely missed each other. 
MARISHA: It's this. Wait, wait, how did I? Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's like John Woo, like (slow motion whoosh). 
MATT: Indeed. 
TRAVIS: (slow motion) Wha! 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (slow motion) Wha! 
MATT: (wobbling cheeks) 
ASHLEY: High five. 
MATT: The cheek's flapping as you go by. You're pulled up, but you're also pulling downward. I need you to make a strength check, as you've now taken control. You do not get the help from your trainer because you filled his head with-- 
MATT and TRAVIS: Bees. (laughter) 
MATT: So this is only Laudna on this tug. 
MARISHA: (screams) Natural 20! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
ALL: (cheering) 
MATT: If there was a time. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Total of 17. 
TRAVIS: The bees, baby! 
MATT: So 17. (laughs) Great. So you pull it up and you manage to scoot by, missing by about 10 feet. The same windmill that he had just avoided. The person that just went outside, "What the hell? (screams)," sees you come by again and runs back inside, tossing their water can way off in the air. 
TALIESIN: You're scattering bees now after the blood went one way and the bees going the other. 
MATT: Yep! (laughs) (bees buzzing) 
LIAM: Maybe it was bee strength that lifted you up. (laughter) 
MATT: The bees don't want to die either. But pull back up and you watch as Laudna scoots by barely, leaving a trail of bees behind as she goes. 
LAURA: Bees! (laughter) 
LAURA: Why bees?! 
MARISHA: I had to regain control. 
TRAVIS: I start trying to make my way back towards the landing pad. It's like Pilotwings on N64. Nothing's going right. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh god! Oh! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Have the owl follow back to try and land. 
TRAVIS: Woo! Follow the orbs! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, make a dexterity check for me. 
SAM: Pull up, pull up. 
TRAVIS: 10. 
MATT: 10. (wind blows) A gust of wind picks up. Sends you off and you go (zoom) and collide into the side of a nearby warehouse. A little ways beyond that-- 
TRAVIS: (shouts) 
MATT: -- the skysail slams into it hard. You take... 
LIAM: At that speed? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: A little barf comes out. 
LAURA: You think? 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (barf) 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: (barf) 
MATT: You take 18 points of bludgeoning damage upon the impact. 
MARISHA: 18! 
MATT: 18 points of bludgeoning damage. As this slam, you see wood is splintered outward. Part of the broken skysail wing is coasting out the side, (creaks) almost twitching as the enchantment's trying to reinforce itself. 
TRAVIS: That's okay. 
LAURA: That's an expensive mistake. 
TRAVIS: It's all right. 
TALIESIN: I slowly walk up to Chet. 
SAM: You're here? 
LAURA: Oh, you're here? 
TALIESIN: There's a trail. I've been following a fucking red line. It has not been hard. 
TRAVIS: I have made a trail. 
MATT: You're not the only one. There's about 20 or so Zephrans that are a little further back going like. As you coast up with your compatriot, Ulli, who's like, "(incoherent grumbles)." His face is kind of swollen. 
ALL: Oh no. 
MATT: He's got bees in his beard. 
ALL: (oohing) 
MARISHA: Sorry, Ulli. 
TRAVIS: Curse of Bloated Agony. No. 
MATT: (laughs) Make a dexterity check for me. 
MARISHA: All right, to try and land? 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: Land this sucker. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's see if this one's going to be good. Okay. Just a straight check, right? 
MATT: Straight dexterity check. 
MARISHA: 17. 
MATT: 17. 
SAM: That's great. 
MATT: Now that you've gotten the hang of it. You coast on one final burst of heavy wind that kicks up at the edge of the cliff. You ride it up to slow down your approach, and then come to a gentle rest onto the top. You land, the wings collapse underneath themselves and fold up. In front of, your associate's like, "(mumbled) Get me out! Please! (whimpering)" (laughter) 
MATT: "I'm done." Opens one eye, but it's swollen shut almost. He unclips himself and tumbles out to the ground. "(coughs)" 
TRAVIS: Nice landing! (mocking cough) 
LAURA: I'll send some more missiles over to Chet. 
TRAVIS: Ah! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We have definitely not helped you get out of this. 
TRAVIS: No! 
TALIESIN: I'm keeping people back. 
TRAVIS: As I, I imagine just hanging out. 
TALIESIN: He can do it himself, people. He has dignity. He can do it himself. (laughter) 
MATT: The other elven skysail operator who left is just in the back with a bowl of grapes and is just like-- 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: "How'd that work out for you, Ulli? Oh my god! Ulli, what happened?" He goes, "(spits)" and just spits a bee out that goes (soft thuds) on the ground. 
LAURA: Aw! 
MATT: (Ulli) "(cries)" 
LAURA: Save the bees. 
SAM: Aw. 
MARISHA: Sorry about that, Ulli. Here, I'll-- We're sleeping, right? I'll drop a Wither and Bloom on you to heal you up a little bit. 
MATT: Okay, so considering him an ally, right? 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughter) 
MATT: Not just (sucking). 
TALIESIN: Tentatively. 
MATT: Yeah. His face returns to mostly normal at this point and "(coughs)." 
MARISHA: That was awesome! 
MATT: "Leave." 
MARISHA: Okay! 
MATT: "Now." 
MARISHA: Let me go help Chet. 
MATT: "No. Just go." 
MARISHA: Okay! And I get to keep the goggles, right? 
MATT: "Please." 
MARISHA: Okay! This was great. 
LAURA: Thank you for the goggles. That was a wonderful experience. 
MATT: "Valuable lessons I've learned today. Go." 
LAURA: I Prestidigitation, clean him up a little bit. I'm just making you look better. All right. 
MARISHA: Did you see me? Was I great? 
LAURA: Oh, I saw you. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. 
LAURA: I saw. 
MARISHA: Oh! Exhilarating, let's go. I feel like we should go check on Chet, even though he said not to. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: I'm just resting... in the danger zone. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Barf. 
TRAVIS: ♪ (hums jaunty tune) ♪ 
LAURA: As we unhook you. 
TALIESIN: I can't tell if you're bleeding or if it's your clothing bleeding. Oh, no, let's give him a minute. Give him a minute. 
LAURA: He's been hanging for-- 
LIAM: Do you have to roll for heart attack, disadvantage? 
MATT: Now, Chetney, you're partially embedded in the side of some sort of warehouse or a barn. It's hard to make out what it is. Mainly it's your head and your hands and your feet sticking out and the rest of you is like, your ass and all is halfway stuck inward like Winnie the Pooh, more or less. You hear this sound from the other side of the wall. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MATT: (chicken clucking) Bunch of clucking sounds. You feel pecking. 
TRAVIS: Ow! 
MATT: (pecking) 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
MATT: (pecking) 
TRAVIS: Hey, fucker. 
LIAM: (extended bawk) 
TRAVIS: Stop. 
MATT: (clucking) 
TRAVIS: Get off me! (screams) Ow! 
MATT: (pecking) 
TRAVIS: (screams) Horn sound off. Pff. (laughter) 
LAURA: All right, all right. Shit. 
TRAVIS: About to go wolf. 
TALIESIN: I'm not a part of this shit. 
MATT: As soon as you pull Chetney up-- 
TALIESIN: I'm literally standing here laughing my ass off. I am not helping. 
TRAVIS: They're eating my feet, they're eating my feet! 
TALIESIN: What the cluck is wrong? 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's really good. 
TALIESIN: (cackles) 
TRAVIS: That's great, Ashton, thank you. 
LAURA: Ashton! 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
LAURA: Nice. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MARISHA: That was good. I'll do a little Mending on the wall. 
MATT: Okay. You pull Chetney out, four chickens (surprised clucking) come out with him and flutter off. 
MARISHA: Oh. Should we get the-- 
LAURA: Chase after the chicken. 
TALIESIN: You're more-- 
MARISHA: Throw them. 
TALIESIN: Brain the chickens. 
MATT: (surprised clucking) 
MARISHA: Mend the wall. 
LAURA: Mending. 
TRAVIS: That is how you do that! 
MARISHA: Yes! Oh! Vacation. 
TALIESIN: Show's over, people. Show's over. Go, go. Get the fuck out. It's all good. 
MATT: (child) "Mom, do they fly like that?" (Mom) "Shh, don't ever do that, son." 
TALIESIN: Scoot, scoot. 
MARISHA: That was the best decision we could've made. 
LAURA: I think y'all made Orym real proud. 
MARISHA: You think so? 
LAURA: Yeah, I think so. 
MARISHA: I wonder if he was watching. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, endeared ourself to his people. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Which, by the way-- 
LAURA: They respect y'all now. 
MATT: As you were walking back from the wonderful, solemn grave site, you hear these distant screams and begin to watch this wild sky performance. 
TRAVIS: Battle, battle! 
TALIESIN: Fucking Road Runner cartoon in the sky. 
LIAM: That's about as well as I thought it'd go. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: Cool. 
SAM: Life really is beautiful. (laughter) 
LIAM: Do we hear the horn or was that only for Imogen? 
MATT: I believe with the horn, it's only who you're-- 
TRAVIS: The last one was for anybody, so. 
MATT: That's right. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
TRAVIS: One, two, three. Yeah, it's for Fearne. (laughter) 
LAURA: Just randomly. 
TRAVIS: (screams) Help! (deep horn wail) 
ASHLEY: What is that noise? 
TRAVIS: (deep horn wail) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (weak trumpet call) 
ASHLEY: I hear a horn. Does anyone hear a horn? 
LIAM: They're taking the werewolves to Isengard! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's 600 feet, so. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That was great. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Drink? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Drink. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Drink! 
MARISHA: Ugh, I got cottonmouth. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Certainly accrued a unique selection of Zephran interested parties. Many of the civilians who are either familiar with the recent deeds that you've done in the name of the Voice of the Tempest and the even more recent deeds you did in the name of a unique celebration for the populace, you-- 
MARISHA: It's going to have to be a ride at Crit Role Land, you guys. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: One of those ones where you hang from the bottom of it. 
MARISHA: Yes, the hanging coasters. Oh, do it. 
TRAVIS: (retches) (laughter) 
MATT: But you all begin to gather after witnessing these things, and you all find yourselves once more in the center of the city. What would you like to do? 
LIAM: (sighs) 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: What's next? 
SAM: Y'all are back. 
MARISHA: (sighs) 
LAURA: You should've seen it. They were-- 
LIAM: We saw a part of it. 
LAURA: They were something. 
TALIESIN: It was pretty fucking spectacular. 
MARISHA: You guys missed out. 
SAM: It seems you really painted the town red. 
ASHLEY: We should've tried it. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
LAURA: As we go about our day for the rest of the day, anywhere I see drops of blood, I'm going to clean it up. I'm Prestidigitation. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LAURA: Trying to get rid of-- 
MATT: A lot of people are in the process of scrubbing this weird iron-like red splatter that has now coated elements of the city. 
SAM: Yeah, maybe hide that for a while. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yeah. Do you create a puddle wherever you stand if you-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
TRAVIS: In the bag it goes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (flicks blood) 
LAURA: Ugh! 
MARISHA: Oh, yuck! 
LAURA: Well, it's really up to you, Orym. 
LIAM: Well, I think I've got another hour or two before my gear is ready. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
LIAM: Did you want to get a drink? 
SAM: I mean, we can just-- We're just picking up gear and spending the night here, right? 
LAURA: (uncertain stammers) 
MARISHA: You said you wanted to do the thing again. 
LIAM: You two know the answer to that. 
MARISHA: So you have a better idea. 
SAM: Yeah, I don't feel confident about going anywhere right now. I just don't know where we're going, so. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: We should stay and then do one more. 
SAM: One more in the morning. 
MARISHA: Right? 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: First thing. 
ASHLEY: I could also help. I could do a Scry as well so if you-- 
LAURA: Oh, maybe you can. Yeah, maybe you can look in on it. 
TALIESIN: Hey! 
SAM: That's true, that's true. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Or we could go to the Airy Eyrie or the Rocky Outcrop. 
TALIESIN: Are those bars? 
LIAM: They are bars. 
MARISHA: What's the better one? 
LIAM: I like the Airy Eyrie. 
TALIESIN: I like the name. It's hard to say if you're trashed, I imagine. 
LAURA: If you're drunk. 
TALIESIN: Airy Eyrie. 
LAURA: Airy Eyrie. 
LIAM: That's part of the charm. 
TALIESIN: I want to learn how to not say it. 
LAURA: Oh, (slurred) launder over low. 
TALIESIN: Airy Eyrie. 
ASHLEY: Ashton! 
LIAM: Next door to the Rural Juror. 
ASHLEY: Look at your-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yo! Yes! 
ASHLEY: This is amazing! My goodness, what an upgrade. 
TRAVIS: You're looking sharp! 
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Woo! 
LIAM: It's not bad. 
TALIESIN: Going professional. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
LAURA: You really look, I don't know, more confident in it. 
TALIESIN: I'm feeling more confident. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MARISHA: You make a corset look good. 
ASHLEY: Yeah 
TALIESIN: Thank you for-- 
ASHLEY: That looks really good. 
TALIESIN: -- purchasing a really, really nice one. I think that little-- 
ASHLEY: I kind of want to try on your jacket. 
LIAM: I think the phrase is: Fine as fuck. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: I think with your build, I don't know. Is it-- 
ASHLEY: Hey, fuck off! 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: That's very impressive. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: (gasps) Do you still have those horns, by the way? 
ASHLEY: Which horns? 
TALIESIN: The ones you may have-- 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, that I took from the-- What did I take? Where, where? (laughter) 
LAURA: What horns? 
TALIESIN: You cut the horns off that demon. 
ASHLEY: I took the horns off the thing. 
LAURA: (gasps) That's right! 
ASHLEY: Yes, that's right. Yeah, do you want them? 
TALIESIN: I was thinking-- Well, we don't have time to get them fucked with now. We can get them fucked with later. I have a great idea. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm into it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I forgot about that. 
TALIESIN: In the meantime, drinks. 
MARISHA: Airy Eyrie? 
TALIESIN: Is there a party tonight? I don't know. 
LIAM: There might be. I don't know. I mean, we could go to the Airy Eyrie. It's like Zephrah-core vibes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: A lot of outdoor seating-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: -- if you want the view at night when the sun sets. 
LAURA: Oh, it's bet it's amazing. 
LIAM: It's pretty spectacular. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, what time of day is it? 
MATT: I'll say for your travels and stuff, it's getting later in the afternoon. You probably have an hour or two before the sun begins to set. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Most nights, somebody goes too deep in their cups and turns into a bird and it's that kind of place. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
LAURA: That's exciting. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Sounds great. 
LAURA: We do need to talk to Keyleth again, right? 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. Well, we have to check in before parting, and then we had a favor to ask. Well, Fearne just wanted some of the, if they have it to spare, that poultice that-- 
ASHLEY: If she has some to spare. 
TALIESIN: I'm a big fan. 
LAURA: Oh, that would be really smart. 
TALIESIN: Maybe running our general plan past an actual adult might not be a bad idea. 
LAURA: Yeah, all right. Get drunk, go talk to Keyleth. Sounds like a great-- 
LIAM: She'd approve. 
SAM: Great. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All right. In that time period, you're able to meet back up with Torth. 
LIAM: Can I swing by? Okay, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LIAM: Hey, hey. 
MATT: "Oh, hi. Perfect timing. Hold on there." Goes ahead and-- You left your shield as well, right? For him to-- No, no, no. You took the shield with you. 
LAURA: Yeah. It was just armor. 
MATT: It was the armor he wanted. 
MATT: Yeah, so he goes and pulls it from behind and-- "Based on what you were asking about, I think this'll get the best opinion about." Holds up this new set of leather armor, if you'd like to describe what he holds up. 
LIAM: Yeah, so Orym tries it on. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: It takes a minute, a hot minute, because it's a full, almost full brown leather bodysuit. 
TRAVIS: Hmm? 
LIAM: Head to toe. He's still got the Boots of Striding and Springing on. He's still got the same blade, same shield, but now, whereas earlier he was kind of in more relaxed Zephrah attire, he looks a little more geared up for the frontline. It's a full leather armor suit. The only parts that are bare are his sword arm, so tattoo and sword arm are free. There's still, even where his shield arm is armored all the way down to the hand, there are still gaps in it and gaps along his ribcage to let air in and keep him light. It's 15 or 20% heavier than he's used to, but he's also gotten stronger in the last few months so he's a little more ready to fuck around and find out. 
MATT: "So it's to your liking?" 
LIAM: It's pretty badass, actually. It's perfect. 
MATT: "Oh, consider it a gift to the Savior Blade of the Tempest." 
SAM: Whoa! 
LIAM: Oh, that's not necessary. 
MATT: "Oh, it absolutely is. I was informed by the Voice herself to waive any sort of--" 
LIAM: Oh. 
MATT: "This is your uniform." 
LAURA: Wow. 
LIAM: Okay. Much obliged, thank you. 
MATT: "Much obliged for helping her." 
LIAM: Well, you do fine work. This is gorgeous, actually. [metallic mug ringing] 
LAURA and MARISHA: Bing. 
LIAM: Oh, also the little sash that was hanging at his belt, the Zephran sash is still here. It's tied around a leather strap right over his heart. 
SAM: Aw. 
LIAM: Which is over here. 
SAM: Yeah. (laughs) 
LIAM: It moves around. 
MATT: Yeah, halflings are weird. 
TRAVIS: Oh no, he's showing true colors. Kill him! 
LIAM: (growls) 
TRAVIS: He's a doppelganger! (laughter) 
LAURA: I thought you were going to say it was tied around his chest now like a little chesty-- 
LIAM: Mm, that's it. That's all it is. It's a nipple guard. It's a cloth nipple guard. 
TALIESIN: Keep them from chafing. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Leather can burn. 
LIAM: So much. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
LIAM: (sighs) Let's go get a drink. 
MATT: All right, so you lead them to the Airy? 
LIAM: I'm going to lead them to my favorite outdoor beer garden. 
TRAVIS: H'airy H'airy. 
LIAM: Type place. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: The H'airy H'airy. 
LIAM: That's on the way out, not the way in. The Airy Eyrie. 
LAURA: Airy Eyrie. 
MATT: Which, in this afternoon, it's hopping more than usual because people are still kind of, you know, reveling in the celebration of the Voice's return to health and the turn of the current tides of luck as they've been in recent days. So you're coming by here, and it's this beautiful cliffside outdoor beer garden, as you said. Long galley seating in places, but it's a kind of open elven-inspired architecture that overlooks much of the surrounding mountain range and the valley to the west and southwest. You can see there's a manner of hanging long flags that flap and curl with the wind, giving this gentle rhythmic (wind whipping) flapping sound as well as a number of decorative pinwheels that pick up from the wind and have bells at certain points that get pulled and tugged with them so it gives this chime vibe where the wind seems to be playing the music for the atmosphere of the interior. But there's laughter and there's clinking of steins and the bar is a rectangular shape. It's three sides and they have a large central column that has all these little pockets like cubbies that are put on top of each other like a lattice or like how libraries will store scrolls, but instead they're wine bottles and liquor bottles. They're pulling them out of these little cubbies to make drinks for those who are there, the two employees that are present. But you are a regular to this place in the past, and you have your favorite spot if you want to lead them to where that is. 
LIAM: I'm actually going to walk up to the bar. Guys, sit over there. That is the view, that one. I walk up to the bar and hop up. Evening. 
MATT: You see an air genasi gentleman in his late 50s or so, a bit of a receding hairline and short salt and pepper hair on the sides. He has a pair of thicker glasses at the end of his nose and a bright smile with a big gap in his front teeth, and he's in the process of wiping one mug that he sits on the counter. "Oh, Orym! Welcome, welcome. It's been a bit." 
LIAM: (sighs) It's been months. 
MATT: "What can I get you?" 
LIAM: Or years. Well, I'll tell you what. 
TALIESIN and MARISHA: It's been. 
LIAM: I've got one night here in Zephrah with my friends over there and I want it to be a good one. This is the last coin in my pocket. I put a platinum down on the bar. 
MATT: "Oh! Big spender." 
LIAM: I'm now broke, totally. Please show my friends a good time tonight. 
MARISHA: He's broke? 
MATT: "We'll take care of you. Don't worry." 
LIAM: Could I start us off with a tray of shots? Is that all right? 
MATT: "I think we can do that. It's a bit early, but you know, you're the customer." 
LIAM: Not too early. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: (glass clinking) Boom, right down on the table in the middle. 
ASHLEY: Wow. What are they? 
TALIESIN: Anything we should expect? 
LIAM: Uh, get lightheaded. 
MARISHA: Is it, are they tiny shot? (laughs) 
LIAM: No, they're big for me. 
MARISHA: They're big? (laughs) 
LIAM: Here's mine. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA and LIAM: Oh, oh, oh! 
TALIESIN: I'm checking the color. I'm seeing, you know, taking a look. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
LIAM: We're on a hard road, but not tonight. Not right now. I'm glad you guys are here. I'm glad you survived. 
TRAVIS: Me too! To the victor go the spoils! 
MARISHA: Oh, to the open skies! 
TRAVIS: Fuck chickens. 
MARISHA: Fuck chickens! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Fuck chickens. 
LIAM: Fuck chickens! 
TALIESIN: But don't get caught. There we go. 
MATT: "Fuck chickens!" 
MARISHA: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LIAM: Mm. 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that's good. 
LIAM: Ah! 
TRAVIS: (impact landing) (laughter) 
MATT: It's got a-- 
LAURA: I think Chet got a concussion. 
TALIESIN: What's FCG doing with all this? 
SAM: Just watching. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to slide an empty shot glass over to FCG. I'm going to put a silver in it. 
SAM: Ah! 
TALIESIN: Then push a little stack of them. Just join in every fucking run. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, now you know. Uh, okay, I think you got to slow down there. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Slow down there. 
SAM: No, this is the good shit! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's my last. Okay. 
LIAM: Does the Easy-Bake Oven make these? 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
SAM: Uh, coins? 
LAURA: Alcohol. 
LIAM: No, no, alcohol. 
SAM: I'm sorry, no, it doesn't. I mean, it can make the alcohol hot. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Oh, hot toddies. 
TALIESIN: Hot toddy time. 
MATT: Yeah, it's a different feat to have the still installed. 
SAM: (chuckles) Yeah. 
MARISHA: Next upgrade. 
LAURA: There's a interesting smell coming from FCG. 
MARISHA: He's fermenting all the time. 
TALIESIN: How would I know if I would know how to make a still? 
MATT: Uh-- 
MARISHA: You would know how to make a still. 
TALIESIN: Maybe. Yeah, that's possible. 
MARISHA: I'm not the DM, but I just know you would know how to make a still. 
TALIESIN: It's a very, yeah, you live in the spires in the-- 
LIAM: Bathtub gin, at least. 
TALIESIN: Then maybe you'd know how to make-- 
MARISHA: Yes, for sure. 
TALIESIN: Possibly poisonous go blind alcohol, so-- 
MATT: Yeah, I mean, that would be alchemy adjacent so that would be a straight intelligence check. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Then if you were proficient in alchemy supplies, that would give you the proficiency bonus added to-- 
TALIESIN: I am not, so let's-- Just straight or disadvantage or-- 
MATT: No, just straight. 
TALIESIN: Just straight. All right, let's see what happens. 
MATT: Disadvantage for folks who didn't grow up in the environment you did. 
TALIESIN: No, that's fair. Okay. So intelligence. 13. 
LIAM: Let's go, street smarts. 
MATT: You could, you feel confident that you could make some hooch. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Take you a little bit with the right supplies, but you could probably do it. 
TALIESIN: Let me see what I can do. Chetney, you down for talking about some shit? 
TRAVIS: I mean, yes, perpetually. I don't even know what the initial offer was. I just said yes. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I love that you're down for shit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's-- We'll see if we can make a little booze using what you got going in there. 
SAM: At the bar? 
LAURA: Right now? 
LIAM: Right here? 
TALIESIN: No, just in the future. 
SAM: Oh, the future. 
MATT: Yeah, it'll take some time. 
TALIESIN: Bring the party with us. 
TRAVIS: Hell yeah. 
LAURA: Do you have anything baking right now, though? 
SAM: Oh, well, I have some brownies that have been slow baking. 
TRAVIS: Me too. 
SAM: I call them, I call-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Slow bacon? 
TRAVIS: Especially after that flight. 
TALIESIN: Okay, what it? Well-- 
TRAVIS: They're a little backed up at the moment. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Thoomp! (laughter) 
LAURA: Turtle head? (groaning) 
LIAM: Oh man! 
TRAVIS: I'm just laying, I'm sitting on one cheek, okay? 
MATT: (laughs) Oh my god. 
LAURA: I don't want the brownies anymore. 
SAM: Nope, I think you don't. 
LIAM: I thought it was a different joke entirely and it swerved in another direction. 
SAM: I'll make something else. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Something with bran. 
TRAVIS: Hey, FCG. 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: You missing FRIDA? 
SAM: Oh, well, jesus! Now I am! 
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. I just figured, you know-- 
SAM: Yeah, of course, of course. I mean, I'm sure they're fine, right? They're all fine. 
TRAVIS: Of course! 
SAM: I forgot, what did we send them to do? FRIDA and Deanna. 
LIAM: They're going to find-- 
SAM: To do research. 
LIAM: -- information in Vasselheim. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Yeah, research mission in Vasselheim. 
TRAVIS: The Dawn City. 
SAM: So they're okay. 
LIAM: The Lore-sonists. 
LAURA: I'm sure Vasselheim is totally safe. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're the ones in danger. Have you had any more visions from-- 
SAM: I mean, I've talked to my god a whole bunch, but yeah, I mean, honestly, the only thing I'm trying to figure out right now next is, well, it seems like some of us are open to the faith a bit more. 
TRAVIS: Mm? 
SAM: But not Ashton as much, and so I was trying to figure out, what would it take to make you a believer? What would have to happen? 
TALIESIN: Nothing that they can-- Well-- (sighs deeply) Nothing that is ever going to happen. 
SAM: Well, how do you know? They can make miracles and stuff. Didn't they make the world what it is today? Didn't they sort of-- 
TALIESIN: I mean, by having a colossal war and destroying huge chunks of it and killing a whole bunch of fucking people and-- 
SAM: But didn't they drive away bad guys and stuff? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, more of their own-- Yeah, like other gods who were just, you know-- 
SAM: Yeah, the bad ones, but they drove them away so we could be peaceful and have magic and happiness-- 
TALIESIN: The bad ones? You were very nice to that previous bad one. The champion of which that we met not that long ago. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Didn't seem that bad. 
MARISHA: The one that Fearne gave-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah, the one that Fearne-- 
TALIESIN: That Fearne was like eye-fucking. 
SAM: I mean, he was very attractive, though. 
TALIESIN: I mean, mad respect. 
LAURA: I mean, he was really attractive. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, well, well, I mean-- Yeah, if we need him. 
SAM: What you got going on? 
LAURA: (rings) 
ASHLEY: It's-- 
SAM: Oh, oh, it's a symbol. 
LAURA: He gave a little smoochy-woochy right there? 
TALIESIN: It's an arcane phone number for texting. 
ASHLEY: An arcane phone number. 
TALIESIN: Just, "You up?" 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: FCG, I was thinking, you know, you've got this connection, this godly connection. 
SAM: I do. 
TRAVIS: It's also strange that you've managed to not only discover that you were brought about by someone that was like you and then you found FRIDA. I mean, your kind is rare, right? 
SAM: Well, apparently, less rare than I thought. I mean, even Orym's mom today was like, "There's another one that's been through here." 
TRAVIS: This is what I'm talking about! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but she said your vibe was a little different. 
LIAM: That was different. I saw the one that Nel was talking about and that was sort of a-- what is the word? Automaton. 
SAM: Watch yourself. 
LIAM: Automaton. 
SAM: Watch yourself-- 
LAURA: What's wrong with automaton? 
SAM: It's a slur in our-- (laughter) 
SAM: No, it's not, I'm just joking, I'm joking. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Don't make weird canon. 
TRAVIS: But that's like me, that's a fourth one. Between you and me, we kind of make up, well, Laudna with an honorable mention, the ancient armada of the group. So what if you could go find disciples? 
SAM: Of? Of who? 
TRAVIS: I mean, we're all working through our thing, but what if you could find more like you and make like-- 
TALIESIN: Automatas. 
LAURA: Oh, like a whole church? 
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know. I wasn't talking about that, I was just-- 
LAURA: Automatons. 
TALIESIN: Atomic-tines. 
TRAVIS: What if FCG had followers? 
SAM: You want... well... 
TRAVIS: You're chosen, man. 
SAM: I mean, am I? I don't know, it does seem like there's-- 
LIAM: You're certainly special. 
SAM: That's what everyone keeps saying, but now it sounds like more and more folks like me are becoming aware, are being arisen or something. Maybe that points to some sort of movement or something. Like the rise of the machines. 
LAURA: Something's waking them up. 
TRAVIS: That's got a positive context to it. 
ASHLEY: You're like the music-- Yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Rise of the machines, rise up! 
ASHLEY: Rise against it, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Literally deus ex machina. 
SAM: (laughs) But yeah. 
TRAVIS: Wakening. 
SAM: But if there's a lot of us rising up for some reason, I mean maybe that's a sign, or maybe-- 
ASHLEY: Maybe you'll be the new gods. 
SAM: Well, I don't want to be a god or anything, but maybe it's for a greater purpose? I mean, maybe there is a god or gods that are causing us to wake up? 
LAURA: Maybe. 
TALIESIN: Or maybe it's just weird shit's happening. 
LIAM: Yeah. Maybe this weird that we've been dealing with has been affecting you or this D you've talked about. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: I don't know, maybe it's interconnected weird shit. 
LAURA: Big D. The Big D. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
TRAVIS: Just saying don't rule it out. I might subscribe. 
SAM: You would follow a faith of mine? 
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, you're talking to gods. I'm not doing that. I've been running for a long time. 
LAURA: Have you ever tried talking to a god, Chet? 
TRAVIS: Nope, but nobody never knocked on my door. 
SAM: Well, I'll ask the Changebringer to pay you a visit. 
ASHLEY: Well, we did see that when we went into the bird lady. 
LIAM: Yeah, she talked to you. 
ASHLEY: When we went into that temple of the bird woman. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I just figured that was because I was with you guys. 
TALIESIN: The what? 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we got a whole vision. 
LIAM: We went to Duskmaven temple and-- 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
LIAM: Had a collective vision. 
LAURA: You told us about that. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, didn't we? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: With Orym. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yes, we told you. But I mean, that was an experience, maybe she was knocking. 
LIAM: I felt the presence of the Wildmother. She didn't speak to me, but I felt her there. So I have never talked to the gods, but lately, it feels like they're talking to us. 
TRAVIS: Just saying, we're guns for hire. We make shit happen. 
MARISHA: I don't know, I'm kind of with Ashton, I feel like I'm going to stick on this primordial path. See what I find down that way. 
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, we got to get a bidding war going and we've got a negotiation happening. 
MARISHA: 100%. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: These are my friends drunk. What have I done? 
ASHLEY: Speaking of primordial. 
SAM: Oh yeah? 
LAURA: Oh, oh. 
ASHLEY: Excuse me. 
LAURA: I've got it. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: What? 
LIAM: One of the bees. 
ASHLEY: You're an even more interesting creature than we thought. 
TALIESIN: I mean-- 
LAURA: You got titan blood. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a thing. 
ASHLEY: You're basically a god. 
TALIESIN: I guess. 
ASHLEY: Maybe we should worship Ashton. 
SAM: But no, but I think the titans were the things that the gods dispelled? 
LAURA: Yeah, they needed their help first and then realized how-- 
LIAM: Story is the titans were here first. The gods arrived, they butted heads. And then they banded together later to deal with the, do I have that right, the Betrayers? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Sounds right. 
LAURA: That sounds right. 
SAM: But the titans have been sort of sealed away or... 
LIAM: Felled. 
SAM: Yeah. Is that why you're so anti-Changebringer, because you're Team Titan? 
TALIESIN: No. 
MARISHA, ASHLEY, and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I'm not Team Titan of any kind. There's another pun in there, and I swear I could find it, but right now is not the time. Jesus. I've been Team Titan for four hours now? Five hours. 
LIAM: About that, yeah. 
SAM: Yeah, but inherently you might've known. It might've been part of your subconscious. 
TALIESIN: Maybe, but that's not why-- 
LAURA: Did you see anything? When we were walking around his brain, did you see anything? 
SAM: Titany? 
LAURA: Titany. 
SAM: Did I see anything titany in his brain? 
LAURA: Think back. 
TALIESIN: Did you attack any of the titans? 
MATT: When you looked in there, it was pretty focused on a specific moment or moments in time within his-- their life. Nothing that rings titany, but you also don't have a lot of experience with titans and their imagery. 
SAM: Well, we're spinning our wheels again, y'all. Let's focus on the ahead. Are you ordering another round? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. I covered it all, one more. 
TALIESIN: What? Oh, more than one more, oh. You're covering? 
LIAM: I covered, we're set, we're set. 
TRAVIS: Nice. Big spender. 
LAURA: Oh, thank you, Orym. 
TALIESIN: Looking good, by the way. 
LIAM: I brought you home. 
LAURA: This armor is very nice. 
LIAM: Oh, thanks. 
LAURA: It looks very Savior of the Tempest. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the one-arm thing is really nice. I appreciate that. 
MARISHA: How does it feel to have a title now, Orym? 
LIAM: About what it feels like to have titan blood. 
TALIESIN: That's fair, all right. 
LIAM: Still figuring it out. 
TALIESIN: Still figuring it out, that's very fair. 
TRAVIS: Still figuring it out. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Bells Hells. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's our tagline. 
TALIESIN: It's actually a very good one. 
MARISHA: Put it on a business card. 
LIAM: If Bertrand could see us now. 
MATT: (glasses hitting table) 
ALL: (oohing) 
MATT: Next platter of drinks find the table. 
LIAM: To Bertrand! 
ALL: To Bertrand! 
TRAVIS: Whoever the hell he is. 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs) 
MATT: Sipping and enjoying your drinks together as the afternoon begins to dwindle into an arriving colorful sunset here in the city of Zephrah. 
MARISHA: Laudna is going to... I need to use the little ghoul's room. I'll be right back. 
ASHLEY and LIAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: I'm going to slip away for a second. 
ASHLEY: It's all I'm going that's not why-- 
SAM: Roleplay taking a shit? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah. Once a campaign! 
TRAVIS: Take those brownies out of the oven! 
MATT: Oh my god. All right, so Laudna leaves the area for a bit. 
MARISHA: Yes, I'm going to go. Can I sneak around the corner? I'm going to go find a cliff edge and meditate looking out over the sunset. 
MATT: Going to kick your legs off the edge of it. The wind picks up a little bit. You would've been more nervous if you hadn't have done what you did earlier today. But a bout of confidence hits you in the face of the elements and you look over the beautiful hues of orange and purple and faint greens that hit in the distant horizon. This is a beautiful, unique area. There are elements of it that do remind you of the southern reaches of Marquet, in the fields where you first met Imogen, but a different kind of vibrance, as opposed to a valley farmland. This is a testament to building an oasis in the sky.
MARISHA: It's lovely. I'm going to focus on the purples and the greens. I'm going to zone out for a minute and then under my breath, I'm going to say: Delilah? Are you still there? I felt a little pulse back in Issylra. So I'm just curious. All right. 
LAURA: You hear footsteps behind you. 
MARISHA: (gasps) Hi. 
LAURA: Hi. I'll come sit down. 
MARISHA: Hello, you, come here. 
LAURA: What are you doing? 
MARISHA: Oh, just taking a quiet moment. Doing a little inward reflection. 
LAURA: About? 
MARISHA: Everyone's in there and talking about how gods or other higher beings have reached out to them and called to them. I've always had a tenant up in here. It's not like there's been any vacancies to make room for anyone else. So-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I don't know. Just checking, I guess. 
LAURA: Do you think she's god-adjacent? 
MARISHA: I don't know. That's kind of what I was curious about. Feels like we're going to need all the help we can get. 
LAURA: Yeah. Well, I know she wants to keep you alive, but I don't know how much power she has outside of you. 
MARISHA: I'm not sure. 
LAURA: I reached out. Did you know that? When you were gone, when you were dead it's weird to say. I reached out to her. 
MARISHA: Really? Well, did she talk to you? 
LAURA: She did. 
MARISHA: Really? I mean, I know you all saw some version of her when you were... 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: In there, but-- 
LAURA: I asked her to bring you back. I asked for help. I prayed to her like she was a god. She was pretty useless. You hear that, Delilah? You're pretty useless. 
MARISHA: I stare awkwardly into your eyes, hoping it gets through. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Maybe she got it. Well. I tried to take a little moment to do some feeling on the inside and I didn't feel anything, so... 
LAURA: What if that's the trick, right? What if she was filling up so much space there was no room to hear any of the gods? What if you tried reaching out to a god? Maybe they could fill up so much room that they would kick her out. 
MARISHA: Maybe, I don't know. I know obviously Letters is very passionate about us all finding one, but none of them kind of spoke to me. Have called to me or feel like my vibe, you know? 
LAURA: Not even the Matron? 
MARISHA: Well, I have a feeling that the Matron doesn't look kindly on someone like me, ironically enough. So. 
LAURA: Who did that cleric serve back in Jrusar? The really interesting one we saw that came to see Lord Eshteross, that spoke to him after he had passed. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Was it the Moonweaver? Who was it that she? 
MARISHA: That sounds right. I'm sure I could look back in my diary and figure it out. We'll do that in time. I mean, Moonweaver, that seems thematic. 
LAURA: It kind of does, doesn't it? 
MARISHA: Wonder what she thinks about all this Ruidus chaos?
LAURA: Maybe we should just ask her. That's as simple as it is, right? 
MARISHA: Yes, should we try right now? 
LAURA: Let's just do it. 
MARISHA: All right. (shouts) Moonweaver! 
LAURA: Oh, Moonweaver! 
MARISHA: What's your vibe? 
TALIESIN: (whispers) I think it was the Duskmaven. 
MARISHA: Duskmaven? 
LAURA: What? It was the Duskmaven? 
LIAM: I think it was the Duskmaven, but I don't diary. 
MARISHA: For Eshteross. Whatever, right now we're talking to the Moonweaver. 
LAURA: (laughs) Things feel fucked? 
MARISHA: Hello? 
LAURA: Want some help? I don't know. 
LIAM: I think they're yelling at the gods over there. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, are we just going to ignore that they're yelling at that thing over there? We can't hear that? 
LIAM: They look happy. 
TALIESIN: Act natural. 
SAM: They're doing it. They're doing it. They're reaching out to a higher power, guys. 
TALIESIN: Oh, baby. 
TRAVIS: Oh, baby. 
SAM: It worked! 
MARISHA: Well, maybe they'll come in our dreams. 
LAURA: (laughs) One can only hope. 
MARISHA: All right. I guess we'll get back to the others. I steal a little kiss before we go back. 
SAM: On the lips? 
MARISHA: You don't know. 
LIAM: Nice. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
LIAM: Chet, I don't understand, you've been holding out on me. You've been modest, I mean, you haven't been modest, but you've been modest. I've played with those adventure dolls in my house for years and you made them. Do you have toys in every city in the world, or--? 
TRAVIS: Pretty much. I mean, yeah, I kind of set up franchises, but toy franchises in the minds and memories of children everywhere. 
LIAM: I understand that you're a very skilled craftsman. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LIAM: But I have to be fair, I thought you were kind of bullshitting us on how deep in you were. 
TRAVIS: Nope. Yeah, sometimes I-- You can tell someone that you're the shit, other times you just let it happen, right? In your case, I've been there all along, baby. 
LIAM: That's cool, you're famous. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Did you have a favorite? 
LIAM: I mean, yeah, it was the swordsmen, those wooden action figures. 
TRAVIS: They're pretty good. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Articulating joints, especially wood, very hard to come by, you have to use wax sometimes. But that's only just as an additive. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Doesn't it stick after a while? 
TRAVIS: It does because your wood swells. I try to work with quality products, but there's some things you just can't control. 
TALIESIN: Well, shit. 
TRAVIS: The wood can swell. 
TALIESIN: It's crazy. 
TRAVIS: Nice. (laughter) 
LIAM: We're talking about toys, right? 
TRAVIS: Toys? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that too. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) He said, non-determinately. 
TALIESIN: I mean, toys. Toys are cool. (laughter) 
MATT: The toy-based conversation and laughter progresses on and as the sun vanishes beyond the horizon and the night sky begins to take the mountaintops of Zephrah. As you all contemplate the day to come, the evening's rest before you, or the plans of where you next set foot here on Exandria. A quiet moment looking past into the shadow-dark distance, holding your cup in your hand, Laudna, you smile, looking over at Imogen. And feel that cold sensation drift down your shoulders. 
MARISHA: It's chilly on this mountain. 
MATT: And you hear creeping into the back of your mind. "No matter who you pray to, no matter who you reach for, you are, and will always be, mine." And that's where we'll take a break. (groaning and yelling) 
MARISHA: It's still her! 
SAM: That bitch. 
LAURA: I will kill her. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Mine! 
TALIESIN: Got to block her on all the social media. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Can't leave that Facebook open. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
LAURA: (high-pitched screeches) 
LIAM: You could just mute. Let her scream into the void. 
TALIESIN: Nature finds a way. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Nature finds a way. 
MATT: But we'll come back here in a few minutes. (cheering) 
MATT: We'll see you shortly. 

Break[]
(mysterious music) 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. Roll an investigation if you want. It's basically perfect. They're so mini. Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself. I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. Can you put donuts in this? Only one way to find out. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. (adventurous music) 
TALIESIN: Obsession is a corruption that shrouds the mind. Its tendrils grow beyond the influence of bleed, as if natural to the soul. Though, the unique skill set a circle of investigators bring forth to each assignment stand guard against this vice. Relying upon the strengths of your allies is the key to survival, for deep within the rubble of a city long forgotten, the Red Hand roots itself within the fathomless, unleashing a faceless behemoth of smoldering greed. The Circle of the Vassal and the Veil: "Assignment #447: The Collectors" (ominous music) (ominous music) (dramatic music) 
TALIESIN: The trials of war have cracked the foundations of those willing to charge forth. 1898. The Fairelands suffered in the tight grip of the armada of Otherwhere, with scores of Halens joining the fray to protect their homes. Few who bore witness to the horrors of the war survived. The metropolis of Newfaire rebuilds, furthering the gap between the elite and the impoverished. Those who've returned from the front lines are left with nothing but fragments of a forgotten past, while others relish in the spoils of victory. Faceless monstrosities now roam the Fairelands. (creature shrieking) 
TALIESIN: Immersing themselves among the everyday Halens, feeding upon the downtrodden. (dramatic music) 
TALIESIN: It's here that this war-torn circle of investigators was forged. Hardened by the siege, they are deployed when only the brave and unwavering can survive. (dramatic music) 
TALIESIN: Chapter Two: The Circle of Needle & Thread. 
(melodic string music) (ominous music) 
Narrator 1: Hello. 
Narrator 2: It's us, we're back. Real quick spoiler warning. 
Narrator 1: If you have not listened to season one of "Midst", you're gonna wanna stop here. 
Narrator 3: Seriously, we'll give you three seconds. (suspenseful music) (countdown timer ticks) All right, you've been warned. So you may be asking yourself, what the hell?! 
Narrator 1: Why the fuck did the moon explode? 
Narrator 3: What's gonna happen to utterly doomed Midst and everybody trapped on it by an incoming wave of reality-devouring fog? 
Narrator 1: Are Lark and Tzila gonna be okay? Are they gonna figure out that Sherman's not dead? 
Narrator 3: What's Phineas gonna do now that he's been abandoned by the Trust, the very institution that raised him and gave him purpose and his sense of self-worth? And like, what is he gonna do? 
Narrator 2: Will Jonas Spahr do the right thing? What even is the right thing? 
Narrator 1: What is Imelda's deal? 
Narrator 3: Why did the Trust even bother rescuing Moc Weepe even though he's this weird sleazeball piece of shit who stabbed his closest friends in the back? 
Narrator 1: And what is a mirror hawk? 
Narrator 3: What is a bocular horse? What is going on with Weepe's voice? Is Landlord gonna die? 
ALL: No. 
Narrator 1: Okay, we will tell you this one. Landlord is not going to die. We're unreliable narrators, not monsters. 
Narrator 3: Why did Lark kill fuse? 
Narrator 1: What is she trying to hide? Is the nutcracker okay? 
Narrator 3: Will the rapidly depreciating value of valor ever restabilize, or is the market doomed to implode? 
Narrator 1: Is the Trust bad? 
Narrator 3: Did Saskia's dogs really eat the melted corpse of enterprising businessman Atticus Concord? Do the narrators even know what happens next? (tense silence) No, we have no idea. 
Narrator 1: Just kidding, we know. 
Narrator 3: And when season two of "Midst" unfolds August 23rd you will know as well. 
Narrator 2: In the meantime for bonus episodes, merch, media and more, visit midst.co. 
Narrator 1: And don't forget to stock up on light bulbs. You might need them where we're going.

MATT: Taliesin! Ashley! Please, I've told you so many times just don't play with those, okay? They're super fragile, custom made, custom painted. You know what? We have to film in about 30 minutes, so why don't you two just come with me. (snaps) Come on. (clicks tongue) [footsteps receding] 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's Major Buzzkill here to take away all our fun. 
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Ah! 
ASHLEY: Is it Thursday yet, bitch? 
TALIESIN: You can certainly die! 
ASHLEY: Oh! Good one!

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Nice. 
MATT: So, as you're all enjoying your evening out, what would you like to do? 
SAM: I'll just go to sleep. 
MATT: Great. 
LIAM: Wait, didn't we say we were going to get toasted and go see the Tempest? Isn't that the plan? 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: Were we serious about that? 
TALIESIN: Or we were going to get toasted and fly the things. 
MARISHA: Well, I think we ruined everyone else's chances to do that. 
TRAVIS: They're locked up. 
TALIESIN: Do you think we're banned? 
MARISHA: Yeah. Huh? 
TALIESIN: I bet we're banned. 
MARISHA: We were-- Mm. 
TRAVIS: For an indeterminate amount of time. 
TALIESIN: It's important anytime that you go to a new city, and I do this every time we go to a new city. You piss off somebody enough that they will remember you when you come back, no matter how long it's been. It's just easier than making a friend. 
MARISHA: That's a good thing? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's good to be remembered. 
SAM: I wish I could get drunk. 
MARISHA: (sympathetically) Oh. 
TRAVIS: Aw. 
TALIESIN: We'll figure it out. 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
SAM: Y'all look like you have so much fun, and I'm just sitting here watching. 
LAURA: Have you tried eating rusty metal? 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
SAM: That is a good idea. 
MARISHA: The tetanus. 
SAM: That's a good idea, I'll try that next time. 
TRAVIS: Get the tet? 
MARISHA: Get the tet. (laughs) 
SAM: Get tetted up. All right. 
LIAM: Have you ever done that thing, maybe you could borrow my sword and put your forehead on it, and then spin in a circle and bunch of times? 
SAM: I've tried to get dizzy. It doesn't work, no. 
LAURA: Doesn't work? 
LIAM: Even that doesn't work? 
SAM: No. 
MARISHA: I still have this-- 
SAM: I'm perfect. 
MARISHA: -- weird little dime bag of drugs that we got from Justi. 
SAM: That I could try. 
MARISHA: Maybe if you try a powder substance. 
SAM: Maybe I could bake it into my brownies. 
MARISHA: Mm! 
SAM: Give me, give me. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but you can't eat the brownies. 
TALIESIN: Actually, that is very-- I mean. 
TRAVIS: Give me, give me. 
SAM: You'll never know when it's in there! 
TALIESIN: I'm not here to tell anybody, that's just-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm the only one who knows what that is. Okay. 
MARISHA: All right. I'm making a note that I gave this to FCG. 
SAM: Why don't go see the Voice tomorrow morning when you people are a little less annoying? 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
LIAM: No. 
SAM: Well, you know what I mean. 
LAURA: No, I get it, I get it. 
TALIESIN: I do. 
LIAM: Appreciate your honesty. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, that's really nice. It's good to hear you go for it. 
ASHLEY: I feel like when I drink, I just want to smoke. Do you mind if I have one? (laughter) 
SAM: You want to bum a cig? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm just feeling like I want a little extra buzz. 
SAM: Sure. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
LAURA: That was great. 
SAM: Object work. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: How is FCG the only one with a fun vice here? 
SAM: Do you want me to light you up? 
SAM: That's my thumb. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
LAURA: Your thumb lights up? 
SAM: Yeah, I'm making that a new thing. 
LAURA: Is that a new feature? 
SAM: That's a new thing. My thumb becomes a lighter. 
MARISHA: You're such a cool guy! 
LAURA: I'm going to use that in combat. 
MATT: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Do you need oil? Do you need lamp oil? 
SAM: Here, I'll put it out. Ah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, lick it. I take out the sword, and I run it across my hand, and then flames come across it. 
TRAVIS: Here you go. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
SAM: That's much better. 
LAURA: Oh. Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: My eyebrows burn off. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's a little bit hot. 
MATT: As you're waving the sword-- 
TRAVIS: Like a bit match. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: As you're waving the sword, in the back of your mind-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! Yeah, the talking sword. Shit! 
MARISHA: Oh. Oh! 
MATT: "Great wielder, majestic, wondrous warrior." 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (snicker) 
MATT: "I worry that you are being duped by a dubious leader. The one who calls this village her own. This Voice, I think she is one of a few, a cabal who seeks to bend this land of Tal'Dorei beneath their will. It would do you well to not trust her." 
MARISHA: Throw it, throw it. Throw it over the cliff. 
TRAVIS: Whoa, what do you-- I'll shuffle away from the group. What do you mean? You mean the Voice of the Tempest? 
MATT: "Shhh." 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: "Yes." 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "There are many through time that are responsible for the slow degradation of society and all good in this realm. Those that call themselves members and allies of the Council of Tal'Dorei are themselves an extension of this shadow." 
TRAVIS: (scoffs) That's unbelievable. But I mean, you're old and wise like me. I can't believe you actually know of her. Well, what should I do? I think we're going to speak with her in the morning. (hiccups) In the morning. (laughter) 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: "Just be careful. Do not let her lies penetrate your mind." 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: "Still your hand. Be ready for anything." 
TRAVIS: Good looking out, homie. 
MATT: "Of course. We must look out for each other." 
TRAVIS: All right, back to drinking. (sheaths sword) 
TALIESIN: He's muttering in the corner. Should we be worried? 
SAM: He does that sometimes. 
LAURA: No, but that one seemed a little-- 
SAM: Chet! 
TRAVIS: What? 
MARISHA: He was staring at the flaming sword. 
ASHLEY: Who were you talking to? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there was these animals in the spire where when they feel death coming on, they all wander to the same place. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TALIESIN: It's as if they know. I was wondering if he was going to make a run for it. 
MARISHA: No, he looked-- What were you doing? 
TRAVIS: I was checking out the edge of the cliff. We really tested the limits today. 
MARISHA: We did. 
TRAVIS: It was pretty sick. 
MARISHA: (satisfied sigh) Such a high! 
TRAVIS: Whew! ST, SS, and-- (tongue trills) 
LAURA: (tongue trills) I can't remember what the name was. 
LAURA: It was Arr. 
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you. 
MARISHA: Please, don't leave me hanging. 
TRAVIS: Pow! 
MARISHA: I don't want to be embarrassed. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MARISHA: (sighs) 
SAM: To bed? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Are we sleeping at your-- Where are we sleeping? 
TRAVIS: Your mom's place? 
LIAM: I don't know if y'all will fit in my house. 
LAURA: Didn't you offer that, though? 
LIAM: Well, we can do it, but it would have to be a slumber party in the living room. 
LAURA: Well, we've all slept in a hole before. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: That's fine. 
LIAM: Cool. 
MARISHA: Would she be okay with that? 
LIAM: I mean, she blessed it. 
LAURA: I mean, we can put up a hole in her backyard. 
TALIESIN: I think sleeping in the hole is an idea. 
LIAM: That's cool, too. It's a great-- the stars here at night. 
TRAVIS: Do you have a roof? Yeah, that's what I was going to say. 
LIAM: We have a roof. 
TRAVIS: We're so close to the stars. We're up there. 
TALIESIN: I feel like the hole might be a bad idea. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to camp out on your roof. 
LIAM: You wouldn't need a hole, you would just need the roof, which I have done, actually, or our backyard. 
LAURA: Oh nice! 
TALIESIN: A roof sounds like a really good idea. 
LIAM: Or the living room. 
TRAVIS: Let's do that. 
MARISHA: A little camping. 
LAURA: No, let's camp. Sounds nice. 
TALIESIN: Backyard camping. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Is that a thing? I'm into it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm into it. 
MARISHA: I hear that people with young children do it. 
TALIESIN: Just a whole world out there. 
MARISHA: I know, right? 
TALIESIN: It's crazy. 
TRAVIS: You never end up in the tent the whole night, though. You always come back in. 
MARISHA: You come back in? 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: Sometimes you do it, sometimes you go across the road at the camp that you grew up at as a kid, and you go in the tent and sleep in it. Then a raccoon or something scratches the side and you think it's a dead thing, and then you run across the road in the middle of the night and go hide inside. 
LAURA: Dead things aren't that bad. 
TRAVIS: Wolves. 
TALIESIN: They're really not that bad. 
LIAM: This is Liam talking. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh, well. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You were doing the voice, so I just assumed. 
TRAVIS: Breaking records. 
LIAM: Still me. 
LAURA: (trills tongue) 
TALIESIN: This is very specific. 
TRAVIS: All right, back to your house and to the roof! 
LAURA: And to-- Yeah. 
MATT: All right. Picking things up, you meander out into the evening sky of Zephrah to the abode where you grew up. At the cusp of your mother's bedtime, she answers the door and looks out amongst your troop. 
LIAM: Be cool, be cool, be cool. 
MATT: (Alma) "Oh!" 
LIAM: Hey, mom. 
LAURA: We're so-- 
MATT: 'Welcome back. It's so good to see you!" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Hello, everyone. I guess you're all--" 
LIAM: We were out celebrating. 
MATT: "I can smell it." 
LIAM: We're back and, well-- 
MARISHA: Oh, damn it. 
LIAM: We're going to stay put for the night. We're done, it's a done deal. 
TALIESIN: Party on the roof! 
LIAM: Is it-- 
MATT: "Best to be enjoying the rest of your evening here under parental supervision." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: That's awesome. 
TALIESIN: That's cool. 
LAURA: She's a cool mom. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Cool mom! 
TALIESIN: Pretty cool. 
ASHLEY: Do you have any more of those biscuits? 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Jeez [inaudible]. 
MATT: "Biscuits?" 
ASHLEY: I know we ate a lot of them, but I always get so hungry at night-- 
LIAM: Are you thinking about my other mom? 
ASHLEY: -- after drinking. I'm so sorry. This is Alma. 
TALIESIN: FCG, did you start something new after the brownies became untenable? 
MATT: She's a lot taller than me. 
SAM: I have some still. 
ASHLEY: I knew something was off. 
MATT and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
LIAM: But you did have muffins here, and those were really good. 
ASHLEY: That's maybe what I was thinking about. 
TALIESIN: We do have the brownies. 
MATT: "Muffins, there's plenty of muffins. I can get those for you, yes." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: "Come in, everyone, please. Make yourself comfortable best you can." 
LAURA: Thank you! 
ASHLEY: Thank you so much. 
LIAM: Think the roof can hold us all, mom? 
MATT: "No, but one way to find out!" 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We should make a fire. 
LIAM: Not on the roof. 
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck. 
MARISHA: Maybe we should just do the backyard then. 
LAURA: Yeah, we'll do it in the backyard. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Well, we can use the roof. I mean, the roof is available. 
LIAM: I've slept all over this place. I'm good with whatever. I'm home. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
TRAVIS: (snores) 
LAURA: Oh, Chet's out. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Chet's-- 
ASHLEY: Are we doing anything before sleep? Do we need to check on anybody? 
LAURA: Did you want to check on D? Big D? 
MARISHA: Nice. 
TALIESIN: Little D. 
SAM: You could, but you don't-- 
TALIESIN: D major. 
SAM: Did you meet them? 
ASHLEY: No, I thought you were going to-- Well, I met Dancer or I saw her. 
SAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY: But didn't you want to Scry? 
SAM: I can't until we go to sleep. (laughter) 
LAURA: What you mean? 
ASHLEY: Why? 
LAURA: Why can't you do it still? 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Why? 
ASHLEY: I can do it. 
MARISHA: When you're the one sober friend. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Driving me crazy here. 
ASHLEY: Do you want me to do it? 
SAM: To Scry on Dancer? Sure, you could. 
LAURA: You could Scry on Big D. 
SAM: No, I don't think she's ever seen Big D, has she? 
LAURA: She's seen a few big D. 
TRAVIS: Oh, she's seen it! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I was waiting for it. 
MARISHA: Thought you were sleeping. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god, are we like-- 
TRAVIS: Some things you just have at the ready. 
LAURA: What if you Scry and you just see Chetney's wolf dick? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Savalir-woo-ood! ♪ 
ASHLEY: That's some Savalir-wood right there. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: This is why we should always drink. 
ASHLEY: All right. Am I checking on Dancer? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: You can. 
ASHLEY: (hiccups) 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
TALIESIN: Scry. 
SAM: Go ahead. 
ASHLEY: Do we need to even do this? 
MARISHA: Scry. Scry. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA: Why not try? 
ALL: (chanting) Scry! Scry! Scry! 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm Scrying! 
ALL: (chanting) Scry! Scry! Scry! 
SAM: Drunk Scrying. 
MATT: "Scry! Scry! Scry!" 
TALIESIN: Hi, Mom. 
LAURA: That's right, Alma. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: "Muffins?" 
LAURA: Oh, thank you. 
TRAVIS: Yes, oh! 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
TRAVIS: God, your mom's the coolest. 
ASHLEY: All right.

LAURA: Ooh, your mom's got Sunny D! (laughter)

SAM: Chicken and Stove Top?! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Your target is? 
LIAM: Thanks for the time trap. 
ASHLEY: Dancer. 
MATT: Dancer, all right. So how do you prepare your Scry spell? 
ASHLEY: Okay. I sit down, and I close my eyes real tight. 
LAURA: I'm going to give her a massage. 
ASHLEY: Thank you so much. 
LAURA: You're welcome. 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to close my eyes, and I'm going to imagine Dancer. I forgot how to do this. Okay. I can remember it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm doing it right now. Here we go. 
LAURA: (laughs)

ASHLEY: Did I have to do a thing? I can't remember. 
SAM: She's got it. 
TALIESIN: I think you got to do the wrist thing. 
LIAM: You have to say the magic words. 
TALIESIN: Is Scry not the magic word? 
MARISHA: Interpretive dance. 
LIAM: That's the first word. 
MARISHA: For Dancer. 
ASHLEY: Okay, for Dancer. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Dancer? Where are you? 
MATT: It is a 10-minute casting time. So there are 10 minutes of you doing this-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- and saying Dancer. 
TALIESIN: ♪ (humming a tune) ♪ 
LIAM: Everybody is-- 
ASHLEY: I take one of my ribbons and ribbon dance. 
MATT: Just do the ribbon dance? That's a pretty great method. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we should do a little interpretive dance. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Are we just going? Yeah, let's just go. 
LIAM: Drunken dancing in the living room. 
TALIESIN: Drunk dancing. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: ♪ Dancing to the Scry ♪ 
MATT: As you "Scry!" 
ASHLEY: Scry! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You jazz hands and feel your jazz hands journey through the ether of magical energy just (whooshing) carrying through the pseudo intoxicated haze. You feel yourself pulled through the evening cloudscape above and into the stratosphere somewhere in Exandria. Clouds and stars sparkling by. 
ASHLEY: Oh, gorgeous! 
MATT: Then you're brought to a city street. 
ASHLEY: Oh! Hey. 
MATT: It's dark. 
ASHLEY: Darkness. 
MATT: Not, well, I guess at this hour, it's pretty late here, so it'd be maybe a little past sunset, early evening. 
ASHLEY: The sun's going down. 
MATT: Nice stone cobblestone walkway through this alley into a street. There are tall buildings of grays and blues and ivory. They're low lit with torch lights everywhere. You can hear the sound of different crickets and evening insects throughout the town. As she walks by, she stumbles a bit and catches herself on the side of the wall. 
ASHLEY: Same. 
MATT: You watch as (flapping) a metallic winged creature lands on her shoulder, like a headless bat made of metal that catches and then curls in. She pats it, and you hear the metal sound of like (clunky thumps) behind her as this spherical device, it's about this large with three strange legs follows her behind like an assistant. 
ASHLEY: Maybe that's Pussy. 
MATT: Sorry, what was that? 
ASHLEY: Nothing. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: As she zigzags down this alley, the other one follows her, keeping in pace and following the exact pattern of walk that she is. Eventually, she stumbles out of the alley into the road. A couple people pass by and she almost bumps into them and stops and watches them go by. She clears her throat. Stops on the edge of one of the walls, and then vomits off the side of the wall into a very, very brightly lit glowing water. 
ASHLEY: I try to told her hair back. 
LAURA: (gasps) She's in the city of light! 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SAM: What is the city of light? 
MARISHA: Yeah, with the glowing-- 
LIAM: The levels of yeah-- 
LAURA: Yeah, the city of 
LIAM: Yes, you're right. 
LAURA: That's the city of light. 
MATT: Yeah, Yios. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Yios. 
MARISHA: Yios. 
SAM: We've been there! 
MARISHA: Yes, she's in Yios. 
LIAM: It's been a hot minute. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I know. 
SAM: You found her. Oh my god, you're amazing. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MATT: It's funny. You seemingly reach out and you watch as the spherical automaton that's following her stops, and then one of its legs comes forward, splits, and then holds her hair back for her. 
SAM and MARISHA: Aww. 
LAURA: Isn't that sweet. 
ASHLEY: Okay, good. She's taken care of. 
MATT: Her hair's kind of short, but still keeping it out of the way. Eventually, she pushes it off and gets back up. 
MARISHA: Aw. 
MATT: Rights herself. Wipes her chin. Takes a minute and breathes heavy, looking up at the stars, and you can see there's a, an odd battle between the appreciation of the beauty that surrounds her and what you can only describe as the understanding of enjoying it alone. Then she keeps walking, and the spell pulls away and leads you back. 
SAM: Jazz hands. 
LAURA: What'd you see? 
ASHLEY: I'm back. 
LAURA: What happened? 
ASHLEY: Okay, tall buildings. Blue, green. She threw up because she was drunk. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: What are the odds? 
ASHLEY: She threw up into glowing water. 
LAURA: (gasps) Yios! 
MARISHA: Yios! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. She really was having a lovely moment alone. 
LAURA: What was she doing in Yios? 
SAM: I don't know. I mean, she traveled around quite a lot. 
LAURA: Oh, really? 
TRAVIS: Insight check. 
SAM: She really did travel around quite a lot. (laughter) 
SAM: I think-- 
MARISHA: I'm imagining Chetney saying, "Insight check." 
SAM: Chetney, you just said that out loud. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I wonder what he's dreaming about. 
SAM: Well, do we go now? I guess not now. 
LAURA: No. We can't go now. 
ASHLEY: No, we probably-- 
LAURA: He could die any minute. 
SAM: But if we go now-- 
ASHLEY: We still got to talk to-- 
TRAVIS: (snores) 
LAURA: We really got to get him a machine or something. 
SAM: Oh, talk to Keyleth. 
MARISHA: Sleep apnea or something. All right, tomorrow morning, we talk to Keyleth, we go. 
ASHLEY: Let's get up early. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: So we're going to see Dancer, then? 
SAM: We're going to go to sleep, we're going to talk to Keyleth real quick, and then we're going to go see Dancer. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to roll Chetney on his side. 
SAM: We know where she is! We don't really know where D is. 
ASHLEY: Should we also check on the other, big D? Devexian? 
SAM: I can tomorrow. 
ASHLEY: Tomorrow? Okay. 
TALIESIN: I think that would be a thing to do. 
LAURA: Yeah, I do too. 
TALIESIN: It's a little less hippity hoppity.

MATT: Until, eventually, the morning sun rises once more. The sound of roosters begin to crow across the exterior landscape of Zephrah. 
ASHLEY: What? 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: And up early. 
LAURA: Oh. Zero, zero, zero. 
MATT: As you didn't go to bed too terribly late, necessarily. One by one, you all begin to come to consciousness and the day is yours. 
TALIESIN: What a beautiful morning! Good morning, you sad fucks! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I feel great! 
LAURA: Yeah, you slept a lot, Chet! 
TRAVIS: Oof! A little bit of a headache. I feel like I might have messed up that warehouse a little bit. 
LIAM: (grunts) I could only do, like, 100 pushups. 
SAM: That staff already had all of its charges? 
TRAVIS: 100 pushups! 
LAURA: No, you could roll and recharge it a little bit. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Now it's full. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: It really only needed-- 
TRAVIS: Ping! 
LIAM: Okay. So everyone has gathered their arcane resources? 
SAM: Yes. 
LIAM: And the staff is charged? 
SAM: Staff is charged! I got spells. 
TRAVIS: Convos to be had? 
MARISHA: Do we go talk to Keyleth, then? 
SAM: Little breakfast, Keyleth? 
LAURA: Let's do it. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Brekkie! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Grab some muffins on the go. 
LIAM: (record scratches) 
SAM: Yeah, we'll bring her some muffins. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Brunch of the Tempest. Fuck yeah! (laughs) 
LAURA: Do you want the last couple? 
MATT: All right. Stepping through the slowly rousing city of Zephrah through the streets people are beginning to wake up and open their shutters and begin their early morning chores and sweeping the front stoops of their abodes. You come upon the central square that denotes where the Voice of the Tempest's structure is, and you can see she's already awake, sitting on the balcony next to the small tree perch that remains empty, looking out towards the sunrise. As you all begin to turn around the corner, she notices and steps up. As the wind (blows) picks up, you can see her multicolored cloak billow a bit in the handful of gusts before she gives you all a nod and then steps inside the building to meet you as you approach. 
TRAVIS: That was epic! She's feeling much better. 
LAURA: Yeah, she's really majestic. 
ASHLEY: That cape is unreal. 
TRAVIS: I don't trust it. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Why? 
ASHLEY: Why? 
TRAVIS: Hmm? Nobody should look that good first thing in the morning! 
MARISHA: That's fair, I guess. 
LAURA: Well, okay. 
TALIESIN: You didn't even say, except you. Are you all right? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Thank you! (laughs) Damn! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (Graz'tchar) "Be on your guard." 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
MATT: Stepping within your-- 
MARISHA: So exhausting! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Fucking weapons! 
MATT, LIAM, and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: For the few that are conscious and going about their business within the bottom floors, they acknowledge your arrival and let you through. Eventually, you can see that, it would be Thollo is currently keeping watch on the outside of Keyleth's room and gives a morning nod. "Well, good to see y'all. If you're here to see the Tempest, she's up in her room." The door opens and you can see her still looking out past the balcony, but upon hearing the door open, turns and smiles to you all. "Well, good morning! This is an early arrival, but nevertheless, a welcome one." You can see how she stands here, not a sign of a wound on her, smiling with a vibrancy you haven't seen since she brought you to Whitestone a short time ago. 
LAURA: Wow! 
LIAM: Morning, Tempest. 
MATT: "Good morning, Savior Blade." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: You look like you've reclaimed the stature I'm accustomed to. 
MATT: "Hmm. Well, that's thanks to you and your friends. Sincerely, thank you all." 
SAM: We brought you some biscuits. 
MATT: "Oh! Oh!" 
LAURA: Muffins. 
MATT: "Thank you!" 
SAM: Muffins. Well, oh, and I made you some biscuits. 
LAURA: Be careful. They may be drugged. 
SAM: Oh! 
TALIESIN: I'll have one of those, actually. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That sounds great! 
LIAM: We're a little foggy this morning. We celebrated, partook a bit last night. Nothing too raucous, although a couple took to the skies. 
LAURA: That was definitely due to inebriation and not sober at all. 
MATT: "I've heard tell of your adventure yesterday." 
TRAVIS: Yeah? 
MARISHA: What did you think? 
MATT: "I'm glad you survived." 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Survived? We thrived! 
MARISHA: (laughs) Hell yes! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Put on quite a show. You should hire us, aerial performances. 
MATT: "I'll put it under consideration." 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Snap! 
MATT: Looks over to you, Orym. 
LIAM: If you see a swarm of bees around the cliffs, it's just temporary. 
MATT: "That's okay. I've accidentally misplaced quite a few hives in my time." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "But nevertheless, you are here for a reason, I assume, this early? Not just to deliver muffins. Though, if it is just the case, I'm very appreciative. That's very sweet!" 
SAM: No, we wanted to check in because we're about to skip town and you said that you were going to go-- 
LAURA: Look for allies as well. 
SAM: Look for allies, and we wanted to find out how to get in touch with you afterwards. 
MATT: "No, no, that's a valid question." 
LIAM: Yeah, we've had a little bit of trouble with that. 
MATT: "Yeah. So it seems. I'm going to be hopping around for quite a bit to personally make these arrangements and I don't think we're the only ones. But right now, coordination is, I think, going to be key, though we have very little information about where we're going and what we're facing. Where are you off to now?" 
TALIESIN: There's some contention about that, but we're-- 
SAM: Yios or the Shattered Teeth, but probably Yios. 
LAURA: Probably-- 
MARISHA: Nicodranas was where we saw D. 
LAURA: Menagerie Coast, yeah. Either way, it's going to be-- 
SAM: (whispers) I don't know why we want D. 
LAURA: Either the Menagerie Coast or Yios and then onto the Shattered Teeth, like you talked about. 
LIAM: Yeah, we have a couple loose threads to pursue before the Shattered Teeth. 
MATT: "Understood. I mean, whatever you can discover about your essence will--" 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: "-- the more, the safer, either helpful or best to know what you are working with." 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: Then you said your friend in the Shattered Teeth would be able to potentially get us back here? 
MATT: "I think so. Jirana should be able to help you." 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "I've not quite been to Evontra'vir, but Jirana should be able to help you." 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: In the Shattered Teeth, right? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: If it happens that we get back and you're not here, what should we do? 
SAM: (whispers) Is it called-- 
MATT: "Well, if I'm not here, you can either wait, or if you have other places to be, we have a few other compatriot druidic guardians that can help also send you whichever way you may need in my absence." 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "But the case may be-- We can't rush into this. Information right now is as important as strength and ability. Whenever you-- I have a thought. You've all been to the site." 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: "You've had visions that pierce beyond the veil of the moon itself, and you are a relatively mobile crew that has managed to go unseen in certain dangerous spaces. Perhaps, when you feel comfortable and/or ready, maybe a mission of information to go there and back to see what we're dealing with." 
LAURA: A secret mission to the moon? 
MARISHA: To the moon or to the sun? 
MATT: "I know it sounds strange, but you know, just yesterday you told me there are people there, so I'm just rolling with the punches." 
MARISHA: I feel like I'm getting mixed messages because I thought it was bad to go there. 
LAURA: It's bad to go and fight. Maybe if we can sneak our way up and in and sneak our way back out. 
TRAVIS: Sneak onto the moon? 
LAURA: Sneak off of the moon, come find the Tempest. 
MATT: "Or at least figure out what we're dealing with. If not to the moon, anything else we can do to prepare. I'm sure I can rally a number of people who would be willing to come to this cause, but anyone of significant intelligence who has survived this long understands that, you know, they're not willing to race into a meat grinder." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's something different. 
LIAM: You've been able to jump to places you're familiar with. Possible? 
LAURA: Oh! To get all the way there with... 
TALIESIN: A big flash. 
SAM: You mean like a teleport there? 
LAURA: I have seen it in person! 
SAM: Does it have-- I mean-- 
LAURA: We could give it a try. I mean, we experienced what happened when things went a little wonky with it, but-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but-- 
LIAM: You were just working the kinks out, though. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was like first time. 
SAM: You know someone on the moon and you've seen it, you're familiar-ish with it. 
LAURA: I just don't have something from the moon. 
ASHLEY: Yes, you do! 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: You. 
ASHLEY: Your friend. Isn't he-- 
SAM: Oh, the red fella? 
ASHLEY: -- with you all the time? 
LAURA: Oh, the Reiloran that I can summon? 
SAM: He's from the moon. 
LAURA: I wonder if I could summon them and then ask for something from them. That's possible, right? 
SAM: When they're here, are they ethereal or are they-- 
LAURA: Kind of half in, half out, but that last time, he seemed a lot more real. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Just rip off his kerchief or something? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Or politely ask for it, you know? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Maybe she could ask. 
LAURA: Maybe I could just pinprick myself and my blood would be considered from the moon. 
ASHLEY: I mean-- 
TALIESIN: Just ask once. 
ASHLEY: You're technically, I mean, aren't you a little bit of the moon? 
LAURA: I don't know if I'm technically actually Reiloran, though. You know what I mean? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. No. 
LAURA: But-- 
MATT: "I'm unfortunately not well-versed in the bookish means of magic. If you have someone you could talk to who understands those particular matters of the magic that you wield, maybe they can help understand what you can and cannot do." 
TRAVIS: What's the Council of Tal'Dorei have to say about all this? 
MATT: "That is indeed some of the people that I'm hoping to speak to about all this." 
LAURA: What is up, Chet? 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
LAURA: Hmm? 
MATT: (Graz'tchar) "You're piercing the veil of lies. You can see in her face." (laughter) 
MATT: "She sends you all to your distant doom. Do not let her honeyed words weave and burrow into your mind." 
MARISHA: Fuck! 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: "You're close. Close enough to end it!" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "To save us all!" 
LIAM: Do it, Trav! 
MATT: "Together!" 
LIAM: You killed Santa. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I think he's changing color. 
ASHLEY: Why do you have that weird look on your face? 
TALIESIN: It's bright red! 
LAURA: Why are you laughing? 
ASHLEY: You have a weird look on your face. 
LIAM: Yeah, you're spacing out. 
TALIESIN: You're real flushed. 
TRAVIS: It's the only one I got. 
ASHLEY: Well-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Well, thank you for your advice. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
MATT: "Of course, of course." 
SAM: We'll get out of your hair now. We got to figure out where we're going. 
LAURA: Yes, maybe you should Scry on-- 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Would it be possible, if you're all done with it and if perhaps there's some to spare. 
SAM: Oh yeah! 
ASHLEY: Would it be possible to take some of that blue flower poultice in case any of us-- 
MATT: "Oh, yeah. Right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: "We have some. We were keeping it at the wayside in case, however, it's much easier for us to retrieve more of it and prepare it now that I'm--" 
ASHLEY: Are you sure? 
MATT: "-- in a healthier state. Yes. So what we do have, which especially given some of the possibilities of future encounters, you should definitely have some at your disposal." 
LIAM: Just a scooch. 
MATT: She raises her hand and wind picks up and blows open a cabinet. She walks over and plucks out a small-- 
ASHLEY: She's cool. 
MATT: -- it's a thick, somewhat faint brown coloration to the glass itself. It's not clear glass. It's a more of an naturally created glass. You can see on the, she uncorks it on the inside, that poultice itself, there's maybe about four or five spoonfuls left. She seals it up and hands it over and says, "Hopefully you'll have no need of this." 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
MATT: "But it's always good to have something in case!" 
ASHLEY: Are you sure? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "Mm-hmm." 
LIAM: I don't want you to go without. Are we actively seeking more? 
MATT: "I will be. I can now, thanks to your help. I retrieved it previously when the last attack came through here." 
LIAM: All right. 
LAURA: Mage Hand it over to FCG. 
SAM: I'll take it. 
MARISHA: So, getting to the Shattered Teeth after we go visit one of the Ds, is that something you can help us with or should we find other means? 
MATT: "Actually, if--" She thinks for a second. "If it makes sense, if you take me with you to the city, do what you need to do, and then we can find a tree. I can send you from Yios and I can be on my way to where I have to go as well." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: Great. 
TALIESIN: That works for me. 
MARISHA: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Sure. 
MARISHA: It's a quick pit stop. 
MATT: "Certainly. I can make myself look a little less conspicuous." 
SAM: Oh, like a disguise? 
MATT: "More or less, yeah." 
SAM: Wow. Cool. 
MATT: "It's been a bit since I've, you know, gone out and just been a normal, common folk. Might be kind of fun." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Fun. 
MATT: (Graz'tchar) "This could be your chance. Keep her close." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Watch for any signs of her leaving herself vulnerable. You can save us all, Chetney, together!" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You deserve all of this. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Please. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (suppressing laughter) Mm. 
SAM: Well then, we should just go. 
LAURA: Go straight to Yios? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You said Yios, you want to go see Dancer? 
SAM: You guys keep saying we should go see D. Still, I am a team player. You know me! I am a-- 
MARISHA and SAM: Team player. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: But-- That's an inside joke with me and Marisha. 
LAURA, MARISHA, and SAM: (laugh) 
SAM: But I still have-- 
ASHLEY: We couldn't tell. (laughter) 
SAM: -- have yet to understand-- 
LAURA: It was so funny, though. 
SAM: -- why we're going to see D. 
LAURA: All right, let's go see Dancer. 
TALIESIN: We'll see Dancer. 
SAM: He hasn't fixed anything ever. 
ASHLEY: Because he is hot. 
SAM: We trust you! 
SAM: Okay. Okay. 
ASHLEY: But also he put you together. 
SAM: He did not! 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. We've already established that Dancer did. 
SAM: He specifically brought me to someone who put me together. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: All right. All right. 
LAURA: Let's do it. 
SAM: But maybe he did. 
SAM: Maybe I'm wrong. 
LAURA: Just, D strikes me-- Dancer strikes me as a liar. 
TALIESIN: And not really that interested in helping. 
SAM: I tried to kill her and I chopped off her arm? Arm? Leg? Arm? 
MATT: Arm. 
SAM: Arm. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
SAM: So that's probably why she was-- 
LAURA: Well, will she help us at all then? 
SAM: That will be a challenge. 
LAURA: Oh, well. 
ASHLEY: Maybe we can persuade her. 
LIAM: It was fraught last time. 
TALIESIN: I felt more positive about an unknown variable that was on the way. But our current transportation issues remove that variable. So I'm-- 
ASHLEY: We might as well. 
MARISHA: Also, yes, your mother was saying that she would consult the Voice for wisdom. So maybe Keyleth knows how to deal with disgruntled people who have severed limbs. 
SAM: Listen. 
TRAVIS: Does she? 
SAM: My entire job in life-- 
MATT: (Keyleth) "I can bring limbs back." 
SAM: -- is to-- 
LAURA and MARISHA: (gasp) 
SAM: You what? 
MATT: "I can, if you have a friend who lost an arm, a leg, I can bring it back." 
LAURA: Perfect. 
SAM: Boom. 
LAURA: Let's do it. 
MARISHA: Bargaining chip. 
TRAVIS: Boom. 
LAURA: Let's go. 
SAM: How is that, by the way? 
MATT: "It's a little dry, but very delicious." 
SAM: Thank you for the criticism. 
MATT: "No--" 
LIAM: Wait 'til it kicks in. (laughter) 
SAM: Give it 45 minutes. 
TALIESIN: We're not going to Yios, are we? (laughter) 
SAM: Maybe an hour. 
TALIESIN: This isn't Yios. 
SAM: I did not drug the Voice. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We're going to have our own version of the "Dark Side of the Moon." It's going to go real weird. 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: Don't do this to me. 
MATT: I just wanted to confirm. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Don't go back for seconds. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Give it time. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
SAM: Hold on. Did I? No, I didn't. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
LAURA: All right, let's do it. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: No seconds. (laughs) 
MATT: "Very well." 
ASHLEY: No seconds. 
MATT: "Let me let my guard know that I'll be gone for a bit and to keep watch, and I'll return and I guess we'll be on our way." 
ASHLEY: All right then. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: "(sighs) We'll be on our way." She steps out of the room. 
LIAM: ♪ Makin' our way ♪ 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MARISHA: Okay. Why are you being so fucking weird? 
TRAVIS: I don't know, I tried. 
MARISHA: You have the face. You were sitting there with an angry face. 
LAURA: The whole time, you've just been like (crotchety snarls). 
LIAM: You look like you're about to have a stroke. 
LAURA: You're making weird rattling noises. 
TALIESIN: That face is somehow even less attractive than your calm and peaceful one. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you're so angry. 
TRAVIS: Well, I just-- My itch! My itch. I don't trust it. She's bouncing around through trees. 
LAURA: What are you talking about, Chet? 
MARISHA: What are you talking about?! 
TRAVIS: Nothing. I'm fine. 
LAURA: We've bounced through trees. 
TALIESIN: FCG, make sure you still have that little pouch of stuff, because this looks really familiar to me. 
MATT: (Graz'tchar) "Calm down. You are making them think that you're acting irrational." (laughter) 
MATT: "Just play it cool." 
TRAVIS: Cool, in the game is actually what I was going to say. It's all cool--

TALIESIN: Is that a phrase we're saying now? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Cool in the game.

LIAM: Everybody's still cool in the game. 
MARISHA: Cool in the game.

MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Why don't you--

TRAVIS: Huh? 
ASHLEY: Why don't you trust her?

MATT: "Do you have everything you need?" 
SAM: We're ready, yeah. 
LAURA: I think so. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're good. 
MATT: "All right." She walks over and-- 
MARISHA: Fix your face. (laughs) 
MATT: -- grabs a satchel and puts it over her shoulder. She takes a potion out of a small cabinet, uncorks it, sips a bit. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's better. 
MATT: (magical shush) You watch as her majestic appearance seems to shift and glimmer and it swirls around her. 
LAURA: Glimmer and shift. 
MATT: This amazing-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Glimmer and shift. 
MATT: -- spiral of sparkles and energy. Her antlers diminish. The cloak pulls upward and you watch as her appearance becomes that of a standard human woman with older skin, a bit of gray across the red, like an odd human version of Keyleth with simple clothes and attire, a walking stick instead of her amazing staff. She just looks like another person. 
SAM: Like when you see a realistic version of a Flintstones cartoon? 
MATT: Kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs) You're like: Hmm, interesting. "I'm ready when you are." 
SAM: Well then, let's go! 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: Gather near. 
MATT: You all get close together. 
TRAVIS: Hold my hand. 
ASHLEY: He doesn't even acknowledge it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Nope. 
TALIESIN: I wouldn't either.

ASHLEY: You're still doing that face. 
MATT: "She'll smite you the moment she has an opportunity."

ASHLEY: Yeah.

LAURA: We've been. 
SAM: It doesn't matter, lets go. 
LAURA: We've been. You can do it. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Just think of it and go. 
SAM: I'm thinking of Yios-- 
LIAM: It's canon. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (silent laughs) 
SAM: -- and going. 
MATT: (gathering arcane energy) You feel this rush of energy within the room. The runes in the staff glow and diminish as the various charges of arcane energy are expended. All of you glance at each other as a similar sort of sparkle of power within the room surrounds and lights up the space around you. For a brief moment, you feel your entire periphery consumed by color and light. You are... 
TRAVIS: Dead. 
MATT: Let's see here. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah. You're dead. You are fucking dead. 
SAM: (powering down) 
MARISHA: (laughs) It's been a great campaign, you guys. 
TALIESIN: All you hear is that sword go: Well fuck. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Now you're very familiar with this space, I'll say, because it isn't just like you've seen it casually or something. You've been in this for a period of time. Go ahead and roll a d100 for me, Sam, if you don't mind. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Oh, I should have warned you. You take damage every time you use this. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: Whoa. 100? 
TRAVIS: Wait, did you roll trip zeros? 
SAM: It's one and two zeros. 
LAURA: That's 100. 
TRAVIS: That's a one. 
MATT: Oh, no, that's a one. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: What is that? 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. 
TALIESIN: That's the other end of that. 
LAURA: You could have rolled really good. Instead you rolled really, really, really bad. 
TRAVIS: Where are we going? 
LAURA: Even worse than I rolled. 
TRAVIS: You don't know. 
LAURA: A one? 
MARISHA: Is it high or is it low? 
MATT: So-- 
LAURA: That's really low. 
ASHLEY: I imagine, though, a one is not good. 
LIAM: Everybody accept punishment. 
MATT: The bright energy that surrounds you-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yes. 
MATT: -- gets brighter and brighter, and you glance upward. 
ASHLEY: He's doing it. 
LAURA: He's so much better at this than me. 
MATT: You can almost see the tunnel stretching. For a moment, you can see the bright blue glow of-- (laughter) (laughter) (laughter) 
MATT: -- magical blue waters that surround the City of Flowing Light. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: But the light gets brighter and you can feel the heat and the vibration before (intense whooshing) all of you are struck from all sides with an intense blast of uncontrolled arcane energy. 
MARISHA: Ah! 
MATT: All of you, including Keyleth, take-- 
MARISHA: We just healed her. 
MATT: Oh! (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: 22 points of force damage.

LAURA: (grunts) 
MARISHA: (groaning) God. 
ASHLEY: Ow! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: I need you to roll again. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: Roll again? 
MATT: Yes, as you're now currently being tossed in the storm of arcane energy-- 
LAURA: Ow, ow, ow! 
MATT: -- a little off course. 
SAM: A one and a 50. So 51. 
LAURA: (sighs relief) 
MATT: 51. 
SAM: Is that one over what I needed? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) No! 
MATT: As you're all racked with sincere pain-- 
TRAVIS: It is not! 
MATT: -- and the energy begins to subside, you finally watch clarity push through on that, the end of that arcane tunnel and (air whooshing) you all are pulled through and then land about six inches of a drop onto the stone ground of one of the side streets in the central region of the city of Yios. 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
SAM: We did it. 
TALIESIN: Ow. 
SAM: (lets out breath) 
LIAM: Ow. 
TALIESIN: (long groan) 
SAM: Why does that happen every time we do that? 
ASHLEY: Well, yeah. 
LAURA: You did better than I did the first time I-- 
SAM: Did I? 
ASHLEY: No, I don't think-- I don't think they did. 
SAM: This thing is broken. 
MARISHA: It is pretty rough. 
ASHLEY: It hurts. 
MATT: "That-- Ow." 
SAM: Sorry about that. Here, gather around, I'll heal everyone. 
LAURA: Oh, you took 6d4 damage. 
SAM: Oh, I also did? 
LAURA: Yeah, you did. 
SAM: Oh great. 
TRAVIS: 64 or 6d4? 
MATT and LAURA: 6d4. 
SAM: Okay, another 14 points. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Wait, wouldn't he have to roll a four? 
LAURA: Huh. What were you rolling? 
LAURA: You rolled the-- 
SAM: Oh, I rolled 4d6. 
ASHLEY: Yes, you need to do-- 
SAM: Whatever. It doesn't matter. (laughter) 
SAM: It's the same. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I'm just curious. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: I will-- Gather round, I'll heal you, Tempest, Voice of. I'm a voice of. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Or I could do a Mass Healing Word. Maybe I'll do that for all of us. Everyone gather around, and I'll cast Mass Healing Word on us. 
MATT: "Thank you." 
SAM: We will all heal-- Oh yeah, this is big stuff. 
LIAM: Uncrush us? 
SAM: Eight points. 
LIAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. 
ASHLEY: Tight. 
LAURA: (flatly) Thanks, Letters. That really made up for it. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Slow ride ♪ 
ASHLEY: I'm almost completely back up! 
MATT: "I appreciate that. Thank you very much." 
LIAM: ♪ ("Price is Right" failure trombone) ♪ 
TALIESIN: It's like scraping against marble. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Take it easy ♪ 
MATT: The city is very quiet and you gauge, based on the time of the journey, it's probably pre-dawn here in Marquet. But as you stand there, you watch as Keyleth looks about the area with a bit of a smile. "I don't think I've been here before." 
LAURA: Oh really? 
MATT: She looks off and focuses her eyes and you watch her eye line and you can see the ominous, glowing red orb of Ruidus and the thread of the bloody bridge that connects it off to the north, northeast. "I can-- I can see why-- Thank you for bringing me. Well, I guess, lead the way. I'm a bit out of my depth here. This is--" 
SAM: Sure. 
LAURA: Where did you see Dancer? 
SAM: I mean, I have Locate Creature that I can use. 
LAURA: Oh, that's even better. 
SAM: But that's only a thousand feet, so, let's hope, fingers crossed. 
LAURA: You said she-- 
TALIESIN: Well, let's cut to the-- 
LAURA: Puked in the water. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, she puked in the water. 
LAURA: That's kind of everywhere, though. 
TALIESIN: Just look, yeah-- 
ASHLEY: Near some tall buildings. Cobblestones. 
SAM: Do you see? Look up. See the tall buildings anywhere? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
ASHLEY: Okay, let me check. 
LAURA: Guidance! 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: Do you have Guidance? 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Double Guidance. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, that's good. 
TRAVIS: (as Ashley) Oh, oh! 
MARISHA: (as Ashley) Oh! 
LAURA: ♪ Dee-do-lee-dee ♪ 
LIAM: Eeep. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) Bee-loo boop! 
ASHLEY: 30. 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
SAM: Do! 
MATT: You recall some of the details, though it tends to blur a bit beyond the original space of a Scry spell. You pick up some of the architecture, some of the shapes of the roads, some of the blurred outer skyline of what you could see of the city, and really quickly figure that it likely was somewhere in probably the Endeavor Ring, which was the central ring of the city, near the base of where the switchback roads lead up to the upper ring. You're not sure specifically, but you know that was the region where you saw her stumbling through. 
ASHLEY: Follow me. 
SAM: Yes, ma'am. 
ASHLEY: I know exactly where to go. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
SAM: Great! 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop. 
MARISHA: Cobblestone roads. (laughter) 
MATT: Indeed. Some of the local guards of Yios give some nods as you pass by and some lingering glares, just making sure that there's no funny business for people they don't recognize wandering about at four in the morning, you know. Eventually you get to the depths of the central Endeavor Ring. You can see the Lakecap Skyport where you had first arrived here not long before, and the dull lights of the still functioning casino, even at these hours. They don't seem to close. You can see the Tri-Bridge Plaza as that climbs up, all the curving staircases that lead to the upper area. You said you cast Locate-- 
SAM: When we get there, I'll cast Locate Creature. 
MATT: When you get there? Okay. 
LAURA: Have you ever been to a casino, Tempest? 
MATT: "Yeah, I've been to a few places of games and chance. I have some bad influences in my life, yeah." 
TALIESIN: Like a casino-casino? 
MATT: "Not this one." 
TALIESIN: I mean, just like, you know. Dozens-- 
MATT: "Oh, I went to the Luck's Run in Ank'Harel, I've been to Kymal. There's been-- Oh, I've lived a little." 
TALIESIN: Insight check. (laughter) 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you have. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah, she's being completely honest. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. 
TRAVIS: It's spreading. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I rolled a two. 
MARISHA: Leave my previous character alone. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Deceptive bitch. 
TALIESIN: Never. 
MARISHA: What? 
MATT and LIAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: She's been through enough! 
LAURA: Aw! 
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm crying. 
LAURA: Poor Tempest. 
MATT: You finish casting the spell and immediately your attention locks in, in a northwestward direction, further up along the Tri-Bridge Plaza. 
SAM: Follow me. 
ASHLEY: No, you're going the wrong way. 
SAM: Follow me. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's over this way. 
SAM: Okay, well, it was nice knowing you. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay, fine, I'll follow you. (laughter continues) 
TALIESIN: Appreciate the assertive. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Clip-clop, clip-clop. 
MATT: Heading up the road. 
SAM: Those are my feet. 
MARISHA: You put on your feet? (laughs) 
MATT: (Graz'tchar) "If she ever hangs back--" 
SAM: (laughs) Jeez. 
MATT: "-- just a bit further from the rest of the group, don't be concerned. Take your shot." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
SAM: He's going to brain her. 
TRAVIS: I was being cool. Like a Crock-Pot, once you get me warm, it's hard to cool me down. 
MATT: "I could sense it within you, this burgeoning greatness. Oh, how you shine like the stars in the sky. You've only begun your journey. We will do great things together." 
TRAVIS: Great things together. 
LAURA: In your head you hear: What the fuck are you mumbling about? 
TRAVIS: Ah! That's very invasive. (flicks tongue) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (sniffs snot loudly) 
LAURA: What the fuck are you mumbling about? 
TRAVIS: What? My allergies are going. 
SAM: Guys, shut up. We're almost there. 
LAURA: Sorry. Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: You come to the outside of-- 
LAURA: No wait, I was in his head! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: He was-- (laughter) 
SAM: I was Detecting Thoughts on both of you! (laughter) 
MATT: Oh, there you go! 
SAM: I could hear you talking. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Yes, but. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Making thought face? 
LAURA: (grunting) 
MATT: (laughs) You approach the outside of a hostel. There are a number of rooms with windows, simple. You can see the bottom floor is an open lounging common area. There are tables and there are lounging, napping areas. There's a small food and drink bar in there, but at this hour it's all closed. It's low-lit with a lantern, and there are two young adults that look like they're travelers that are slumped over in a corner, snoring gently together. You sense that on the second floor upward is where Dancer currently resides. 
SAM: All right. I mean-- 
ASHLEY: Do you want to go? 
TALIESIN: I don't think that's a good idea. I think that we should go in with a bit of a ginger approach and make sure that she doesn't run. 
LAURA: Should I go and calm her emotions right away? 
TALIESIN: That or I was just going to pin her down, but that's cool, too. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Wait, we're talking about attacking her? 
LAURA: No! 
TALIESIN: No, restraining. 
LAURA: Just making sure she's chill, she's calm. 
LIAM: Not letting it go sideways. 
SAM: She's going to be calm. 
LAURA: It's cool. All cool in the game. 
SAM: It's going to be fine. 
TALIESIN: How much money you got on you? 
SAM: I ate it all. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
SAM: I don't carry money. 
TRAVIS: I got plenty. 
TALIESIN: I know, I'm trying to think of something of value that I can take from you when you're wrong. 
SAM: Our friendship. 
LAURA: Aw. 
TALIESIN: I already have that. 
TRAVIS: Barf. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Okay, do you want to-- 
SAM: We're just going to talk to her. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: If you're just going to talk, let's cover the exits to make sure that we'll catch her when she runs. 
MARISHA: Is she going to be super still probably drunk? 
TALIESIN: How bad was she? 
LAURA: That might be good. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: So everyone's going upstairs? 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Well, I guess I'll hold back and watch the exit. 
TALIESIN: It's the second floor, if you can hit a window on the second floor. 
LIAM: What's our disguised Tempest doing, is she coming up with or staying? 
MATT: "You tell me what you need from me, I'm here to help in what way I can, but this seems oddly tense and personal outside of my purview, so I'm just following your lead." 
TALIESIN: How about just for safety's sake, if you're going to hang by, you cover the window, you stay outside. If we need you in there eventually for some healing issues or we go somewhere else, you can signal bring the Tempest in. 
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. I can hang with her. 
MATT: "I mean, if you need me nearby but hidden--" and she turns into a tiny little dormouse. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: I just don't have the toolkit to strategize about any of this. 
LAURA: You could just be little mice best friends! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to pick her up. Oh my goodness. 
MATT: (cute chittering) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Pâté! Pâté! 
MATT: (Pâté) "Yeah. What we doing?" 
LIAM: Hold on. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: "I was taking a nap, but--" 
TALIESIN: Shit got weird. 
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We just need to talk to Dancer. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: Easy, easy. 
LAURA: Let's not fucking spook her before we even get up there. 
TRAVIS: (transforming growl) (laughter) 
MATT: (Graz'tchar) "Finish it!" 
TRAVIS: (roaring) (laughter) 
SAM: Good god. 
MATT: (builds block tower) 
TALIESIN: Lord. 
MARISHA: Okay, maybe you be a not-mouse. Come back. 
TALIESIN: Well, I mean-- 
MATT: (Pâté) "Okay, watch this. "I did it." 
MARISHA: Not-- 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Are you talking to Keyleth? 
MARISHA: I was talking to Keyleth. 
MATT: Oh. (laughter) 
SAM: Keyleth can be a mouse, it doesn't matter. 
LAURA: Why can't Keyleth be a mouse? 
TALIESIN: Keyleth can be a mouse. 
MARISHA: Okay, she can stay a mouse. 
TALIESIN: Turning into a tiny thing and going into a dangerous situation is always fine. 
LIAM: You're doubting her? 
LAURA: Tell you what. I'm going to go upstairs and see what Dancer's doing. She's never seen me. I'll go upstairs, see what she's doing. I'll send a message down to you if she seems fine. 
SAM: Great, great. 
LIAM: Fearne's toting the Tempest. 
LAURA: So I'm going to walk up the steps. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I can hold her. Do you want to hold her, Chet? 
TRAVIS: Sure. 
MARISHA: (strained) No. 
ASHLEY: No, I'm kidding. She's so cute. Stay up here. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Stay up here, you little oochie-poochie-poochie. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: All right. You go up the steps, they turn back and head back up to the second floor. You're met with a long hallway that has a series of simple doors. 
LAURA: Oh shit, it's like a bedroom situation. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: In your head you hear: It's just a fucking hallway with a bunch of doors. Which room is she in? She's asleep or something. 
SAM: I'll come up. I'm coming up. 
MATT: Okay. (wheel thudding) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: I can sense which door. 
LAURA: Oh great. Then sense it. 
MATT: Third door on the left. 
SAM: (whispering) Third door on the left. 
LAURA: Okay. It's probably locked. 
SAM: Wait, what time is it now, like five in the morning? 
LAURA: Yeah, she's probably sleeping. 
SAM: Let's just knock. We're not going to bust in on her. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: (sighs) 
LAURA: (knocks) 
MATT: (Dancer) "What?" 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Hey, that was effective. 
LAURA: Hi, Dancer. Is that your name, Dancer? 
MATT: It gets quiet. 
MATT: "Who's talking?" 
LAURA: Imogen. 
MATT: "I don't know Imogen." 
LAURA: Well, now you do. Come on and answer the door, so I can talk to you, hun. 
MATT: (laughs) Make a persuasion check. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Oh wow, that is surprising. 23. 
MATT: 23. "You sound cute, Imogen." 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
LAURA: So do you, Dancer. 
MATT: "Who sent you?" 
LAURA: Well, you'll just have to find out. 
MATT: "Okay, hold on--" (thudding) You hear some stumbling over. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
MATT: (machine whirring) "Shh." 
TRAVIS: Goddamn it. 
MATT: (multiple locks clicking) (hinges squeak) She leans out. You can see her, black hair half in the face, looking like she's still in the process of sobering. Probably was asleep and is now rapidly put together in a slap-dash way. "Well, hi, Imogen." 
LAURA: Hi. Can you talk? 
MATT: "I mean, I've been talking to you, I think I can do more than talk." 
LAURA: Great, I'll just come in then. 
MATT: "Please." 
LAURA: Oh, and my friend's here with me. 
SAM: Hi. 
MATT: "(startles)" 
SAM: Don't worry, don't worry. It's okay, it's okay. 
LAURA: Calm Emotions. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) Oh, it's cocked. Okay, that's a natural two. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: She goes (panicked) "Ah!' 
SAM: It's okay, it's okay. No one's here to hurt you. 
MATT: (metallic squeaking) You hear this noise right above the door and you see this perched metallic creature that's leaned down into it with this weird pointed beak-like element where a head would be. 
ASHLEY: Calm down, calm down. 
LAURA: Like a little bird. 
SAM: I know. I don't like it. 
LAURA: What's the bird's name, Dancer? 
MATT: "That's Pussy II." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "What's this about? What are you doing?" 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
SAM: I'm here for help. I'm here to ask for your help. 
MATT: "I'm sure you are. What is it you want from me? (sparse laughter) 
MATT: "You following me?" 
SAM: No, no. I tracked you down for sure, using magic, but only because I want to help you and I need your help to do that. I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a big shooting red beam in the sky that's really bad. 
MATT: "Yeah, it's all sorts of fucked." 
SAM: Yeah. Well me and my friend, Imogen here, and some other friends we got downstairs, we're trying to fix things and put the world back. Ever since I left you, I've gone on so much great adventures and had a sort of an epiphany and now I'm faithful. I've got a god who I talk to all the time. I've really turned my life around and I've got a whole new group of friends and they trust me and-- Don't you trust me? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: She does. 
LAURA: Also, we can grow your limb back. If you want. 
MATT: "What? (sighs) (sighs) (groans)" Rubs her head for a second and grabs a stool and scoots it over before plopping down a bit. "(tired groan)" You see, puts her face in her hand and you can see underneath the quickly-thrown-over shawl, the metallic arm that has been built to replace the one that she lost before. 
SAM: Look, I know that we had some rough times. That was my fault, totally accept blame for that. But also the one thing I know about you is you're great at fixing things. That's one trait that you passed on to me and I'd like to try to fix the world a little bit. If you can help me fix something, then maybe I can sort of pay that forward and help fix you and this whole situation that the world's in. 
MATT: "Is he serious?" 
LAURA: Unfortunately, we're very serious. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: I'll say with both of you together and with you backing him up, you can take it with advantage or you can both take it separately. 
SAM: I'll take advantage. A one and a four. 
LAURA: Why didn't you let me roll? 
SAM: Because I'm crazy. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Take advanta--! (laughter) 
SAM: Oh god! He's killing Keyleth! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Chetney-- 
SAM: He's killing Keyleth! (laughter) 
LIAM: That's Laudna! 
MARISHA: I know, it's confusing! (laughter slowly fades) 
LAURA: This has all been a dream. We're still in Zephrah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
SAM: I have a high persuasion, so that's a 10. 
MATT: She reaches back off the table and grabs a green glass-looking liquor bottle and shakes it. It sloshes of what remnants or dregs there are and finishes that, sets it back and it topples and spills a little bit on the table and goes, "Eh, fuck. FCG, I don't need to be fixed, all right? What I've been able to make here is both something I learned a lot in trying to put together and it's a reminder of being careful where I put my trust." 
SAM: Well then, can you at least-- I can't move on, I-I-I can't fulfill my job unless I'm able to close this chapter with you. 
MATT: "(sighs)" 
SAM: I did something really horrible that I'll never feel right about in my entire life unless you let me. I'm not asking you to forgive me, I'm just asking you for a chance to do something good for someone else. 
MATT: "(sighs) Look, if you really came here asking for my help in whatever sort of god-forsaken, fucking savior mission you've put yourselves on, I'll do what I can to help, but there ain't nothing I can do to make you feel better about something that you've decided you're holding onto. We're-- We've been done for a while. The only person that's hanging on is you. I know that sounds harsh, but you got to fucking move on. All right, yeah, we had some good times and we had some real bad times. Maybe you have changed. Maybe you found better people. The fact that you're still hanging around knowing what he's capable of says that, well, you got a higher tolerance than I do, and with that, hats off to you. But-- Look, I spent most of my life trying to get from under the thumb of society and expectation and debts and manipulations and people using you. Now we got a big old side of the apocalypse glaring down day and night out here. So I'd like to spend the rest of my days here as long as we got them, drinking, fucking, and sleeping. In the interim, I help you how I can. But that's where it sits. If you decide to move on, that's something you got to figure out. It's not my responsibility." 
SAM: Okay. Well then, treat this as a job, then. We'll pay you for your services and you can go on your way and I'll never talk to you again. 
MATT: "Sounds like a deal." 
SAM: We have something that we don't understand how to fix and we think maybe you can." 
LAURA: It's very old. Old technology, we don't know how it works and you seem to be versed in mixing arcane with-- 
MATT: "Oh, I'm good at improvising. Sure, I ain't no specialist." 
LAURA: But you woke them up. 
MATT: "Yeah, with time and supplies." 
SAM: We can get you what you need. 
MATT: "Y'all got any water?" 
LAURA: Yeah. I'll go get some from downstairs. 
MATT: "Give me some water. I don't-- I've had a night not expecting work the next morning. 
LAURA: Oh, I bet you can-- 
SAM: Yeah. If you'll let me, I could probably make you feel sharp as a tack. 
MATT: "Be my guest." 
SAM: I'll cast Lesser? 
LAURA: Yeah, I think-- 
SAM: Lesser Restoration. 
MATT: As you approach you see an instinct and it can't not hurt. But you watch as you reach for her, she-- Leans in as you touch the side of her temple, moving the hair back a little bit and the divine power scattering through your arm and filtering into her. You burn the toxins from her system in but moments. You watch her blink a bit. "All right, I'll say that's one thing I do miss "about traveling with you. (laughs)" 
SAM: Yeah. You probably can't drink quite as much these days, or as often. 
MATT: "Oh, I do. (laughs) It just sucks more." 
LAURA: You still want water or you want some coffee instead? 
MATT: "Coffee's fine." 
LAURA: Should I bring the group up? 
MATT: "How many more are you?" 
SAM: We're a whole bunch. 
LAURA: A lot. 
MATT: "I'll come down. (groans) Pussy, Cookie, come on." 
LAURA: (laughs) Pussy. 
LIAM: P2. 
LAURA: The second coming. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
TALIESIN: Nice, nice. 
SAM: That's amazing. 
ASHLEY: I like it. 
SAM: Those are some pretty fancy contraptions. 
MATT: "Learn as I go. Find what I can." 
SAM: I might have some old parts that I can give you. 
MATT: "If they're not useful to you, I'm sure I'll find a use for it at some point." 
SAM: All right. 
MATT: "All right. Let's meet the rest of your troop." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You can see as you all step out the door a couple of the doors open and the people in the hostel have woken up and they're looking out, blinky-eyed for the bereavement of noise and conversation way too early in the morning and then close their door once they notice that you've noticed them. You descend down into the base area where the rest of you are, and the rest of you watch Dancer come down, moving the shawl up off the arms. "Morning. So, what am I looking at?" 
SAM: Yeah, who's got it? 
LAURA: Harness, harness, who's got the harness? 
TRAVIS: I got it in the bag of holding. 
SAM: Whip it out. 
TRAVIS: Whip it good. Oh. It's fucking huge. This is for you. 
LAURA: As we come down, I'm going to put my hand on FCG's shoulder, and in your head you hear: You're a good person. 
SAM: Thank you, Imogen. I guess I-- I guess I got to figure that out for myself, though. 
LAURA: I trust you. 
SAM: Should you? 
LAURA: As much as you should trust me. 
SAM: It's true. 
MATT: "Where all did you get this?" 
TRAVIS: We got that deep in the Savalir. Are we just putting it all-- 
TALIESIN: No, no, no. 
LAURA: We found it. We found it. It's old. 
SAM: We're telling her everything. She needs to know its providence to fix it. 
TALIESIN: Ah, we'll get to that. 
MATT: "It certainly all it looks like it's got Elven, Elven runic history to the enchantment that was inscribed here. It's beautifully made, damaged as it is. Smells like compost." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: She reaches into her tool pack off to the side that she dragged downstairs. 
TRAVIS: Some people like the smell. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Scoot over. FCG, can you cast that language spell on other people or is it just you? 
SAM: I can, but it's only spoken language. 
TALIESIN: Okay, it's not read? I thought somebody had for reading. 
SAM: I might have something else. 
LAURA: Like in a previous campaign we had. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: (sparking) 
LIAM: Hallo. 
TALIESIN: Sorry. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Crystal's getting weird, nevermind. 
MATT: "Well, the runework here is certainly subtle and complicated. (groans) I mean, I could probably get a handle on some of its function, but this design is a little beyond just me." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "There's one place I know with a facility that could probably be of assistance and a person that I think would be a functional partner in this endeavor." 
MARISHA: Does the name start with D? 
LAURA: Great! 
MATT: "No. No, no." 
TRAVIS: Good guess, though. 
MARISHA: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: 25 more to go. 
SAM: One in a 26 chance. 
LAURA: Where is it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: "Imahara Joe." 
SAM: Huh? 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Imahara Joe. 
LAURA: Yeah, I bet that would've been a place to go. The two of y'all working together. 
MATT: "I imagine. We've only collaborated on a couple of small things here and there, but he's sharp in different ways than I am. I run with instinct. I just picked it up as I went. He's a little more classically trained, I guess you could say. You know, we fill the gaps of each other's knowledge. I've been wanting an excuse to get back anyway. This city's starting to wear on me. That and Bassuras always was kind of home." 
LAURA: Are there trees in Bassuras? 
SAM: I'm sure there was a tree. 
LAURA: Were there? 
MATT: There are dried, a handful of desert trees that scatter out there, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Was there a tree in the temple? Not the temple. Shit, in the-- 
LAURA: In the hive mind? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Do they have a tree in the-- I can't remember. I feel like there might've been stuff within the courtyard. 
MATT: Within the city, there are trees that are cultivated as well, usually outside the affluent homesteads. 
TALIESIN: That's, yeah. Okay. 
LAURA: Weren't we run out of town? 
TALIESIN: I mean, everyone gets run out of town there. It's like-- 
LIAM: Yes, we were. 
TALIESIN: It's the local sport. 
LIAM: Yeah, we fled. 
LAURA: Yeah, right. 
LIAM: People in the air. 
TALIESIN: Everyone who really, really hates us is either dead or on the moon now, anyway. 
LAURA: That's true. 
SAM: Yeah. We got other things to worry about. 
TALIESIN: It's a metaphor. 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LAURA: It's a metaphor. 
TRAVIS: That's a good one. 
LIAM: It's a metaphor like: Oops, I killed my whole family. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: It's one of those. 
SAM: Maybe our mouse could get us there. 
TALIESIN: Not a metaphor. 
LAURA: So I mean, yeah. 
MARISHA: A very talented mouse. 
MATT: The mouse is like, (chittering). 
LIAM: Modest. 
LAURA: Otherwise, I mean, we'll be spending the night here-- 
TALIESIN: Killer. 
LAURA: -- so you can recharge that. 
MATT: (whooshes) The mouse twirls out into the simpler Keyleth form. (Keyleth) "Hi. Also a friend. Hi." 
SAM: This is our normal, human woman friend. 
MATT: "I was just a mouse, now I'm a person." 
SAM: Key-- Kim. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I'm Kim-- "-- othy." 
LAURA and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
LAURA: Kimothée Chalamet. 
LIAM: Kimothy? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Kimothée-- 
TALIESIN: Oh god. That hurt. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Kimothée Chalamet. 
TALIESIN: Kimothée Chalamet. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: What the hell? 
MATT: (Dancer) "Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Kimothée." 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: "So your mouse friend here is getting us somewhere?" (Keyleth) "Bassuras, right?" 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "I have been there." 
LAURA: Oh great! 
MATT: "There are two trees I can pick. One-- Both at this hour seem to be less dangerous. We'll just try and keep quiet." 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: "I guess let's find a tree then?" 
SAM: Yeah. Dancer, you need anything to bring? 
MATT: (Dancer) "No, honestly, as long as I got Cookie." She knocks on, you see the spherical one. It's about that large. It's a little cobbled together, but it's still a smooth ball with three tripod-like legs that have multiple joints in them and as it walks it moves in a slight S pattern. But as she knocks on a drawer, (metallic clang) opens up on the inside and you can see it's a mobile storage associate. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
MATT: She reaches in and pulls out a toothbrush, and starts brushing her teeth. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: (muffled) "I'll be ready in just a second. (spits)" 
SAM: What about your Pussy? Is that going to come with us, too? 
MATT: "Oh, I take it everywhere with me." 
LAURA: You usually do. 
MATT: (wings flutter) 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: (metallic gears adjusting) This is like-- It's a nasty, wicked little thing. 
MARISHA: I once again pull out Pâté. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: (Pâté) "What is it? Oh, hello." (laughter) 
MATT: "What are you doing, you very weird looking metal one?" (Pussy II) (whirring) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (beam fires) (laughter) 
MATT: It shoots a fire beam directly into Pâté's face. He goes, (Pâté) "Ah!" (sizzling) (laughter) 
MATT: (Dancer) "Pussy, Pussy, stop that!" (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh! Ooh, Pâté, you got burned by some Pussy. (laughter) 
MATT: (Pâté) "If I had a nickel-- (laughs)" (laughter) 
MATT: "Ow." 
MARISHA: Sorry, buddy. 
TALIESIN: It's just right there. (laughter) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: (Dancer) "I travel light these days. So wherever we've got to go. I'm not going to say no to a quick trip back home anyway. This place is a little too uppity for me." 
SAM: All right, Kimothée. 
LAURA: Wrap a scarf around our heads and go. 
LIAM: Mean Pussy. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (Keyleth) "Okay. All right. So the nearest tree that will be large enough here would be-- I haven't been here before." 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Right. 
SAM: Isn't it-- There's lots of water around so I assume there's lots of trees, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, but they're usually-- I guess let's go out and see if we can find one. 
MATT: Yeah. There's a massive jungle that surrounds the lake that the city's in-- 
LAURA: Right, but you have to get out. 
MATT: But you have to go across the long bridges there and stuff. "I mean, I can change and grab a few people or is there something within the city?" She's walking out in the middle. 
LAURA: I don't know of a big tree in the city. We didn't spend enough time here. 
MATT: You did see a few outside of the-- There was the Colosseum and the, one of the massive colleges. 
LAURA: Oh, right. 
MATT: In the Venture Ring. 
LAURA: Let's head there. 
MATT: No, sorry, not the Venture Ring. That would be the Dominion Ring. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: I think there were some by the college. 
MATT: Yeah, Aydinlan Seminary. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: I got into an argument there for some reason. 
LAURA: ♪ Da da da ♪ Let's go. 
MATT: "Well, let's head that way." 
SAM: All right. 
MATT: Moving past the guards, traveling a bit, heading up the stairs through the hallway, eventually coming to the outskirt of the college from a distance. (harsh squawking) 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: No! 
LAURA: Oh god. 
LIAM: So many birds. 
LAURA: I forgot about Shithead. 
SAM: No! 
ASHLEY: Wait, I thought we killed Shithead. 
SAM: (repeated) Help me! Dancer. 
TRAVIS: What's happening? 
SAM: Something's about to happen that's really bad. 
MATT: "What are you even talking about?" 
SAM: It's a personification of my own guilt and it follows me around forever and it's-- 
MATT: "What the fuck are you talking about?" 
SAM: It's going to attack us right now. It's going to try to kill us right now. 
TRAVIS: Stand back. 
MATT: Stand back and Keyleth's like, "I don't, um." 
TRAVIS: Start boxing out Dancer and put my back against her and shuffle her away. 
LAURA: I get ready with Blindness. 
SAM: You know, not-- 
TRAVIS: FCG, move! 
TALIESIN: I pull out the hammer. 
SAM: Not for nothing, but you built me, so this is, I feel like this is sort of your fault. 
MATT: "What? I don't even--" 
SAM: You made me like this! I don't know, I'm freaking out! (laughter) 
MATT: Does 18 hit your armor class? 
SAM: What? 
MATT: Does 18 hit your armor class? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Right as you finish that line, (echoing impact) a massive bird shit smashes up the side of your head. 
TRAVIS: No! 
MATT: (echoing impact) 
LAURA: Where is he?! 
ASHLEY: Wait, I thought we killed him! 
MATT: Glance up and you can see the gnarled, nasty-looking, feather-patchy Shithead bird. It (squawking) up in the air. 
LAURA: I Catapult a rock. 
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack. 
SAM: Just leave me! Leave me and run. 
TRAVIS: No, FCG! 
ASHLEY: No! 
SAM: No, just leave me. 
LAURA: It's a dexterity save. 
MATT: Dexterity save. 
SAM: It's too late to save me! 
MATT: Natural 20. 
LAURA, SAM, and ASHLEY: Oh! 
MARISHA: What! 
LAURA: Piece of shit! Just rocks go flying past it. 
MATT: (screeches) Shit's coming in for another pass. 
SAM: No! Just go! Just go! 
ASHLEY: Scorching Ray! Scorching Ray! 
MATT: Scorching Ray? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, three attacks on it. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TALIESIN: Just going for it. 
ASHLEY: 14. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MATT: Hits. 
ASHLEY: And 25. 
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll damage. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right. 
TALIESIN: I feel like this is a trap. 
ASHLEY: I do, too. 10. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) No, I don't think so. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: 16 total. 
MATT: Okay. You watch as it spins around, (screeches), goes into this large dive and these fire rays go. (three fiery impacts) (sloppy plop) (laughter) 
MATT: Just on the ground, it's a roasted, tiny quail, you know? That you find at the stores. (rolling impacts) On the ground. 
TRAVIS: Chetney bounds over. (ravenous devouring) (laughter) 
LAURA: Just because you're old in that form. 
MATT: Just-- yeah. Yeah, not even a wolf just-- 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MATT: Just burnt feathers and-- 
TRAVIS: I forgot to change. 
MATT: -- charred meat in your mouth. 
MARISHA: Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. 
SAM: Just go! Just leave me! 
ASHLEY: No, it's done. It's done. 
SAM: Just leave me here! 
LAURA: You're fine. It's fine. 
SAM: What? It's over? 
ASHLEY: Open your eyes. 
LAURA: Yeah, but you are covered in shit. 
TALIESIN: Literally anti-climatic. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: He's presenting you with its corpse. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: It came back to life last time. 
SAM: What? 
MATT: (crackles) 
ALL: (screaming) 
SAM: Do something with it! Put it-- put it-- 
MATT: (trilling squawks) 
SAM: I'll eat it! I'll eat it! Put it in my stomach. I'll eat it! 
ASHLEY: Bake it! Bake it! 
TALIESIN: That seems like a bad idea. 
ASHLEY: Bake it! 
SAM: Dissolve it! (laughter) 
LIAM: Dissolve it? 
SAM: Well, I got acid in there! 
LIAM: Why do you have acid in there? 
SAM: (garbles) If oh-- it can dissolve-- (gags) If it can dissolve metal, maybe it can dissolve this! 
ASHLEY: Why don't you bake it? 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: Okay. (laughs) (laughter) 
SAM: Well, I got to do something with it. 
ASHLEY: We need dinner! 
TALIESIN: I'm not eating a manifestation of all of your guilt and no. 
SAM: It's already been roasted by you! You roasted it! 
ASHLEY: Roasted it! 
LAURA: Yeah, so roast it again! 
MARISHA: But what happens when it-- 
LAURA: Double bake it. 
MATT: (screeches) 
TALIESIN: It's carbon at that point, no one wants to eat that. 
SAM: I can't fit it. It's too big! 
MARISHA: No! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to open the fucking hole. I'm opening the hole. I'm finding a big piece of grass. Just put it in there, maybe it will be a problem later. 
SAM: Bury it? 
LAURA: We put it in the hole. 
TALIESIN: Put it in the hole! 
SAM: Wait, the hole! 
LAURA: Drop it in the hole. 
LIAM: Suffocate it indefinitely? 
TALIESIN: It'll just fly out when we need it. Oh, that's actually-- 
MARISHA: It's an undead bird! 
TALIESIN: -- pretty funny. 
MARISHA: It's like a revenant bird. It's got-- 
MATT: (screeches) 
TALIESIN: Oh god! 
SAM: (screams) (screams) 
MATT: It's sprouting feathers and it's trying to fly away. 
LAURA: Shocking Grasp, Shocking Grasp! 
MATT: Is that a dexterity save or a constitution save? 
LAURA: No, it's an attack. 
MATT: Oh, roll for that. 
LAURA: 22! 
MATT: That hits, roll damage. 
LAURA: Ah! 
SAM: What do we do? 
TALIESIN: Oh god. 
LAURA: Eight. Eight points of electric damage. 
MATT: Eight points. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait. 
MATT: (electric crackles) It goes limp in your grasp. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Sous vide! 
ASHLEY: I have an idea. 
SAM: What do I-- What am I doing? 
TRAVIS: (shouts) 
SAM: What do I do with it? 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait! Give it to me! Give it to me! 
SAM: What are you going to do with it? 
MARISHA: I don't know! Do I know-- Do I sense its undead properties? Who do you work for?! 
MATT: Make an arcana check. 
LIAM: (laughs) (laughter) 
MARISHA: What? 
MATT: Make an arcana check. 
MARISHA: Arcana check! All right. God bless it! Ah! (shrieks) No! 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Four. 
SAM: Guidance. 
MATT: You have no idea! 
MARISHA: Wait, Guidance! 
MATT: Nah, too late, too late. 
MARISHA: Ah! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Can you banish it to whatever hell it came from? 
SAM: I can Banish it. If it's from another plane of existence, sure. 
LIAM: Maybe it is. 
ASHLEY: Hey, hey? 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: Okay, wait. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab it by the neck and I'm going to Speak with Animals. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, great. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Didn't you already do-- I feel like you did this. 
ASHLEY: Did I do this already? 
SAM: We tried this once already. Just try it again! Just go for it! 
ASHLEY: What the fuck? (laughter) 
MATT: It's still dead. But then it like (snarls) is beginning to reform. Its cracked beak from the slamming of it begins to slowly seal over its damage. It's starting to come back to some semblance of life and consciousness. 
SAM: I'm going to cast Identify on it. 
LAURA: Oh, that's smart. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that is smart. 
MATT: Identify? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: (powers down) 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: You have Destroy-- well, no. 
LIAM: It's a bird. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Man, if only we had a cleric. 
SAM: Oh, yeah. If it's undead, I guess I could do that, too. (laughter) 
MATT: Identify. 
TALIESIN: I didn't say it-- Ashton says, out loud: If only we had a cleric. 
MATT: Technically, it's not an object. But if it's a creature that you're casting on what spells, if any, currently affect it. So, you don't learn about it, but you do learn a very, very strong necromantic power is seated within this creature. 
LAURA: Within it. 
SAM: Within it. What does that mean? 
MATT: Or just like its essence. 
LAURA: Maybe it's got a necromantic-- 
SAM: So it's undead? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Or it swallowed like a magic button. They do that all the time. 
SAM: Should I Turn Undead? 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, magpie. 
MATT: (crackles) 
ASHLEY: Hey! 
LIAM: Why not? Try it. 
LAURA: Try it! 
SAM: All right. All right. I'll do Turn Undead. Is that what I do? Destroy Undead? 
TALIESIN: No, Destroy Undead. 
SAM: Destroy Undead. 
LIAM: Destroy at a certain level. 
LAURA: It's a pretty small-- 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. Does Fearne learn anything? 
MATT: Well, it's coming to consciousness, and you smacked it. What do you say? You Speaking with Animals with it? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: (snarls) 
ASHLEY: Why are you going after him? 
MATT: "He just seems unworthy." (laughter) 
MATT: "Kind of pisses me off. "I don't like him." 
MARISHA: We for sure did this before, because he said the same thing. 
LAURA: He just doesn't like him. (laughter) 
MATT: "I just don't like his face." (laughter) 
MATT: "Don't like his little wheel." 
ASHLEY: Wait-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: His little wheel! 
SAM: It's a shithead! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wait, what? Why do you-- 
TALIESIN: Just say this to a bird, but it has to touch grass. Really should touch grass. 
LIAM: It's been trying repeatedly! 
TALIESIN: Not that Grass! 
MATT: What were you saying? 
ASHLEY: What's your goal? What's your goal? How can we help you complete your goal, so you stop? 
TRAVIS: What's your goal? 
MATT: "My master's been gone and I can't die." 
LAURA: Oh, who's your master? 
MATT: "So I just shit on him." And turns the head slowly over to FCG. (shrieks) 
SAM: (shrieks) No! 
ASHLEY: It's all right. Who's your master? 
LIAM: Who is your daddy? 
ASHLEY: Who's your daddy? 
TALIESIN: And what does he do? 
MATT: (laughs) And what does he do? 
LIAM: This is so weird. 
MATT: "It's been so long, I can't even remember. I once had a name, Gargo." 
MARISHA: Gargo? 
SAM: Gargo? 
LIAM: Gargo. 
TALIESIN: God, I'd be angry, too. 
MATT: "She called me Gargo." 
MARISHA, LAURA, and TALIESIN: She? 
LAURA: What if it's Delilah? (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh. What? 
LAURA: That would be fucking perfect. 
ASHLEY: What do you want me to say? 
SAM: I don't know! Gargo? 
ASHLEY: Gargo? Gargo? All right. We have very important stuff to do. This is not the time. This is really not the time. What's the matter? 
MATT: "Everything's the matter." (laughter) 
MATT: It's going to try and muscle out of your grasp. 
TRAVIS: No! 
MATT: Make a strength check. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. (laughs) A strength check? 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Six. 
MATT: (laughs) (screeches) 
SAM: (screams) 
MATT: Right towards you. 
SAM: (screaming intensifies) 
LIAM: Seedling Grasping Vine! (laughter) 
LIAM: Grasping Vine. 
ASHLEY: He said Gargo? 
MATT: Okay. Does a 15 hit you? 
SAM: No. 
MATT: Okay. It rockets another necrotic shit in your direction. But you just duck out of the way. 
TRAVIS: I come across and bodyguard dive. (laughter) 
MATT: That's going to be a 17 dexterity check. 
LIAM: Oh, it beats it. It beats it. 
MATT: Shoots by. (screeches) Flying up in the air. 
SAM: It's flying away? 
LAURA: (shouts) Turn Undead! 
MARISHA: Do it! Turn Undead! 
SAM: How do I do that? 
LIAM: You say, "I Turn undead." 
LAURA: Just say it! Destroy Undead! 
SAM: By the power of the Changebringer! I hold up my coin. I destroy you, evil! 
LIAM: Power of Change compels you. 
MATT: You're going to Turn or Destroy Undead? 
SAM: Destroy? I don't know. I've never used this thing before. 
LIAM: It's all one thing. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Turn / Destroy Undead. 
TRAVIS: Into the light, I command thee. 
MATT: Is it a wisdom save? 
SAM: It is-- I've never done this before. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It's under Features and Traits. Class feature. 
SAM: Turn Undead. "30 feet of you, wisdom saving throw." I must. Oh, "each undead that can see you--" 
LIAM: No, it needs to save. 
SAM: -- "must make a wisdom saving throw." 
MATT: All right, that is going to be-- 
LIAM: Its challenge rating dictates if it's turned or destroyed. 
LAURA: Are you undead? 
MATT: Right. It's a six. It rolled a six. 
SAM: So it failed. 
MATT: It failed. 
MARISHA: I have to do it too, don't I? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (gasp) 
MARISHA: I forgot about that. 
SAM: Oh shit, am I going to kill you? 
LIAM: Your challenge rating is high. 
LAURA: You're officially undead? I didn't know if you were like a special sort of-- 
MATT: All things that affect undead-- 
MARISHA: All things that affect undead, affect me. 
MATT: -- affect her. 
SAM: Am I going to kill Laudna right now? 
TRAVIS: I'm sure it's going to be fine. 
LIAM: Her challenge rating is way higher. 
TRAVIS: You're going to be fine. 
MARISHA: Saving throw, right? 
MATT: Yeah, wisdom save. 
LIAM: She might run away. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Give us a one. 
MARISHA: It's bad. My wisdom is high, though. 15. 
TRAVIS: You needed a 16. 
MATT: Is your spell DC a 16? 
SAM: Where is it? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what? 
MATT: What's your spell DC? 
SAM: It's a 15. 
MATT: Is it 15? 
LIAM: Meets it beats it. 
MATT: So you just succeed. 
MARISHA: Meets it beats it. 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Oh! 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: Meets it beats it, meaning I beat her? 
LAURA and TALIESIN: No, no, no, no. 
TALIESIN: She beat you. 
SAM: She beats me? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Or else she would've been dead? 
TRAVIS: No. 
LIAM and TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: No. She is higher than mo... Okay, I guess, what-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What happened? 
LIAM: You just have to try it every day until it works. 
TRAVIS: Such a casual dice roll. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Fuck you, bird! (explosion) (laughter) 
MATT: Just fucking Thanos snapped her accidentally. 
TRAVIS: Begone, evil! (poofs) 
TALIESIN: Oh no, not that one! 
TRAVIS: (screams) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! 
MARISHA: The personification of your guilt continues! 
MATT: So, for Destroy Undead, the CR1 is currently the boundary on it. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: The bird swoops in as you... Describe to me how your Destroy Undead apparates. How does it come into being? 
SAM: Oh. I would probably flip the coin and its spinning through the air would cause a whirlwind of pure divine light that would envelop and wrap the thing. 
MATT: Okay. As the light filters in, it swoops towards you, right as it lowers into its path. As it hits, (impactful boof) There's a flash of white light and a burst of black oily feathers. And that's all that's left. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (gasp) 
TALIESIN: Well, that's done. Cool. 
LAURA: Gargo. You'll be missed. 
MARISHA: You did it! 
SAM: Wait, it's gone? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You did it, FCG. 
LAURA: You destroyed Shithead. 
TRAVIS: You vanquished your nemesis. 
ASHLEY: Gargo. 
SAM: Wow. 
MARISHA: You overcome. 
LIAM: Gargone. 
ASHLEY: Gargone? 
LAURA: You overcomed. 
MARISHA: You overcomed. (laughter) 
SAM: Are you okay? 
MARISHA: I'm a little woozy. 
SAM: I'm so sorry. 
MARISHA: No, it's good. It's good to-- 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: What's wrong with you? I overcomed. (laughter) 
SAM: This is a sign. This is a sign from the heavens. I've reconnected with Dancer. 
MATT: (Dancer) "More or less, I guess." 
SAM: And the personification of my guilt is gone forever. 
ASHLEY: You destroyed it. 
MATT: "Because you killed a shitty bird." 
SAM: No, because-- because I'm with you again. And because I'm truly, truly sorry for everything that I've done to you. 
MATT: "Well, good for you. Good for you." 
SAM: I'll take it. 
MATT: Keyleth is like, "You're all very strange, and this is fun." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Enthusiastic. 
MATT: "It's been a little while since I've been amongst this much chaos, and I miss it." 
LAURA: Well, you're welcome, anytime. 
TALIESIN: This was like a seven or eight, I think, really on the scale. 
TRAVIS: How do you feel? I mean, this is huge. 
SAM: I feel free. 
ASHLEY: You do? 
MARISHA: Good. 
SAM: I don't have to worry about birds anymore. 
ASHLEY: You don't feel a missing void? 
SAM: What? 
TALIESIN: That takes weeks to kick in. Now, come on. Let him have some peace. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay. 
TALIESIN: Nothing. 
LIAM: The remains aren't moving or doing anything? 
MATT: There are no remains but feathers. 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: Can I take a couple feathers? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: They're a little oily to the touch, but they're there. 
LAURA: Eh. 
SAM: I'll just put them in my backpack. Sorry about that, Dancer. 
LAURA: Do you want to leave the bird shit on your head-- 
MATT: "It's all right." 
LAURA: -- or do you want it cleaned off? 
SAM: I think I'll wear it for a while. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: As a victory symbol. 
MARISHA: Badge. 
SAM: Or badge of honor. 
MARISHA: Courage. 
TRAVIS: Like a Budokai? 
MATT: It's almost like a-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: I know what you're talking about. 
MATT: It's almost like a partially melted Phantom of the Opera mask. (laughter) 
SAM: So, to the tree then? 
LAURA: To the tree. 
MATT: (Keyleth) "To the tree." 
TRAVIS: We're just trying to get to the fucking tree. (laughter) 
MATT: Stepping onto the outside of the grounds, one of the various guards of the city approaches and goes, "Halt." You see this big orc gentleman. 
TRAVIS: (screeches) What? 
MATT: It's like, "This is for students only. It is too early to come through here." Keyleth just-- 
ASHLEY: I am a professor, so please let us by. 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: This is the one. 
SAM: Didn't you have credentials or something? 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LIAM: Going to have to call that devil. 
LAURA: Oh. (laughs) 
SAM: This is not going to work. 
LIAM: Four. 
ASHLEY: Okay. And where is it? 11. 
MATT: 11. 
ASHLEY: 11. 
MATT: "Right, certainly. No, I will ask you to turn around, or I would call the authorities to come and arrest you." 
MARISHA: All right. No, it's fine. Can you just point us where a big fatty, beefy tree is? 
SAM: A big thick boy. 
MARISHA: A thick boy. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Someone at least. 
MATT: Points to a pretty thick tree. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Thank you! 
ASHLEY: Thank you so much. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: That's actually all we wanted. 
MATT: "You're just looking for a tree?" 
LAURA: Just needed a tree. 
TALIESIN: That's all we needed is a fucking tree. 
LAURA: Big, fat tree in there, but we can-- 
MATT: Puts his hand on the hilt of his weapon and goes like, "I'll be watching you. For whatever your tree business is." 
TALIESIN: Hey. I'm going to remember you. I'm going to remember you. 
MATT: Good long look. "Okay." 
LAURA: I saw a real connection there. 
MATT: Make an intimidation check. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh, there we are. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I'm gonna remember you ♪ 
TALIESIN: That's a-- 
SAM: ♪ ("I Will Remember You") ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ You will remember ♪ 
TALIESIN: 26. 
MATT: 26. He goes, "Well, um, I--" 
TALIESIN: As you were, I have a list. 
MATT: "My name is Stanley." 
TALIESIN: Don't need it. Know your face. Yeah. 
MATT: Just trying to change his face a bit. 
LIAM: All right, it's Thicc:30. Let's go. 
TRAVIS: To the tree! 
MATT: You waltz up to the side of the tree. Keyleth goes, "Okay. Bassuras, everyone, pile up quickly. This goes quick, if you recall." Closes her eyes. She raises her hands and curls in, pulls her arms apart. The tree tears open and the guard goes, "What the?" 
MARISHA: Unsettling Presence. 
MATT: "(gasps)" (laughter) 
MATT: Oh, he doesn't make a save immediately, just the next save. 
MARISHA: Yes. He's just fucked up. He has disadvantage on his next saving throw. He's like, "(scared noises)" (Keyleth) "Okay. Quickly, please." 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: I go in last. You fucked with the professor. Don't think we don't know! As I go through the tree. (laughter) 
MATT: The tree closes. You all-- 
ASHLEY: Heard that. 
MATT: You all step out-- 
TALIESIN: Got to reestablish. 
MATT: -- and emerge same early morning here deep in the streets. Not far from the Carmine Curtain on some side of the city. You can see the various burning torches and braziers that keep the city thriving and living all through the night. You can see the smokestacks rising up under the sky, underlit by the city's warm torch glow. You can hear the sounds of shouts and the revving of crawlers, some point off in the city beyond the wall, or possibly within. It's been a bit since you've been to Bassuras, but the fact that it's awake at this point in the morning doesn't surprise you. For those who've been here for a while, it's always a place to find trouble. 
LAURA: We're really close to the... 
TRAVIS: Fort? 
LAURA: Yeah. This is close to ground zero. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: On top of that, too, everything has the faintest of a red hue to it as the perpetually flaring Ruidus that is glaring in the sky above casts its cursed light down upon the Hellcatch Valley. And that's when we'll go ahead and finish tonight's episode. 
ASHLEY: (groans) Oh, ooh! 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MATT: Pick up at Bassuras next episode. 
TALIESIN: I'm ready. 
MARISHA: That was a crazy-ass episode. 
ASHLEY: That was. 
TRAVIS: Shithead tattoo incoming. 
SAM: Going to get a Shithead tattoo. Yep. We're going to put that right on my body. 
MARISHA: High octane. 
SAM: High octane bird action. 
TALIESIN: Literally a tank that we opened up earlier tonight. Really-- 
MATT: Destroy Undead, one of the few things that could end its suffering. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Because of the enchantment on it, it just can't die, so it just fucking, it just hates the world. 
LAURA: Oh, Gargo. 
TALIESIN: At what level do you get the destroying thing? 
LAURA: Gargo. 
SAM: Find out the lore. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. What level do you get Destroy Undead level one at? This is a great power to have. You use it only a little, but it's like really-- 
SAM: Turn Undead. 
LIAM: Maybe you could Legend Lore some of them feathers. 
TALIESIN: That's true. 
SAM: Destroy Undead. 
TRAVIS: Start running when you use it. 
MATT: That's what that spell's for. 
SAM: For cleric level eight, I get Destroy Undead of CR1 or lower. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: So yeah, this is pretty recent. That's nice. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: You get it at a lower level, but I think it's like CR of a half. 
LAURA: It's a Turn Undead instead of... Yeah. 
LIAM: Right. It levels up. 
MATT: But-- 
TALIESIN: It's a good tool to have. 
LIAM: Level up. 
MATT: It is. That's how it works out. Well, that was fun and weird. 
LAURA: Woo. 
SAM: Yeah, it was. 
MATT: You got Dancer and Keyleth in tow in the middle of Bassuras in the Hellcatch. I'm curious to see what comes up next. But thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. 
TRAVIS: (howls)
