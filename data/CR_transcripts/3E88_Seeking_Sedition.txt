TRAVIS: Yay! 
MATT: Happy nine years, y'all. 
TRAVIS: Yay! 
MATT: This is crazy. 
ASHLEY: Yay! 
MATT: It should never have gotten this long, and it won't. I'm shutting it down now. (shouts of protest) 
MATT: No, this is wild. For all you newer kids fallen into our sphere, thanks for being here in our chaos. Those who've been here for a long time, or since the beginning, let us rub our aching knees together in friendship. (laughter)

ASHLEY: What's going on in there? (laughter) 
SAM: -- on dynamic animated versions of Czepeku battle maps. 
MATT: Dungeon delving. 
SAM: So, do you all like maps? (groans of disgust) 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
ASHLEY: Whoa, what is that?! 
MATT: What in the hell is that? 
TRAVIS: Smells like the inside of a cast! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Ugh! 
SAM: Okay, but do you like Czepeku's maps? 
LAURA: (gasp of delight) 
ASHLEY: Oh wow, that's amazing. (murmurs of approval) 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Those are actually much better. 
MARISHA: Smells nicer. 
TRAVIS: Smells not like that. 
SAM: Join the community. Go to Czepeku.com/CriticalRole. Join the Patreon and get 4,000 plus battle maps for just $5. Matt, map to you. Pap to you.

MATT: (Irish accent) Hi there, pap to you, sir. (laughter) 
MATT: Thank you, Sam. 
SAM: Sure. 
LAURA: This string looks 3D! 
MATT: Thank you and I'm so sorry, Czepeku. So folks, the Daggerheart open beta play test is live now! (cheering) 
MATT: It is open! 
TRAVIS: Holy shit! It's happening! 
ASHLEY: Huzzah! 
MATT: We've had a blast play testing it ourselves over the past few years in all of its iterations up until now. We can't wait for you all to finally give it a try. Please, dive in, tear it apart, break the game. Tell us what works, tell us what doesn't. Whatever you love about the game, the things you'd like to see adjusted, the things that work really well, the things that you're like, it's so close. Let us know! That's the fun part about this process is we all get to make it the best game it can possibly be together. Your feedback is truly invaluable and the more people who play the game, the better we can make it for all of us. So to help get you started, we've uploaded a ton of new content on our YouTube channel, including a quick 101 on the system of Daggerheart, a session zero to show you how to set up a campaign, and a character creation video to show you the process of creating your new character. 
SAM: It's so fun! 
MATT: We also played a live one-shot of Daggerheart earlier this week and you can watch it on the VOD right now to see how an actual game of it flows. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: You, yourself, you, I'm talking to you, can join the open beta play test at Daggerheart.com now. Go do it. Go, go play, go play. 
TRAVIS: Go do it! 
MATT: I mean, after the show, after the episode. 
TRAVIS: Go do it now! 
MATT: Put it in your tabs. (laughter) 
MATT: Laura, you're up next. 
LAURA: Hi! Guess what? 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Hi. 
LAURA: We have merchandise. 
ASHLEY: Woo-hoo! 
LAURA: This time it's in celebration of our anniversary. We decided to make some nice core CR stuff. 
ASHLEY: Yes! I love it. I love it! 
LIAM: Oh! 
SAM: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: I love it so much! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: You can certainly try. 
MATT: That's actually really cool. 
ASHLEY: So good! 
MARISHA: Have a-- 
LAURA: With our logo on the back. I'm a huge fan of our other tie dye hoodie that we made, so we wanted to make another one because there's like-- 
ASHLEY: This is-- (chef's kiss) 
MARISHA: Perfect. 
LAURA: I kind of live in my other one, so, yeah. Then in addition to that, you may have seen it sneak peaked on our shop already, but-- 
SAM and TALIESIN: Ooh! 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ooh! 
LAURA: Our dad hat. 
ASHLEY: Such a good dad hat. 
SAM: We haven't had a hat in a long time. 
LAURA: I know. So it's amazing. 
ASHLEY: Look at the strings. The strings are tie-dyed! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Maybe they are on the other one too. 
LAURA: it says: How do you want to do it-- 
MATT: We have the technology. 
LAURA: -- do this, how do you want to do this-- 
ASHLEY: Herdy-derdy. 
LAURA: -- on the back. So yeah, our artist is Chris Gladis, designed the calligraphy of "How do you want to do this" on the back of this hat. 
MATT: Woo! 
LAURA: Which has been designed for forever, so there you go. 
SAM: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Hey! 
LAURA: Then, in addition to that, our pals at Youtooz-- (laughter) 
LAURA: -- created four adorable plushies from Mighty Nein. Jester and Caleb are joined by fluffy pal Sprinkle! 
ASHLEY: Hey! 
MATT: Oh my goodness! 
ASHLEY: (as Sprinkle) Kill me! 
LAURA: Frumpkin! 
MATT: Oh my, they're so freaking cute! 
LAURA: Look at how cute! 
LIAM: (purring) 
LAURA: This is before we killed him-- 
MARISHA: Does he have magical freckles? 
LIAM: Of course! 
LAURA: -- 1,000 times. 
MARISHA: It's so cute! 
LIAM: It's Fey sprinkles. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, they're like little constellations. 
LAURA: Yeah, a little magicalness on there. 
ASHLEY: Look at this little softie puff! 
MATT: I love how the eyes on Frumpkin, they glow against the of the fur. That's so cool. 
TALIESIN: They're very shiny. 
LAURA: Anyway, you can pre-order yours now at Youtooz.com. ♪ (triumphant fanfare) ♪ 
MATT: That's so cute. 
SAM: So cute. 
MATT: Now we got all the little animals in a room now. 
LIAM: (Frumpkin chittering) 
TALIESIN: That's very nice. 
ASHLEY: Find your D&D therapy plushie. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That's the way to do it. 
TALIESIN: More pets. 
LIAM: Hi, buddy.

Part I[]
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: And welcome back. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
MATT: Last we left off, (laughs) Bells Hells, after arriving on Ruidus and sneaking, sometimes successfully, sometimes not so much, across the surface, amongst a few way points of civilization here on the surface of the red Moon of Ill Omen, you eventually came to the city of Kreviris, or what you've come to know as Caeluma Kreviris, the top-facing surface city, which seems to be at various levels of destitution and militaristic presence. A number of these thin, spire-like towers protrude from the top for viewing vantage points across the upper region of it, called The Banners. There's the main focus of the city that is referred to as The Clutch. That's where the majority of the populous that live here do so. Then there's also The Crumble, which is the series of crevices and cracks where a number of ruins and fallen elements vanish within, and you've been told that's the more dangerous region here of Caeluma Kreviris. But in search of the Volition, the resistance against the Kreviris Imperium that holds sway over the entirety of this red moon and is currently one of the two major driving forces to releasing Predathos, the god eater. You managed to get into a small scuffle in a street-- 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: -- but managed to cover your tracks rather rapidly. You then, through some information that you had gathered from some locals and some keen eyes, found your way to the Jagged Edge Glassworks. This is a glass smith building. You've seen this strange bluish-green glass that's been pushing its way through, or existed in veins throughout elements of the rock here. You can see now upon coming here, and you've seen a few examples of tools and weapons that use this glass, as well as parts of the housing structures. It's one of the main materials between bone, leathers and other fungal-type materials that have been dried and stretched into a cloth fabrication. There you met with Zhesh, Zhesh and Jidoh, looks to be the true purveyor of the establishment, who then stepped out to leave Zhesh some time to speak with you. You convinced them that you are no ally to the Vanguard, though you wear their colors, and that your intent was to find information in hopes of eventually helping the Volition. Zhesh wasn't forthcoming with them being a member necessarily, but an ally who occasionally helps out the Volition, and gave you some information as to where to locate where their current pass house haven might be, to search upon some of the highest spires, recommending the Overspoke, to look for the darkest of deep-blue coloration as a marker as to where the entrance would be. You went to take a rest in the subterranean basement of the Jagged Edge, and towards the end of this rest, you began to hear footsteps above, and were told to keep quiet as the entryway to this basement was closed. Laudna, you cast a sphere of Darkness within to plunge it into a void-like absence of light, and you all sit there in the quiet listening. 
MARISHA: Let's hope this was a good idea. 
MATT: So, here beneath, you hear the footsteps, a bit of silence, and you hear a voice poke out, like it's halfway through a conversation. "Yeah, we've come to collect something." Then no more conversation. It's odd, you begin to realize this is a group of conversing individuals, but only some of them telepathically communicating. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: You're catching bits and pieces of information. Another one goes, "Around here somewhere. We got to make good. Right vengeance if we're losing them." 
MATT: Another one says-- 
LAURA: I know we can talk to each other, right? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Because we're mentally connected. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: The voice, again, creeps in later, "Three, three of us dead." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: "Someone's got to pay." 
LAURA: Ruh-roh. 
SAM: Uh-oh, that's us. 
MARISHA: They know. 
MATT: Silence. 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
MATT: What are you all doing? 
SAM: (panicked breathing) 
TRAVIS: You can't hear them, or the hear the thoughts, or--? It doesn't work like that, right? 
LAURA: Not really. I mean, I could open-- No, unless they're directing the thoughts at you, you can't hear what they're saying. 
SAM: You can cast Detect-- 
LAURA: Detect Thoughts. 
SAM: I can cast Detect Thoughts. 
LAURA: But you won't hear-- 
TRAVIS: Try to see them or anything? 
LAURA: -- the conversation, you'll just hear-- 
LIAM: Can I tell roughly how many are walking above us? 
LAURA: -- what they're thinking. 
TRAVIS: But they're thinking the conversation, right? 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
LIAM: So I'm normally at advantage, but I'm in the dark-- 
LAURA: You would think. It doesn't work that way. 
LIAM: -- so straight roll? 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: This is just listening. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: You won't be able to see. I say this is a straight roll because you're just hearing. Actually, in darkness, you're able to focus, so I'd say it's a straight roll. 
LIAM: Okay. That's good, It's 25. 
MATT: 25. You hear six sets of footsteps. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: And this odd-- 
TRAVIS: Six? 
MATT: -- kind of like a low growl. It's almost cute, almost like a (soft growls). 
LIAM: New sound to me. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: It sounds weirdly familiar. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: A cytaa. 
LIAM: Okay, so-- 
MARISHA: Wait. 
TRAVIS: Maybe they have their own little-- 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Did Chu rat us out? 
SAM: That fucker. 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I know. 
TRAVIS: So fast, dude! 
LAURA: No, I bet it-- 
TRAVIS: We don't even-- We don't know! 
LAURA: It's way too far away. Chu didn't rat us out. If anybody ratted us out, it's that guy up in the tower that we didn't talk to after he saw us. 
MARISHA: No, Pâté talked to him-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Pate threatened the fuck out of him. 
MARISHA: Yes, he threatened him. He did such a good job. 
LAURA: Then we left. 
TRAVIS: Pâté. 
LIAM: Also, somebody could've tailed us from the street. It's possible. 
TALIESIN: This may not even be about us entirely, they might just be here because this is where you go to broker a conversation. 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I think they want a patsy. 
TRAVIS: Can I try and stand on my tiptoes and (sniffs) smell any whiffs of the occupants that might be on the floor above. 
MATT: Sure, yeah. Go ahead and roll with advantage for using your keen scent and hearing. 
TRAVIS: Just in case there's something new. 20-- Or I'm sorry, 16. 
MATT: 16, okay. I mean, the interior of the chamber upstairs is filled with all manner of burned and burning materials. The forges up there that melt and bend the glass and the materials they use in here, it clouds the atmosphere with a lot of chemical scents and things that blanket the majority of what you're looking for. But you do catch up what are now becoming more familiar to you, the smell of Reilora, a handful, and something else. Once again, it's slightly familiar, but you're not quite sure where you've smelled it before. 
SAM: Matt-- 
TRAVIS: Got a new bogey. 
SAM: (laughs) -- we're in complete darkness, right? 
MATT: Yes, you are. 
SAM: So I'm going to go around and touch my friends. 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
SAM: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Sorry? 
SAM: With consent. 
TRAVIS: Oh. (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) Just to make sure I know where everybody is. I'm also going to Sympathetically Bond myself to Ashton, Orym, Chetney, and Laudna. 
TRAVIS: You're moving around extremely quietly. 
SAM: Extremely, yeah. Well, I oil myself. I oil. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. You're lubricated? 
SAM: I lube. (laughter) 
SAM: I use lube. 
LAURA: Yeah, you do. We've heard you doing it. 
MATT: It's about here that you hear out of the silence upstairs that voice ring out again and be like, "I agree. Maybe we go ahead and have a look around." 
SAM: Oh jesus. 
TRAVIS: Fucking shit. 
MATT: "Just in case." 
SAM: What do we do if they come down here? 
ASHLEY: What do we do if they come-- 
MATT: You hear some of the footsteps begin to separate, and you begin to hear a new sound that you didn't recognize before, almost like a grinding or something sifting, like a (gritty slithering). 
TRAVIS: Like a slithering? 
MATT: Possibly. 
SAM: Or maybe they're using a rain stick? 
MATT: Maybe. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
LAURA: Maybe-- 
MATT: They're real popular here on Ruidus. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Maybe they're looking for holes in the floor. 
LIAM: Could be. 
LAURA: Spreading sand on the ground. 
SAM: Oh yeah, shit. 
TRAVIS: Does it rain on the moon? 
SAM: That's smart. Hey, just so I know how magical darkness works. 
TRAVIS: That is smart. 
SAM: If we're inside the magical darkness bubble and they open a door, we can't see them. 
MATT: Nope. 
SAM: Shit. 
LAURA: We can't see them. We could hear if the-- 
SAM: They can't see us. 
ASHLEY: They can't see us though as well. 
TRAVIS: They see impermeable darkness, though. 
MARISHA: I can see through-- 
TRAVIS: Which is weird. 
MARISHA: -- magical darkness. 
MATT: You're the only one who can, yeah. 
SAM: Whoa. 
LAURA: Great, so Laudna-- 
ASHLEY: So cool. 
LAURA: -- is like (ghastly hiss) at the bottom of the stairs looking up at them. 
LIAM: But they can't see her. 
LAURA: No, they can't see her, but-- 
MARISHA: They wouldn't see it, yes. 
LAURA: -- she'll see them. 
MATT: It is the Travis nightmare. 
MARISHA: Definitely, I look like a night terror. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: I look sleep paralysis demon. 
TRAVIS: Stop calling it into existence. 
LAURA: He just cuts to people-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: For some reason, I envision it as one of those night-vision cameras. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MATT: Just the eyes. 
TRAVIS: I can't do any range stuff, I can't do anything that's triggered by the space. Do we have anything that we would want to put underneath the trapdoor? 
MARISHA: I know, I was thinking that, too. 
TRAVIS: That they would walk into? I don't have any of that stuff. 
SAM: Oh my god. (sighs) Everything is like-- 
TALIESIN: If they-- 
LIAM: What about the hole? 
MARISHA: I know, I was thinking that-- 
TALIESIN: It won't fit. 
LAURA: If we got in the hole? 
MARISHA: They fall in the hole. 
LAURA: Oh, but the hole up there? They have to be sitting on something. 
LIAM: What if we stand around the hole and let them jump down in. 
SAM: How will we even know? 
MARISHA: Then we can-- So wait, do you think we can press it up against the ceiling flat? 
TALIESIN: Absolutely not. 
LAURA: You think the hole would fit on the ground in here? 
SAM: How would we even know if it does? 
LAURA: But even if they-- Well if we put it on the ground, if they come down the stairs, they just fall right into the hole. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Then the people outside of the hole wouldn't be able to hear that they fell in the hole because it traps the sound inside. 
MARISHA: Then we fold them up, and then we let them suffocate. 
LIAM: That will take-- 
MARISHA: Then we add more bodies to our body count. 
LIAM: -- X amount of enemies out of the picture right away. Even if they don't all go in, that is two less three less. 
LAURA: Let's see if we can open the hole down here. 
TALIESIN: If I recall, we can't open the hole down here. 
MARISHA: Yeah, do you-- 
TRAVIS: I think we asked that. 
MARISHA: I think we did. 
LAURA: Oh, we couldn't fit it? 
MARISHA: Can we fit the hole down here? 
MATT: The space in here, I mean, you can certainly try. 
TRAVIS: Hey, hold it up, hold it up! 
MARISHA: First shout-out. 
LIAM: Gotta try. 
LAURA: Where'd I put it? 
SAM: I don't know. (laughter) 
LAURA: I don't either. 
TRAVIS: You're not sitting on the merch? 
MATT: That wasn't intentional. 
TRAVIS: You're supposed to sit on all the merch. (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's how we make our money! 
LAURA: Oh, you stole it, you stole it. 
ASHLEY: I forgot it was over here. 
MATT: Here's what I'll say. It requires a fairly flat surface to roll it out for it to become the hole that's there. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: There is enough room here, but a lot of the edges of it right now are occupied by supply crates and things around it. 
TRAVIS: No, no. 
MATT: So you can do it, but you have to move a few things to make the space. 
TRAVIS: No, fuck that, we're not rolling for that. 
MARISHA: That would be so loud. 
TRAVIS: Negative. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we'd be so loud. 
TRAVIS: Negative. 
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what-- 
MATT: I mean, it's possible. I'm just saying. 
SAM: Yeah, we could-- 
TRAVIS: Unless we have silence. 
TALIESIN: Guide me to the stairs-- 
MARISHA: You look really good. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you look really good today. 
TALIESIN: You look great, too. 
TRAVIS: You can see Matthew going-- 
TALIESIN: Guide me to-- Where was I? I can't actually see you, I assume you look good. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Do it with your eyes closed. 
ASHLEY: Your eyes closed. 
TALIESIN: Guide me to the stairs. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I love that. We can-- 
MARISHA: You feel Laudna's breath on you because I'm covering too close. 
TALIESIN: That's-- 
MARISHA: (breaths heavily) 
TALIESIN: I know who you are. 
MATT: It's really cold. 
SAM: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: Cold? 
TALIESIN: Ugh. Oh, that's like one of the cheap vaporizer. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Hmm. I can lock the hammer between two of the steps, so if they come down, they'll trip. 
SAM: Ooh, that's cool. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's cool, 
ASHLEY: Good idea. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
ASHLEY: Very good idea. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to give you a little-- 
LAURA: If they trip, do we-- 
SAM: -- blessing of a d6 to use. 
LAURA: -- let them hang out down here? What do we do if they trip? 
LIAM: Well, if they-- 
MARISHA: Maybe they'll break their necks and it's just a terrible accident. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: If they come down here at all, we have to wrap this up like we thought we did on the street. Nobody leaves. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LIAM: We got to keep it contained. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
TALIESIN: We drag them in, we finish it, no one leaves. 
SAM: But no one's-- 
TALIESIN: Maybe they'll look and then they'll away. 
SAM: We're not going to kill anyone though, right? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: I mean, we're the good guys here. 
TRAVIS: Never have, not yet. 
SAM: We'll just talk to them and convince them-- 
LAURA: We don't kill people. 
TALIESIN: We power them down. 
SAM: All right. 
ASHLEY: That's a good way to put it. 
SAM: Put them in sleep mode. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
ASHLEY: That's really good. 
TALIESIN: For a very long time. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can't search for exits, there's nothing we can cast. 
ASHLEY: Well, well. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
ASHLEY: So I've been thinking I could try something. It feels like a very high-level situation for something like this, but I feel like I can make something look different. 
LAURA: (gasps) So you can make it look like the room is empty? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think I can. 
SAM: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: I think I can try to project something to make it look like this is a completely empty hole. 
LAURA: Amazing. 
SAM: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: Even with the darkness? 
LAURA: Well, should we drop the darkness-- 
SAM: We have to drop the darkness. 
ASHLEY: Oh shit. 
LAURA: -- and do that? 
MARISHA: Well, I can drop the darkness. 
TRAVIS: I mean, if you cast it above the darkness. 
MARISHA: That too. 
LAURA: Oh, that too. 
ASHLEY: It's an option. 
SAM: So you have darkness-- 
ASHLEY: It's an option. 
SAM: -- illusion, and hole. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs) Yes, yes. (laughter) 
SAM: And a tripwire. 
TALIESIN: No more bullshit, just go for it. 
LAURA: The darkness is stuck down in the hole, right? It doesn't go up above the hole at all, right? 
TRAVIS: Ashley, what is it? 
MATT: No, it's about 10 feet from the floor to the ceiling. 
ASHLEY: Hallucinatory Terrain. So creating the darkness in the bottom, it fills the entirety of the basement, so it doesn't go beyond it. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
SAM: I feel like that's worth dropping. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
MARISHA: Well, she said you can layer it-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- theoretically. 
ASHLEY: So if they look in-- 
MARISHA: Then even if they try to go down-- 
ASHLEY: -- it just looks dark? 
MATT: You would assume, yeah. What are you trying to cast? 
ASHLEY: Hallucinatory Terrain. 
MATT: Ah. 
SAM: (sultry) Hallucinatory Terrain. 
TALIESIN: Go on. 
SAM: By Czepeku. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (whispers) Czepeku. 
TRAVIS: (whispers) Czepeku. 
LAURA: Does that work? 
MATT: I mean, the only downside is it takes 10 minutes to cast. 
SAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Nevermind. 
LAURA: Aw, bummer. 
ASHLEY: Poo. 
MATT: So if you can distract them for a while. 
ASHLEY: That's why it says 10 minutes for cast time. (laughter) 
MATT: However, that is an extremely useful spell for situations-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Just like this. 
MATT: -- at other times. So good to keep in mind. 
ASHLEY: Okay. We'll keep it in mind. 
MARISHA: Well, let's see what happens. I can maybe just-- 
LAURA: Let's do that trip thing though, that's great. 
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do the trip thing. 
TALIESIN: I'm putting it right below the shadow-- 
ASHLEY: Yes, love that. 
TALIESIN: -- so that it's not visible. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: They might not even look in. 
LAURA: They might not look in, and if they do trip, he might just go: Ow, I tripped, it's dark, and then go straight back up. 
ASHLEY: Then leave. Yeah. 
MATT: You hear some things shifting (clattering) up above. They're moving furniture. (discordant creaking and grinding) 
TRAVIS: Should we all start whispering horribly so that if they look down into the darkness, they just hear? (demonic whispers) 
MARISHA: Well, to be fair, that it was part of my plan C. Yes. 
TRAVIS: Okay, we'll keep it as the C, okay. 
MARISHA: Yes. Yeah, we'll see. Yes. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We're good. 
MATT: You hear the footsteps scattering around a little bit. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: Then one of them comes to the side door, not far from here. You hear that voice from earlier like, "What's in here? Then open it!" You hear the, (unlatching) (creaking hinge) the door open and the footstep (thuds) above. Behind it: (gritty slithering) 
TRAVIS: It sounds like slithering, I think. 
LAURA: Can you see what's happening? 
MARISHA: I don't think they've opened the chamber yet, the hatch. 
TRAVIS: No, that was a side door. 
MATT: Not the hatch. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But you can now hear the steps above you. 
LIAM: It's coming. 
ASHLEY: What is that noise? What is that noise? 
MATT: (thuds) 
LIAM: They're in. 
TALIESIN: Everyone against the wall. 
MARISHA: Please don't find us. 
MATT: "Psst." You hear all the other footsteps beginning to, (thuds) except for-- 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
MATT: You clocked five sets of footsteps. 
MARISHA: My heart's starting to race. 
MATT: You hear three approaching from the one that was here and that other odd sound that followed it. So there's one unaccounted for that seems to be remaining in the other room-- 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
MATT: -- because your perception's fucking high, you would know that. 
SAM: Anyone want to prepare any spells, or--? 
LIAM: I'm calling that out, I'm like: One in the antechamber, five above. 
LAURA: What if I can make it sound like there's rats down here? 
SAM: Sure. 
LIAM: (squeaks) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's great. 
LAURA: Maybe I'll just, yeah, if they open the hatch, I'll make it sound like there's rats down here. 
ASHLEY: What if they're friendly for some reason? 
TALIESIN: Somehow. 
MATT: That's really good and really cute. 
LAURA: That is a really cute little rat. 
LIAM: (squeaks) (laughter) 
MATT: We spent a lot of time alone as children. (laughter) 
LIAM: True. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: My poor older sister, "Shut. Up!" (laughter) 
MATT: So what's the plan? 
TRAVIS: I think we're sitting tight. 
MARISHA: Sitting and seeing what happens? 
TALIESIN: Backing up against the wall. 
MARISHA: I got a few things ready. 
LIAM: We're all ready to rumble. 
MARISHA: Just in case. 
MATT: Okay, just in case, let me set up a little visual so we know at least where everyone's set up. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
LAURA: Could you put the hammer through a latch on the thing so they can't get the latch open? 
SAM: This, just in case, is brought to you by WizKids Minis. Bells Hells plush are now available, Fresh Cut Grass, Ashton Greymoore, Fearne Calloway are ready to join your couch party. Order your plush friends today, Bells Hells plush at wizkids.io/bellshellsplush. That is a small space. 
LAURA: It is a teeny-weeny little. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's way too small. 
LIAM: Matt, do we remember, when we came down, if the thing opens? 
MATT: You could put the hole here if you wanted to, but you have to move things out of the way to do it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's too loud. 
MATT: Whereabouts are you guys all arranged? 
LAURA: I don't know, against a wall. 
TALIESIN: I'm practically underneath the stairs because that's where I'm-- 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm under the shadow. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, Matt, did the hatch door open upward or did it open down? 
MATT: It opened upward. 
TRAVIS: Was there a latch or a handle on the underside? 
MARISHA: To where that we could slide the immovable rod to keep it? 
TRAVIS: If you wanted to (sliding, thudding) 
LAURA: Put it through something? 
LIAM: Right, do we remember? 
MATT: Oh, no, there would be, because, I mean, besides pushing it up, there's also a latch internally. 
LAURA: So we can slide the hammer through the latch. 
MATT: You could. 
LAURA: It might make some noise. 
LAURA: Yeah, but then, they're going to be like, "Open it." 
LAURA: Yeah, "Why won't it open?" 
ASHLEY: "Why isn't this opening?" 
TRAVIS: Yeah, for sure, I mean, you could just make it one more obstacle. 
ASHLEY: Obstacle, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Then they open it and it's just dark as hell. 
MARISHA: I've got my immovable rod. 
LIAM: Orym will go across from Ash, and then crouch, like Daredevil, waiting for this to start. 
MARISHA: So leave your hammer. I'll go up and-- 
MATT: Okay, were are you at? 
LIAM: Across from Ash on the other side of the ladder. 
TALIESIN: Also, if you're spidering-- 
MATT: This little ladder? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
LAURA: Oh my god, you can hang from the ceiling. 
TALIESIN: -- be prepared to get up on the roof. 
MARISHA: They open the latch and I'm on the hatch. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Ah! 
ASHLEY: (gasps) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Like a fucking Jack-in-a-box. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Yep. (laughs) All righty. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: How about the rest of you? 
TALIESIN: Then rush out to get the rest of them? 
SAM: Anywhere, Matt, anywhere. 
LAURA: Yeah, against a wall somewhere, Matt. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, against a wall, against a wall. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Can't see anything, anyway. Probably just be holding onto a wall for-- 
MATT: Just feeling your way against the edges. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: I have hopped up on a box-- 
MARISHA: I can't see. 
TRAVIS: -- because I'm tiny. 
MARISHA: So Matt, I climbed up and I'm going to take my immovable rod and latch it through the handle on this side. 
MATT: Okay, so you're up at the top essentially? 
MARISHA: Yeah, very-- 
MATT: Spider-climbing along? 
MARISHA: Very quietly. 
MATT: Okay. Now make a stealth check for me, if you don't mind. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
LIAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Do we have Pass Without a Trace, Ashley? 
ASHLEY: Yes, we do! Pass Without a Trace. 
MATT: Wait, you're casting it now? 
ASHLEY: Oh wait. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MARISHA: I have advantage. 
MATT: I'm saying does it have verbal as a-- 
MARISHA: I have advantage on this. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You're good. 
MATT: Pass Without a Trace-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: -- requires verbal, somatic, and material components, so you have to mutter an incantation. What you can do-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know. 
MATT: I need you to make a-- 
ASHLEY: It feels so counterintuitive to do Pass Without a Trace-- 
LAURA: And have to make noise. 
ASHLEY: -- and then you're like (loud, frantic spell casting) 
MATT: (laughs) It's a preparation spell. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: It's not impossible, once again. But I'll ask for a stealth check. 
SAM: We're good. She's good. 
LAURA: Yeah. No, yeah. 
MARISHA: It's a verbal-- 
LAURA: It's the noise that she's going to make sliding the rod through the handle. 
TRAVIS: She wouldn't screw this up and doom us. 
MARISHA: Very quiet. I've got this, I've got this. 
SAM: She's got this. 
SAM: Why are you rolling with advantage? 
MARISHA: Because I sucked in that ring and that lasts for 24 hours. 
SAM: Amazing. Amazing. 
MARISHA: I think it's only been like-- 
LAURA: It hasn't been-- 
MATT: It hasn't been that long. 
ASHLEY: Barely any time. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Six hours? 
ASHLEY: 15 minutes. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's been like 15 minutes. 
SAM: Go, girl. 
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 19 for 25. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Okay. It slides in smoothly and without any sound. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Didn't even feel it. (laughter) 
MATT: That's the Vax journey there. 
LAURA: Did you do it? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Well, I know you're going to be calling the shots. 
MARISHA: Map pap, okay. 
ASHLEY: Did you do it yet? (laughter) 
MATT: Shortly after you get that into place, you hear the rustling of metal on metal and then-- 
ASHLEY: Metal on metal! (rattling jammed door) 
TRAVIS: Oh god. 
MATT: You hear (garbled snarls) and that same shifting sound again. The voice goes, "Is it locked? Open it!" 
SAM: Guys-- 
MATT: "I said, open it!" You hear (heavy impact) 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: (tumbling) 
LIAM: They're going to fuck up the owners. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: There's just quiet again. "That's not a good answer." (violent slam) 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: You just-- 
ASHLEY: I had a feeling. 
TRAVIS: We can't let him take the heat. 
ASHLEY: No. 
TRAVIS: We got to come out. 
SAM: What if we're just making a porno? 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: It's worked before. 
ASHLEY: We could just act like we're dead. 
LIAM: Don't let them do it again. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should-- 
MARISHA: I'll unlatch the thing. 
MATT: Okay. You hear the sound of someone getting up and futzing with it again, and then it-- (unlatching) (hinges creaking) 
MARISHA: I crawl back down into the darkness. 
MATT: Pulls open, and you all hear the footsteps curve around the front. 
TRAVIS: What do you see? 
MATT: "What the hell?" 
MARISHA: What do I see? 
MATT: Where are you standing now? If you're down below here, where are you? 
TRAVIS: She's looking right up into their faces. 
MARISHA: Yeah, pretty much. 
MATT: Okay. You glance up inside and you see-- 
LIAM: It's so horror movie. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: -- the bottoms of two feet and the edges of one of those tall, furry gray and white haired entities that is dressed in similar armor as to the other sentinels you saw of Kreviris, that you had fought earlier. 
MARISHA: The Sasquatch-esque. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: You see just from the waist down from your vantage point, and you see it-- It snaps its fingers and it carries over a lantern, one of those weird, glass, blue orb lanterns that is lighting up. "What the hell?" 
MARISHA: Unsettling Presence. 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) It takes two steps back, (whistling) gives this loud whistle sound. (gritty slithering) You hear that weird shifting sound. You watch as a familiar looking creature slithers around the edge, its singular, central eye and its massive tooth-covered jaw, those creatures that you saw frenzy-feeding in the middle of the dust. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
MATT: It looks like there's one that's been-- 
LIAM: Domesticated? 
MATT: -- trained and domesticated by this figure. 
LAURA: Aw, cute! 
SAM: Oh god. 
MARISHA: It is kind of cute. 
MATT: (slithering growl) Comes up to the edge. He (clicks tongue) and points down. (bouncing thuds) It bounds down the ladder. (snarling and sniffing) What are you all doing? 
SAM: It's down here with us? 
MATT: It is down here with you. 
TALIESIN: Does it seem like it has-- 
SAM: Oh, god. 
TALIESIN: Does it seem like it has-- 
LAURA: Well, we can't see it. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. Does it seem like it has seen us? 
LAURA: Yeah, Laudna, tell us what's happening. 
SAM: Does it have truesight? 
MARISHA: Does it seem like it's seen us? 
SAM: Tremorsense? 
MATT: It does look like it has-- It looks like it's emerged down below. It stumbles off the edge of the ladder. (low snarling) 
MARISHA: I say in our brains-- 
TRAVIS: It's seeking, it's seeking. 
MARISHA: I give a location of where it is. 
MATT: Yeah, it is right in front of you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It doesn't see you. It's interesting because the little eye that you see flitting on it-- 
MARISHA: Doesn't see us. 
MATT: -- it's-- Make an insight check. 
SAM: Mm. 
MARISHA: An insight check. 
TRAVIS: Nobody move, not a muscle. 
LIAM: There's just a fucking wolverine in the middle of the room-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: -- between us all. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: 21. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: 21. You're looking right at it. You're used to seeing creatures an eye up here where there's the slit where the thing's shifting around it, but you don't see a pupil, and you see this slight little gap that occasionally opens in it and you realize it's not an eye, it's part of its sensoring apparatus. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: But it's not sight-based. It's like it's tasting the air through this other additional eye-like appendage and it's like (low, searching snarls). You watch it begins to-- The outside of its body has these, now that it's this close to you, hundreds of little tooth-like spines that come out of the sides of its body that protrude out like cat claws that begin to (skittering slither) shift. 
ASHLEY: Ugh! 
MATT: The rock around it begins to break away and it almost begins to gently burrow, like wading into water. 
TRAVIS: What is the matter with you? 
ASHLEY: Ew! 
MARISHA: I say in everybody's head-- 
TRAVIS: What's the matter with you? (laughter) 
MARISHA: I say in everybody's heads: It's covered in teeth, it's covered in teeth, it's covered, it's covered in teeth. 
TRAVIS: (laughs anxiously) Oh fuck. 
MATT: It is coming in your direction, testing checking around the room. 
MARISHA: Towards me? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: What do we do? We can't move. 
MARISHA: I tell everybody to hug the walls. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Hopefully, it keeps coming towards me because I want to lightly navigate around it. 
MATT: Okay. I'm going to ask-- 
MARISHA: Try and slip it. 
MATT: -- for a group stealth check on this. 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Sorry, guys. 
LIAM: And there's no Without a Trace now, correct? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: No, but now it's-- 
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know, I know. 
SAM: This is going to be great. 
TALIESIN: I'm still at disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
LAURA: What'd you do? 
LIAM: Oh dear. 
MATT: You are. 
LAURA: No! 
SAM: It's all good. 
TALIESIN: It's cocked, thank god. 
LAURA: It's a group, it's a group. 
SAM: This is a group? This is a group stealth check, right? 
LAURA: It's a group stealth check. 
MATT: Yep. Yep. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. We'll start over here with you, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Double checking. Yeah, okay. That's-- No. Nine, 16. Math. 
MATT: 16, with disadvantage. Great. All right. 
LIAM: 13. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: 23. 
SAM: Oh! Wow. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Natty one. 
MARISHA: Oof! 
MATT: (hollow pops) Okay. 
SAM: Four. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Shit. 
MARISHA: 23. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Natural 20. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Yes, all right. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: For a 30. 
SAM: That negates-- 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MARISHA: That negates the natty one. 
ASHLEY: Does it? 
MATT: That negates the natural one. 
ASHLEY: It does? Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: It was group check, it was a group check, a group check. 
TRAVIS: I just had a single roll. 
LAURA: Did we make it? 
TRAVIS: Because I have advantage on stealth checks. 
LIAM: 20 and one are gone. Two high 20s. 
LAURA: And a four. 
LIAM: A couple of teens and the super low one. 
MATT: Yeah, the most important one is you because you're the only one who's moving in this instance. This is to see if the rest of you can stay still while it's this close to you in the presence. Yours is the primary one on this. As you begin to slightly shift backward and move as it (shifty slithering) sifts through the sand itself and it begins to run a perimeter of the room. (invertebrate gurgling and growling) 
MARISHA: I'm trying to get any boxes between me and it, but-- 
MATT: It bumps into one (wet thud) and you shift around on the other side of it. (angered snarling) Sifts around, scoots around past you, Imogen. 
MARISHA: I say in her head: It's coming for you, Imogen. It's coming for you. 
ASHLEY: Should we give it any body parts again? A little snack? 
MATT: Scoots now past you, Fearne. 
LIAM: It's taller than me, is it? 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Is it taller than Orym? 
MATT: It's about your height. 
LAURA: Oh, god! 
ASHLEY: Oh, no. 
MATT: It's about this wide. 
LAURA: That's huge! That's so much bigger than I imagined it. 
MARISHA: He's not taller than you. 
TRAVIS: Should have gotten on a box. It's okay up here. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I thought it was like a cat. 
MATT: So there's a unique-- The rest of you don't see this, but there's a unique "Mission Impossible" dance that Laudna's attempting to try and avoid its movement and hide off by one of the boxes-- 
ASHLEY: "Entrapment." 
MATT: -- as it snaps into things and smashes into other parts and does a little pass. 
LIAM: Orym is still devoting a lot of his CPU to listening to people up top. Does it still sound like they're on the lip looking down at us? 
MATT: It sounds like there's one right at the edge, and there's three others-- 
TRAVIS: That's what that is. 
MATT: -- at the doorway that leads into this small closet. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: It finishes its pass around, comes over in the direction past you, and you can feel its presence, that (skittering slither) sifting sound as it burrows through the rock a little bit. Then you watch as it dips into the rock and burrow entirely-- 
MARISHA: It's going underground! It's going fucking underground! 
MATT: -- into the ground. 
ASHLEY: I hate this thing. 
LAURA: Oh wait, where's it going to pop up? Where's it going to pop up? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
MATT: (slithering burst) Bursts out of the nearby wall for a second. Rocks tumbles into it. 
LAURA: Did it get any of us? (anxious mumbling) 
MATT: I'm going to say-- I need a dexterity saving throw from you, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Mm. Oh, saving throw. Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (anxious sigh) 
TALIESIN: I still have that d6, by the way. Thank you. 
MATT: This isn't going to do damage, but it will be your attempt to move out of the way without making too much movement yourself. 
LAURA: (buzzes lips anxiously) 
MARISHA: Why Ashton? 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Because he made rocks fall on the ground-- 
TALIESIN: Do I get to add the d6 if I need it, or do I have to roll it-- 
LAURA: -- to hide some of the-- 
TALIESIN: -- into the roll? 
MATT: It hides the sound. 
SAM: You get to use it, it's like inspiration. 
MATT: This is for if he can manage to not-- 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I can roll and go mm-- 
MATT: -- draw his attention to movement. 
TALIESIN: -- and then add the d6. 
LIAM: You're made of rocks. Just sound like rocks. 
TALIESIN: I'm working on it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Working on it! 
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. 
ASHLEY: Working on it! 
TALIESIN: I don't need it yet. 
LAURA: That's what you think. 
TALIESIN: Actually, just throw it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: 22. 
MATT: 22. (angry slithering) (low snarling) (whiny, snappy barking) Then it barks almost like a puppy up towards the figure at the top of steps. He goes-- 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
LAURA: I need one. 
TRAVIS: Don't-- No, it's not cute! 
MARISHA: It's so cute! 
MATT: "Fucking A. Nothing down there." 
SAM: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
SAM: I attack. 
MATT: (whistles) Whistles again and the creature (pounces) bounds up and you watch as it bounds, because you can see it, it's not really landing, it's hovering and using the ladder, almost like it's a fun little, like a bit of an obstacle course. 
LAURA: Fucking shit. 
LIAM: Slip 'N Slide? 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Well, you saw them before, they were hovering when they were burrowing through the ground and stuff for moments. There's something unique about their movement. 
TRAVIS: Trout jumping. 
MARISHA: Flying-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Flying fish. 
MATT: Comes up-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Hovercraft. 
MATT: -- as he whistles two more (heavy pounces) burst out of the nearby walls and follow up behind it that you didn't even realize were burrowing in the ground outside of the tunnel. 
LAURA: Whoops. 
MATT: The last thing I need here, based on where they were going, I'm going to go ahead and roll some dice to see where those emerge from. The first one's going to be on a two. A four is going to be next to Imogen and the last one's going to be Fearne. I need both of you to make dexterity saving throws for me, please. 
LAURA: Dex saving throws? 
TRAVIS: You got it. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
TRAVIS: You got this. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LAURA: Do we have advantage on anything? 
MARISHA: We're so close. 
LAURA: We don't, and you didn't give either of us sixes. 
SAM: Not yet because I gave, it's still active with good old Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I burned it. 
MARISHA: No, he burned it. 
SAM: Oh, you burned it. Well. 
LAURA: Too late. 
TALIESIN: Oh, not for that one, never mind. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 10. 
MATT: A 10? Okay. 
ASHLEY: 21. 
MATT: 21. 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
MATT: Okay, the one that bursts out beside you, you duck out of the way. It catches you in the side, but you hold your breath and it burrows off and picks up and floats back up the ladder after the other one. Shortly after that, the one hits you from behind, bursting through the wall behind you, Imogen, knocking you to the ground, some of the rock covering on you and you instinctually (gasps) breathe out as it knocks the wind out of you for a moment and you're trying to catch yourself. The creature (growls) turns and focuses in your direction. You're watching this and you can feel that odd breath as it's-- (spooky panting) It creeps up close to your face. 
SAM: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: It's gangly. 
MATT: (intense, creepy growls) Opens its mouth and bites down on your head-- 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: -- almost gently, like it's testing what's there. (swooshes) Pain surges through you as you, not knowing what else to do in that moment, let this creature bite into your head, rows of sharp teeth digging into your scalp and a part of your shoulder. You take-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: He's so cute, though. 
MATT: (laughs) 14 points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: Oh, my. 
LAURA: 14! 
MATT: Do you do anything? 
ASHLEY: It's a love bite. 
LAURA: Nope. I don't want to do anything. 
TRAVIS: The world's largest tattoo all at once. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: He continues to chew. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: It seems to have found something it likes and almost like a small creature gnawing on a toy, but then it gets the treat in the middle of it. It's like (wet gnashes) and it starts tearing into you again. 
TRAVIS: Can we drag it off? 
MARISHA: It seems like I know-- 
SAM: So are we in the clear, everybody, I can't see a thing. (laughter) 
LAURA: I'm trying to find something that's not verbal! 
MATT: That's going to be another 13 points of piercing damage. 
LAURA: Why is everything verbal? 
MARISHA: Can I, can I take out this Reiloran behemoth finger that I have and slowly-- 
ASHLEY: Wiggle it in there. 
MARISHA: Yeah, wiggle it in its mouth and try and slip it in and slip Imogen's head out? 
TRAVIS: Just toss it on the floor. 
MATT: I'll say-- 
MARISHA: Or just, yeah, toss. 
LAURA: Everything's verbal. 
MATT: Make a-- There is a metamagic ability that helps improve that. 
LAURA: Oh wait, wait, let me see if I have that. Do I have that? Twinned Spell, Quicken Spell. 
MATT: It's Silent Spell. 
LAURA: I know, but I don't have Silent Spell. 
MATT: Aw. Well-- 
LIAM: Hands on the creature's mouth? 
TRAVIS: Why'd you build a broken character? 
LAURA: Why didn't I know that I would have a creature gnawing at me when I couldn't make noise? 
TRAVIS: Oh, you're dumb? Yeah. 
LAURA: Why wouldn't I have planned for that? 
LIAM: It's nine years; you didn't figure it out yet? 
MARISHA: I'm going to try and bait it with this-- 
MATT: I understand. 
MARISHA: Give it a little beef jerky. 
MATT: I'm going to need you to make an animal handling check. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: As you're trying to draw its attention from a fresh piece of bleeding meat to an old piece of no longer bleeding meat. 
ASHLEY: Get your beouf jerkey! 
LIAM: But gristly. There's a lot of meat on that bone. 
LAURA: If something has a verbal-- 
MATT: This is the juggernaut finger, you said? Yeah, it's a meaty, it's like a sausage, yeah. 
LAURA: Did the other creatures already leave the thing and he's the only one? 
MARISHA: Natural 20! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: No fucking-- 
MARISHA: On the Laudna dice! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: They've been waiting. 
MATT: Okay, where do you throw this? You watch as you pull the finger in the way and like (panting) it looks up at you, you can see the blood streaks down the outside of its jaw and you see this red mess that's the back of the unmoving Imogen's head. You instinctually grab the finger and hold it in front, and as you do, it (snorting). 
MARISHA: Can I trail it to the door a little bit and then just, yeah, the direction the other one's going to get out. 
MATT: (snorting) You throw it out the-- 
MARISHA: Don't want to throw it out. No. 
MATT: Where do you throw it? 
MARISHA: No, no, no. Towards the ladder or whatever. 
LAURA: Just a finger flies out. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: You chuck it towards the ladder and it just (snarls) and immediately lunges over digging into the ground and catching it like a shark out of water, if the water was rock being burrowed through, takes it, the ladder gets bumped and almost gets knocked out of the hole for a second. It makes a bit of a clatter above and you hear some of the foot's like stepping over to the edge and one of them is looking in and can't see anything, holding the lantern again, one of them is like, "Hey, come on. What's going on? (whistling)" 
MARISHA: Go, please leave, please fucking go, please leave. 
MATT: Spits a chunk of the partially chewed section, then eats it. (slurping) It turns to look back towards where Imogen is. 
SAM: Get out of there! 
LAURA: When it-- 
MATT: While it's distracted, what are you doing? 
LAURA: Can I feel a box behind me? 
MATT: From where you are, yeah, there is definitely like a box that got shifted as it burst through the wall, yeah. 
LAURA: Can I try to get up onto the box while it was-- 
SAM: I will give-- 
LAURA: -- distracted jumping after the thing? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: While it was making noise and clattering around. 
MATT: Make another stealth check for that. 
SAM: I can't give you a d6 because I said Orym, Ashton-- 
LAURA: I know, you didn't bind with us. 
SAM: -- Chetney and fucking Laudna. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Why fucking me? 
LAURA: Oh no. Oh no. I rolled a seven. 
SAM: Yeah, but plus things. 
LAURA: Seven, no, I rolled a three. (chuckling) 
SAM: Hmm. 
MATT: It turns back around. 
TRAVIS: Get ready. 
MATT: And (growling). 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: It's fine, it's fine. 
MATT: (snarls) He goes (hums) over to you. 
LAURA: The minute it makes the noise at me-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- Jesus Christ. 
TRAVIS: With your head bleeding, profusely. 
LAURA: Sure. I'm going to, let me make sure I don't have to-- 
LIAM: Matted with blood. 
LAURA: Fuck, I don't know, I can't see, I can't see! Um. 
MARISHA: Could you turn into one of them that you saw earlier? 
ASHLEY: Does it make noise? 
MARISHA: Then pretend to leave with them for a minute, to get them to go away. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: Would I know, does Shock Flare make noise? 
MATT: Shock Flare? 
SAM: Kill this one, then you can be it. 
MARISHA: Speed out? That way. 
LAURA: Or would I know what noises my spells make? 
MATT: You would know that Shock Flare makes a little bit of a staticky noise, like a (crackles). 
LAURA: Okay, okay. Then the minute it gets to me. 
MARISHA: We took a short rest. 
ASHLEY: We did? 
MATT: Yeah, you took a short rest. 
LAURA: The minute it makes noise, I'm going to reach forward and try to touch it. 
MATT: Okay, as soon as you grab it-- 
LAURA: I'm going to try to Inflict Wounds on it. 
MATT: Okay. Now, because you cannot see it, you roll with disadvantage. So roll to make your spell touch attack, your melee spell attack with disadvantage. 
SAM: It's a one. 
TRAVIS: Wow! This is a series of really crap rolls. 
MATT: Yeah, they are. 
LIAM: Telling us something here. 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
MARISHA: It was going so well. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You have so many dice. 
LAURA: Sorry, guys. 
ASHLEY: We have an idea. 
TRAVIS: Maybe it's because there-- 
LAURA: Travis, shut up! (laughter) 
MATT: You go to reach towards it, and your spell grabs-- 
SAM: Shh. 
MATT: -- the empty space of the inside of its open gullet as it snaps over the front half of your body, (heavy impact) The rest of you-- 
LAURA: Over the front half of my body? 
MATT: -- just hear (intense impact) 
TALIESIN: I don't like this. 
MATT: You see now just the legs of Imogen-- 
TRAVIS: (yelps) 
MATT: -- kicking outside of it. I'm going to say, for this instance, let's roll initiative, since we are now actually in a battle. 
LIAM: Do the witch legs curl up? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: So for this point in time, you've backed off to the side, and this is now right over here, and you are restrained. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Shit. 
LIAM: Aw. 
TRAVIS: Donkey balls. 
MATT: Not restrained, grappled, sorry. 
SAM: Can't see anything, so everything's going to be with disadvantage. 
MATT: You can't move, but you essentially are grappled by it. 
MARISHA: I can drop this. I can drop this. 
SAM: But then they'll see-- 
LAURA: No, they'll see it. 
MARISHA: They're walking away, though. 
LAURA: Are they, though? 
MARISHA: You said the two were walking away. 
MATT: They were all walking away, and then when that one hit the ladder, some of them started coming back, because they heard the clatter. One of them's looking over with the lantern right now, but can't see anything down there. 
ASHLEY: We had some good ideas. 
MATT: But nevertheless. 
LAURA: We had some-- 
SAM: That's a good idea. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: Laudna had a good idea. 
MATT: Okay. That's going to be. And. Okay. So. I would like to get 25 to 21, or 25 to 20? 
MARISHA: 22. 
LAURA: Oh, I didn't even fucking roll. 
LIAM: Not this time. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Well, shit. 
MATT: All righty. 25 to 20? 
SAM: 19. 
MATT: Sorry, sorry. 19, yeah that's 19. 20 to 15? 
ASHLEY: 17? 
LIAM: 17. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: 17, okay. 
MARISHA: Good. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So that's Fearne and Orym. 
LAURA: I rolled a 15, as well. 
LIAM: (Kiwi accent) Casters on deck. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: You want to do Rollies? 
LAURA: Rollies. You'll win, because I'm rolling like balls right now. Three. 
LIAM: 12. (pained laughter) 
TRAVIS: Jeez. 
LAURA: Get it out. 
LIAM: Fearne. 
MATT: It's true. 
ASHLEY: Get it out, get it out, get it out. 
MATT: All right, 10 to five. 
TRAVIS: Eight. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh, five. 
SAM: (groans) 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Rollies, or? 
LAURA: Did anybody else roll? 
MATT: It's okay, one of them rolled really, really bad. 
TRAVIS: Is there some rule that's like, year ten is just going to suck ass? 
TALIESIN: 20. 
LAURA: Eight. 
TALIESIN: Okay, you're at the top. 
TRAVIS: Or dead, near dead? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: I cannot get over that top face. It's like someone took you, Brennan Lee Mulligan, and Pete Davidson, and put you into a gene splicer. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's weird. 
LIAM: What is that? 
SAM: I don't know, I can't-- 
MATT: It's terrifying. 
SAM: -- I can't see it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: If Laura was wearing Sam's face. 
MATT: It looks like-- Oh, that's what that is. 
ASHLEY: That's why it's so, yes. 
MARISHA: Wait, it does look like Brennan Lee Mulligan. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's the-- 
MATT: That's not true. He's a far more handsome gentleman. It looks like Peter Lorre, to be honest. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Ah. 
MATT: (like Peter Lorre) "You know, it's important to know what we're doing in our game of Dungeons & Dragons." 
ASHLEY: Yes, it does. (laughter) 
LAURA: Which is weird, because Brennan does not look like that at all. 
MATT: At all! I don't know where you're getting that from. Sorry Brennan, I apologize for them. 
TRAVIS: Shout out Brennan Lee Mulligan. Prayer to Brennan Lee Mulligan. Save us! 
MATT: All righty, so that's going to be... Sorry, Chetney, you had an eight? 
TRAVIS: Yes, and then Ashton was a five. 
SAM: Then Ashton last. 
LAURA: Steve Buscemi. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's a little Steve Buscemi in there. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Sméagol when he was still a halfling. 
LAURA: Yes. (laughs) 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: Oh my goodness, okay. 
TALIESIN: I thought it was me, too, it is not me. 
LAURA: All you. 
SAM: It's me? 
ASHLEY: It's all you. They're all you. 
LAURA: It's just all you. 
SAM: I thought that was Taliesin. 
TALIESIN: It's not me. 
ASHLEY: You are wearing a shirt full of you. 
MATT: So, sorry, going back to the top of this now. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Top of the initiative here, it is Laudna, with FCG on deck. What do you got? 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: You can actually see. 
MARISHA: I can see. I am going to try to just quickly lead this, and I'm going to tell everybody, "Everyone remain calm, and shut the fuck up. I'm going to throw Fearne as one of these creatures through the top of the roof." 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. 
LAURA: Oh... amazing! 
MARISHA: I tell Fearne. 
SAM: Are we trying to kill the thing? 
MARISHA: Yes, but let me get rid of this thing first. I would get rid of them. I tell Fearne: Turn into one of those little tadpole-y things that we saw, but like, Orym-sized. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: So it looks like... 
ASHLEY: (blows raspberry) 
MATT: So, the tadpole thing, as in like, what you were in the river? 
LAURA: No, the one's we're fighting. 
ASHLEY: What we are fighting. 
LAURA: She's trying to look like the thing that we're fighting. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Piranha teeth things. 
MARISHA: It's one of the things that we already saw. 
MATT: Correct, it is technically a beast. Though a Ruidian beast. So, okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, it's cool? 
SAM: She can do it? 
ASHLEY: Is it? 
MATT: Wait, are you transforming, like using your Wild Shape into it? 
ASHLEY: I was thinking about it. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But I also could Disguise Self. 
LAURA: No, that's different. 
MATT: Disguise Self has to be closer to the humanoid space. 
LAURA: Yeah, Beast Shape would be cool. 
TRAVIS: You don't know, she could-- 
MARISHA: Beast Shape would work though, right? 
MATT: You could try it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to try it. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: It's going to be a fly. 
MATT: You've had a decent look at this up close. Actually, you have not seen this creature up close. You only saw it from a distance, but you did see it when you were trying to go over the top, so you will yourself into a form, and your body shifts into an uncomfortable state. Indeed, you are currently now the form of a slither. 
ALL: Slither? 
MARISHA: I'm going to hold my action. So Fearne is-- 
MATT: I will say, so this will be you, Fearne. I'll surround this with a green marker so you know which one is you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So that's you there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (shouts) Look at that face! 
MARISHA: Oh my god, he's kind of cute. 
TRAVIS: Shit, what? 
MARISHA: He is kind of cute. 
LAURA: They're kind of cute. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, the way a piranha's cute. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Then, can I hold my action? Well, we're doing this all at once. 
LAURA: I have to say, I thought the mouth was much smaller that was biting me. I didn't realize it was like, the size of half my body that was biting me. 
MATT: Yeah, and the mini's a little larger than I intended it to be, but it's just a little bit smaller. 
LAURA: It could swallow half my body. 
MATT: Yeah, it's about that big. Kind of this large of a sphere with a little tail behind it. 
LIAM: Cool. 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: All right, so-- 
LAURA: Do you remember the horror movie, "Critters?" 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Little bigger than one of those. All right, what are you doing? Sorry, you told her to do that, and then? 
MARISHA: I'm going to hold my action, until after Fearne turns. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Technically, there's an FCG sandwiched between us. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Technically? 
LAURA: (Jester) Technically. 
LIAM: And at the table. 
MARISHA: Then I want to toss Fearne's ass up through the hole. 
MATT: Okay. You got it. 
LAURA: I mean, you probably wouldn't even need to toss her up. She could probably walk herself up. 
MATT: So are you going to move over here? 
ASHLEY: Hover up? 
MATT: Are you going to move over to where she is, then? 
LAURA: Oh, right, right. 
MATT: Are you going to move over to where Fearne is, or are you moving by the bottom of the stairs? Or the bottom of the ladder, sorry. 
MARISHA: I need to guide Fearne. I'm the only one who can see. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you step behind, and hold on to Fearne, and begin to force movement, drag her over this way to the bottom. You can do that with your movement. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, that's a movement, not an action. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm holding my action. 
TALIESIN: But she's touching the ladder. 
MARISHA: Yeah, if she can get to the ladder-- 
ASHLEY: Then I would know. I would know where to go. 
MARISHA: Blump up. 
MATT: I'll say you're getting in position for that. This is not your action, you're just pinching, and tugging, and you're drifting. 
TRAVIS: We also don't know how they move. Just because she looks like one of them-- 
LIAM: She can't levitate like these things do, not that any of us see this shit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: So you drift, pulling her over. While you hear the gnawing sounds of your friend being eaten in the shadow. All right, so you hold your action for that. Darkness. FCG, you're up. What are you going to do, buddy? 
SAM: We're killing this thing, right? 
MATT: You can't see anything. 
SAM: I can't see, but I've heard some chomps. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: So our attacks are going to probably be at disadvantage. We got to attack. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to. 
TALIESIN: Unless you've got something else. 
LAURA: Try to do silent spells. 
SAM: Everything is verbal, as you well know. 
TRAVIS: That buzzsaw isn't. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (buzzing) 
SAM: I'm going to quietly-- 
MATT: Yeah? 
SAM: -- quietly affix my coin to my palm, and I will use it to cast Guiding Bolt at 4th-level. 
MATT: Holy shit, okay. 
SAM: At the thing. 
LIAM: Which will not make any light, because of the darkness. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: Which means it doesn't give you the secondary benefit, but it does-- 
SAM: No, it doesn't. 
MATT: Not while it's dark, because you have nothing to guide you. 
SAM: That's true. 
MATT: So roll with disadvantage, to make your spell attack. 
SAM: Disadvantage. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: That's a natural 20. 
MARISHA: Hey! Oh wait-- 
SAM: And a seven. (groaning) 
MARISHA: Disadvantage! 
SAM: Plus, what is-- 
LAURA: That's okay, it's still going to be good. 
SAM: Plus 10, that's 17. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage. 
SAM: I think I did it at level four, so that's 7d6. 
MATT: Yes, it is. 
SAM: Okay. I'll just do these first. Okay, 12 plus, 23 points of damage. 
MATT: 23 points of damage, all right. 
ASHLEY: That's good. 
MATT: Dang, all right, cool. So, you release it and you hear. (sizzles) (impact) (bellows) That's all you hear. 
MARISHA: Does it look like that fucked it up? How many hit points do these things have? Hit points of a kitten? Does it look fucked up? 
MATT: It looks hurt. 
SAM: Damn it. 
TRAVIS: It's got teeth on the outside of its body! 
MATT: (laughs) If you had more time to inspect it with a little more light, maybe you could tell, but in this instance, in this (snaps) instant, you're uncertain how hurt it is. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
SAM: Bonus action, I will sense Orym near me, and I will give him a Bonded Blessing to help him in his attacks. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: A d6. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Like a d6 ♪ 
MATT: There you go, so you got your d6 ready for that? 
TRAVIS: (humming) 
MATT: Please, no. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Please no. 
MATT: (evil voice) They'll learn in time. 
TRAVIS: (grunting) (laughter) 
MATT: All right, that finishes FCG's go. It's now the slither's go. (groaning) 
LAURA: Okay, wait. Here's my question. 
MATT: Yeah? 
LAURA: Did you take one bite on me before, or did you do multiple bites on me? 
MATT: Two bites. 
LAURA: Okay, what was the second bite for? Because I didn't mark it. 
TRAVIS: 13. 
MATT: Oh, it was 13, yeah. 
LAURA: 13 was the second one, okay. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Two bits. 
TALIESIN: Don't like it. 
TRAVIS: The first was 15. 
TALIESIN: Don't want it to be true. 
LAURA: Okay. I marked the first one, but I didn't mark the second. 
MATT: Okay. So, the one that's still on you is going to continue to chew. 
TALIESIN: Okay, it could be worse. 
MATT: So Vice Bite on you. 
LIAM: The cave is shaped like a heart because Matt loves us. 
MATT: That's going to be, now that you're inside, it's going to be an 18 to hit you. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, oh! Right, because it didn't even have to roll to hit me because it was already chomping on me. 
MATT: Yeah, you were still, so it went. (crunching) 
LAURA: That chomps me. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
MATT: That, you take, okay. That is going to be 17 points piercing damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: The grapple is maintained. It is now rolling you around in its mouth, trying to chew and throw you a little bit and catch you. Just like a creature playing with its food as it eats it. 
LAURA: Yay. 
MATT: All right. That finishes that slither's turn. There is movement upstairs, a little bit. Finishing that go, Fearne, you're up, with Orym on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right. Okay, I'm going to keep you guys posted about what's up there. 
MARISHA: Just try and get him to go. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to get him to go. 
MARISHA: As long as they walk out the fucking door, we're good. 
LAURA: You can still hear my thoughts while I'm inside of this thing. (screams) (laughter) 
LAURA: Ow ow ow! 
MATT: I'll say-- 
TRAVIS: The grape stomp lady? 
MATT: Just for reference, too-- (grunting) 
MATT: That poor girl. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah, she looks hurt. 
MATT: At the top. 
LIAM: Someone up there. 
MATT: There's the one guy with the lantern who is looking through the shadow, that's just standing, not right in it, but just at the lip of the-- 
LIAM: That's what Laudna sees? Because we're still in darkness. 
MATT: Correct, that's what Laudna sees. 
LAURA: You're all happy that you-- 
ASHLEY: Cuddle. All right. 
MARISHA: Just look happy. They do these little bounces, they're little hops, and I'm going to help you get up out of there. He's right at the gate. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. I'm going to get up there. 
MARISHA: I help her up. 
MATT: Okay, so you throw, you follow with the momentum. You find yourself almost drifting, and floating ever so faintly, and then suddenly, the shadow emerges, and you're inside the room above, gliding, and you realize you can gently hover. Not fly, but hover, just a little bit above the ground. 
LAURA: So cool. 
MATT: There, you see the figure standing there with the lantern who's like, "Ah, I was wondering what was going on." 
ASHLEY: I'll just move around. 
MATT: Make a deception check with advantage. 
MARISHA: Come on, come on! 
ASHLEY: No, I mean, I'm going. I'm going, I wasn't planning on sitting there-- 
TALIESIN: Run, Lassie, run. (clamoring) 
TRAVIS: Shark worm! 
SAM: Try to be the goodest boy. 
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out! 
LAURA: Yeah, be a gooder boy. 
SAM: Yeah, get some scritches out of this. 
TALIESIN: You're a good boy. 
LAURA: Look at that roll. 
ASHLEY: Hey. (clamoring) 
TRAVIS: Uta Hagen, Uta Hagen! 
ASHLEY: Uta Hagen! 
MARISHA: With advantage! 
ASHLEY: Oh, with advantage. Oh, that's cocked. 
LAURA: Cocked. 
ASHLEY: That's cocked again. 
LAURA: Cocked. God, your fucking dice. 
LIAM: Throw your dice into the parking lot. 
ASHLEY: It's cocked again. 
LAURA: Ashley. 
ASHLEY: I know, I know. Okay, I'm going to take the first one. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay. Perception? 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
SAM: She rolled five times. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right, your perception-- 
ASHLEY: That's really good. I mean, my deception's not great. It's-- Weirdly, but it's okay. 
MATT: So you-- 
ASHLEY: Oh no, no, no, no. 
MARISHA: You have a really high deception, right? 
LAURA: That's better. (laughter) 
SAM: By the way, Matthew. 
ASHLEY: I don't. 
SAM: I just want you to know. I noticed that the downstairs chamber is shaped like a heart, and the upstairs chamber is shaped like a cock and balls. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh, that's so sweet! 
TRAVIS: Dick heart. 
ASHLEY: That is a round-- 
TRAVIS: Heart cock. 
SAM: That's how my dick looks! 
MATT: Well no, it's the Scanlan cube, right there, see? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Huge, swollen testes, little cube dick. 
LIAM: It's got a growth on the side. 
MATT: Oh boy. All right, so you emerge up top. What did you roll? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to (slurps) as I'm walking by it. 
MATT: But what'd you roll? 
ASHLEY: A 20 total. 
MATT: A 20 total, okay. 
SAM: That's good. 
MATT: You emerge and come out the top, you-- 
ASHLEY: I'm getting an eye out. I wanted to see who everybody is, so I can tell everybody. 
SAM: Can she see? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, can you? But how do you see me? 
SAM: I thought they just smell, or--? 
MARISHA: They have little sensors? 
LAURA: But you can feel everyone. 
SAM: I don't know. 
LIAM: What do you see-- 
ASHLEY: I'm up here, I can't see shit. (laughter) 
MATT: So, you don't see. You have blindsight for 30 feet, which means you can just sense, and tremorsense. So you can, oh yeah, it's more tremorsense than blindsight. Where you can feel movement around you, and in a very much Daredevil-esque way, you can make out the shape and movement of things around you. You do see, back over here, there's these two figures by the edge. 
ASHLEY: More Reilorans. 
MATT: There's one back there that has one of those bone wands with the crystal at the end? 
LIAM: Ah. 
TALIESIN: Over-- Yeah. 
MATT: And a shrike that is also emerging up here. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: There's also-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, this would've been so bad. 
MATT: You can sense them just outside the space. 
TRAVIS: What do you mean "This would've been"? 
LIAM and SAM: This is happening. 
MARISHA: This might be. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: Two. 
LIAM: Shit. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't like those. 
LIAM: Because she can feel their movement, even through the walls? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: She can sense their shifting movements. There are two beyond that area, and then over here, in the far corner. 
SAM: Jesus! 
MATT: This, and I'm marking this one as a friend, because that is technically Zhesh. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: So I'm putting green there. 
LAURA: Oh, that's Zhesh, okay. 
MATT: Zhesh is back against the wall, letting them, basically, toss over the place. You can see shit's been knocked over, weapons have been fallen off walls. The place has been rolled a bit. But as you emerge, the one who's with you, he's like, "(gasps) Now go, go." 
SAM: Well, this is your life now. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Bye-bye. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'll go to the door. I don't want to go outside, or get closer to the other ones, so that they don't really see. Just a little more tucked into there, like I'm just waiting. 
MATT: Over here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, waiting to go. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Just hovering. 
MATT: It's odd, this is a new, weird form. 
ASHLEY: This is so weird, I'm literally floating, but there's a lot of people up here. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: So don't come up here. (laughter) 
LAURA: Ow! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Just kill it, and we'll keep going. 
MARISHA: The guy who had the lantern, is he like, "Cool, dope, I got my pet snake back and I'm walking away?" 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
MARISHA: I can see, I can see him. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I can see him. Still have advantage on all these. Okay. 17. 
MATT: 17. 
TRAVIS: Oh, whispers! Whispers! 
SAM: Oh! We got a whisper. 
TALIESIN: He's just going to say we're fucked. 
LAURA: I'm sorry I fucked this up, y'all, By getting bit on my head. 
SAM: No, you didn't. You had a head. That was the only mistake you made. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was really your dice. It was your dice. 
SAM: wizkids.io/bellshellsplush. Oh my god. 
MARISHA: All right, all right. 
SAM: Happy nine year anniversary. 
LAURA: (frustrated groan) 
MARISHA: All right. I tell everybody: Keep remaining silent. I think it's working, but we need more time. 
LAURA: (whiny whimpering) 
MARISHA: It just has to walk away. 
TRAVIS: (mouth fart) 
MARISHA: Just hold on. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to bark at the door or whatever. 
LAURA: Don't, don't. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to leave it. I'm going to shut up and stay by the door. 
MATT: (laughs) Do what you want, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Vogue by the door. 
SAM: Do something fun. 
MATT: Do what you want, Fearne. What do you want to do? 
SAM: Try to steal something. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to just-- Well, I feel like this isn't my turn. I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait. 
MATT: No, this is your turn. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to just-- (laughter) 
MATT: You've literally just moved, so. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I just moved. I'm going to try to, I'm feeling like there's something, whatever we're looking for is out the door. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
ASHLEY: So I'm getting antsy like a dog that wants to go outside to go pee. 
MATT: Okay. What sound do you make? 
ASHLEY: (adorable snuffling) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Hell yeah, all right. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: So you begin to shift and turn towards this way. I need you to make a deception check to try and see if you can figure out, in this space, a way to convey that sort of intent. 
ASHLEY: (soft bark) 
TALIESIN: Oh god, she's going method. We're so fucked. 
MATT: I'll say deception or performance, your choice. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Which is better? Oh, ooh! 
MARISHA: Deception or performance? 
TRAVIS: Haven't had a performance check in forever, ever. 
MATT: Not a lot of performance-based characters in this campaign. 
ASHLEY: 26. No, wait. (mumbled counting) 25. 
MATT: 25, okay. As you do that (soft ruffling) misdirection, you for the first time really feel those teeth grow out and you're like, that's weird. But as you do that, it's like a creature putting its spines up out of interest or anxiety or anticipation. As you do, the two other creatures (ruffling) they put theirs up too, and shift over to look in the direction that you're looking. The ones outside hear the sound (curious gargling) and look over in your direction. So definitely, you've made your intent known, and it seems to be having some sort of reaction. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: All righty. Orym, are you doing anything? 
LIAM: Yes, I am. 
ASHLEY: (snuffling and barking softly) 
LIAM: So I heard that go up and I've heard the plan, so I turn towards the darkness in the room and in my head I'm thinking, covered in teeth, covered in teeth, covered in teeth, covered in teeth! (laughter) I bite the insides of my cheeks, and as soon as I feel teeth on my hand, I'm going to start fileting this thing as fast as I can. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Guys, I am covered in teeth. 
MATT: Shift that forward. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: My dream come true! 
LIAM: Okay, so disadvantage on these guys? 
MATT: Indeed. Your hand immediately-- It's like touching the outside of a wall of fishhooks. 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
ASHLEY: Ugh 
MATT: Now, when you touch it-- 
ASHLEY: I don't like that at all. 
MATT: -- because they're not out at the moment, it's like feeling the outside of the curvature. You can feel where the point is, but you're not dragging against the hook, but you can sense they're there. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: You just made my hands tingle. 
MATT: Go for the strike. 
LAURA: Oh, like if you run your finger over a grater, but the nice way. 
MATT: Yeah, the nice way. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: That's how you catch it. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: The other way would be awful. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll. 
LIAM: Okay, at disadvantage. 
TRAVIS: It's like snake skin. 
LIAM: That's a natural one, so I get to reroll it. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: Ugh, 20. 17, 28 to hit. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: 28 hits. 
LIAM: That is-- 
TALIESIN: That was a lot of drama there. 
TRAVIS: Please all the things. 
LAURA: I know, I don't know what any of those numbers just meant. 
TRAVIS: Please all the things. 
LIAM: Eight. I will make this-- 
LAURA: Kill it! 
LIAM: -- a goading attack just so it hurts more. 
MATT: Okay. Natural one on its saving throw. 
LAURA: Yay! 
LIAM: Okay, so disadvantage against everyone except me. Three, nine, That's 17 for that hit. 
SAM: Whoa. 
LIAM: The next one is a 14 to hit. 
MATT: 14 just hits. 
LIAM: Ooh! 
LIAM: Ah! 
TALIESIN: Writing that down. 
LIAM: 15 for that one. 
TRAVIS: 29. 
LIAM: 17 for the third. 16 for that one. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LIAM: I didn't even have to action surge! I come in really fast going-- (graceful slicing) 
ASHLEY: Filet, filet. 
LIAM: -- and push the roof of its mouth, I think, I hope, back and toward the wall. 
MATT: Yeah, as you carve into it with each, the third strike goes through as it's already falling out of its telekinetically lifted self. 
TRAVIS: Don't let it fall! Don't let it fall! 
MATT: As it drifts to the ground, you catch and pull the mouth open, and Imogen, you finally pull yourself free, the pain released, and here in the middle of shadow and darkness, you feel that surge of freedom and thankfulness wash over you. 
LIAM: Then you hear, about a foot away from you: (retching) 
LAURA: Don't make any noise. 
MARISHA: Shut up! Shut the fuck up. 
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Don't you dare retch! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, that finishes Orym's go. Imogen? 
LAURA: I reach over and put my hand over his puking mouth. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: (puke gushing) 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: (groan disgustedly) 
LIAM: (blocked spewing) 
MATT: Oh god. (laughter) 
MATT: Oh my god. (laughter) 
LIAM: Just a little, tiny little bit of paste. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Ugh. 
MATT: Ugh! 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
SAM: Paste? 
MATT: A little hand salsa there. All right, that finishes-- (laughs) Imogen, anything else you want to do on your turn aside from put your finger in the halfling? 
LAURA: No, I'll just-- (laughter) 
LIAM: Happy anniversary, guys! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (plugging hole) 
MATT: It's a layered reference that also doesn't work. (laughter) 
MATT: Anyway, please continue. 
LAURA: I mean, if the thing's dead and we're still trying to be quiet, then I'm going to sit in silence and wait for it to-- 
TRAVIS: Sit and bleed. 
MATT: Yeah, kind of. 
LAURA: I'm just going to bleed, have a little puke on my hand, and (gags) get a little puke in my mouth at the same time. 
MATT: Okay, you feel that warmth of the heartbeat as you can feel the blood running from the wounds as you sit in quiet and contemplate that odd vibration of the landscape. Especially as the blood's running and the adrenaline's spiking in your system, you can feel that latent connection to that energy that's buzzing all around you, especially more so here than any other place you've been in the city. Now that you have a moment of heightened awareness, Kreviris itself, definitely there is a proximity aspect to it that leaves you a little sharper. Finishing your go-- 
TRAVIS: Not sharp enough to roll better dice. 
LAURA: That's exactly what I was thinking in my head. (laughter) 
LAURA: But I didn't say it out loud. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
TRAVIS: I have to, I'm her husband. 
MATT: I'm was about to say, man. You're married to her. It's your funeral. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, the Slitherlord is going to-- 
LAURA: Enjoy your time here. 
TRAVIS: (whimpering) 
ASHLEY and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: The Slitherlord's going to come by over to where you are and be like, "Hey, hey, what do you see?" 
ASHLEY: Woof, woof! 
MATT: "What do you see? Where?" 
ASHLEY: Just full, I'm trying to put my teeth out as far as they can go, all my teeths. 
MATT: Okay, he's going to be like-- 
ASHLEY: Still pointing out the door. (growls) 
MATT: "I think they're on the trail. This place is done." 
ASHLEY: Woof! 
MATT: The two other Reilorans here at the front that you can see waiting there look at each other quietly, look back over at Zhesh, who puts her head down, and they both start walking alongside as the rest of the surrounding slithers start darting out the windows, out the front door, pushing past and opening it. They all begin to dart outward together as he's starting to-- 
TRAVIS: Creepy. 
MATT: -- prepare his exit. 
LAURA: What are you going to do? What are you going to do, Fearne? 
SAM: You're going to have to live with them forever now. 
LAURA: What are you going to do? 
ASHLEY: Am I still inside? 
TRAVIS: If you're actually one of these, you can-- 
SAM: No, I think you're leading them outside. 
ASHLEY: Am I able to move into the stone? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
ASHLEY: Like they can? Okay. So, I mean, if they're not-- Well. Wait, what are we doing? Is it my turn? No, it's not. What are we doing? 
MATT: I'm explaining to you what they're doing. So next round-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, got it. 
MATT: They're following the intent that you gave. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, I have ideas, but I'm like, wait. 
MATT: That's okay, we'll come around to it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Sorry. 
MATT: Fun things about initiative. You've got to wait your turn. All right, that brings us to Chetney. Anything you want to do on your end? 
TRAVIS: Isn't it Imogen before? 
LAURA: I just sat and puked in my mouth. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I will hold my turn. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Hold my action. Hold my attack. 
MATT: This figure over here, who looks to be Vanguard, but also is wearing a shoulder piece that looks like Kreviris, like they've begun to assemble, or at least try and cross the streams. Maybe this person's been here for a little longer than some of the new recruits you've seen. 
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I will do a Crimson Rite on my hand and get the little chisel on fire in the darkness. 
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you hear a crackling on the edge. 
TRAVIS: I'll hold my action. 
MATT: This faint little flicker of flame, but no light emits around you. It's an odd experience. Feels a little disappointed until you give that barking sound, and then looks out the door, immediately leaps out and starts darting off this way and begins perusing the street outward, looking to see where you might have been referring to, if anyone had run by or anything. 
LIAM: (canine warbling) 
MATT: Ashton? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my action, and my action will be to unlock the hammer if someone comes down the stairs and uses it. I'm going to unlock it once somebody's into it. 
MATT: Okay, get it ready. 
TALIESIN: Well, it's still up on the stairs. 
LAURA: To trip somebody. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So yeah, if it works, then-- (clicks) 
MATT: Great, so you're going to prep yourself up there on the side. At the top of the round, Laudna, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
MARISHA: What can I see? That he has moved away? 
MATT: Yeah, he's left. You're now at the bottom of the stairs, a recovering Imogen. Everyone's still and quiet, and you've sent Fearne off to a new life on Ruidus. 
ASHLEY: I think they're starting to leave. I think they're starting to leave. 
TRAVIS: Matt, where was the side door that we heard open before they opened the hatch to this room that we're in? 
MATT: It would be over in this area. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh, got it, got it, okay. 
MATT: From opening that side of the chamber. 
TRAVIS: Sweet. 
MATT: Would have a door there, but I left it in the map room. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: There's still only one exterior door to this whole building. 
MATT: That you've seen, yes. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
LAURA: What is that back there? 
TRAVIS: That we've seen. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
LAURA: Is there a second entrance if we were to come out-- 
MARISHA: I'm just going to hold. I will hold to drop Darkness if it's needed, and when I feel safe. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: But until then, still maintaining this hold. Fearne has told us all that they're leaving, so just sticking with the plan. 
MATT: You got it. FCG? 
SAM: I want to heal you, but it makes noise. 
LAURA: You can wait until they're gone. 
SAM: Okay. I'll feel around to find where you are, so that I can heal you eventually. 
MATT: (wheel whirring softly) (FCG clattering) You find-- 
LAURA: Thunk! (laughter) 
SAM: What are these things? 
MATT: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
MATT: Perfect. 
ASHLEY: Little pillows! 
MATT: All right, so you hold that. The rest of these slithers here now begin to-- 
TALIESIN: A bag of nickels. (laughter) 
MATT: -- scatter off in this vicinity. 
SAM: One's slightly bigger. 
MATT: Trying to pick up, it looks like they're-- (sniffing aggressively) Their weird little sensors in their head are looking for, trying to follow what you pointed towards, and aren't picking up anything, so are reaching out into the ether to try and pick up whatever scent or sight you're sending them towards. Finishing their go, that's up to you, Fearne. What are you doing? 
ASHLEY: Woof, woof! I'm still going. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: I'm still trying to get them all outside. I'm just going crazy. Come on, we've got to go! 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: (urgent barks) 
MATT: All right, are you going to glide out? 
ASHLEY: Get out here, everybody! We've got to go! So I'm maybe trying to wiggle next to everybody. 
LAURA: Down the street? 
ASHLEY: Like I'm getting excited. so I'll start going out the door, but also, not fully out there, but still staring back at them like: Come on! 
LIAM: In the doorway, you mean? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, in the doorway. 
MATT: In the doorway? 
LIAM: Which way did they go, Jerry? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. All right. So you're trying to-- (directional grunts) 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
MATT: Get over here! 
ASHLEY: (directional barks) 
TALIESIN: Get over here! Over here! 
MARISHA: Get over here! 
TRAVIS: (pigeon coos) 
MATT: Okay, 
MATT: You're going to stay in the doorway while you're doing that? 
ASHLEY: No, I'm going to stay outside a little bit. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go out so there's room. I'm like, let's go. 
MATT: Okay, so you drift outside and continue that way. You can see the rest of them are (snarling) looking back at you for intent. Eventually, the rest of them-- The rest of you are waiting for anything to happen at this point. 
LIAM: Yeah, just letting things slide. 
MATT: Slowly, they begin to emerge from the Glassworks, the Jagged Edge, and begin to scatter as a group in search of whatever scent you're leading them towards. We'll come to you in a moment. What are the rest of you doing now as you feel-- 
MARISHA: The moment that I feel them be like, all right, cool, leave, door close, I'll drop Darkness. 
MATT: (Darkness dissipating) 
TALIESIN: Click. 
TRAVIS: This was a single story building from the outside as we were approaching it, correct? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: It had a risen area, but part of it's a higher apex and there's a massive chimney and a series of smokestacks emerge from the top of it where a lot of these furnaces and elements for processing the glass and other materials exhaust out. 
MARISHA: Now that Darkness is dropped, how does Imogen look? Does she still have a scalp? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah, she looks fairly rough. (laughter) 
MATT: To my mind, I mean, however you want to describe it, your instinctual sorcerer capabilities almost try and protect you in ways, so it still pushes through and still tears you, but you're not shredded with hunks of flesh hanging off or anything. 
LAURA: There's little arcing sparks of electricity coming off the little bite marks as it's trying to-- 
MATT: Trying to stitch it. 
LAURA: -- skin back together. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
SAM: I'm going to cast a 2nd-level Cure Wounds on you. That's seven plus four is 11, plus another two, 13. 
LAURA: Thank you, thank you. 
LIAM: We heard the place empty out above? There's no sounds left, right? 
MATT: For the time being, it sounds like it's emptied out. 
LIAM: All right, Orym's going to sneak up and peek out the windows. 
MATT: Okay. As you sneak up, you can see Zhesh is currently righting one of the tables up and looks over to you and goes, "Shh!" Starts setting up things, goes over and closes the door, goes and pulls these large swaths of leather curtain to close the windows, open windows that are there. There's no glass in the windows themselves. They're left open for ventilation, but the curtains do shutter it in. Before turning and going, "(breathing heavily)" 
LIAM: You all right? 
MARISHA: Is she all right? Are you all right? 
LIAM: How bad they rough you up? 
MATT: "I've gone through worse. I'm just surprised you managed to-- I thought they had found you." 
LIAM: Honestly, same. 
LAURA: Yeah, Laudna's a genius. 
MARISHA: (uncertain noises) Darkness came through this time. 
TRAVIS: That was very resourceful. 
MATT: She steps over and looks down in the basement and goes, "You killed one!" 
LIAM: Is that okay? 
MATT: "It must be hidden." 
LIAM: We can do that. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: We have ways of doing that. 
LIAM: Yeah, let's unroll it. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: Take out a knife and fork. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm going to pry a bunch of teeth off of it, if I can. 
MATT: You can indeed, yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Takes you a little bit, but you can manage to-- 
LIAM: Take the skin off. 
TALIESIN: We have a hole. 
MARISHA: Zhesh. 
TALIESIN: It's getting real gross in there. We're going to have to do something about it at some point. 
MATT: It's pretty gnarly in there right now. 
LAURA: How many bodies do we have in there? It's like fucking "Sweeney Todd" in there. 
MATT: Straight-up. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Bells Hells living up to their name. 
MARISHA: We're going to open the hole one day, and it's going to be like "The Shining." 
LAURA: Defiled. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: From just the blood pouring out. Ew! 
SAM: Wait, what about Fearne? 
MARISHA: I turn to Zhesh and I say-- 
LAURA: She can still hear us, yeah. What are you doing? How are you doing? 
TALIESIN: Give them a little bit of a-- 
ASHLEY: I'm having the time of my life! 
MATT: Coming over to you, Fearne, now, you have a troop of five Imperium members, or four Imperium members and one Vanguard member, and a cluster of four other slithers that are all wandering now through the neighborhood and looking to you for the scent you picked up. The one sasquatch-looking figure that looks to be the one that's guiding them, the one that's whistling and calling them around is going, "What do you see? Where are we going?" 
ASHLEY: I'm going to do that thing where, like I lost the scent. (growling) (confused noise) (laughter) 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
SAM: Come on! 
ASHLEY: Is this what I want to do? (groans) Shit. 
LAURA: Is that a performance or deception? 
ASHLEY: Deception. Eight. 
MATT: Eight, okay. He goes, "What do you mean? Pick it up!" As it says that, he takes this, it looks like a riding crop-- 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: -- and goes, "Whack!" on the side. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'll start moving. 
MATT: "Right," and he follows, and all of them follow you. 
ASHLEY: I'm going a little slow. Shit. 
MATT: (whip crack) You hear it again on your back, and you feel the sting. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right! (laughter) 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (growling) 
ASHLEY: (growls) Okay. 
MATT: You've now led them down about two blocks away, and the open streets of the Clutch are around you. 
ASHLEY: So if I see a building, the nearest, whatever I can see, building with a door, I'm going to take off to it and start barking and going crazy at the door. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Like I found the scent. 
MATT: You dart towards the nearest closed doorway. 
SAM: It's an orphanage. 
MATT: The rest of you hear echoing, this (vicious snarls), and the others-- (frenzied snarling) A whole group of-- 
SAM: Can I help you? 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: -- terrifying beasts all found their prey, that hunting call of coyotes or wolves that all gather in the distance echoing down the street edges. For a brief moment, you're afraid maybe Fearne had been found out, or something worse. You've now, they all rush to the door, and the four around you burrow into the ground out of sight in the direction from underneath. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to do the same. 
MATT: (shifting rock) You burrow down, and it's like pushing through light mud. The resistance isn't strong enough to slow you down. You actually have a fairly fast burrow speed. In fact, a burrow speed of 30 feet. You can burrow as fast as you can hover. 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Amazing. 
MATT: You glide through the ground and rock. 
ASHLEY: Oh, this is amazing. All right, I'm going to try to burrow away. 
TRAVIS: You go down and then-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Go in and back the other way. 
MARISHA: Double back, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. You vanish. Eventually, cruising on back, you, I'm going to say, make a nature check for me. 
SAM: Make a Dig Dug check. 
MARISHA: Aw, Dig Dug. 
MATT: You are burrowing in unfamiliar territory with only the basis of a memory of the direction you were traveling. 
ASHLEY: Rolled a two, and I have a minus one for nature, so a one. 
LAURA: We're on a moon! 
ASHLEY: We're on a moon, we're on a moon. 
MATT: You burrow and burrow, and you think you're nearby, but it just keeps burrowing. 
SAM: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: You're going to find Predathos. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (screams) 
TRAVIS: (like Predathos) I've been waiting! 
LIAM: (like Predathos) What time is it? 
MATT: As you carve through, it just continues to go. 
LAURA: ♪ Rock-a-bye baby ♪ 
MATT: You're like, "It can't be this long," so you double back, and it's just more rock. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: You're not sure which way's up, which way's down. You're just pushing in a direction to try and find your way back. You are lost underground. 
SAM: Oh no! 
LAURA: Fearne! Can you still talk to us? Is she still close enough that we can hear her? 
MATT: The distance on it is anywhere on the plane, right? 
SAM: Let me look. 
LAURA: Is it miles or is it anywhere? 
SAM: This is-- 
MATT: Telekinesis, right? 
LAURA: It's the telepathic-- 
MATT: Sorry, telepathy. Telepathy. 
SAM: Telepathic Bond says-- (mumbling) 
TALIESIN: 30 feet, oh no! 
SAM: "Communicate through the bond." 
MATT: "Possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes." 
LAURA: Great. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. 
SAM: Over any distance! 
MATT: So yeah, you can hear it. 
MARISHA: So dope. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Hi, I'm on my way back. I'm just a little lost. 
LAURA: Lost where? 
TALIESIN: Define little. 
LAURA: The streets? Where? 
ASHLEY: I'm in the dirt, I'm in the ground. 
LAURA: Uh-huh? 
ASHLEY: I'm going, you know, swimming back through the dirt to you, but it all-- 
LIAM: You shook the rest of them? 
ASHLEY: I think I lost them, but I don't know. It all looks the same. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: So I don't know where I am. I'm going to try to go what I think is up, and then I'll report back. 
SAM: Wait, wait, wait! If you go up, it might not be up. 
LAURA: You might be going down. 
TRAVIS: Blow bubbles! 
SAM: I can find her. I can Locate Creature. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, if you can ping and then-- 
SAM: I could locate her and then we could get above her and make a big noise that she could-- 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: And bring them all towards us? 
MARISHA: I know. 
LAURA: Shit. 
SAM: We could wait an hour and do it. 
MARISHA: I'm going to do-- (knocks "Shave and a Haircut") 
TRAVIS: "Shave and a Haircut?" 
MARISHA: Do you feel this? Do you hear this? 
MATT: Nothing. 
MARISHA: Fuck. 
ASHLEY: No, no. 
MATT: Not with a one. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: All right, it's fine. I'll take care of it. I'll figure it out. 
LAURA: How? 
ASHLEY: I don't know. I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Does Locate Creature, so you can see-- 
SAM: I'll be able to see or sense where she is, so we could probably talk her back. 
LAURA: You could say, oh, you're going down now. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Come back up the other way. 
SAM: It's just like our trust exercise that we did back at-- 
LAURA: That's great! 
SAM: Okay, I'm going to cast Locate Creature. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
SAM: And sense where she is. 
MARISHA: Maybe you can be made invisible by somebody, and you guys could go invisible scouting? 
TALIESIN: Maybe just bring her back. 
MATT: As you finish the spell-- 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: -- you immediately feel, you can sense Fearne pretty straight down and a little bit away from the current position where you're standing in the middle of the shop. 
SAM: Okay, go the direction that you think is up. 
ASHLEY: All right, so I'll turn one way and start going really fast. 
MATT: You watch her descending rapidly. 
SAM: Okay, you're going down. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay! 
SAM: So go back the way you came. 
ASHLEY: I think I'm turned around 180. I'll go up again. 
MATT: She's now turning up, even further away, but now at an upward trajectory. 
SAM: Okay, that's up, and now, shit, she was going down, so can you pull up on the yoke? 
ASHLEY: Sure, I think so. I think so. 
MATT: It takes you a good 20 or so minutes. 
LAURA: Oh wow, that's a long time. 
MATT: But eventually, you do manage to maneuver her in a very zigzag pattern. 
ASHLEY: Can I try to come through the floor-- 
MATT: You rolled a one. 
ASHLEY: I know, amazing. Can I try to at least come through the floor of the-- 
MATT: You do. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Like a fucking Etch A Sketch. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
MATT: (laughs) That's basically how it worked. The reason it takes so long is because of that care you're taking. You don't want to emerge in the middle of the street near them again to set the whole thing off, so slowly, as you get closer and closer, it's now little movements. All right, narrowing it in. All right, all right. Then eventually you push through ever so gently out of the ground. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: Hi! 
ASHLEY: Hi! 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! 
ASHLEY: Wow, it is wild going under the ground. I don't know how you do it. You can't even see anything. 
TALIESIN: Have you shifted back or no? 
MATT: No, but she can talk. 
TALIESIN: (growling) 
MATT: She can talk telepathically. 
TALIESIN: You're actually doing-- yeah, that's right. 
ASHLEY: I just like having all these teeth. 
TRAVIS: We should move, we should move. We should get off this X. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we should go, we should go. 
LAURA: Zhesh, is there somewhere safe we can go? 
MATT: "There is nowhere safe in this area, not after all that." 
MARISHA: How close are we till sunset? I know dusk was when we were going to go-- 
LIAM: We have to kill some time. 
LAURA: That took a little longer than-- 
MATT: "Well, I guess right now, the safest would be here. The purple lightning does not strike twice so quickly, so--" 
TRAVIS: The purple lightning? 
SAM: Them, the bad guys. 
MARISHA: It's a turn of phrase. 
LAURA: What's the purple lightning? 
TRAVIS: Is that what they're called? 
MATT: The storm, as you've seen, had purple-- 
LAURA: Oh, they had purple lightning? I didn't realize they had purple lightning. 
ASHLEY: I was like, what does that stand for? 
LAURA: Cool. 
MARISHA: So we are able to stay here for-- 
MATT: "For a bit. I guess, for right now, this would be one of the safest, because they are turned away from it, perhaps, but best to be hidden, just in case. But you should not stay long. They might be bringing others back to double check." 
MARISHA: How much longer till sunset, dusk-ish, when we should roll? 
MATT: Make a nature check for me as you glance out through the window. 
SAM: Could also ask Zhesh. 
MARISHA: I did ask Zhesh. 
MATT: You asked Zhesh? Sorry, I thought you were asking the GM. "Maybe another couple of hours." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: But they're moon hours. 
MARISHA: So 49 minutes. 
SAM: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Since we're killing time, you got some cool shit in here. What is it exactly that you do? I'm actually going to start looking at this shit now that clearly we're not being quite as chill. 
MATT: "We are crafters of the Ruidian glass. We make adornments. We make collectables. We make weaponry. We make whatever can be made from the glass." 
TALIESIN: Show off my ridiculous hammer. 
MATT: "Might I?" 
TALIESIN: Oh yes, please. 
MATT: "I have not seen this." 
TALIESIN: It's the same as this. 
MATT: "This is very unique." 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: "Looks like it was put together. Separate materials, two types." 
TALIESIN: Quite a few times, but most recently, yeah. 
MATT: "Hm, impressive." 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: "Should you ever want to get rid of it, let me know. I would be interested to work on it myself." 
TALIESIN: I will keep that in mind. 
MATT: You got a scythe last time. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: You do see there are little spears with glass pointed tips, like that obsidian chipping to a very, very fine razor edge on a lot of them. You see there are longshords-- Longswords, shortswords that are made of glass-- 
LAURA: Longshords. 
MATT: Longshordsh! 
LIAM: Jorts. 
TRAVIS: Long John Silver's. 
MATT: Shortswords. 
ASHLEY: Longjorts, shortjorts. 
MATT: I think you have yours. I put the scythe in your inventory. 
TRAVIS: Oh, did you? Okay. Ruidian glass scythe? 
MARISHA: Next character, wielding jorts. 
TRAVIS: (excited laughter) 
SAM: Jerts? 
LAURA: Glass jorts. 
ASHLEY: Long jerts. 
MARISHA: Jorts. 
MATT: "The strongest of the glasses--" 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: "The bits that are mined from the deepest sometimes have unique properties." She looks over and points to one of the blades on the wall and walks towards it, and as they slit their eyes at it, you watch the glass glow faintly. 
LAURA: What does it do? 
TALIESIN: I've got to walk over to this thing. 
TRAVIS: Fucking yeah, it glows when it's near a Ruidusborn or someone of natural psychic ability. 
MARISHA: Wait, your scythe? 
TRAVIS: The one that they're walking over towards. 
LAURA: Have you been underground? 
TRAVIS: But yeah, it does do that. 
MATT: "When I was younger, it was for a time easier to try and acquire these materials myself, but most of those mines are Imperium controlled, so." 
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh my fucking god. 
LIAM: How large is the blade that they're referring to? 
MATT: The one they were pointing to is a longsword. There's a shortsword over there as well. There's also a massive greatsword of its type. There's all sorts of tools made from it. It's a material that seems to be abundant and multipurpose, and, to what Zhesh has said, in certain situations and certain crafts can have occasional benefits. 
SAM: Just out of curiosity, in addition to the mood ring thing, the mood gem that I was curious about before, could you-- I'll whip out my saw blade. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: This saw blade, very cool, doesn't do very much damage. Is there a way that you could make a blade like this out of your material? 
TRAVIS: (quietly) Liam. 
MATT: "That is an interesting challenge." You see they look outside the window for a second. She looks back. "Let me see what I can do," and puts her hands out towards the blade. 
SAM: I will remove it and give it to-- 
MATT: Carefully sets it down, goes and puts her goggles arrangement on and begins to sketch out what it would look like and begins to go to work. 
LAURA: Sick. 
SAM: Good to know. Good to have, maybe. 
LAURA: That's really cool. 
MATT: The rest of you doing anything else? 
LIAM: What do you even sell these for? 
MATT: "We trade for resources, materials. You provided some of that gold material, which is extremely rare here on the surface." 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "Does not have worth in monetary currency, as I believe you Dreamers use, but it does have occasional uses as a softer material." 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
ASHLEY: What do you use? It's not monetary? 
MATT: "We are what you would call a barter type system." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Do you have any interest in-- I pull out a piece of platinum. 
MATT: "I mean, this is also occasionally useful, like all metals. Some have various strengths. Some have purposes based on that softness or hardiness. But nothing quite like the glass." 
TRAVIS: Do you know what makes the glass? How it's produced from within the moon? 
MATT: "Mm-mm. It's always been here, like all the other minerals. We don't make gold. We do not make platinum. We do not make glass. But we find and we mine it. The only renewable resource we have is bone, and that we get from hunting, from those we've lost." 
TRAVIS: Does it seem to push out of the ground? Grow? 
MATT: "Not to my knowledge. It's just always been there." 
MARISHA: Hang on, go back to the bone being a resource thing and getting it from those you've lost. 
TRAVIS: Hunting. 
MARISHA: Hunting? I thought I also heard those you've lost there at the end, kind of brushed over. 
MATT: "Some cultures on this moon remember our ancestors by crafting things from their remains to keep them nearby." 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I love that. 
MATT: "For some, it's a keepsake. For some, it's for protection. For some, it's to protect ourselves." 
ASHLEY: You use their bones? 
MATT: You watch as she pulls out this thin stiletto-like blade that is this sharpened, looks like a femur that's been ground to this fine point. The tip is slightly broken, but has been filed into two separate points with a groove down the center now. It's been broken and then remade in a way that still makes it useful. 
ASHLEY: I love that. I would absolutely make weapons out of all of your bones. 
TALIESIN: That's amazing. 
MATT: "This once belonged to my father." 
MARISHA: Please do! I like this. 
ASHLEY: That's a great idea. 
MARISHA: That's interesting. So, what are your death rites? Do you bury people, or is it generally-- 
MATT: "We take what is useful, and the rest we let the land reclaim." 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Mm. 
TALIESIN: I very much like that. 
ASHLEY: I do, too. 
MATT: "Often it helps us to keep the bane worms away." 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
SAM: The bane worms. 
MARISHA: Oh, because they eat the corpses. 
MATT: "Mm-hmm." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: The bane worms aren't related to the slithers, right? They're two different burrowing-- 
MATT: "Two different creatures." 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: How big are the bane worms? 
MATT: "(joyless laugh) Hope you don't find out." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I figured as much. If we happened upon one, is there anything that you would suggest as a way out, a way to deal with them? 
MATT: "Either don't move, or say your prayers." 
ASHLEY: Comforting. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Don't move it is. 
ASHLEY: Copy that. 
TALIESIN: Is there anything to wear? Is any of this-- I'm digging the vibe, and I'm not really looking for another weapon or otherwise, but boy, I like this stuff. 
ASHLEY: New fit? 
TALIESIN: I have these, too. I don't know if these are interesting. I pull out a handful of gems. 
MATT: Looks them over. "These are-- These are quite rare. You sure you want to be rid of these?" 
TALIESIN: Well, I-- 
LAURA: No, we don't. 
TALIESIN: What's the good of something valuable if you're not doing something with it? All I can do with this is get other valuable things. 
MATT: "You've already come in and, one, destroyed parts of the shop, but then also managed to keep all of our necks above water with the Imperium, and you seem to have strong-- Strong moralistic intent, and that is important. Most of what we make here is temporary. So if you see something of use," she reaches over and takes a handful of gems and rolls them in her hands for a second, "take what you need." 
LIAM: May I try the heft of one of these? 
MATT: "But of course." 
LIAM: Orym'll take the shortsword that is made of this, the color is blue? 
MATT: It's a blue green, almost a turquoise-ish tint, and it changes in the light when you look at it. 
LIAM: He starts to slowly go through the Zeph'aeratam. 
LAURA: Hey! 
LIAM: Yes. In the room, testing the weight of it. 
MATT: It's quite light. At first it feels off balance because the handle is heavier than the blade, but once you get a feel for it, it feels like it has very little resistance at all. You flick it, and you can feel it vibrate ever so faintly, picking up resonance of the vibration. It's interesting, as you step and walk, as you're swinging it, you see it almost glow for a moment. You look where it glows, and you step a little closer towards Imogen and Fearne, and as you step in that radius, that vibration intensifies, and you can see it give that faint glow. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: It's like-- 
LAURA: That's good. 
TALIESIN: It's very you. 
LAURA: If they have those, it might-- 
SAM: It would make killing Imogen so much easier. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: FCG! 
SAM: If we needed to! 
LAURA: Sure, yeah. 
SAM: If we needed to. 
LIAM: I don't have any gems. Have you ever had one of these? I Druidcraft a strawberry. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you're in for a treat. 
LIAM: I immediately grow another one. 
SAM: We're millionaires. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Start a fruit stand on Ruidus. 
MATT: "That is a memorable experience. Thank you." 
LIAM: How many of those memories would you need for this guy? 
MATT: "Well, your friends already paid for what you need in here, but I'll take as many as you're willing to give in the time that we have." 
TALIESIN: You're welcome. 
LIAM: I start to make a basket of strawberries. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'll help. I'll help you make some strawberries. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a strawberry. 
MATT: (berries tumbling out) 
LAURA: Those wands. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Do they-- 
MATT: Just like horse apples. 
LIAM: They pour out the door. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: The wands that we've seen people using, do they amplify powers that are already there or is it just about-- 
MATT: "I've only crafted the bases of the tips. The actual, the mechanism is beyond my skills. But from what I know, they at least need to be recharged by someone of mental capabilities." 
LAURA: Interesting. 
MARISHA: Do I see any type of tiny stiletto daggers, like really tiny? 
MATT: Yeah, you can see-- 
MARISHA: Like a letter opener? Something small? 
MATT: You see one that's a little larger than you'd want, but you think with a little bit of work, you could probably actually carve it smaller and still be functional. 
MARISHA: I take it off the shelf. Chetney, you think you can affix this to Sashimi's hands? 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MARISHA: Okay. (laughter) 
LIAM: Like Puppet Master. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, amazing. 
MARISHA: I want to give Sashimi a bladed hand. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (blades zing) 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: There are about five of those daggers available. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: If you wanted to grab a couple. 
MARISHA: If we have a few minutes. 
MATT: Yeah, you guys are resting here 'til dusk, while staying out of sight, and Zhesh working on your commission. 
LIAM: Do we have a couple hours here? 
MATT and LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm going to short rest. 
SAM: So, short rest. 
MARISHA: For sure. 
SAM: Also I wrote down from last session, we grabbed a box off of a cart. 
TALIESIN: We did. 
ASHLEY: Yes, the silver box or something? 
LAURA: Oh yeah! 
LIAM: Right. 
TALIESIN: Meat hole. 
LAURA: We need to disarm the magic on it. 
MATT: It's magically trapped. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
LIAM: We were going to-- 
SAM: That's why were going to do-- 
MATT: Magically locked. 
SAM: We were going to do Dispel Magic, which we-- 
LAURA: But we don't want to do it-- 
SAM: That's 'til tomorrow morning. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: We were about to do it, and then we heard people above us. 
TRAVIS: Matt, in addition to putting the blades on Sashimi, I'm also going to make a second toy. 
SAM: I don't have Dispel Magic until tomorrow, right? 
TRAVIS: It'll take an hour. 
MATT: Okay, you can do that. Yeah. 
SAM: We were going to try anyway. 
LAURA: I think Fearne has it. 
TALIESIN: I'm looking for either a nice necklace of any kind, preferably I love the black glass is great. Or, I also am a glove down because my right glove stopped fitting, and so I have not been wearing it, so if there's anything to start crafting something to wear on my very bare right hand at the moment. Which feels weird in general. 
MATT: Okay. They don't make attire here, but as part of one of the glass forges, there is a massive leather, thick leather gauntlet that is used for reaching into and out of the furnace. It's blackened and burned from years of use and it looks like it's-- There are other pairs that have since been utilized or brought to here that look like they're ready to use. There's one that looks like it's on its last legs that could be possibly affixed to your glove hand, or to your rock hand if you wanted to. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to do it up a little bit, but since, you know-- 
ASHLEY: I do have it. 
TALIESIN: -- already got the vibe. 
SAM: You do? 
ASHLEY: I do. I think we had talked about it. 
LIAM: There is leather working here then as well? 
MATT: There's minimal leather work done here. It's mainly just finishing off and affixing finished glass here. Most of the materials here are for glasswork intentionally. 
LIAM: Zhesh, do you have a sheath of leather for this blade? 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: "Sheaths, I do not have. But you could maybe find one, maybe take one. You seem to be very good at getting into trouble, and there is always things that can be recovered if you survive trouble." 
LIAM: Do we have any leather in the hole? 
SAM: We have skin. 
TALIESIN: Give it a couple weeks and there will be. (laughter) 
LAURA: We probably have some clothes though. 
ASHLEY: We could make something. 
TALIESIN: I'll also say there's-- 
LAURA: Weren't they wearing some clothing? 
MARISHA: Give it a couple weeks, and there will be. 
TALIESIN: In the meantime, it's not insane to get something made out of wood, which is very doable. Wooden sheaths are not unheard of. I've seen a couple before. 
MARISHA: He's making the toy. 
ASHLEY: Chet, could you make a wooden sheath? 
TRAVIS: Yes, indeed. I could just make a standard sheath or I could make a contour to a part of your body. It would just take a little extra time. 
SAM: Do you have enough wood to do that? You need enough wood to make these toys that we're going to give as bribes, right? 
TRAVIS: Yes, but I've been making them very small. It doesn't take much to create excellence. 
SAM: Now remember though, when we get over there, part of your mission is to bribe our friend, but also the other part of your mission is to establish an entity named Chetney Claus who lives on the moon and who gives presents to all the good boys and girls. 
TRAVIS: Chetney Clause, like a legal disclaimer? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Yeah, it's like a warning. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TRAVIS: Chetney Clause. 
MARISHA: Just like Tim Allen. 
TRAVIS: Setting up franchises. 
LAURA: It's the Chetney Clause. 
SAM: Yeah! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit him up for a necklace with some nice little black glass hooks and then probably a couple things from my ear and then-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, cool. 
TALIESIN: -- a few things to-- 
MATT: She can definitely do that. There's plenty of loose glass. 
TALIESIN: Just plain. 
MATT: You can see that a lot of it has been practice shaped. There are loose pebbles of glass, elements that have been sheared off bigger pieces, and that as, you know, cast off can be easily carved and made shapes. 
TALIESIN: I'm using the bag that the gems came in to grab a few pieces of glass. 
MATT: Okay, no worries. 
LAURA: Bag of gems. 
MATT: Easy enough to do so. 
TALIESIN: Excellent. 
SAM: If there's a way to do it, it might require some self examination, but I would love to affix a piece of glass on my chest that sort of shows my general mood. 
LAURA: Yeah, your mood gem. 
ASHLEY: Like a mood glass! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, in fact, how wide were those, did we get a bunch of daggers? Is that what they were? 
LAURA: Yeah, they were a bunch of little daggers. 
TRAVIS: Are they about an inch, two inch thick? How broad is the blade? 
MATT: The dagger is about three and a half inches long, but it can be flecked down. A lot of the glass has been, you know, bashed at the edges to create the fine point. 
TRAVIS: But in width? Super wide? 
MATT: Oh, wide? No. It's pretty thin. 
MARISHA: She now has dual blade hands. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! I'll actually get to work, and I'll use a file to create a slit through a piece of wood, then I'll create a little belt loop second edge on it so you can actually affix your holster wherever you-- 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
LAURA: Oh, nice. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
ASHLEY: Super cool. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: I like that. 
TRAVIS: Like a lowercase G. 
ASHLEY: Hey. 
SAM: Yes, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Yes, could you give me that silver box? 
SAM: (tune of "Silver Bells") ♪ Silver box ♪ Yes! 
TRAVIS: Ah! No! What?! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (screaming) (dies dramatically) 
LAURA: Should you take it down into the cellar? Just in case? 
SAM: Well she's got Dispel. 
LAURA: I know, but just in case. 
ASHLEY: I do. 
TALIESIN: Dispel doesn't-- 
SAM: Sure, sure, sure. 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to go down there. Just in case anything happens, I'll go down there so nobody gets hurt. 
LAURA: How far away from it can you be in order to Dispel it? 
ASHLEY: I can be pretty far. 
LAURA: So maybe we set it on its own and then you do that? 
ASHLEY: Great idea. 
LIAM: Do your thing from the top of the ladder. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Do my little fiddling from there? Okay. 
TALIESIN: Are we really-- Okay. We're doing this. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to put the silver box down there. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Go back up, and I'm going to Dispel Magic on it. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Is anyone watching the front door? 
SAM: Nope! 
TRAVIS: I'll go watch the front door. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, no. I mean, we would be. 
MATT: I imagine you guys have all been taking turns looking through the windows to see if any of the guardians come back. 
LIAM: We can say, because there's something I want to do, Orym has taken off his shirt, his armor, and I'm using Druidcraft-- 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
LAURA: (cat calls) 
LIAM: -- to slowly weave-- 
TALIESIN: Is it time to work out? 
LIAM: -- little tendrils of vine-- 
ASHLEY: No need to brag. 
TRAVIS: Talk about chiseled! 
LIAM: -- alongside my other sheath. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: So that I have a plant grasp for this second blade to go right alongside the other one. I'm doing that and looking out the window. 
LAURA: I'm going to use Prestidigitation to make-- ♪ (groovy tune) ♪ 
LIAM: Oh yeah. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Certainly. 
LIAM: Natural 20. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LIAM: So that's a 30. Whatever my passive is. 
MATT: (laughs) It's enough. 
LIAM: 31. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You can grow your own grip, too, on it, you can actually-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah! 
TALIESIN: You can trellis up that thing. 
MATT: You, keeping a pretty-- 
TALIESIN: Love it. 
MATT: -- vigilant eye as the coloration of the hazy, red dusted sky gets darker and darker, shifting to an evening purple before the moon sunset begins to take the horizon. Occasionally you see a few figures scooting by, none that catch your worry. You do see that troop that first came to the shop and hear the odd baying of the slithers, but they seem to be encircling the perimeter of this section of The Clutch and finishing out their building-by-building pass. They seem to have bought your ruse for the time being, though they're down one slither and a bit worried. (laughs) One of them just vanished. 
LAURA: He's wandered off. 
LIAM: I occasionally eat a strawberry. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Treshi scry ball. 
MATT: Treshi scry ball. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Tresh-shu-shu-shu. 
TRAVIS: Center of the city last time, right? 
MATT: Yep. Still setting in the center of the city, but shifting and moving. No proximity yet. As the sunset begins to crawl near, the sound of grinding and shifting towards the back of the glass forge, you see Zhesh working on both your saw and shaping some sort of a glass piece, smoothing it, until eventually you see her procure this beautiful little oval polished glass element. Turns to you, and working together, ends up loosely fixing it into your breastplate. To make it stay, she has to shape the space inside, which is a bit of hammering to make the space. It's a bit of a-- 
SAM: Ow. 
MATT: -- uncomfortable experience. 
SAM: Ow! 
MATT: But eventually gets to fit it inside. Indeed, you have this central gem now that sits in a way that compliments your chest adornment. 
SAM: Cool. 
LAURA: That's awesome. 
LIAM: It's purple, what does that mean? 
SAM: It's like right here. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: It's moving on its own, that's creepy. 
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool. 
SAM: There it is. It's pretty rough right now. 
TALIESIN: Some colorblind issues happening, though. 
ASHLEY: That's bad. 
LAURA: What do we do? How do we make that stop? How do we make you back to green or blue? 
LIAM: Do you need a reset or power down? 
TRAVIS: (reverberating bong) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Ah! (laughter) 
MATT: Zhesh also lifts this blade. It has less teeth on it. It's like there are six major, you know, saw teeth along the outside, but they are incredibly jagged, like six hooked shark fins in a row around. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: It has that imperfect-- 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Nice. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: -- natural glass texture to the outside. You worry if it'll even work, but as soon as she hands it over to you and you see where it bolts in similar, she studied very well the device that you affixed to your arm and did the best she could to make something function. She hands it to you and says, "Don't rightly understand how this functions with you, but this is the best approximation I could do with the time that was given." 
SAM: All right, I'm going to spin it up. 
MATT: At first, it kind of wobbles (rickety whirring) as it spins up, makes this high noise, and eventually it hits that perfect smooth bit when it moves fast enough. 
TRAVIS: Chetney, you need anything cut in half? 
TRAVIS: (smooth whirring) Reflexively, I'll throw a junk piece, like a square chunk of wood, and toss it up like a baseball. 
MATT: (forceful buzz) It cuts through it clean. 
SAM: Oh man. 
TRAVIS: (awed gasp) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Incredible! (ecstatic) Oh! 
SAM: It's just sawdust in the air. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I forgot what assisted woodworking can feel like! 
ASHLEY: That was beautiful. (laughter) 
SAM: Yeah, that's right! I could just sit here and you could just use me, like you could just-- 
TRAVIS: (moans joyfully) (laughter) 
SAM: Use me as a table saw! 
MARISHA: Table, yeah! 
ASHLEY: Yeah! (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's pretty great. 
MATT: It's about this time that you see Zhesh looking through the window. "It's about dusk. If you're going to make this happen, do it soon before the next watch takes over." 
LAURA: Which way is it? (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
SAM: Big tower. 
MATT: She points out towards the, not the direct center of The Clutch, but on what would be the left. Further on the left, you can see amongst the dozen or so main towers that poke out into The Banners, there's one that rises above them all. This thin needle point of a tower that has a number of banners that drift and flow with the wind behind it as it goes. "That one. That is the Overspoke. You'll find Earot there likely for the next hour or so, so hurry." 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "And--" 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: "-- good luck." 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Did we want to do the box right now? 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. Do the box, do the box. 
LAURA: Oh right. 
MARISHA: That's right. 
MATT: So, at this point as you're finishing up, you cast Dispel Magic. 
TRAVIS: (explosion) 
ASHLEY: (contained explosion) 
MATT: There's a flash of runes, like this network of rune-like webbing that appears around it, brightens, and then seems like shatters, like magical dust that then flitters away, leaving it dull and dark. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll grab it. I think it's gone. 
SAM: Wanna open it? 
TALIESIN: Chet, you want to take a look at it really quick to make sure that it's-- 
TRAVIS: It was locked last time, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: (soft ticking) 
TRAVIS: (cracking knuckles) 
LAURA: Does it have any traps? Check for traps still. What if there's a regular trap? 
TRAVIS: No, I don't want to. 
LAURA: (frustrated, resigned moan) 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: Go ahead and roll your thieves tools to do the physical lock on it as well. 
LAURA: (whispering) Guidance. 
ASHLEY: Guidance! 
TRAVIS: ♪ Sleight of hand ♪ 
ASHLEY: (quietly) Thank you. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: The what? Oh. 
MARISHA: Nailed it. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What that a d4? 
TALIESIN and MATT: d4. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's a d4. 
TRAVIS: Natural 19 plus one is 20, plus 11 is 31. 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Jesus Christ. 
TRAVIS: I built a lock pick. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah, you did. Yeah, the DC on this was 25. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
MATT: You find this lock, and it's a very intricate lock, and you can see it's designed to ensure that very few people can get into this through physical means, which is why the magical lock on top of it was just a fail-safe. But as you finish and pick the point, you hear the spring snap and it-- The latch, because it's a built-in lock, it's not a hanging one. it's built into the box, ends up getting stuck, and pulls open and the lid opens up. The interior is about maybe two feet by two feet, this box, and wedged in there with almost no room left, there is something wrapped in a dark velvet. 
SAM: It's a baby! 
MARISHA: It's a head. 
LIAM: Head. 
TRAVIS: Even though it's open and it's wrapped in velvet-- 
MARISHA: What's in the box? 
LAURA: It's a baby. 
TRAVIS: Can I look for any additional secondary traps inside? 
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check for me. 
TRAVIS: Just in case. 
ASHLEY: Oh, good idea. 
TALIESIN: Very good. 
TRAVIS: 10. 17. 
MATT: 17. You don't sense any other traps. 
LAURA: What is it? 
MATT: You pull back the velvet and you see this, you can only say it's beautiful in its simplicity. This odd device. It's this strange, hexagonal like-- 
LAURA: Ah! 
TALIESIN: Motherfucker! 
ASHLEY: No. 
TALIESIN: Sorry. Carry on. 
MATT: I don't-- Hold on. 
LIAM: We're just fascinated with you. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Apparently no. This hexagonal device with grooves and runic markings along the interior. You've seen and destroyed contraptions like this at the base of the Malleus Key that were causing those bursts of Dispel in the vicinity. But those were rougher. This is refined. This looks beautiful. It looks almost like arcane creation and art come together, and you've not quite seen anything like this. In all of your travels and all of your research, there's something about this that is wholly alien to your eye except for some similarities to some of the arcane devices that you had encountered around the base of the Malleus Key. 
TRAVIS: Is it mirrored? 
MATT: Hmm? 
TRAVIS: Like mirrored or polished, shined? 
MATT: Elements of it look polished. Other parts look like they've been a little roughed up. Like the part that you see is beautiful, but you can see there's some aging, there's some damage on the edges and corners. Like it's either had a rough journey here or it's maybe old. You're not sure. 
MARISHA: How big is it? 
MATT: It's about this big. Like the box-- 
TRAVIS: Hexagonal. 
MATT: Huh? Yeah, from what you can see on top. It's just inside, it has a hexagonal shape. 
SAM: The ones in the bottom of the Malleus Key, they dispelled magic? Wait, what? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: They were sending out pulses. 
MATT: Pulses that dispel. 
TRAVIS: I'll reach in and I'll try to lift it out of the box. 
MATT: It is extremely heavy, but you're fairly strong. 
TRAVIS: You bet your ass. 
MATT: You pull it up, and as you do, you can see the top of it is almost like a shelf. As you pull it up underneath, there's all manner of-- It almost reduces into coils and additional bits of runic configurations around it. As you pull it free and lift it up, the rest of you see it's not elven, but there's definitely arcane design to it. 
MARISHA: Can I read the runes with my Eyes of the Rune Keeper? 
MATT: Indeed. This would be a very, very strong piece of abjuration magic. It looks like-- Make an investigation check for me. 
SAM: Guidance. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: I hold it up and I aim it at Ashton. 
MARISHA: (laughs) (whirs) 
LAURA: You're like, "Yeah, it's--" 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. 
TRAVIS: Hold on! 
MARISHA: Sure, okay, Guidance. 
SAM: Give it to Ashton. Ashton'll eat anything. 
TRAVIS: You always got to test it on the barbarians. 
MARISHA: Yeah, true. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Cocked. 
TRAVIS: (snapping) 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Yes ma'am! 
LAURA: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
MARISHA: Natural 20. For a total of? 
MARISHA: 22. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: With my one that I rolled on the Guidance. 
MATT: This is, okay. This is part of something. It is not a whole piece. This is a section of very strong abjuration magic. It looks like it is-- It's not about protective abjuration magic, it's about disrupting abjuration magic. 
LIAM: Oh, opening a seal. 
LAURA: (gasps) Waking him up. This is to help wake him up. 
MARISHA: Don't wake daddy. 
LIAM: Whatever's got him locked. 
MATT: It's not constructed. The more you look at it, this looks very old, and a lot of the runes along the sides of this, you've only seen in one other place, in the inside of Imahara Joe's shop when hanging on a chain hook, your friend FCG was laid bare and you realize this is likely Aeorian technology. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: And we're going to go to break. (shouting) 
MATT: So we'll come back here. 
TRAVIS: Put it in your body, see what happens! 
SAM: Mama? (laughter) 
MATT: We'll come back here in a few moments and pick up the second half here and whatever transpires from there. So see you here shortly. (exclaiming)

LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Oooh, so comfy cozy. I mean the Traveler always says, impulse purchases are a good decision. Style should never be a dump stat, Darling. Could anything be more perfect? Oooh, look at this. Look at the details, oooh. Look at this. Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here. This is a lot of stuff, you guys. We have so many cool things right now. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
TALIESIN: Catastrophe lies at the edge of the Vastchasm for any circle daring enough to tempt fate, though when stakes are high, great risk is a calculation worth taking. A long lost and dangerous relic has surfaced from the depths of time. The assignment we've handed to our investigators is simple: Parley with the dealer, recover the artifact, and return to the Pharos. But a circle is at its most vulnerable when a threat is underestimated. And for those lucky enough to return home, Serenity awaits. The Circle of the Crimson Mirror: Assignment #4149, Seeking Serenity. 
Oh hey, it's us. Your friendly neighborhood ambiguous shadowy weirdos here to say cryptic things at you as usual. Are you ready for the third and final season of Midst? We certainly are. Some of you have been waiting a very long time. Good news: the wait is almost over. Midst, man. What the heck? A lot of questionable characters doing incredibly problematic things to each other in a series of increasingly insane escalating circumstances while struggling to follow their warped moral compasses and do what they think is hopefully the right thing. Can the Trust get… worse somehow? Can Phineas get less worse? How much longer can Lark outrun her past? Are there any objectively good guys in this story? Other than Moc Weepe. How can any of these threads possibly be resolved with only one more season to go? And we STILL don't even know what happened with that dang moon. Are we ever gonna get some ANSWERS? Yes. As a matter of fact… we will. The third and final season of Midst unfolds February 14th. Listen to the pure sound experience anywhere you stream podcasts or watch illustrated video episodes on the Critical Role YouTube channel. In the meantime, you can follow us at @midstpodcast or join the Fold on Midst.co to get early access to episodes, behind the scenes bonus content music downloads, digital artwork, and more. Everything's been leading to this. We'll be with you to the end. Do you Trust us?

NARRATOR: Holly Mistletoe thought she had it all. HOLLY: As you can plainly see, sales are up 7%. NARRATOR: But when she finds herself back in her hometown for a very special holiday. HOLLY: I can't believe I have to come back to my hometown, it's so provincial. (gasps) Seamus? Seamus O'Shamrock? I didn't know you still lived here. You own and operate a small, charming coffee and pastry shop? SEAMUS: Only when I'm not raising horses. NARRATOR: She'll discover just how much her life was missing. HOLLY: Has anyone ever told you you're a really good baker? SEAMUS: Has anyone ever told you you're more adorable than the custom emotes you can use in Critical Role's professionally moderated chat with a Twitch subscription? Happy Valentine's Day. NARRATOR: This holiday season, or that holiday season, or whatever holiday season it might be. HOLLY: What is it? SEAMUS: Void Tech is going to foreclose on the horse ranch. HOLLY: They can't do that, not on the 4th of July! (fast string music) HOLLY: With the proceeds from our wholesome Halloween haunted house, we can raise enough money to save the horse ranch from your greedy company, Mr. Fatstacks. MAXAMILLIAN: Damn you, Mistletoe. If it hadn't been for your big city business savvy, I would've been able to fool those small town provincial bumpkins! SEAMUS: We may be provincial, but we have values. MAXAMILLIAN: (scoffs) SEAMUS: Like watching episodes of Critical Role before they go on YouTube with a Twitch subscription! MAXAMILLIAN: Fiddle faddle! (grunts) NARRATOR: Stand up and celebrate. MAXAMILLIAN: I eat my feelings! (growls) NARRATOR: Make every day a holiday. HOLLY: Oh, okay. Boop. (giggles) SEAMUS: (sneezes) HOLLY: No. NARRATOR: And give the gift of love. HOLLY: (gasps) Is this? (soft electronic zap) SEAMUS: A subscription to Critical Role. I can gift those with my Twitch subscription to Critical Role. HOLLY: Yes. NARRATOR: Laura Bailey as Holly Mistletoe. HOLLY: Don't be violent, that's not romantic. NARRATOR: Travis Willingham is Seamus O'Shamrock, and featuring Sam Riegel as Maxamillian Fatstacks in "A Holiday Subscription for Love. The Ballad of Mistletoes and Shamrocks: Part 2." (lively orchestral music)

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. All right so, as-- (laughs) As you've been set on your path this evening, you have your equipment that you've gathered, your materials that you requested, and it looks like dusk is upon Kreviris. Those of you who got glass weaponry, you can put those into your-- 
SAM: Yeah! (laughs mischievously) 
TRAVIS: Inventory? 
MATT: I put some of it in your inventory during the break. You can see what the general benefits of it are. 
MARISHA: Oh, you put it in there? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Well, I put it in the-- You can put it on your character sheet. But you put Ruidian glass, like dagger, shortsword, buzzsaw. 
SAM: Cool, cool. This is awesome. 
TRAVIS: Scythe. 
MATT: Scythe. But yeah, essentially-- 
LIAM: Scythe! 
MATT: -- it critically hits on a 18 to 20, but every time you crit you have to roll. On a one to six-- 
ASHLEY: That's so cool. 
MATT: -- it shatters and is destroyed because it's glass. 
LAURA: That's so cool. 
MATT: And it has some benefits if it's the radius of somebody with psychic natural ability. 
LAURA: Some benefits? Like it upgrades it? 
MATT: Yeah, it gets a little extra boost. 
ASHLEY: A boost? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: They are psychically resonant. 
LAURA: Wow! 
TRAVIS: It dampens their intelligence. 
LAURA: So wait, if y'all are near me with it, then it's going to fuck up my spells? 
SAM: No, it's more likely to hit our target. Also, if we do hit, then that target has disadvantage on some saving throws. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it would have to be directed at you. 
LAURA: Oh, got it. 
TRAVIS and SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: But does that mean that-- 
TRAVIS: If they hit you with one-- 
LIAM: Since we're almost always in proximity to 'Mogen, that it's always amped up? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, unless you move outside of the radius. 
LIAM: Right. Right, right, right. 
MATT: But you also aren't the only ones with these weapons. 
LIAM: Sure. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. Zhesh begins to usher you out into the evening. 
TRAVIS: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The piece! 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: The Aeorian piece, we should put it in the bag of holding or the hole or something. I mean, it's like-- 
TALIESIN: Well, I'd assume that we'd put it into the-- 
MATT: Yeah, it's a chunk. It will not fit in the bag of holding. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Ah. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Because it's familiar-ish, well, it looks like some of my circuitry, I'm going to inspect it a little bit and see if there's anything, I don't know, anything that I sense or can glean from it. 
MATT: Make an arcana check for me. 
SAM: An arcana check? 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: We'll get the hole unfolded. 
TALIESIN: Oh, we are-- 
SAM: Guidance myself. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: There you go. 
TALIESIN: That's how we got it out-- 
SAM: Self-guidance. 
TALIESIN: -- in the first place. 
SAM: Ooh! Come on, where's the d4s? 
TALIESIN: We're going to have to clean that thing, seriously. 
SAM: Oh, here it is. 
TRAVIS: Kind of. 
TALIESIN: It's real bad. 
SAM: Okay, arcana. 22. 
MATT: 22, okay. Between what Laudna had gleaned originally and you jumping off of that point as well, indeed, this is a type of abjuration that is reverse to the intent of a lot of abjuration magical protective networks. Instead, it is intended to interface with and scramble other types of magic that might exist out there. Like that Dispel wave technology you saw before, this one, it looks like it has the intent to diminish or prevent or interrupt some other kind of magic. 
LIAM: Some sort of disruptor. I mean, what? 
MATT: (laughs) You might have to find somebody with a stronger knowledge of arcana to get more details. 
SAM: Devexian. 
LAURA: You need to find someone Aeorian. 
SAM: I need to find a robit man. 
MARISHA: I mean, we know a robot man. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. Devexian. 
TALIESIN: We know a couple. 
SAM and LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We know a few robits. 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, finally. 
TRAVIS: I hand out the little dagger sheaths-- 
SAM: Finally, I'm going to get the D. 
TRAVIS: -- for everybody. 
ASHLEY: We each get a dagger? 
TRAVIS: A little dagger sheath, just a little clip. 
ASHLEY: A little shagger death ("deeth"). 
TRAVIS: Yeah, so if you want to keep it on outside your person-- 
MARISHA: Shagger death? 
ASHLEY: A shagger death? 
TRAVIS: -- you can. 
ASHLEY, MARISHA, and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: So that if you keep it on your hip and that way one of them starts to glow-- 
LIAM: That's a great album. 
ASHLEY: That's a good name. 
LIAM: That's a great album name. 
LAURA: Do we all have shaggers? 
MATT: Now, interesting point. 
ASHLEY: Do we all have shagger deaths? 
MATT: These always glow in the radius of-- 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: -- Imogen and Fearne. 
LAURA: How close do they have to be to us in order-- 
TRAVIS: 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet. 
SAM: So my buzzsaw is glowing all the time now? 
MATT: Faintly. 
SAM: Shit. 
MATT: It's not a massive bright light, but it does give off a faint glow to it. 
LAURA: Gives us away. 
ASHLEY: So if we have a shagger death it's glowing on us at all times? 
TRAVIS: Well, it doesn't really gives us away. 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I doesn't give us away. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, remember Reilorans have this stuff. 
TALIESIN: City like this-- 
TRAVIS: Their stuff is all glowing. 
LAURA: Theirs is all glowing, too. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay. 
LIAM: Right. 
SAM: Matt, I don't know where I got it, but in my inventory it says that I have a black negligee. 
MATT: Yeah? 
SAM: I don't know where I got this in the campaign. 
TALIESIN: It was supposed to be a surprise! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
LIAM: Happy ninth anniversary. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what? 
TRAVIS: Happy ninth! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Enjoy-- 
SAM: I guess we found it somewhere. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm going to wrap my-- 
LIAM: Is nine years lingerie? 
ASHLEY: I can't remember what that's from. 
SAM: Wrap up my buzzsaw in it. 
ASHLEY: A black negligee? 
SAM: In a teddy. 
MATT: Yep. (laughter) 
MATT: That checks out. 
SAM: So it doesn't glow. 
TRAVIS: Give it a little camo wrap? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: A little ghillie suit? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Perfect. I'm not going to say easily done, but done nevertheless. 
ASHLEY: Little lacy ghillie suit? 
TRAVIS: Little lacy ghillie suit. 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You're hiding your buzzsaw now. 
LIAM: So Madonna. 
MARISHA: I really want to see the art. A bra wrapped around FCG's hand. 
ASHLEY: A little black lacy number. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: A little teddy. 
TALIESIN: (sexy buzzsaw whirring) (laughter) 
LIAM: And it is shredded. 
SAM: Crotch-less. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) (laughter) 
MATT: There's parentheses next to the title. 
SAM: Uh-huh. (laughter) 
MATT: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Out into the night? 
TALIESIN: Out into the night. 
SAM: Oh yeah, we got to go to the tower. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Everything that's iffy is in the hole now. 
MATT: As you guys are all gathering in the front, Zhesh goes, "Good luck. If you are to help the Volition, you'll need it. If all else goes well, maybe we won't see each other again." 
TRAVIS: That's fair. 
MARISHA: Thank you for all your help. 
MATT: "Make sure it was not in vain," and pushes you out the door, closes it, locks it, bolts it. 
LIAM: We're rocking our Vanguard look still at this point, yeah? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace? 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
LAURA: So that we blend in a little bit? 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: Yep, great idea. 
MARISHA: All right, we head towards the tower. 
LAURA: How about that Treshi scry ball? 
MATT: Still below you, somewhere beneath. 
SAM: Beneath. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: In the same central location? 
MATT: More or less. The ball doesn't have extreme GPS coordinates, but you can gauge, much like you were with Fearne lost in the rock, you can gauge where the placement is from the center of the sphere from where the target is from you. She's below and a little bit left. 
LIAM: Yeah, there's got to be some sort a sage around. 
TRAVIS: Make sure you update that OS when we sleep. 
SAM: It doesn't give you the address until you book the Airbnb. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Yeah, that's the one. 
MARISHA: Turn it on and off again. I'm going to keep checking it and especially as we're moving towards the tower. I want to see if we're moving towards her or away. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Okay, fair enough. 
LIAM: If she's super deep, it's not going to change a lot, and if she's higher up it will. 
MARISHA: No, which is-- Well, it'll still be good to know. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. Trekking through the street, are you darting from shadowy corner to shadowy corner, or are you walking with confidence as Vanguard members? 
TRAVIS: Confidence. 
SAM: Confidence? 
LAURA: Yeah, because do they have-- 
TALIESIN: Confidence. 
LAURA: Could we gather, when we were listening in on those others, we didn't hear much of the conversation, but did it sound like they had descriptions of us, or they just knew it was a group? 
MATT: You didn't pick-- You only picked up bits of the conversation, and you didn't hear anything about descriptions. 
TRAVIS: I heard some like "three of them" at one point. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, well, we killed three of them. 
TALIESIN: Killed three of them. 
MATT: Yeah. So you're uncertain. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But if you're all walking with confidence, I'd like a group deception check, please. 
SAM: Group decepsh. 
TALIESIN: (groans) Really? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Really? Oh boy. This is not going to go well. 
LIAM: Stealth would be much better. 
TALIESIN: Please, I was going to say, are we not doing stealth, really? 
LAURA: No, we're deceiving. 
MATT: For this one, just deception. 
TALIESIN: Okay, this is going to suck on my end. 
MATT: Mind you, it's not a high DC, but mixing it up a little since we're not doing the stealthy approach, necessarily. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: All right, so across the board here, we got? 
TRAVIS: Six. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: 20. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: 15. 
MATT: 15. 
ASHLEY: 13. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LAURA: For a 29. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: Dang. 
LIAM: 18. 
MATT: 18. 
TALIESIN: Four. 
MATT: Four. 
TALIESIN: I warned you. 
LAURA: Far ("four"). 
TALIESIN: Far. 
SAM: Far. 
TALIESIN: (Pirate-y) Arr. Oye. 
MATT: You aren't bothered by anybody that crosses your path, and few do. At this point, there is no sign of a storm and it's actually a beautiful clear night. The stars are out. You can see a number of the people of Caeluma Kreviris have come out here to look at the stars. You can see shifting shapes and you immediately go defensive. But as you watch, you can see some of the families of this poorer, more destitute region of the city come out in clusters and light little fires and look up at the sky, many of them glancing up at the massive Blue Promise that lays now bound above them. It's beautiful, but also oddly solemn. Not quite certain what the Blue Promise is promised to these many people or if they're even part of what the Imperium's interests are. But they seem to be finding moments of happiness they have and while your initial impressions of the Reilorans and the people of this moon were militant and dangerous, here, you're reminded that every people is not a monolith. There is a lot of complication and, for lack of a better term, humanity here in this desolate space of the moon as well. It makes you miss home a little bit. Using the description from Zhesh, you eventually weave through The Clutch and come to the base of a structure that has three different tiers of clustered homesteads along this tower with an outer spiral staircase that winds up. You can see there are all manner are these tight, stretched banners and bridge walkways that connect to other rooftops and nearby smaller towers that you can certainly attempt to ascend. It looks like there are three posted guards along the base that are walking, patrolling. At the very top, it's like the tiniest little crow's nest where you can see those banners are flapping in the light breeze. Right now, there's no storm to give you any cover, but also with the lack of dangerous weather, there's a peace and an almost sense of a lack of danger at the moment. What would you like to do? 
LAURA: Did we get a description of what Earot looked like, or--? 
MATT: No. 
SAM: Tower guard. 
LAURA: That probably would've been smart. 
SAM: Turncoat, Overspoke. That's all I wrote down. 
LIAM: Yeah, what the purpose of this tower is. 
LAURA: So we can get a look at the-- 
LIAM: I know why we want it, but what does the tower serve? What's its purpose? 
LAURA: We didn't find that out. 
LIAM: Was that explained to us? 
MATT: Best that you know is it's a military watch point-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: -- for the Dominion of Cruth. 
LIAM: So if we want to try to talk, we have to convince them to let us ascend the security tower. 
LAURA: Yeah, and Earot is the one that's blocking the way, right? So is there one, is there a guard at the bottom? 
LIAM: Yeah, two or three you said? 
MATT: Yeah, there's two near the bottom that are patrolling and there's one that's halfway up. It's walking around the, it's like a central disc balcony that surrounds the exterior of it. You can see that he's walking around and keeping watch. 
LIAM: So yeah, we need to do some really good convincing or some quiet take downs. 
TALIESIN: Convincing would be better. 
LIAM: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Who's convincing? I mean, Chetney's bribing, right? 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, with the gift. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's at the end. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It doesn't hurt to just go up and ask for Earot and see if we can-- 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: All of us or just a couple? 
LAURA: I can walk up. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: Guidance. 
LAURA: Thanks. 
TRAVIS: In fact, I actually don't need to present the toy. You could present it. 
LAURA: Oh, I could? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: You're Chetney Claus. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Chetney Clawz with a Z. But keep it under this piece of fabric before you give it to him. 
LAURA: All right, I'll put it in the fabric in my pouch. 
TRAVIS: Don't look at it. 
SAM: But also-- 
LAURA: All right. When you give it to him, say the Chetney Claus gave it to you. 
LAURA: Sure, sure. 
SAM: He's a jolly old elf. 
LAURA: Chetney Claus, that's the most important part of all this. 
TRAVIS: He sees you when you're sleeping. He sees you when you're awake and when you're doing other things by yourself that you could do with a partner. 
SAM: Chetney Claus only looks at you when you masturbate. (laughs) (laughter) 
LIAM: It is Jesus! (laughter) 
MATT: I will also note-- 
ASHLEY: So when you're masturbating, does that mean-- 
TRAVIS: I see you. (laughter) 
MATT: At these dusk hours, the light is minimal. It's not quite full nighttime yet. But even from that vantage point, somebody who has keen vision or somebody who can acquire keen vision under darker circumstances would also be helpful. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: You can see in the dark. 
MARISHA: I can. 
LAURA: Come with me. 
MARISHA: All right. Ooh. Maybe this is going to be so romantic. 
LAURA: I know, it's kind of like a little date. We haven't got one of these. 
MARISHA: I know, not in so long. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so who's going up? 
LAURA: Me and Laudna. 
MATT: Two of you? 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: Okay. So the rest of you are just hanging back, playing sentinel here a little ways off from the base of the tower? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I-- No, no, keep going. 
LAURA: Yeah? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. The rest of you post up out of the way. The two of you, any preparation before you approach? 
SAM: I've Guided her. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Do you want to leave Pâté with us or no? 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. I'll tell Pâté to go invisible and stay with them so I have eyes down here. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Maybe if it comes to talking, if this Earot is-- 
MATT: That's all right. I'm going to stare at you. 
LIAM: If you tell middleman, middle person, that he's expecting you and you have the delivery, maybe that'll send the message. 
LAURA: Who's expecting me? 
LIAM: Earot. 
LAURA: Okay. Sure, I'll walk up to the person in front of the door. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: At the entrance, is there someone at the entrance? 
MATT: You do not a door entrance to this tower. There's an outer spiral staircase that crawls up the center. 
LAURA: Oh, I was thinking the staircase was somewhere-- 
MATT: There are layers and platforms climbing up from there that have banners and bridges that pour off of it. 
LIAM: It's a tower play set. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: All right, so we can start making our way up. 
ALL: ♪ Makin' my way ♪ 
LAURA: Up the stairs? (creaking) 
MATT: As you approach the base of the steps, one of the patrols comes up to you and immediately comes up in a huff. You can see they're having these heavier gray robes that are wrapped around them. At first, they look like they're lost in them, like they're a little too big for their size. You realize this is a younger Reiloran. They're less elongated and the crest on the head is a little shorter. You see this is probably a newer recruit, probably in their early twenties or so, runs up and looks at you, a little wide-eyed for a second with recognition, and speaks into your mind. "I didn't realize you were coming." 
LAURA: Yes, I need to get to the top. 
MATT: "Of course." 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
TRAVIS: That's so cold. Ice cold. 
ASHLEY: You have Guidance. 
LAURA: Oh, right, right, right. 
LIAM: Gweedance. 
LAURA: Gweedance. 
ASHLEY: Gweedance. 
LAURA: Gweedance. 
MATT: You have advantage in this. Of course you have advantage in this. You look kind of like your mom. 
LAURA: Okay, Gweedance. Wait, where's my fours? Where's my damn fours? There's one. 
TALIESIN: We're okay. 
LAURA: Wow, I missed that. Okay. (laughter) 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: (whooshes) 18, okay. 
LAURA: Oh, that was such a better roll than what I-- (laughter) 
MATT: Oh, well, 18. Steps aside and looks-- You can sense the dark eyes looking at you out of the corner-- 
LAURA: In his head, he's going to hear: Stop looking at me. 
MARISHA: I'm going to fall into this role like I'm her bodyguard. 
MATT: Yep, doesn't even acknowledge you. 
MARISHA: Great. 
MATT: Is just-- "(clears throat)" Loudly swallows, as you begin to ascend the steps curving around. The second patrol and the second bit hears the footsteps and begins to walk over approach. You hear off the side, "Psst." Looks over the side and the first guard goes like-- Looks over and sees you both approach, gives an acknowledged nod and then steps away towards the edge of the tower and look-- Looks up at you as you both walk by. 
LAURA: In your head, you hear: How long you think we'll be able to keep this up? 
MARISHA: As long as it serves us I hope. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Your mom is really important. 
LAURA: Yeah, I've gathered. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: You ascend the ever climbing tower and it becomes this perpetual spiral that begins to grow exhausting. At a certain point, you've now climbed seven or eight stories of spiral stairs and you feel a sweat beginning to creep into your robes. As much as the temperature gets much colder here at night, it's quite a heavy drop in temperature, you still find yourself hot from exertion of getting up to the top. But eventually you clamber towards the final bit of that tip where you can see the basket-like crow's nest peak of the Overspoke sits and the singular point goes to an actual spike point to the very top. As you approach, you can see those blue glass lanterns that are affixed throughout the city that you see occasionally hanging from places. They're dull, but as you step underneath them and get within a certain radius, they glow. 
LAURA: That's so cool. 
MATT: You immediately begin to get the sense that maybe these lanterns are proximity-based. As soon as they glow, a voice goes, not into the air around you but the minds of both you, "Hello? Who's there?" 
LAURA: Earot? 
MATT: "Yes?" You look up and you can see over the edge, there's someone looking over down at both of you. 
MARISHA: What does he look like? 
MATT: From what you can tell at a quick glance, Reiloran. Looks a little hunched, lanky-looking. Looks like he's carrying a book in one hand that's clutched in an arm and has straps and what looks like a heavy spyglass and a walking stick leaning up to the edge. Someone who's posted in solitary watch over the highest tower in the city. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MATT: He's unexpected an arrival. 
LAURA: I need access. 
MATT: "What for?" 
LAURA: It's none of your business. 
MATT: He gives you a look. Make a deception check. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
LIAM: Do we even need the toy? 
MARISHA: I know, we could save it if we don't need to. 
LAURA: With advantage? 
LIAM: Yeah, save it for another day. 
MATT: Not for this guy, this guy's a little more discerning. 
TRAVIS: The toy is already working. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay. 25. 
MATT: 25. "Of course. I--" 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Bless you. 
LIAM and SAM: Stop it. 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: "I serve the Imperium." He closes the book, quickly hides it and takes the walking stick and stands up and steps to the side as you both continue to ascend the steps until you get to the peak of the interior where he is, and he stands there. 
LAURA: With my back to him-- 
MATT: A big, toothy grin. As we look out, he's going to hear in his head: Earot, this is nobody's business but ours. 
MATT: He gives you a keen turn of the head. (stammering) "Of course. (laughs nervously)" 
LAURA: I'll turn my back and look out. We're looking for-- I don't even know what the fuck we were looking for. 
MARISHA: Purple house, look for a purple house. 
LAURA: Purple house, we're looking for-- Oh, it's dark. How are we going to find purple when it's-- 
MARISHA: That's why I'm here. 
LAURA: Okay, great. 
SAM: To remind her of the point of the mission. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Now, mind you-- 
LAURA: I was trying to get us up here. 
MATT: Interesting point. Darkvision doesn't have a lot of strong color. 
MARISHA: Still has a the range? 
SAM: Oh, shit. 
MATT: It's a lot of grayscales and stuff, so it's not impossible because it's not night. 
MARISHA: I know, I told him already. 
SAM: Shit. 
MATT: No, but what I'm saying is-- 
MARISHA: I have-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- you have a lower DC than most to see it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: But even so, you're at the highest point. You have this massive city around you. Are you going to glance over the edge and look around? 
LAURA: Yeah, we're trying to find purple fabric, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Deep purple paint, I think. 
LAURA: I don't want to lean over the edge. Can we stand back from the edge so that if you look up, you don't see us? 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Didn't we have a fucking spyglass? 
LIAM: Fearne has one. 
ASHLEY: I do. 
LIAM: I have really good eyes. 
MATT: You did see one hanging around the neck of Earot. 
LIAM: You can see in the dark. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: (snaps fingers) Earot. 
MATT: "Mm-hmm?" 
LAURA: I need your spyglass. 
MATT: "Of course. (nervous chuckle)" Lifts it off, and it's this long, it looks like a scroll case that's segmented and as he hands it over to you-- 
LAURA: I'm going to use my telekinetic hand to pull it over to me. 
SAM: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MARISHA: Sick. 
LIAM: Boss bitch 
LAURA: Hand it over to you. 
MATT: Interesting point of order, too. Earot seems much more tactile than other members of the Imperium that you've noticed. Many, they lord their psychic whims with almost an air of superiority. He seems much more tactile and hands it over to you. 
LAURA: He's reading a book, I like him. 
MARISHA: I know, I like him, too. All right, I'm going to do a scan. I'm going to try, and knowing that the Volition is going to be on the outskirts, I'm going to try and go far and see if I find something that looks like this on the outer rings. 
MATT: Sure. All right, now it's going to take a little bit of time to do this but you can continue to do a pass. Go ahead and roll a perception check for me. 
LIAM: Come on. 
MARISHA: (nervous exhale) I'm glad I got advantage on all this shit because I sucked in a ring. 
LAURA: While she's looking, I'm going to turn around and stare at him so I can see what he's doing. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
SAM: Is he reading a Reiloran-- 
MARISHA: Fuck yes. 
SAM: -- translation of "Tusk Love," by the way? 
LAURA: Oh my god. Or "The Trials and Tribulations?" 
LIAM: It's been localized. 
TRAVIS: "Der Katzenprinz." 
MARISHA: 24. 
MATT: It says "Tusk Romance." (laughter) 
MATT: It's didn't quite make the full translation over here. 
LIAM: "Teeth Romance." 
SAM: "Teeth Romance." 
MATT: A lot of interpretive, dream-based recollections. (laughter) 
MARISHA: "Teeth Romance." 
ASHLEY: A real nail-biter. 
MARISHA: 24. (laughter) 
MATT: 24! 24 is great. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Romance, teeth, ro-ro-romance ♪ 
MARISHA: I rolled an 18. 
MATT: Within three minutes of doing a scan, many of the banners here, a lot of the color is washed away from sunlight, from dust and storms and a lot of Caeluma Kreviris, the surface city, has this dull reds and browns and grays to it washed over with time to where there's not a lot of color that pops, which does make it easier to catch your attention to what looks like a single purple flag, a tiny little flag that's off in the outskirts by this massive pile of freshly excavated red and brown dirt. You can see what looks to be a metallic gate that's pressed into part of the rock wall on what would be the far right-hand side of the city's encased crown of mountain range of the valley it sits in. But you can see this little flutter of purple flag that drifts in that area. 
MARISHA: I think I found it. 
SAM: So great. 
MARISHA: I pass the spyglass over to Imogen and guide to see if she sees what I see. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wait, it's a little heavy in the front. Hang on, let me, hang on. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Turn it around, turn it around. 
SAM: "Everything looks smaller." 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: I can't see anything, I can't see anything. 
MATT: It takes a moment to find it and you do figure it out and at first, you want to make sure to compare and contrast, so you scan other areas to make sure there isn't other purple that's brighter or anything. But indeed, you find flecks of color out there but a lot of it's muted with time and erosion. Indeed, this does stand out. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: Not to a distractingly, beacon-like degree, like "look here," but definitely seems to bear the symbol you're looking for. 
LAURA: Can we see a path to it from where we are, the roads we would need to take? 
MATT: Yeah, you can glance down and see the shortest paths, the safest paths, the most hidden paths. You have different options at your disposal. 
LAURA: Great. 
MARISHA: All right, I guess we got what we need. 
LAURA: We head back down, right? 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: Did you give him a present? 
LAURA: We don't even need to. 
LIAM: No, save it, save it. 
SAM: But-- But Chetney Claus. 
LAURA: Don't. 
SAM: You have to start the myth. 
MARISHA: We already have with the children. 
LAURA: I don't want to use up his stuff. I love that you guys can be on the ground and we can still have conversations. 
SAM: Toys are meant to be shared. 
ASHLEY: Wait, but remember that they said that he was in it for personal gain and he wants presents? 
LAURA: Well yeah, but he also thinks I'm his boss right now. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LIAM: So Volition, right? 
ASHLEY: Volition? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Do you trust him? 
LAURA: No. I'll put the spyglass back on his chest and pat his shoulder. 
MATT: "(sighs)" 
LAURA: Good work, son. 
MATT: "It is a pleasure to have you on my tower. (chuckle)" 
LAURA: I wasn't here. 
MATT: "Of course, no, nothing, not at all." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Then I'll head down. 
LIAM: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: As she-- 
TRAVIS: So bad. 
MARISHA: -- shoulder-check him a little bit on the way out. 
LAURA: Does your shoulder come out of the socket? 
TALIESIN: Your shoulder pops out. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
MATT: "(groans)" He's bleeding. (laughter) 
LIAM: Stabs right into his rib. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, you descend and at this point, now you can see a few of the other patrol guards are gathered at the bottom talking and as you approach, they all whisper quietly and it seems like a few of the folk have come to see the woman. 
MARISHA: You know, Chetney's-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- toy might come in-- 
LAURA: I might bust that out. 
MARISHA: -- handy now. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
MATT: As you begin to descend, the central guard you first passed stocks back up and as you hit the bottom, the first patrol, still making sure he doesn't look you directly in the eye, takes his position and some of the other ones scatter off a bit and they're all trying to play it off like they're doing their patrol, but you can see there's three more gathered patrol that are just awkwardly in the area catching glances over in your direction. You oddly feel there's a sense of mythology that's been woven here around your mother, at least her interactions here on the moon as of late. People are drawn to catch a glimpse. 
MARISHA: You're famous. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MARISHA: Well, not you. You're not famous, your mother's famous, but that in turn kind of makes you famous. 
LAURA: What's she been doing? 
MARISHA: (exhales) 
LAURA: Should I give them a present? 
MARISHA: Let me see if I can, I'm going to step in front of her and be like: Break it up, break it up. 
MATT: (laughs) They all scatter a bit and hold to attention. You say "Break it up" and they form almost into-- 
TRAVIS: Ranks? 
MATT: -- a walkway, ranks to the side. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Ten-hut! 
MARISHA: Yes, that is what I meant. Good work. 
LAURA: I'll keep my head high and walk past them. 
MATT: Okay, as you walk by, Orym, you feel a heavy elbow into your side and you're like (grunt) and you glance over and at first what you thought was Ashton is another Vanguard figure that's like, "Shh." 
LIAM: I'm not saying anything. 
MARISHA: I tell everybody-- 
MATT: He walks off. 
MARISHA: -- in our heads as we approach them: Get into a formation so we can get the fuck out of here. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: I similarly nudge Ash and I pull out the sword and then go about 10 feet out from Imogen off diagonally to the right like a bodyguard. 
LAURA: This is definitely the most-- 
LIAM: Because I'm a bodyguard. 
LAURA: -- the most nonchalant way to travel. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Just as we walk away from the tower, I think. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: To avoid the fanboys. 
TALIESIN: Right. 
LAURA: Is anybody following or watching as we head down the street? 
MATT: They watch as you walk away, but nobody pursues or follows. 
LAURA: Great. 
ASHLEY: Okay, good. 
MATT: As soon as you're a little ways away, you can see them regather to talk and whisper to each other. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MARISHA: That was crazy. 
LAURA: Yeah. I didn't use your toy. 
MARISHA: We still have it. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: We didn't use your toy. 
TRAVIS: You have it? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Here, give it back. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (relieved sigh) 
MARISHA: Treshi scry ball. 
TRAVIS: (gurgles) 
SAM: (yells) (laughter) 
MARISHA: He's been Fjord the whole time! 
TRAVIS: (dramatic groans) (laughter) 
LIAM: A little rocking horse. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Frothing at the mouth. (laughter) 
MATT: Oh my god. 
LIAM: (like Uk'otoa) Delight. (laughter) 
MARISHA: "Delight." 
MATT: Long live the new flesh. So (laughs). 
TRAVIS: The new flesh. 
LIAM: Once we get out of sight-- 
MATT: Taliesin's the only one at the table that got that. 
LIAM: Just random little crowd on the street. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: No worries. 
TALIESIN: Killer. 
MATT: All right. So following the directions of the two of you who got the bird's eye view, you deftly begin to-- Are you taking-- 
LAURA: I'm going to pull my hood up so I don't seem-- 
MATT: Are you taking a direct route confidently again or are you going stealthily? 
LAURA: I feel like we should be confident until we get a little bit closer and then we can dart off into the side streets and be a little more stealthy. 
LIAM: Maybe the last quarter-mile. 
LAURA: Yeah, so we're not super noticeable going to the Volition. 
MATT: I'll say make one final group stealth check to make the last bit of the journey's leg to your destination. 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
LIAM: Pass Without a Trace. 
MATT: Yes, which we do have now. 
MARISHA: ♪ Da da da da da ♪ 
SAM: Big roll. 
LIAM: Oh, it's a single roll. 
TRAVIS: Oh, a single roll? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Dope, dope, dope, dope. 
LAURA: Single roll, but add 10. 
TRAVIS: 26. 
MATT: 26. 
MARISHA: 33. 
ASHLEY: Woo. 
MATT: Woo-oof, all right. 
SAM: 13. 
MATT: Boop. 
ASHLEY: 26. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: 27. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: 29. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: 12. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: 12. 
MATT: It's a good spread. All righty. 
TRAVIS: Do you still have some exhaustion? 
TALIESIN: Oh yes, two points. 
ASHLEY: It's your last day? 
LAURA: You have two or just one? 
LIAM: We never rested. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: Ashton said at the end of the day if there's any spell slots left to restore. 
LAURA: Oh right, because then you'll get-- 
LIAM: Both taken away in the morning. 
TALIESIN: There's a cost also. 
SAM: There's a financial cost. 
TALIESIN: There is a financial cost to it. 
LAURA: I also have a Scroll of Greater Restoration. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: That was given to us. 
SAM: Oh, that's right, for Planerider Ryn. 
LAURA: But we should probably save that for Planerider Ryn in case we don't have any. 
MATT: Indeed, all righty. 
ASHLEY: We never saw Planerider Ryn. 
MATT: You did not see Planerider at the Malleus Key, no. 
LAURA: Maybe Planerider's here. (gasps) Maybe that'll be our exit. 
ASHLEY: That would be amazing. 
SAM: Or maybe she's dead. 
MATT: As you all carefully dive and shift from shadowed alley to shadowed corner, you eventually come upon the exterior of the dump region of an excavation tunnel. You see these massive piles of rock, large chunks to small crumbled bits and it is pushed up against the side of this mountain to this massive wedge pile. You can see there's a few small buildings on the outside with lazy bits of smoke where it looks like either workers or guards are posted to keep watch. But it looks like when someone is, and many of you remember, like they're digging a new mine. All the rock has to go somewhere and so it's all been brought back to the surface and pushed onto the side. The fact that it still rests here and it looks fresh means that this is a recent excavation. As you begin to come across the exterior of it, you see from inside one of these little hovels with the smoke trail, a figure comes out with a big thick cowl on, himself an older one of those sasquatch figures. You haven't learned the name of them yet. But you can see he's older, he's balding on top. There's that little bit of the scalp crown that's showing there and the longer white hair that dangles past and the cheeks pour out from there. He has the big cowl on the neck and the cloak is thrown over to the side and he has one of those bone wand rods, but it's long and it has the glass crystal at the end and he emerges and (click). "What is your business, if I can ask?" 
LAURA: Is there something we're supposed to say? 
SAM: Uh-uh, I don't know. We never learned what Volition people say to each other. 
MATT: "Step away from the Dust Pit unless you're here on Imperium business." 
MARISHA: Oh. So, okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughing) How smooth. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right so-- 
MARISHA: DM, are we close to the door? Are we at the door? 
LAURA: Is this where the purple fabric is? 
MATT: You can see the flag is affixed to the top of the structure that he emerged from. Just-- (flag gently flapping). 
MARISHA: Okay, so this is it. 
MATT: -- flicking. 
MARISHA: This is it, okay. 
MATT: This is what you saw from the tower. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: This weapon that he's got, it's the wand. The glass isn't at the end. Is the glass at the end of it? 
MATT: There is a piece of glass, and it looks like a large bone, like a femur of some creature that has been carved and shaped to have this-- Either it was naturally formed in this odd-- Maybe a rib bone from some massive beast. As he holds it like a rifle, and at the end there is the crystal pointed. He's just holding it there at the ready. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Detect Thoughts. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to say: You're not going to need that weapon. We're not here to challenge you or anything. By the way, it's a very finely made piece. 
LIAM: We're acquaintances of Zhesh. 
SAM: Yeah, did they make it? 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
LAURA: What's in their thoughts as-- 
LIAM: What's in your wallet? 
LAURA: What's in his wallet as he says that? 
MATT: They are extremely nervous. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: 25. 
MATT: 25. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LIAM: No, I looked at perception. That's different for me. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: But still pretty good, 19. 
MATT: 19. The first thoughts are nervousness and then surface thoughts that go over are like, "Shit, shit. Oh god, oh god. Um... Keep cool, keep cool, keep cool." Says, "Friends of Zhesh, I think I know of this-- Zhesh makes good glass stuff, eh? Yeah?" 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: I actually have a few criticisms of the Imperium. 
LAURA: Are you loyal? 
MATT: "I don't know anything about that. (nervous chuckle)" 
LAURA: To the Imperium, are you loyal? 
MATT: Looks at you, and you see his face drop and he goes, "I-- I am doing my duty." 
SAM: Maybe you're not the one who should be asking. 
LAURA: In his head, I want to be thinking what he's thinking in his head though, as I ask it. 
MATT: So you ask him--? 
LAURA: I asked him that, but I want to hear what's in his head as he's answering me. 
MATT: Right now in his head is, "Oh no. Oh no, oh no, oh no." 
LIAM: I'm going to jam Seedling into the ground, blade down. Because... we're not. 
MATT: He's not even looking at you right now. 
LIAM: Does he hear those words? 
MATT: Might be. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: But in his head you sense just abject terror. 
LAURA: I am not who you think I am. I am not my mother. 
MATT: Now you make a persuasion check. You've kind of loosened him up. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. I didn't realize my persuasion was that high. 24! 
LIAM: You have mercury tongue, what do you mean? 
LAURA: What the fuck? Yeah, but I always thought-- I don't know. I just forgot. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: He looks, finally breaks eye contact and looks over at you. He looks at your sword. Looks back at you. Looks at you again with that curious, what the hell are you sort of look. 
TRAVIS: (snoring softly) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: He sleeps standing up. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
LAURA: He's really old. It's-- 
ASHLEY: Chet! 
TRAVIS: (startles) 
LIAM: Do you have a chair? Maybe we could take this inside. 
MATT: "Maybe we should have a conversation." 
ASHLEY: (laughing) Fall asleep standing up. 
MARISHA: Waking up sounding like a bike horn. 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (horn-like startle) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What? 
MATT: "It happens to the best of us. (laughs)" 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: A little jet lagged. 
MATT: "Yeah, let's step out of the road." 
TALIESIN: Yes, please. 
MATT: Still nervously holding the mass wand at his side, the bone contraption. Steps back into this little hut. It's maybe about 15 feet by 15 feet. It's pretty modest. It's built along where that metal gate sits that closes off the entrance to this wide cavern. He steps inside, looks out through the window. Once you all pull in, it is a bit of a tight fit, closes the door. "Why has Zhesh sent you? What-- Your mother? What's going on?" 
SAM: We're friends. We're friends of the Volition. We were sent to find you and to find-- 
MATT: "Me?" 
SAM: Well, not you specifically, but your people. 
MATT: "I was like, I don't do much." 
SAM: What's your name? 
MATT: "My name is Amido, Watcher Amido. I, um--" 
SAM: Watcher Amido. 
ASHLEY: Watcher Amido. 
SAM: Hold on, we've got to get out our notebooks, Watcher Amido. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: We've come-- 
MATT: "You're Exandrian, yes?" 
LIAM: Yes, we've come a really long way. 
MATT: "She's your mother?" 
SAM: But we're not allied with her. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: "What is your intent, then?" 
SAM: To stop her. 
MARISHA: We know of some of the Imperium's plans. We're not aligned with them. In fact, the Imperium has done a lot of damage and wreaked a lot of havoc on Exandria. We're not against Ruidians. 
MATT: He's nervously pressing his thumb against his tusk, almost to have just a little bit of pain to keep his attention focused. Like a little tick. 
MARISHA: We want to help you all. But we do not approve of the way the Imperium has been going about things. 
LIAM: Yeah, there's people on Exandria who are working with the Imperium to the detriment of both places. I think we might have common interests here. 
MATT: "This is a strange bit of fortune. I am not the person to talk to. You should talk to Rashinna." 
LAURA: Where's Rashinna? 
MATT: "Rashinna of the Golden Hammer. She's-- She's the current head of the Volition." 
SAM: Rashinna. 
MATT: "She and Gaz Tomo would be the ones to talk to." 
TRAVIS: Gastomo? 
MATT: "Gaz Tomo." 
LAURA: And where are they? 
MATT: "I'll show you the way, but I can't go with you. I have to stay here to make sure nobody finds it." 
ASHLEY: What's the Golden Hammer? 
MATT: "That's her title." 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's her title! Rashinna of the Golden Hammer. 
LIAM: She's probably got a golden hammer. 
MATT: "Her father was the Golden Hammer before her." 
ASHLEY: Oh sorry, I thought it was of the Golden Hammer. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: She probably has her father's golden hammer. 
ASHLEY: Okay, tight. Tight, tight, tight, tight. 
LAURA: That's all said in our heads. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, that wasn't out loud. 
LAURA: That was just a shitty, stupid mind conversation. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Where do we find-- 
TALIESIN: I said mine out loud. Sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Where do we find her? 
MATT: "This way." He steps out and looks around while holding the door there. 
TALIESIN: If he pulls a secret latch, I'll be so happy. 
MATT: "(significant whistle)" Does this faint whistle, and someone emerges from the other little hovel off to the side, rushes over to part of the metal gate. You hear the jingling of metal, and then the gate shifts open about a foot and a half, then he darts back inside the hut. He goes, "Don't go as a group. Give a space of time between each entry. Close it behind you." 
TALIESIN: Should we take these off, maybe? 
MATT: "Once inside, yeah." 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: I reach up and take him by the hand and clasp my-- 
MATT: "(startled gasp)" 
LIAM: -- hand over. 
MATT: "You're so small." 
LIAM: I know. It comes in handy sometimes. Sometimes it's a problem. When I take my hand away there's seven or eight blueberries in his hand. 
MATT: "What is-- (gasps)" 
LIAM: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: They call him the Farmer's Marquet. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Erewhon. 
LAURA: Orym of the Farmer's-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I feel so bad for that. Carry on. 
LIAM: Orym has finally found his super power. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You got those at a blueberries still? (laughter) 
MATT: He doesn't even break eye contact, he just-- 
LAURA: Just making it really awkward. 
SAM: You got some blue-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Got some beep beep? 
MATT: You see the eyes wrinkle from the smile. He pulls the hand away and there's a mess of blueberry in his long, white beard shrouded face. 
LAURA: Aw, he's like a Maltese doggie. 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Aw! With his little snack. 
LAURA: With the big-- 
LAURA: You've got to give raspberry snacks. I want to see-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: It'd be so cute. 
MATT: "(belches)" 
LIAM: You want me to give this guy raspberries? 
LAURA: No, no, no. The next person. 
LIAM: Next person, next person raspberries. 
TRAVIS: I've already started walking towards the gate. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. Chet's first. 
SAM: One at a time, one at a time. 
LAURA: Chet's first. 
ASHLEY: One at a time, or can we go in as groups? 
LAURA: He said not as a group. 
ASHLEY: As a couple? Two at once? 
SAM: Probably two is okay. 
TRAVIS: I get to the gate and I walk through. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: I'm walking. 
TRAVIS: As I get in, I start-- (disrobes) Taking the reds off. 
LAURA: Getting naked. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
MARISHA: Trail in, one at a time-- 
TRAVIS: Scratch my nips. 
MARISHA: -- as instructed. 
MATT: One at a time, you all take moments-- 
LIAM: Just getting my human flesh off. 
MATT: -- to step within the subterranean tunnel until eventually you've all passed through the gate. The moment after the last of you steps within, you hear the gate-- (shifting) (muffled bump) Sorry, as I punch the microphone and make-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- make the audience at home go: 
MATT and TRAVIS: (screaming) 
ASHLEY: Ow! 
MATT: So sorry. Impactful moments here. 
TRAVIS: The cockroach in "Fifth Element." (high-pitched blare) 
ASHLEY: Sowwy, Chwis. 
MATT: It is a wide 25-ish foot opening. The top of it gets low pretty quick. You can feel the-- 
LAURA: Dancing Lights. 
MATT: As they glow through and reveal it. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: You can see that loose dust and dirt and gravel and such have been pulled up and left along the sides, stuff that's tumbled off from whatever carts and elements brought it up. As you continue down, you see some of these carts which have heavy barding and chains for various large creatures. In fact, the wuukors that you've seen, it looks like it's made for some of the larger wuukors that pull some of these carts that carry these heavy bits of excavated dirt up. As you begin to descend around, one of your orbs presses past before a lantern lights up at about a 60-foot distance from you. You begin to notice that along this tunnel there are these lanterns, these little blue-green lights that (soft, igniting glow) appear in the proximity of your travel. It winds down, eventually dips into a descent that is steep enough to the point where you have to hold the sides a little bit to go down. The tunnel begins to thin a bit. You're having to guide yourself. 
TRAVIS: Single file? 
MATT: Not quite single file yet, but you have to put your hands down to scoot at times to make sure you don't tumble. 
TRAVIS: Is there any sense of water or moisture down here? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: 12, 13. 
MATT: 12? Pretty dry. In this tunnel, you don't catch any sort of moisture. You continue to scoot down, it levels out a little bit. As you come to the base of that one descent, hitting a few rocks with your feet, a voice goes, "Who goes?" 
SAM: (gasps) 
LIAM: Friends of the Volition. 
MATT: "Prove it." 
LAURA: How? 
SAM: We've got some dead bodies or anything? 
TALIESIN: That sounds really complicated. 
TRAVIS: Watcher Imutoe. 
LIAM: We're going to open up a picnic blanket. 
LAURA: Amido. 
ASHLEY: Amido. 
LIAM: You're going to want someone to look inside. We'll back away from it. 
MARISHA: Close enough. 
LIAM: You'll see what you need to see. 
MARISHA: That's, you're going to show-- 
SAM: What are they going to see in there? Just a whole bunch of dead bodies? 
MARISHA: We look like psychopaths. 
TALIESIN: But they're all-- 
LAURA: We're going to look psycho. 
ASHLEY: Maybe we should just pull out one body instead of showing them all? 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Just to warm him up a little bit. 
MATT: All right, so what do you do? 
TRAVIS: Watcher Amido gave us passage. 
LAURA: We're here to talk to Rashinna-- 
ASHLEY: Rashinna and Gaz Tomo. 
LAURA: -- and Gaz Tomo. 
MARISHA: We still have that head, right? 
LIAM: Yeah, we can pick. 
MARISHA: We pull out the head of-- 
LIAM: -- the evidence we want. 
MATT: The juggernaut? 
MARISHA: The juggernaut, and toss it. Yeah. 
MATT: (bouncing thuds) A foot catches it in the shadows. You can see the figure lean in. You can see they have a hood up. They glance past it. They kick it back and (bouncing thuds) comes to rest. (grotesque snort) 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
MATT: Tongue lolling out. 
TRAVIS: (bags head) 
MATT: It's starting to get a little soft at the edges. 
LAURA: Yuck. 
SAM: Ugh! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Ugh! 
TRAVIS: I peel off a little piece of cheek and-- 
LAURA: No, Chet! 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: A little protein. 
MATT: "It is for Rashinna to decide. Walk with me." The figure turns around and you can see they're carrying another one of these, they look like a cannon almost, like a hand cannon wand, if you will, with the crystal at the tip. Do you follow? 
SAM and LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. You continue following. There's a couple other tunnels that merge with this one from off to the side. Almost like they're starting to come to these nexus points. This tunnel also looks a bit, the further in you get, he takes you, this figure, pulls you off into a side tunnel and winds a more freshly dug, smaller passageway, barely braced, with similar bits of curved bone, like you had seen some of these carved from. It looks like a curved rib bone that's put up in the side to keep some semblance of bracing to this tunnel. But the dirt is very loose and fresh and it looks like whatever tunnel that he's taking you through is a very recent addition to the space. This walk continues on for a good 15 minutes of silence as this figure keeps walking and looking past over the shoulder every few seconds to keep a watch on you. 
SAM: Did we ever get a good glimpse of what they look like? 
MATT: They've been in shadow mostly this whole time. The minute you put any light ahead, they turn and continued walking facing away. You press on. Until eventually you come to a large door. It looks like it's made from wood, but you haven't seen a lot of wood sources in this area. This has this rough, gnarled exterior to it. It's not a shaved wood. There's almost a bark that's still grown unto it that's split in places. On the inside, the striations, there's not a pattern of straight striations, they almost interweave underneath the bark. Like the tree, or the wood itself is knotted, like a Celtic knot-like design beneath where the bark is broken and exposes underneath. The figure approaches it and takes the butt of this rod or cannon and like, boof. Just hits it once. You watch as part of the door pulls back and opens, like a false window is pulled away. The figure looks out. There's no conversation for a moment before the figure in the hood goes. Nods and turns back. "Well, either you're telling the truth or you die tonight. So, good luck," and begins to walk past you all. As they do, you get a glimpse at them. This is a Reiloran figure. A similar physicality to some of the Shrikes that you've fought before. But you see both of their eyes are snow blind. They have a heavy, heavy scar that carves through the jaw down to the neck. The speaking they've been doing into your mind, you can see probably couldn't be done with the healed state of their face. They've suffered some serious injury to their face. But they walk past stoically and continue on to the tunnel past. As the false doors placed there and you watch as the wooden entryway peels away to reveal an opening. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: It's not a hinged door. It seems to kind of un-grow in a place, if that makes any sense, kind of pulled away. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: Beyond that, you see a figure holding their hands out, with a faint green glow on their hands. 
MARISHA: The druid. 
TRAVIS: Can I go to where the door grew into, totally forgetting whoever opened it and look and try and find where it retreated into? 
MATT: Yeah, as you approach it to look into it with this curiosity and wonder, it's like the knotted striations are roots that bound together to create a strong door and you can see it's probably that thick. Like if the roots of a tree all were concentrated into one pattern-- 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: -- and they grew over. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MATT: And then began to retreat into itself to leave an opening, like a curtain. 
TRAVIS: Incredible. Oh. 
MATT: You step into the next chamber and it is a plain, open, antechamber- like cavern, maybe about 20 feet tall, about 60 feet wide, and a multitude of tunnels that splinter off of it. You can see some more of those lanterns hang within, glowing and lighting the space. There are probably four other figures, also similarly hooded and shrouded, sitting at different corners, posted with their own series of weapons. You see some people that have more of those glass cannons, if you will. A few others that have large glass weapons, like greatswords that look hooked and carved that affix to their back. As you step in, many begin to step out. A dozen, two dozen figures begin to emerge. They're forming a rank around all the other tunnels and you're starting to get the sense that they're essentially going to be enveloping you as you step in and they do. As you begin to walk into the central chamber, you are immediately surrounded by, now, it looks to be about 35 to 40 figures total. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: You wouldn't happen to have 35 of those toys, would you? 
TRAVIS: I've got two. 
MARISHA: Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: But nothing like some competition. (laughter) (tings) Ah! (growls) 
MATT: As they surround you, you can see the shapes. Some of them, with the low light that's here, you can see, they look humanoid. Some have the Reiloran crests. Some are tall and lanky. You can see the shape of the Shrike creations. You can see a few of them are massive, hulking figures, looks to be Reiloran juggernauts or a like physicality, all wrapped and covered and trying to stay unrecognized in their intentional attire. It is a motley crew of figures. Some that look small. You see some Bormodo in there. You see what looks to be, possibly gnomish or halfling figures in here. You see one standing figure that is-- Where is it hidden? A green-scaled dragonborn that is heavily armored. They all stare at you quietly as you step in, all waiting for something, before, eventually, some of them part in the middle. One figure approaches, pulling her hood back. You see this powerful, stoic-looking female Reiloran. She looks a bit gaunt, but serious in her face. She wears a breastplate of what looks like hammered metal. Her dark burgundy brown cloak drags on the ground behind her. She is gauntleted in her hands. You see swinging at the side of her belt, what looks to be a brass, gold-colored mallet or hammer of some kind that clings gently against her leg armor as she steps out from the rest of the crew. Her crest splits into three, almost like flower petal type designs on it. You can see there are all manner of tattoo designs that merge and splinter off of it. There are cold iron chains that wrap around it and connect right above the brow and dangle past where the nose bump is, drift past the chin and hang and swing. As she steps forward, you can feel the reverence in the chamber for her. She approaches. And not telepathically, but speaking as you speak. "Who among you would you consider to be your leader?" 
SAM: Boy, just the craziest question. 
LAURA: I know. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: We debated this. We've talked about it a bit. 
MATT: (sternly) "Who speaks for you, at least?" 
ASHLEY: Well, I mean-- 
LAURA: I-- 
LIAM: I literally push Imogen by the elbow forward two steps. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I do. 
MATT: "You." There's this faint, hushed clenching throughout the whole chamber as you step into the light a bit and everyone sees the coloration of your hair and the designs of your scars. All the lanterns flicker brighter as you enter the chamber. "You're of her lineage, are you not, this Temult?" 
LAURA: I'm her daughter, yes. 
MATT: As you say that, the whole room shifts and you hear the sound of weapons being pulled from sheaths. You see glowing green glass begin to glow from all corners of the shadow in your direction. 
LAURA: There is no loyalty that comes with this blood. 
MATT: "You fought hard enough to find your way to the heart of our safe house. Tell me what it is you intend before we strike you down and leave you in ashes." 
LAURA: We want to destroy Ludinus. We want to destroy Otohan Thull. We want to destroy my mother. And everyone who would seek to control the people of Ruidus. 
MATT: "What is your intent with the Imperium?" 
LAURA: What is yours? I didn't even know of its existence until recently. 
MATT: "Ask the questions later. Answer them now." 
LAURA: If they serve Ludinus, then we would see them destroyed as well. 
MATT: "We have your assurances that you are not a puppet, an instrument of the Weave Mind?" 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
LAURA: Gulp! Okay. 
SAM: Oh yeah. Maybe you are an instrument of the Weave Mind. We don't know. 
LAURA: You don't know. 
LIAM: Sounds fun. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 27. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: 27. 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
MARISHA: She said that so flippantly. 
MATT: There's a good 15 seconds of tense silence, as this figure turns her head from side to side, looking you up and down, looking at your friends. Each of you feel peered into, peered through, judged, spiritually chewed and spat out in a matter of seconds, like you've been read for filth, front to back. 
ASHLEY: That feels dirty. 
MATT: Quietly. 
MARISHA: You like it? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I like it a little teeny bit. 
MATT: Before she steps back a bit onto her back leg and crosses her arms in front. "Well, I believe that you believe that. And that's something, at least. Very well. You want to know my intent? Our intent?" She turns around and walks back towards the crowd that parts. 
LAURA: Do we follow? 
SAM: Follow! 
LIAM: We do. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: We do. We're all in. 
MATT: You fall in and step behind her. As she walks, you see one of the hulking juggernauts steps and joins her at the side-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- (heavy footsteps). Looks back at you and still untrusting, cracks his knuckles at the side, but-- 
TRAVIS: What's up? 
MATT: "(exhaling loudly)" Continues walking. 
LIAM: I crack my knuckles in return. 
TRAVIS: Those are my knees. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Towards the opposite side of the chamber, you can see there's a mass of glass that is opaque and barely exposed at the edge that covers about a 15-foot section of wall. As you approach the edge of this chamber to where that glass wall is, you watch as this figure raises her hand across it. As she does, the glass, its opaqueness vanishes and becomes somewhat translucent, like a window that is revealed with her fingers. As it does, you are looking down from the ceiling of the most incredibly large chamber underground that you've ever witnessed. You see this perpetual mind-blowing expanse, this open space that is filled with hundreds more bridges and structures and archways. You see all these little bits of carved stone that bind together like a hive, a network of caverns that all bleed together into this massive, heart-like cityscape. Thousands, tens of thousands more people could live here. You see thousands of those little sparkling blue lights, like fireflies in the distance, and it takes you a moment to realize that these are lanterns that alight structures that spread on almost forever into the dark. This... This is the heart of Kreviris. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: Oh wow. 
MATT: This is the city. You see the moving energy and liveliness of it throughout, like a bloodstream of people that shift and move. The vibrancy of a society you've not yet gandered. You can see spires and structures and temples that seem familiar, but not. A lot of the architecture seems to change. The inspiration's pulled, in some ways, from Exandrian history and cultures, but a facsimile of it. Repurposed, remade, not fully understood, but claimed as its own. It's like bits of the history of the world long gone and today, all put together and made new, made unique. Sitting amongst it all, you can only imagine this quarter mile or higher height of this underground chamber, where it all swirls and connects. This singular spire of faintly glowing glass that rises up the center of it. Like a tree trunk. Where all of these different paths all connect to and weave around. 
LIAM: We were just on the outskirts. 
MATT: You can see the bits of stronghold structures built into the side of this trunk and it does indeed look almost like a shadowy tree in the way that everything around this city breaks off of it in layers and layers and splinters off into the nearby caverns. You can't even see the bottom, almost, from this height. It's just-- It feels like a dream. As you glance out and try and process all this, the Reiloran figure, the leader, which you assume to be this Rashinna you heard about, steps alongside you all. "What we want is inside there. The five minds that have enslaved us for hundreds of years. That... glowing heart of this city. We aim to bring it down." And that's where we'll end tonight's episode. 
TRAVIS: Oh no, you can't! 
ASHLEY: Oh! No, Matt! 
TRAVIS: Come on, that's so good! 
ASHLEY: No, Matt! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That's so good. The five minds? 
LIAM: No, that tracks. That tracks. 
ASHLEY: The glowing heart of the city. (groans) No! Like 20 more minutes! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Come on, Mom! 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
TRAVIS: I've got the whole cavern in my mind. 
MARISHA: I'm not even tired! 
ASHLEY: Just like-- 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MARISHA: I know, I know. 
TALIESIN: They're beautiful. Can we roll for initiative really quick? (laughter) 
MATT: Just to start the next one? 
TALIESIN: Real quick. 
LIAM: Fight Manhattan. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
LIAM: Are we talking Grand Canyon scale underground? 
LAURA: Bigger. 
MATT: It's like the depth of the Grand Canyon. Not quite as expansive, per se. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MATT: It doesn't extend that way, but it is that like a-- If you were to take an equal, cylindrical chamber of the Grand Canyon that was about, from top to bottom, about a quarter mile or so. 
LIAM: You wouldn't want to fall. 
MATT: It fills out from there. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no. 
MATT: There's dozens, if not hundreds of rock shelves and splintered pathways that come out from it, some that have crumbled, some that have been built on. 
LAURA: Like a termite. 
MATT: Some that have been shaped. 
LIAM: Yeah, where's David Attenborough when you need him? 
MATT: -- like a slightly more open termite mound with this massive glass cylinder in the center. 
LIAM: (old voice) A Reiloran cityscape stretches out before you. 
MATT: (laughs) Even from where you sit now, the scale is hard to gauge. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: As you take in the shapes and those thousands of little firefly-like glittering lights of all the different lanterns of the city coming on and flickering off as people step in and out of their radiuses. So it's fun. 
SAM: It's a far cry from fighting chairs and tables. 
MATT: Little bit. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Far cry. 
MATT: Things have shifted. 
MARISHA: Aw. 
LIAM: ♪ Empty chairs at empty tables ♪ 
TALIESIN: To be fair, they were really nice chairs and tables. 
MATT: They were nice chairs. 
TALIESIN: They were beautiful. 
TRAVIS: They were good chairs. 
MATT: We'll pick up from there next episode after you've now made contact with the leader of the Volition and figure out what the next plan of action is here under the surface of Ruidus. I'm excited. (laughs) 
SAM: Wow! 
MATT: All righty, so we'll pick up from there next week. Happy ninth anniversary, everybody! (cheering) 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Nine years! 
ALL: Nein! 
MATT: Nein, indeed. 
ASHLEY: Nein, nein, nein! 
MARISHA: I have one gray hair for every year. Just nine of them. 
LAURA: Lucky you. 
SAM: Shut up, numbers. 
TRAVIS: Just nine. 
MARISHA: Just nine. 
MATT: Only them. Love you all. This has been crazy and it's only getting crazier. 
TRAVIS: Love you, Matty. 
MARISHA: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Love you, Matty. 
LIAM: Nine years married. 
MATT: Indeed. 
LIAM: To nine more! (laughter) 
MATT: Well, thank you all for joining us. We'll pick up next week at this crazy bit, but we love you very much and is it Thursday yet? (cheering) 
MATT: Good night.

Cooldown[]
SAM: Time to jump.
ASHLEY: Okay, wait. You said the five minds that have enslaved us for years--
LIAM: Five--
TRAVIS: The five minds.
ASHLEY: The five minds.
TRAVIS: Of the glowing heart of the city.
LIAM: Centuries of five--
ASHLEY: Centuries.
LIAM: --fancy pants.
SAM: We didn't meet anybody.
LAURA: The Weave Mind is just five?
TRAVIS: I've also got Zion pictured in my head.
SAM: Yeah, I guess the Weave is five people.
TALIESIN: It's just five dicks.
SAM, MARISHA, LAURA: Five dicks.
TALIESIN: I'm excited because we have a sixth dick. We have the sixth dick.
TRAVIS: There's one big, central, glowing--
LIAM: They have just been--
TALIESIN: We have the sixth mind.
LIAM: They've been stretching themselves through the centuries.
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Stretched to the limit.
MATT: The Ruidian glass.
ASHLEY: It's the five that-- oh, we don't know.
TALIESIN: We brought, we have ALl-Minds-Burn, so that could be fun.
SAM: I don't think it's Otohan.
LIAM: So much. We've got Aeorian tech being used by the Cerberus Assembly to help bust open whatever Viper-armed defense system is on Predathos, to let daddy up.
TRAVIS: Disable it.
SAM: Wait, wait, start over. So we have this Aeorian tech--
LIAM: That the Cerberus Assembly had in a box with their logo on it.
LAURA: Wait, when they were trying to wake up the gods, weren't there really strong sorcerers or whatever?
TRAVIS: Who was trying to wake them?
LAURA: The ancient, ancient, ancient people-- When the city got pulled off of Exandria and stuck on Ruidus, it got pulled with really strong--
LIAM: Right. They clapped him in a big mudball from Exandria and threw it off the world.
LAURA: I'm getting my ancient civilizations mixed up.
TRAVIS: Yeah, but Aeor had the Key-- that was-- did they call it the God Hammer?
MARISHA: The God Hammer. Which was the Malleus--
MATT: Yeah, the Factorum Malleus, which is the God Hammer.
LAURA: That's what started the Divine Gate, is-- that's how it--
TRAVIS: Which we don't know if it was to break the Divine Gate or if it was to kill a god or to disable something.
TALIESIN: Or to force the Divine Gate.
TRAVIS: So it could be a piece of that.
MATT: You don't know what--
MARISHA: We know all the gods were-- the two different gods, the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities were fighting, and then Aeor was like, "Yo, we just built this shit."
MATT: Aeor tested the Factorum Malleus.
LIAM: Yeah, we made a Death Star, right? 
MARISHA: Yes, and then all the gods went--
MATT: All the gods went Game Off, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, got to deal with this.
MATT: Fuck this, this city in particular.
MARISHA: Then they were like: Cool, that's done, game on.
MATT: But that's all you know.
TRAVIS: So it could be a piece of that.
LAURA: It could be a piece of that.
TRAVIS: Didn't we see a larger piece of the God Hammer used as the--
LAURA: The Malleus Key, right.
TRAVIS: Yeah, isn't the bottom of the Bloody Bridge remnants of that as well?
MATT: There's a lot of odd Aeorian tech being woven and built on here.
LIAM: It's Luda. Luda's been on this shit for a long time.
SAM: Aeorian tech will be used to undo whatever it is--
LAURA: The trapping of Predathos.
SAM: Yeah, whatever is keeping Predathos there.
MATT: I don't know.
LIAM: Yes, you do.
MATT: Maybe-- I do know.
ASHLEY: Yeah, don't you lie to us.
MATT: Maybe it could be, I don't know, something to look into.
LIAM: There's a lot of things.
SAM: (laughs) Something to look into. Of course, that's why we're here.
TALIESIN: We've got to find ourselves a library.
MATT: Sorry, I'm loading up over here in the middle of this.
MARISHA: While you were talking about all the different facsimiles of Exandria and the different histories, I was like "Epcot."
TRAVIS: Underground Epcot.
MARISHA: Moon Epcot.
TRAVIS: We got to go have lunch in Germany.
MARISHA: We got to go to the beer garden, it slaps.
MATT: I'm excited for you guys to learn more about Reiloran culture in the main city.
ASHLEY: I want to learn about Reiloran food.
TRAVIS: We've largely gone down, right? So we've been going down.
LIAM: Down and down.
MATT: Yeah, you guys have been traveling down these tunnels and then got to an area that seems to be at the very top of this massive--
LAURA: But the city that we're looking at, it's got the Imperium. Like this is just the city.
LIAM: Right, they refer to this--
LAURA: So we're still going to have to be like super (cautious noise).
LIAM: They refer to the city where the five beings are, in there.
LAURA and SAM: In the tower.
LIAM: They were looking through the OLED TV screen and saying "in there" is referring to...
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: This is their ground zero looking at the city. But you said when we first entered, it was a fresh tunnel. So they're making new entrances probably all the time to different parts of the outside.
LAURA: How'd that feel?
LIAM: Pretty good. It definitely hit the funny bone.
TRAVIS: I didn't even notice you hit your hand.
LIAM: I was going to play it off. I was going to play it off. No, I feel it.
TRAVIS: Static fingers.
LAURA: Like I bumped my head on this.
LIAM: Psychic powers.
LAURA: I just had to pretend like I didn't.
MARISHA: Yeah, we're not looking at a super base for the Volition. We're looking at the fucking heart of the city.
TALIESIN: We're going to have to have one tourist day, just to get all the-- Just one to--
ASHLEY: Try some food.
TALIESIN: Try some good.
ASHLEY: Try the local foods.
TALIESIN: See the sights.
MATT: I mean, that's all part of, that could all be part of the intel mission. All information is helpful to bring back to Exandria.
SAM: The Volition has been fighting this fight for who knows how long, or assembling their forces,  but no one from the Volition has ever reached out to anyone on Exandria that we know of. Have they?
LIAM: That we know of. And where the fuck is Wendagoth?
SAM: Oh, yeah.
MARISHA: That's right. He was like "Tee-hee-hee, come find me."
MATT: That is a pretty good...
LAURA: He's here. I bet he's here.
TRAVIS: He's running the casino now. I just saw him.
LAURA: Do we get to keep these crystals here?
TALIESIN: You learn a lot about a culture--
MATT: Oh, we're going to keep these crystals as long as we're in subterranean Ruidus, I want to keep them.
MARISHA: Matt saw the set and he was like, "Can we keep this up while we're in Ruidus?" I said, "Yeah."
SAM: I'm just curious.
LIAM: Who makes the rules, though?
SAM: This is above table or whatever. How did we find these? Like these are perfect. Did you design the world after these or did we-- How did we make these?
MATT: No.
MARISHA: We made these.
SAM: We made these?!
MATT: We didn't make these. We commissioned the amazing--
MARISHA: Noxweiler Berf.
MATT: Shout out to Nox. You're amazing, dude.
MARISHA: Shout out to Nox!
SAM: I walked in, I was like, "How did they find something so perfect at a rental shop?"
MARISHA: So Nox was awesome. We had this idea to do the underground Ruidian crystals and he made the molds and vacuum formed these. It was vacuum formed.
SAM: What does that mean?
LAURA: It's plastic where you go (air sucking) and it forms the plastic.
TALIESIN: Yeah, they suck it out in a huge chamber.
LIAM: This looks like giant Dwarven Forge.
SAM: It's so cool.
MARISHA: Yeah, these were custom made for us.
TALIESIN: He just does the, "Yeah, yeah, I can do that."
MARISHA: But we also-- Nox is so brilliant, you guys. Once again, shout out to Nox. He does so much cool shit for us.
MATT: He does.
MARISHA: But yeah, we could also, if we ever go anywhere where we need red crystals, because he's got the mold so you can just--
LIAM: Impossible.
LAURA: Let's just make everything that we do have crystals now.
MARISHA: I did fully be like--
TALIESIN: That was my plan all along. 
MATT: Who will redo your dining room crystals.
MARISHA: I do want a set for our house.
SAM: Well, I was about to say that.
MARISHA: For like parties.
SAM: Is this like a wedding at the end of it? Can we take one of these home? Like when you take home the centerpiece?
TALIESIN: Ninth anniversary is crystals, if I remember.
TRAVIS: I'm low key sad.
SAM: Kyle just went "Nn-nnn."
MARISHA: Kyle just said no.
MATT: Not happening.
MARISHA: What were you going to say, T?
LIAM: We're honoring willow. We looked it up.
TRAVIS: I'm low key sad I didn't give away a toy.
MARISHA: I know!
SAM: We have to establish Chetney Claus!
TRAVIS: I have to or I'm going to die soon.
SAM: Wait, what?
TRAVIS: I've got to give a toy away. 
SAM: Is that true?
TRAVIS: It's part of the deal.
LIAM: Well, the statistics of him living are getting smaller and smaller every day.
MARISHA: But is this true?
LIAM: This is how it works.
MATT: I mean, that's the same for all of us.
LIAM: That's how it works, yeah.
SAM: You have to give the toys away?
MARISHA: Is this true? Are you bullshitting?
ASHLEY: Did you roll today?
TRAVIS: At my last long rest I did.
MARISHA: Is this true?
SAM: Do you really have to give away toys?
MARISHA: I know, I can't tell.
SAM: Well, he has to become the--
TRAVIS: I have to give them away.
ASHLEY: No, he's lying.
TALIESIN: He has to give away toys or he'll feel sad, is what he said.
TRAVIS: I'll die.
SAM: We have to establish Chetney Claus.
TRAVIS: Chetney Claus.
MATT: Well, imagine how many children there are in the city.
LAURA: But you have to give nice toys away, not scary toys away.
TRAVIS: You haven't seen it!
SAM: Maybe Chetney Claus--
LAURA: It's covered. It's like we're not supposed to look at it. Obviously it's something.
TRAVIS: I just don't want you to be sad and then not want to give it away when you were supposed to. Try and keep it for yourself.
SAM: I wonder what happens down here when the flare happens.
TRAVIS: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Look at that face!
MARISHA and TRAVIS: You're doing the face!
TALIESIN: I saw that chin.
TRAVIS: Double dibbles.
MARISHA: Doesn't it glow and pulse--
TRAVIS: Yeah, I bet--
TALIESIN: Like a giant fuck-all Tardis.
SAM: Maybe that's when Chetney Claus will leave a present at your door!
LIAM: There's a lot of kids in this city. So maybe the spirit of Chetmas is what's going to trigger--
LAURA and ASHLEY: The spirit of Chetmas.
TRAVIS: Start breaking into people's chimneys. "Why is this so fucking small?"
ASHLEY: Maybe you can just go in the door. You know, you don't have to be--
SAM: Yeah, you can make your own lore.
MARISHA: Big Molotov cocktail.
TRAVIS: Toy bomb houses.
SAM: Every Chetmas, Chetney breaks in our window, leaves a toy, steals all our food, takes a dump on the floor, and leaves.
TALIESIN: This is basically some Krampus stuff at that point. It's not like this is-- It's already been written here.
MATT: It's true.
TRAVIS: Somewhere.
LIAM: With a touch of his finger to his jolly old nose, the gnome turned into a werewolf.
TRAVIS: Hey, props for turning into a slither.
ASHLEY: That was smart.
SAM: Also, you can do that now.
MARISHA: I can't believe it fucking worked.
ASHLEY: I know, and I forget about it. So because we had a little session.
MATT: You can turn into a slither. You can turn into a wuukor. You can turn into any of the beasts that are on this--
SAM: An avadon?
MATT: Avadon is technically not a beast.
SAM: Oh, it's a monster.
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: You're a monster.
SAM: And these Yeti-type creatures, we've not heard what they are.
MATT: You haven't asked.
SAM: Wait, what's a bormodo?
LAURA: Doesn't it feel rude to be like-- "What are you?"
ASHLEY: The shorter ones with the big--
LAURA: You know what I mean? It gives a less--
MATT: Not them directly, but you can ask somebody else. Learn more about the culture.
ASHLEY: They have the little--
SAM: Bormodo are short and cytaas are even shorter.
LIAM: They're the little gremlins on the shoulder.
ASHLEY: How do you get a see-ta?
LIAM: Say-ta?
LAURA: I know, I want one.
MATT: Sigh-ta.
LAURA: You have to be a bormodo.
TALIESIN: You have to order one.
SAM: You can become a bormodo.
MARISHA: They're technically illegal in California, but--
MATT: You could--
LIAM: Bormodo would be Disguise Self, right?
MATT: Disguise Self, you could become a bormodo.
TALIESIN: I have an uncle in Vegas. You can send it there and then he'll just drive it in.
ASHLEY: I'm really feeling like--
MARISHA: Yeah, you got to drive to Nevada.
ASHLEY: --I'm wanting a second child. I'm ready.
SAM: Could Mister be your cytaa?
MATT: Let's see if we can make sure that all of you have seven pets each before the end of this campaign. So I have more things to keep track of. I would love that so much.
