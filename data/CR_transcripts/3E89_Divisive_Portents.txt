Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (yelling) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: Spin that hammer, Ashley. (laughter) 
MATT: Hell yeah, thank you. 
TALIESIN: Damn. 
MATT: But yeah, before we jump into our session for tonight, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with our first sponsor, UniVersus. 
LAURA: Woo. 
MATT: Which I recently got to play with Liam over here. It was so much fun. Sam, why don't you take it away? 
SAM: Sure, UniVersus is an arcane fighting game reimagined as a trading card game that answers the question, who would win in a fight? Go head-to-head with characters like Deku from "My Hero Academia," Yo-- Yusuke from YuYu "Hak-show." 
LAURA: "Hakusho." 
TRAVIS and MATT: "Hakusho." 
SAM: Spike from "Cowboy Bebop." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Asshole. 
MATT: Fucking dick. 
SAM: Now straight from Exandria, two pairs of Critical Role adventurers have joined the UniVersus Collectible Card Game. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
SAM: The enigmatic twins of Vex'ildan-- Nope. Vax'ildan and Vex'ahlia. 
MATT: Still fucking it up. 
SAM: You can show the cards, show the cards. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: Also those chaotic detective duo of Jester Lavorre and Nott the Brave. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
SAM: The Challenger Series includes a 60-card pre-constructed ready-to-play deck. Each box contains a collector's pack with six stunning alt arts and each Critical Role base card has a foil or art variant found only in the booster. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MARISHA: So pretty. 
SAM: Now, because this game, you can put them down, because this game is about unlikely match-ups and because we play these characters, I thought we'd give you a taste of what it would sound like if Vax-- 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: -- battled Jester. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: So I wrote a little script and of course. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: Oh no. (laughs) 
SAM: Playing Vax will be Ashley Johnson. 
LIAM: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
SAM: And voicing Jester will be Taliesin Jaffe. 
TALIESIN: That's not funny. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: That's not funny at all. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
SAM: They haven't seen these scripts before. 
TALIESIN: I can't do the fucking accent. 
SAM: So go ahead and scene. 
TRAVIS: (claps) 
LAURA: (Jester) Good luck, you can do it. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: (Jester) I believe in you. 
TALIESIN: (Jester) I do not believe I can do it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: And action! 
MARISHA: Sorry, Matt. 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: Oh no, I can't hear it. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I can't find it. 
ASHLEY: (deeply) I'm so moody and dark, no? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, keep going. 
ASHLEY: Wait, can I hear their accent? 
MATT: No, keep going. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what is an English accent? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I can't get it in my head. 
SAM: Just do it. 
LAURA: Say one line. 
ASHLEY: (deeply, British) I'm so moody and dark. The Matron wants me to kill you with my daggers. (laughter) 
SAM: Okay, then Jester says. 
TRAVIS: (squeakily) Is he from Liverpool? 
TALIESIN: I can't think. ("Jester") Oh man, you have a god too, that is so cool. The Traveler is super awesome and can totally give you a drab outfit like a fun makeover. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (deeply) I'm going to-- (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm just going. (laughter) 
SAM: Yep. 
ASHLEY: ("Vax") I'm going to kill you fast-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: (Jester) Technically-- 
ASHLEY: Hold on, I got to finish my line. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, shit. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to kill you faster than one of Matt's NPCs. 
TALIESIN: Technically, you're already dead, so. 
SAM: And scene, that's good enough. 
MATT: Oh boy, wonderful. (claps) 
SAM: Now, what would it be like if Nott fought Vex? To act out that scene, here's Travis Willingham-- 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
SAM: As Vex. 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god. 
SAM: And Marisha Ray as Nott. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Thank god. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, hang on, wait. 
LAURA: You got it. 
MARISHA: [Nott] Aah! 
TALIESIN: That was terrible. 
SAM: And action. 
TRAVIS: Is it my line? 
SAM: Yes, your line first. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it starts with you. 
TRAVIS: (Vex) Darling, you haven't got a chance against my sexical, magical arrows. 
MATT: What? 
SAM: My sexical mexical ar-- 
TRAVIS: Sexical magical arrows. 
MARISHA: (impressively Nott) Aah! Fluffernutter! I'm drunk, buttons, Yeza! 
TRAVIS: Trinket, darling. What is this maniac talking about? 
MARISHA: Aah. Minotaurs. 
TRAVIS: (sputters) 
MARISHA: Alcohol. Motherhood. Screaming! 
SAM: And scene. (laughter) 
SAM: Thank you, performers, thank you. (clapping) 
MATT: Well done. 
SAM: Critical Role Challenge-- 
MARISHA: Fuck yeah. 
SAM: Critical Role Challenger Series are available today. Get your hands on them at UVSgames.com/criticalrole or at your local game store. Be sure to ask for the Briarwoods Co-Op Adventure. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Now, Matt, back to you. 
MATT: Fantastic, thank you, Sam. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. No, really, these are dope. 
LAURA: Yeah, these are fun. 
MATT: That was beautiful. 
LIAM: They are pretty cool. 
MARISHA: I'm Vax, I'm from Liverpool. (laughter) 
LAURA: I like how Jester just had no accent. 
TALIESIN: I gave up, I was just trying and it was not working. 
LAURA: It was not there. 
LIAM: These are actual size, by the way. (laughter) 
MATT: If only. 
SAM: We're just teasing. 
ASHLEY: Well, no, because when I saw those-- 
TRAVIS: Build your deck. 
ASHLEY: I was like how are these supposed to fit in there? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Can you fold up the cards? 
MATT: That's perfect. 
LAURA: These are cute. I want to hang them up. 
MATT: Next up, Laura, you got some announcements? 
LAURA: Oh, I do! You guys. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
LAURA: ♪ Guess what we have right now ♪ 
LIAM: You've got a lot of merch? 
LAURA: We got some Candela Obscura Beyond the Grave hoodie right here. 
ALL: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: That's cool. 
LAURA: Okay, so this is a really beautiful piece of art by Amelia Leonards. She did all the lovely watercolor illustrations from the book and then our fabulous Aaron Monroy added a little extra something something. What I like about this hoodie-- 
ASHLEY: What does it say? 
LAURA: Is that even if you don't watch Candela, which you should, even if you don't, this is just a cool-ass design. 
MARISHA: It's just badass. 
ASHLEY: Is that looking up from? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: From the grave, yeah. 
LAURA: It's like you're in the grave and you're looking up. 
ASHLEY: That's cool. 
LAURA: It says-- 
LIAM: That's Molly-vision. 
LAURA: Death is not the only way to go. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: It's really cool. 
MARISHA: So cool. 
LAURA: Also, we have-- 
TALIESIN: I'm into it. (triumphant humming) Oh wait, that's this one first. It's a Candela Obscura collapsible dice tray. 
SAM: Nice. 
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LAURA: You can unbutton it and collapse it and you can also-- 
SAM: It can be a Frisbee. 
LAURA: -- use these really freaking badass Candela Obscura-- 
LIAM: They're heavy. 
LAURA: -- premium dice. 
TRAVIS: Oh, do the turn. 
LAURA: They're metal. 
MARISHA: Look at that. 
TRAVIS: Let them hit the light. 
LAURA: They're metal. 
LIAM: Metal. 
LAURA: They're really cool. 
MATT: Oh, so the gilded dice actually looks gilded? 
LAURA: The gilded dice are actually gilded.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. 
TRAVIS: That was so cool. 
MATT: So last we left off, upon traveling here on the surface of Ruidus, Bells Hells, you have eventually journeyed across the dusty and storm- covered surface to the central capital city of Kreviris, where the Imperium's heart remains. You've trekked through the surface portion of the very tippy-top of this mostly subterranean city. You've met with a few individuals, barely dodged being found out and attacked by some of the local soldiers, defeating a few of them and others just barely getting by with some druidic ingenuity before getting the information you required, which was the location of the Volition, the resistance troop that has been working against the Imperium for a period of time that you can only assume has been a long while. After finding where this entrance was, you talked your way into the hidden subterranean tunnels before arriving here at the Volition Pass House. Here amongst a period of tense immediate conversations and convincing the Volition members present that you are not an immediate threat, weapons were put aside and the central figure, the seemingly leader of this who has been referred to in the past by other members as Rashinna of the Golden Hammer walked you to the edge of this pass house where a massive opaque crystal wall sat and there when she touched it, it began to become semi-translucent to reveal beneath the incredibly massive cavernous space that contains the expansive, beautiful, alien, but also in some ways oddly familiar landscape of the city of Kreviris. So here, as you take in the sights around here, Rashinna removes her hand from the crystal and (swoosh) it clouds over once more before she turns back to the rest of you. "So, you're here, you say we're allied and you're not a danger. What can the Volition do for you and what can you do for the Volition?" 
TRAVIS: Definitely a pillow, three squares a day. Maybe a place to sleep for a little bit. I wouldn't take your eyes off us if I were you. 
MARISHA: For our service to the Volition, we're all pretty aligned on this, so we think. 
TRAVIS: Very convincing. 
MARISHA: We will help you, we will help you with all the elf man coming in and him being like, "Whoa, this is my moon now, and (groans)." 
LAURA: Yeah, what she said. We want to take him out. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: If that means taking out your Mind Weave people as well, we'll do that. 
TRAVIS: Weave Mind. 
LAURA: That's our goal. 
MATT: "I say this with all due respect on the chance that we've just met here, but you would all become paste within moments of attempting to go against the Weave Mind. Let us begin this forging of trust with a bit of a chance for you to show us what you're capable of before we send you into the chipper." 
LAURA: Well, we also have a lot of allies on Exandria. At the end of the day, it wouldn't just be us. 
MARISHA: Plus, we got here, didn't we? We've been through a lot just to even find you. 
TRAVIS: That's right. 
MATT: "I can tell by the sallow look on your faces and the sunken sockets that surround your eyes, you've certainly made your way here." 
LAURA: We need sleep, all right? 
MATT: "Nevertheless, you've come at a time where we're in the midst of plotting. So you can make yourselves useful or you can sit back and do nothing." 
MARISHA: Wait, what can we? 
SAM: We're happy to make ourselves useful. We're useful people, but is there something specific you had in mind? 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: What are you plotting? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Can we hear? We want to plot. 
MATT: You see for the first time since your arrival on this Rashinna figure this slight smile curl at the edge of her sharp-toothed grin. "Plotting is what we do best. Walk with me." She turns back towards the center of the main chamber where you were. 
MARISHA: A walk and talk. 
MATT: As you can see, she's moving out of this main chamber off to a side chamber where there is a large rough-looking stone table. It looks like it may have been a circle at some point or maybe it's shaped in a way where it's circular in size, but it's really rough-hewn. So either it's a heavily damaged table or something that was crafted haphazardly and quickly out of the nearby stone. But as you walk, some of the other cloaked figures follow around. Others begin to scatter and still keep a distance, but you can still sense that you're being watched carefully by many figures in the vicinity as she continues to walk to the front of your troop and leading you into the next room. "We're all here based on trust. Many of our members, many of the people who have sworn themselves to this pursuit of freedom from underneath the Imperium have been harmed, misused, put into the position of having not much else in these days. So we are willing to give anything and everything for the future. Is this something you're willing to do?" 
SAM: We made our peace with giving our lives long ago. We know that not all of us will come back from this and if that aligns with what you're doing, then yeah. 
MATT: "Very well." 
LIAM: Trust is probably hard to come by and it's right that you're wary, but you don't have a lot of time and neither do we, if there's anything we can do to earn that trust. 
MATT: She steps to the table, puts her hand there for a second. "I've trusted before. My father was a very trusting man, and all it took was one time to trust the wrong person and now his hammer's at my side. So yes, I am very careful in who I trust. But to your point, things have been escalating. Come." She gestures everyone to come to the table as other figures begin to also emerge from the sides. You see one of the hulking figures, tall, broad back, heavy cloak that's wrapped over the shoulders and a hood that's leaned over, he pulls it back and you can see one of the Reiloran hulks, the juggernaut figures that you've seen, themselves muscular and swollen with whatever psychic power that resides within the Reiloran originally. He steps forward and you can see he has heavy marks on his face as well as elements at the crest of his forehead, you can't tell if it's tattoo or paint, but he has these unique shapes and designs put into it. He rests both of his arms heavy on the table (thuds) and you see three small figures scurry up behind him. (skitters) These tiny, two-foot entities and you didn't see them before because he was so broad, but now that he walks by, you can see there are these two bipedal, somewhat chewing gum-looking, textured individuals. The light here is not very prevalent, but as they step around him and flank to each side, they have a fungal texture across their body. They look like they're a tiny fungus folk that flank the sides of him as he walks. 
LAURA: So cute! 
MATT: Little companion pets or what, you don't know. 
MARISHA: Who is this that we're looking at? 
MATT: This is another figure that steps up to the edge of the table. 
LIAM: There's three of these little bipedal, fungal-type entities and a big guy? 
MATT: And a big guy. 
LAURA: Do their heads look like fungus at the top? 
MATT: One of them looks like it sprouts out into a bit of a spore-like headpiece. Another one looks like it's either not fully grown or it's not developing a cap, and the other one looks like it's cleft in the center and its head split, and then it healed over and now-- 
LAURA: Ugh. 
ASHLEY: Like a cow? 
SAM: A buzz cut? 
MATT: Yeah, as it walks, both sides flop a little bit and you can see an eye on each of the two split flaps as it (soft footfalls) wanders up to the sides of this hulking Reiloran. 
SAM: Are these, what are they called, cytaas? 
LAURA: No, they're not. 
LIAM: No, this is something else entirely. 
MATT: No, this is something else. 
LAURA: It's a new one. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Wait, how big are they? 
LIAM: Two feet tall. 
MATT: They're about two feet tall. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
MATT: While the figure they're following is about eight-- 
LIAM: Shorter than Orym. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: -- eight and a half feet tall. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: And about five-foot wide, shoulder-to-shoulder. 
SAM: Jesus. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MATT: Rashinna gives a nod. "This is Gaz Tomo." 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: "My right hand and the right hand of the Volition. Gaz, this is--" 
LIAM: Gaz. 
LAURA: I like them. 
MATT: "You said your name was?" 
LAURA: Imogen. We're the Bells Hells. 
MATT: "Bells Hells, yes." This massive hulk with his hood pulled back to drape over the back of his shoulders places his elbows on the table and leans forward to where he's now eye level with most of you and still taller than the rest and goes, (gruff, sultry) "Hey. Nice to meet you, Bells Hells." (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes! I'll follow him anywhere. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: "The name's Gaz." 
ASHLEY: Nice to meet you, Gaz. (laughter) 
LIAM: I need to take two minutes to get used to that. 
TRAVIS: No! 
MARISHA: Gaz. 
LAURA: Wrong lever! 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: The moon's weird, man. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I like it up here. 
MATT: "I know you're all looking at me, and--" (laughter) 
MATT: "-- I'm feeling a little uncomfortable, you know? A lot of us brutes, a lot of us hulks here in the Imperium are kind of single-minded." 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
MATT: "But that just goes to show how little you understand about us, huh?" 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Anyway, nice to meet ya." 
ASHLEY: Nice to meet you. 
SAM: Smiley day to you. 
TALIESIN: Absolutely. 
LAURA: I love him. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: When did you join the cause, recently or were you always with them? 
MATT: "No, I've been here about 10 years." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Wow. 
MARISHA: 10 years. 
MATT: "Not here in particular, this place is constantly moving. I've only been here about three days, but you know, generally, generally about 10 years." 
TRAVIS: (moaning) Oh. 
SAM: Wait, did you just say this place is always moving? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's why they got the flag. 
LAURA: The headquarters. 
SAM: Oh. Oh, the headquarters is always moving. Sure, sure, sure. 
TALIESIN: Not physically, but yeah, I don't think. 
SAM: This struggle's been going on for so long, have you made any progress? 
MATT: "Well, I mean, yeah. It's just not a lot of us and a lot of them." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I don't know. I don't know. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm not back yet. (laughter) 
SAM: Well, there's more of you now, because you got seven more on your side. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: "See, that there's heartening. But you fuck up, I'll take your head off." 
LAURA: We, well-- 
ASHLEY: I'm sure you will. 
LAURA: I can't guarantee we won't fuck up, but we'll try not to. 
ASHLEY: Gaz, who are your little friends? 
LIAM: Your friends? 
MATT: "Oh, these? These are my myceit," and he rubs the top of one. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Myceit? 
ASHLEY: Aw! 
MATT: "You really aren't from around here, are ya?" 
MARISHA: Uh-uh. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: He looks over at Rashinna, Rashinna goes, "Being Exandrians and your first time here on the moon, "I understand the ecosystem of Ruidus might seem a bit strange. The majority of the sustenance of the folk here is cultivated fungus or surface-based creatures for meat and leathers. But the myceit are part of the deeply-seated ecosystem of Ruidus. There are, I don't know what they number above, but thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of them that work throughout the city itself. They don't seem to align to any political endeavors. They live a short time and, well at the very least, they're certainly adorable. But they can be useful. "And--" 
SAM: Are they dozers? 
MATT: "-- Gaz seems to have a bit of a--" (Gaz) "Yeah, I have a soft spot, you can just say." 
SAM: They're not food, are they? 
MATT: "No, no." 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: "No, I don't eat them." 
SAM: Okay, but other fungus is cultivated for food? 
MATT: "What I know is there's a wide variety, at least 347 types of fungus down here. Depends what kind of flavor profile you're looking for. Texture's pretty heavy. You can go for more of a slime mold if you want something more like a party delicatessen vibe if you're having friends over. It's a whole different thing you got to set up for." 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: Wow. And not all of them are alive in the way that these are? 
LAURA: The myceit are? 
MATT: You see for a second him think and Rashinna goes, (Rashinna) "No, no they're not, Gaz. They're very different." He goes, "Right, yeah, very different, okay," and you see you kind of shook him for a second. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, got a little rattled. (laughter) 
MATT: A question he hadn't really considered before. 
TRAVIS: The door opened. Uh-oh. 
LIAM: I want to wave at the one with a split head. What kind of reaction do I get? 
MATT: (adorable, thick cooing) The head wobbles for a second. It waves back. (cooing) 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: Hey, little guy. 
MATT: (cooing) 
MARISHA: Do they have names? 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: What are their names? 
MATT: "I don't know, I never asked them. What's your name?" 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: One goes, (meaningful cooing) "I don't know how to pronounce that, so." (laughter) 
MATT: "It's on you." (laughter) (lingering laughter) 
LAURA: Do you ever try to-- 
TRAVIS: (as Gaz) It's on you. 
LAURA: -- talk to them in their head so you can understand them a little bit better? 
MATT: "I mean, I--" You see there's an awkward moment there and Rashinna goes, (Rashinna) "Not all Reilora maintain the capabilities of telepathic connection. The hulks, if you are, as well as the many other deviations of the standard Reiloran physicality have been altered over generations by the Weave Mind. We began as a singular people and since they've come into power, we're now many kinds with many specialties." 
LAURA: Did they do that on purpose? Keep people out of the hive? 
MATT: "I can only assume it made them easier to control and less likely to resist." 
SAM: Are you saying that they bred different kinds of people? 
MATT: "The Weave Mind, five extremely powerful Reiloran mystics. They really are the true ruling circle of Ruidus. They've fundamentally altered the evolution of themselves and our entire species to meet their ends. I myself have not seen them in person, but those who have been able to infiltrate deep enough to have even the briefest glimpse say that their withered forms are far taxed beyond their stretched lifespans, since the same five have been in power, as far as we know, since they came to bear their--" 
TRAVIS: No. They haven't-- This is not a seat that changes every couple decades or so? 
MATT: "The Weave Mind has been as it's always been since it started." 
MARISHA: How long was that? 
TALIESIN: How long ago did it start? 
MATT: "The best records we have, four, five centuries." 
SAM: They're as old as you. 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. 
TALIESIN: Wait a minute. 
TRAVIS: I guess it's time to open up a sixth seat. Say that five times fast. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Sixth seat. Sexy seat. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Sexy is right. 
MATT: "The Weave Mind, they oversee magical and mystic engineers throughout the upper echelons of the Imperium society, that develop and support the Dominion of Cruth and its military might since the development of the hulks and various other soldier specialties under The Will. They also can psychically project themselves all over Ruidus and can inhabit the minds of those who have been marked at birth, which is most." 
LAURA: Marked at birth? 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
LAURA: What does marked at birth mean? 
TRAVIS: They can project their minds all over Ruidus? 
MATT: She turns a bit and reveals, you can see from some of the chains that hang from the back of the neck, she pulls them aside. You can see there's a divot in the base of the skull, the back of the skull that it looks like something was carved out. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MATT: Or removed and healed over and you can see at this point, Gaz takes a nod and leans forward a bit and shows the same thing. 
LAURA: They can take control of you at any moment? 
MATT: "Every civilian of this city is at any given point in time possibly an extension of the Weave Mind." 
LAURA: Holy shit. 
TRAVIS: The fucking ancients, man. 
SAM: Just so we know when we're walking around and stuff, does that mean that everyone looking at us is always transmitting what they're seeing back to the Weave Mind? 
MATT: "They have limitations, or we would've been wiped out long ago. They are still five minds, though powerful and ancient as they may be." 
SAM: They can only focus on one thing at a time each? 
LAURA: Ancient. 
TRAVIS: I think I know the answer to this. Has anyone ever seen them? 
MATT: "They've been seen not by myself, but operatives of ours. We have, (chuckles) we have connections throughout the Imperium." 
MARISHA: Yes, that's how they said that they're all old and shrivelly now. 
ASHLEY: Just withered bodies. 
SAM: You said that if we were to face them-- 
LAURA: Just like you, Chet. 
SAM: -- we'd be turned into paste immediately because they're so powerful. Do they have arms and hammers and stuff or do they fight through the will of other people? 
MARISHA: Are they in little floaty chairs and they're all connected to-- 
SAM: Brains in jars? 
MARISHA: Brains in jars and they're (retched groan)? 
TRAVIS: Y'all are weird. 
MATT: "No, as far as I know, they just sort of float around." 
MARISHA: They float around like a brain in a jar. 
SAM: But how do they enforce their will? I guess through Cruth? 
MATT: "Through the five of them together. It's hard to explain and I hope you don't see it for yourself." 
SAM: I want to see it. 
MATT: "They're extremely powerfully-willed and are able to look and see throughout the domain beneath them here on Ruidus and especially within Kreviris at a blink of an eye. But there's a lot to look at and many people here and the most, the strongest that we can instill paranoia within them, the more unfocused their intent is and that gives us strength." 
LIAM: Have you ever-- 
TALIESIN: How do you keep, oh, go ahead. 
SAM: So many questions. 
LAURA: All of it. 
LIAM: So many questions. Have you ever had one of them reach into your mind that way? 
TALIESIN: Or someone here? 
MATT: "My father ensured that we were unmarked when we could be." 
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: Got it. 
SAM: Oh, sorry. You go ahead, Fearne. 
TALIESIN: See, that's the bit that, you carve that out so that they can't? 
MATT: "Yes." 
TALIESIN: Does that work with non-Reilorans, too, or no? 
MATT: "Well, only the Reilorans are marked." 
TRAVIS: Marked as in something was put in their head after birth or you were born with something that was carved out? 
MATT: "Shortly after birth. It's a requirement upon a Reiloran child being bred within the city that it must be brought into (sigh) the Arx Creonum to be marked." 
TALIESIN: Sweet fuck. 
SAM: The Ox Cronim? 
MATT: Arx Creonum. 
LAURA: Arx. 
LIAM: Arx Creonum. So they're tagged at birth. 
MATT: "The Arx Creonum is the citadel that is built into the Prime Pillar that I just showed you." 
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
SAM: Citadel. 
TRAVIS: Arx Creonum. 
MARISHA: Arx. 
ASHLEY: That's so fucking cool. 
TRAVIS: Creonum. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead. 
TRAVIS: I definitely didn't spell it right. 
LAURA: It's not cool for you. 
TALIESIN: So they have the ability to see all across Ruidus. Does their empire actually or does their control cover all of Ruidus? Are there places on this moon that are independent? 
MATT: "There were." 
TALIESIN: There were? 
MATT: "To be honest, from what we know, and I say this because many records have been destroyed by the Imperium when it took to power, but there's been estimated by what mystics we had within our reaches before they passed at least four points in history in which Ruidian society had to be reset by--" 
MARISHA: This is so much. 
MATT: "-- we don't really know why or where it came from, but Kreviris has been rebuilt at least twice." 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: "The central pillar being the only thing that remains in any way." 
LAURA: Has Predathos always been worshiped here? 
MATT: "This is an interesting conversation I have not quite had with many Exandrians." 
LAURA: I'm sorry. 
MATT: "You have your gods. They have no sway here. We see no miracles other than the visions we occasionally grasp in a dream and are left with nothing but envy or hatred or wishful thinking for some. All that we have are each other and the promises of the Weave Mind and the occasional whisper at the edge of our consciousness, that sense of belonging below. The Weave Mind are the ones that interpret the will of Predathos and for most, that's enough. It makes sense of all this." 
LAURA: Why would he speak to Exandrians and not to the people right in front of him? 
MATT: "He speaks to some. But I think you're ultimately more useful to his plan." 
LIAM: Can we talk history? You said that these five have been around for four or five centuries maybe. What about before then? It sounds like they have complete control and that's what you're working against, but what about before their rise? 
MATT: "Before then, there was the Collective. There were a number of societies that existed at multiple places on Ruidus. There was an event called The Crush nearly three centuries ago that destroyed most of them. There was tension between the Imperium and the Collective and this Crush was eventually what finished the ability for these various societies and villages to defend themselves and it was safest to ensure the survival of everyone to bend to the Imperium. To be honest, for many, there was promise. But as time has progressed, it seems they have intent elsewhere and the society is more of a self-reflective tool than it is something they're invested in, at least in my mind," and you see she looks around the table here to the others and they all nod solemnly. 
LAURA: Yeah. Chet. 
SAM: Go ahead, Chet, yes. 
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. This is fucking thrilling. You wouldn't happen to have, not that it would serve us any good, any of those carved out, again, sorry about your dome, devices that came out of your cranium? 
MATT: They look around and, look around and eventually come to a nod and she goes, "They're destroyed upon removal. We want to ensure that no possible aspect of the Weave Mind's connection could find its way into any safe space." 
TRAVIS: So smart, so smart. 
LIAM: What's their composition? 
TRAVIS: And stupid. 
LIAM: Is it organic matter, is it--? 
TALIESIN: Just a rune? 
MATT: "The Weave Mind are masters of psychic bioengineering, I guess is the best way to describe it. So it is an organic implantation, if you will." 
SAM: I got a couple questions, sorry, sorry. Unless you guys do? Question one, how do they get power? Or yeah, how do they? 
LAURA: How are they alive so long? 
SAM: Yeah, what are they feeding on? And tied into that question is what's your plan to take them down? 
MATT: "Hmm. The answer to your first question is something we are still trying to discover. We assume it has something to do with the heavy amount of bioengineering and research that they maintain within the Creonum. They have a number of various biological designers and talented figures that have worked under them for generations to better develop their obsessed means of pressing their existence and finding a way to build towards something that feels imminent. As to the second part, well, we'll have that conversation here in a moment." 
SAM: Ooh! One more question, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I apologize. 
LAURA: Why? 
SAM: One last question. There's a whole bunch of dreams going on, right? All the people of Ruidus are hearing the dreams of Exandrians. Do those dreams then get, do you know if the Weave Mind can see or hear those dreams as well? 
MATT: "I would have no confirmation, but I could only assume an element of that is carried on. They're connected to all their people, intentionally. While they are powerful as individuals, it's when the five of them are together that they are unstoppable." 
TRAVIS: If-- if! Because we're here to prove ourselves to you. We want to be an asset with a capital A! If you have any babies, younglings, that are getting the little things carved outta their head, maybe don't trash one of them. Just hold on to one of them for us, because we would like to do a little diagnostic action and see if maybe we could reverse the flow. 
ASHLEY: Reverse engineer it. 
TALIESIN: I can get you one later, if we have to. 
TRAVIS: You can? 
TALIESIN: I mean, we're inevitably going to come into contact with one, and I'll just, I'll-- 
SAM: Take off their head? 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: Wait, do we have anyone in the bag yet? 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: In the hole? 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: We should check the back of their heads! 
ASHLEY: Oh, we should. 
SAM: We're going to pull out a bunch of dead, severed heads. 
TALIESIN: Not right now. 
TRAVIS: They were already dead! They were already dead. We didn't do it. 
MARISHA: This might be weird. 
TRAVIS: They were already dead. We just, we're cleaning up. 
TALIESIN: Not going to do it in here, it's going to smell. 
MATT: "You do not have to apologize to us for taking out the trash." 
TRAVIS: Ooh, cold. 
ASHLEY: I have a question. So you said that before the Weave Mind there was the Collective? Then the Collective was destroyed because of something called The Crush? 
LAURA: Yeah, The Crush. 
SAM: The "Blue Crush?" 
ASHLEY: The Blue Crush? Great film. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What was that, exactly? 
SAM: Where they crushed all the opposition? 
LAURA: The Crush was like a war. 
MATT: "How long have you been here?" 
SAM: 300 years. 
TALIESIN: A couple days. 
ASHLEY: A couple days, yeah. 
MARISHA: Eight hours. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Five hundred, twenty--♪ 
MATT: "So you haven't experienced any of the quakes yet?" 
LAURA and TRAVIS: The quakes? 
SAM: Well, we felt like the big flashes of light. 
MARISHA: The flares, yes. 
MATT: "The flares and the quakes are different. Different phenomenon. Oh... Like all terrestrial land that has some element of shifting interior, there are occasional physical quakes. They're very rare, maybe once every few years or so we get one through Ruidus in different regions of it. But in recent months they've been happening more and more rapidly." 
LAURA: He's waking up. 
MATT: "Every month. We're down to maybe once a week, if not sooner. The Crush was-- About a little under three centuries ago. A series of quakes so strong that it destroyed most of the surface of Ruidus and laid most of our towns to waste. Or so I've been told. I wasn't around then." 
TALIESIN: Is that why there's so many ruins underneath the deserts? Or cities underground? 
MATT: "Possibly. I've mostly been in Kreviris most of my life, so." 
TALIESIN: Oh. And just as a random question, I like the hammer, what's the deal with the Golden Hammer? Is it a hammer and a title? I'm just curious. 
MATT: "It is a hammer and a title, yes." 
SAM: And it belonged to your father? 
MATT: "Precious metals of some make are rather rare on this landscape. Gold in particular, is extremely rare. This was a family heirloom that was constructed when my father was part of a, what you'd call a masonry guild, many years ago. When he stood up into his position within the Volition, it was, and still remains, the symbol of leadership within the Volition. So I carry it with much weight and much respect." 
SAM: I'm so sorry for your loss and if we can help you get revenge, we'll certainly try. 
MATT: "We've all lost something here." Then she looks around. Everyone kind of, there's a solemn tension in the air. We're all ready to lose more if it means that we can stop this cycle of violence. Even if it takes violence." 
SAM: Sure. Do you know who, you know, was responsible for his death? 
TALIESIN: I feel like you're getting a little too over focused on that. 
SAM: Okay, I just want to make sure that we're useful to you. 
TALIESIN: I don't think that revenge is really what they're asking for. 
MATT: (Gaz) "Well, that's not true. Revenge is very much what we're in the game for." 
TALIESIN: Except for that one. 
MATT: "But I mean, we can--" 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's pretty. 
MATT: We got the music working. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It was always working. 
LAURA: Weird, I didn't realize it wasn't there. 
ASHLEY: Me neither. 
MARISHA: It was driving me crazy. 
MATT: "Well yeah, Weave Minds, real dangerous, but they're just one of a few various factors here that you got to look out for." 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: "There is of course, Dominion of Cruth." 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: "Military law enforcement spectrum around the entire city and beyond there helmed by the Sunder King, Ozo Cruth and his organization called The Will." 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: "Yeah, yeah." 
SAM: Ozo Cruth? 
MATT: "Ozo Cruth, terrifying tactician. Warriors, the most recent in a long line of Cruths helming the iron will of the Ruidian military. Kind of a badass, to be honest. I used to look up to the guy. But anyway, his bloodline has a, what would you call it? Like a special psychic connection to the beasts of the land." 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: "Kind of call upon The Will. That's where a lot of the Slitherlords and the Wormlords and the Vidulchlords all stem their training through that entire family's bloodline. Now if you see one of them, run." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Or end it real quick." 
TALIESIN: He's like an Aquaman of the land. 
MATT: "Or make friends, maybe, with the beasts. But you know, good luck. If it's not going to, get out there real quick." 
MARISHA: There are lords of slithers? Like the little tadpoles with teeth? 
LAURA and TRAVIS: We saw them. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Outside of the-- 
MATT: "Oh yeah, there's all sorts of creepy crawlies that call this place home and let's just say the Cruths and all their family folk are real buddy buddy with them, yeah." 
MARISHA: Oh, I was thinking like, the little slithers had lords. That's what I was, okay, understood. 
ASHLEY: That's where I went with it. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'm not the only one. 
MATT: "See whereas the Weave Mind is seen as like the spiritual leaders of all the unenlightened folk of the city. You know, salvation through purpose in their eyes and all that." 
SAM: Religion, sort of. 
MATT: "Ozo, now they're the inspirational center of the Dominion. They're the ones who strength, power through strength, power through might, power through fisticuffs, you know." 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
SAM: That's the Dominion of Truth? Of Cruth. 
MATT: "That's the only point I had to make. I'll be quiet now." And he backs away. 
ASHLEY: Guys, um-- 
SAM: Oh sorry, what about, there's one more. The Tectus, what's that faction? 
MATT: There's a couple chuckles in the room. Rashinna goes, "The Tectus are dangerous at times, but also are quite useful. They're reliably paranoid and self serving. They are the bloodstream between the Weave Mind, the Dominion, and many of the various economic and social societal norms." 
TALIESIN: So politicians. 
MATT: "They impose their will on the street level. We also have a member or two within the Tectus that are aligned with our interests. So, what is the phrase you Exandrians use? Ace up our sleeve. What does that refer to, actually?" 
LAURA: Card games. Have you ever played card games? 
LIAM: Games of chance? 
MATT: You see people lean into the table like, "I've had visions and dreams of them, but we've not--" 
LAURA: Sometimes you play a game where you're playing for the best hand. Aces are powerful and some people cheat and keep them up their sleeve. 
MATT: Gaz goes like, "Oh, it's like Holies." 
TRAVIS and SAM: Holies? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Is that like Rollies? 
SAM: Do you roll something? 
MATT: "Yeah, you take a rock and you carve into different sides and you put little shapes on it. Then you throw them at each other until one of you falls unconscious." 
SAM: Why is it called Holies? 
MATT: "Because if you throw it really hard you leave a hole." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LAURA: That's not where I thought we were going. 
TALIESIN: Is there a point system to this? I'm suddenly very interested. 
MATT: "Yeah, whoever's standing wins the point." 
TALIESIN: Well, that's fair. 
LAURA: Have you seen Ludinus down here? Any of y'all? 
LIAM: What do you know about the Exandrians who are showing up on your-- 
SAM: Otohan? 
MATT: "We know about them. We've had eyes on them. We've had skirmishes that did not end perceivably well and the few survivors were able to give us descriptions as well as some ideas of their business since they've come here. But they've only been here a few weeks. So, we've been a bit scattered in getting what we can. So, information that you might have would be helpful. What we do know is that they've been, since they've arrived, been bringing all sorts of strange things from Exandria across that bridge and escorting them there beneath the citadel. There's been a large scale excavation beneath and within the Prime Pillar of glass." 
LAURA: So they're working with the Weave Mind, 100%. 
MATT: "I'm fairly certain." 
TRAVIS: Oh, the Prime Pillars! We saw it through the-- 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: What is that, anyway? Do you know where it comes from or how far it goes? 
MATT: "I myself do not. That's not my specialty. There are all sorts of veins of glass that weave through this world. That's the largest that I've ever seen." 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
MATT: "I can see why it's used as a symbolic seat of power here in Kreviris." 
LIAM: Can we talk for a minute about the One Who Sleeps? 
MATT: "Yes." 
LIAM: What is it? I'm not talking myth. Is it a tangible, real thing to your people today? 
MATT: "For many it is the closest thing to a faith outside of the Weave Mind, who speak of it as a calling to all of us. To be honest, there are a number of theories that even all of us at one point were Exandrians." 
LIAM: We talk about our gods, the people that we've followed here, and that we have a problem with back home. Best we can tell, they want to crack open this place like an egg and get the Sleeping One out for some sort of war or-- 
MARISHA: We have pretty strong reasons to believe that they want your Sleeping One to eat the gods of Exandria. 
LIAM: They put a lot of time and money and resources into going after your faith. We're here because we're a little worried about the repercussions for your world and ours should that come to pass. 
MATT: "What we do know is that since the Vanguard has arrived, the Imperium has been ushering an era of excitement within the populace. They promise of relocation. There have been days of celebration across the streets of this township, the city itself jovial with music and dreams realized. So, I know not what this means for this home to us, moon to others. But I believe the intent is for those who are true to the Weave Mind to leave it behind." 
LIAM: Are they dissatisfied with Ruidus? 
MATT: You see this hardened look come across her face. "The only reason we know that our life is so hard here is because we compare it to what we see of yours in our dreams. We see verdant fields, beautiful, curling rivers, seasons. We see feasts and holidays. We see miracles and-- Here, there is dust and survival. And there is joy to be found here. It's one thing to not know otherwise, except that most nights the basis of comparison is put in our face. There are many here who would hate you for what you have. I would not surprised if the Weave Mind are five of them." 
MARISHA: That's really horrible, I'm sorry. 
MATT: "It's all that we've known." 
SAM: Do you-- 
MARISHA: Question. 
SAM: Oh, sorry. 
MARISHA: We have a lot of questions. 
SAM: We do, and also I just realized earlier, I cut off Fearne's question. You still have a question that you haven't asked. 
ASHLEY: It already got answered. 
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry. 
ASHLEY: No, it's fine. 
MARISHA: You mentioned that society has restarted several times here. Do you recall or have any written texts from your history and how you came to be? 
MATT: "We don't anymore. At least, within the Volition." 
MARISHA: We have an inkling from the research that we've done. Do you want to know? 
MATT: "Maybe. But this has been a lot already." 
MARISHA: We're more than happy to share whenever you feel ready. 
MATT: You see her nervously fiddling with the gold hammer at her side. She looks around and you can see there are like, clusters of other Volition figures that have been arming up and waiting. She gives a quick whistle. Like this loud, two finger whistle. Folks begin to come into the side of the table. "We have to start plotting our plans for the morning. We have a few endeavors to transpire simultaneously. You want to prove yourselves?" 
SAM: Yeah! 
MATT: "This is an opportunity." 
TRAVIS: At dawn, we plot. 
MARISHA: He beat me to it. 
TALIESIN: Been waiting for it. 
TRAVIS: You can't beat me, motherfucker. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. 
SAM: Where does Chetney end? 
MARISHA and SAM: And Travis begins? 
TRAVIS: The union is almost complete! (laughter) 
MATT: Looking about the rest around the chamber. "One such endeavor, and please, do speak up if something strikes your interest. We are plotting a detonation of part of the excavation. That should deeply slow their advancement beneath the Prime Pillar and give us time to recover some of our imprisoned allies, and maybe allow some of your Exandrian allies to bring some reinforcements our way. What we do know is that Sorrowlord Zathuda is currently overseeing the excavation beneath Kreviris and well, most of our last demolitions team-- Most of our last demolitions team, uh-- Made a gracious sacrifice to buy us the time we have now. The only survivor, who has been a great ally and crafter of some of our means of defense is helming this next expedition." She puts her hand up as a lengthy figure emerges from the shadows. 
LAURA: I knew it! I knew it! 
MARISHA: This bitch! 
ASHLEY: Me too! Me too! (Ira) "I'm quite familiar with these figures." 
MARISHA: Of course, if it's Unseelie Court shit, of course he's involved. 
LAURA: You couldn't just tell us where you were? You couldn't just tell us how to get here? 
MATT: "Where's the fun in that, Imogen? Besides, you've learned a lot on the way, haven't you? Be thankful, all these little moments inform who you're going to be." 
TRAVIS: If it helps, we know this one could vouch for us, but we're not asking for that. 
SAM: It's really nice to see you again, Ira. 
MARISHA: It is, hello. 
TALIESIN: Hi, Ira. 
ASHLEY: Hey, Ira. 
MATT: "Hi." 
MARISHA: So you're leading this little exposition-- expedition? 
MATT: I led the last one. 
LAURA: Oh, he makes you so nervous. 
MARISHA: Yes, sorry. It's just he's so cool! 
MATT: "I led the last one. We crumpled two of their tunnels, but I was the only survivor, unfortunately." 
SAM: By design? 
MARISHA: I know that seems odd, Ira. You know that, right? 
MATT: "No, they are just so very slow." 
TRAVIS: Crumpled two of their--? 
MARISHA and SAM: Tunnels. 
TRAVIS: Tunnels. I heard "tongues" and was confused. 
ASHLEY: I did, too, and I thought-- 
SAM: (gasps) Tongues? 
ASHLEY: I was trying to figure out how that happened. 
TALIESIN: Tongues probably got crumpled as well. 
MARISHA: This is the excavation that's happening underneath the pillar that the Exandrians, as they're mining something, we're not sure. 
TALIESIN: God, I fucking hate excavations. 
SAM: I mean, this sounds like a good mission for us, for a few reasons, but what were the options? 
MARISHA: Yes, what's option B? 
MATT: "Well, we also have a infiltration." 
MARISHA: Fun. 
MATT: "One of our spies, Evoroa, a Bormodo scientist who is tangential to the work that Ludinus has been overseeing within the Imperium to repurpose some of this odd technology that he's bringing in. Evoroa has vanished, and has stopped--" 
SAM: Eroa? 
LAURA: Evoroa. 
TRAVIS: Evoroa. 
SAM: Ah-wa-wa-wa? 
MARISHA: I didn't get it twice. 
MATT: "Evoroa." 
LIAM: Evoroa. 
SAM and MARISHA: Evoroa. 
LAURA: He's a Bor-- 
MATT: "She's a Bormodo." 
LAURA: She's a Bormodo. 
LIAM: A Bormodo scientist, you said? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Evoroa. 
SAM: Oh, so she's gone missing and we need to get her back? 
LAURA: Somebody needs to. 
MATT: "She's been feeding us information for quite some time since their arrival, and some of the odd shifts in the Weave Mind's developments. But they were last to be confirmed working within the Colloquium of Candescence at the base of the Creonum." 
LIAM: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Colloquium? 
MATT: "Colloquium of Candescence." 
LAURA: Colloquium. 
LIAM: Colloquium. 
TRAVIS: The K Cube? 
LIAM: Candescence. 
MARISHA: Candescence. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
TALIESIN: It glows. 
MARISHA: Candela Obscura. 
TRAVIS: Evanescence. 
SAM: Really trying our spelling skills. 
LAURA: It's so bad. So bad. 
MARISHA: It's insane. 
TRAVIS: So glad I don't have [inaudible]. 
SAM: You said that that's at the bottom of the Creonin? 
MARISHA: The Creonin, where people get baptized. 
SAM: The Arx Creonum? 
MARISHA: Not baptized, but they get stamped. 
TALIESIN: Baptized. 
MARISHA: They get marked. 
MATT: At the Arx Creonum-- 
TALIESIN: Baptized. 
MATT: -- which is the massive stronghold where the Weave Mind-- 
SAM: Wait, you said the Colloquium of Candescence? 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: Bad-tised. 
LAURA: Is there? 
SAM: Is there? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Is where the, in the Arx-- 
MATT: The section of the-- Well, the Arx Creonum, which you will find out over the discussion, is, it's a stronghold in the sense that it's the core of it, but it is built all throughout this glass pillar. 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: It is a massive, extended mini city within the city. 
LIAM: It's a vertical city. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Do you have anything of Evoroa? 
LIAM: In a toilet tube. 
SAM and LIAM: Evoroa. 
TRAVIS: Evoroa? Any items of theirs? 
MATT: "Unfortunately, no. It's all been contact through messages. Nothing face to face or transferred. Though, we have the messages that were sent. Some of them, at least." 
SAM: Oh, that could help. Physical messages? 
TRAVIS: Physical messages-- 
MATT: "Yes." 
TRAVIS: -- or even where they stayed or lived? 
MATT: "I don't know where they stayed or lived." 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, the messages would be very helpful. 
MATT: "All right, we'll retrieve those." 
LAURA: Have you sent mental messages to Evoroa? 
MATT: "Some are mental, some are physical. Because we had to reach out. As a Bormodo, she cannot--" 
LAURA: Right. 
MATT: "But nevertheless, last we heard, she was, and a number of other crafters and designers, were working on something for Ludinus, some sort of device and/or weapon. She wasn't certain. Then, that's the last we heard." 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "So we'd like to see if we can either recover, salvage, or at least learn what became of her. Maybe see what this is. Also, some of us will be heading to a rescue operation, on the next day." 
MARISHA: There's a third option. 
TRAVIS: I love fucking A B Cs. 
LAURA: This is option-- 
ASHLEY: B. 
TRAVIS: It's been a minute. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Numerous folks have been taken prisoner by the Imperium. A number of our Volition, as well as a number of Exandrians who crossed the bridge and opposed the Imperium. Some of your allies." Looks over towards one of the hooded figures you saw when you walked in, this scaled, dark emerald dragonborn that you saw in this dark-looking, intense plate armor. Steps forward with this heavy sound of armor chinking and grinding against the stone as she steps out. "Yes, of course. I came here on the behalf of the Strife Emperor. 
TRAVIS: Oh, what? 
LAURA: Of who? 
MARISHA and SAM: The Strife Emperor? 
MARISHA: Wait, who is that again? 
TRAVIS: Y'all, read your lore. 
MATT: "I am Vezoden Amerai, the Talonheart. 
SAM: Was that a name? 
MARISHA: Wait, what did you say? She's who? 
MATT: "Vezoden Amerai." 
MARISHA: Bizordin? 
MATT: Vezoden. 
MARISHA: Viz-o-den. 
MATT: Amerai. (laughter) 
LAURA: I heard Bizordin, too. (laughter) 
LAURA: Vezoden Amerai. 
TALIESIN: There's been a lot of vowels and consonants coming at us today. 
LIAM: Bazongas. 
TALIESIN: You've worked very hard to make sure that we can't make these kinds of-- 
SAM: Bazongas Dragonage? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I appreciate it. 
LIAM: Vezoden Amerai. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You don't deserve this, Matt, I'm sorry. 
MATT: I never did. 
MARISHA: Vezoden. 
SAM and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: That's a cool name! 
LAURA: It is. It is really cool. 
TALIESIN: It is. 
ASHLEY: Wait, so Vezoden is here on behalf-- 
MATT: It's too late. 
MARISHA: Dani, help me. 
LAURA: No, it is cool! 
LIAM: It's a cool name! 
MATT: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. 
LAURA: We just misheard. 
TALIESIN: And we're dead. 
LIAM: But I don't recognize the lore that Travis did. 
TRAVIS: Strife Emperor-- 
LIAM: Is? 
TRAVIS: Bane, who's a Betrayer God. 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! 
LIAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: That's bad. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: But I mean, the fact that they are working with the Imper-- I'm sorry, I'll stop. 
MARISHA: Wait. 
SAM: So the dragonborn was sent on behalf of the Strife Emperor. 
MARISHA: Strife Emperor. Oh! Well-- 
SAM: To fuck shit up. 
LAURA: To fight? To fight Ludinus? 
TRAVIS: I don't know, they just introduced themselves! 
SAM: We don't know any of this. 
MARISHA: Well, hang on. 
SAM: We don't know this. 
TALIESIN: No, this makes sense. 
MARISHA: But this does confirm some things, that the Betrayer Gods have a similar vested interest-- 
TRAVIS: Don't want to get wiped either. 
MARISHA: Don't want to get wiped either. 
LIAM: To not get eaten, yes. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: So are you a champion? 
TALIESIN: That's why Asmodeus was-- 
MARISHA: Yes, was interested as well-- 
LAURA: ♪ Asmodeus ♪ 
MARISHA: -- with your guy. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Beelzebub ♪ 
MARISHA: She also has a hottie. Sorry, I'm getting ahead. Are you a champion of the Strife Emperor? 
MATT: "Some would say, aye." 
MARISHA: (excited gasp) 
TRAVIS: What's your weapon of choice? 
MATT: She pulls back the cloak, and you can see one arm is missing, and off the side of that hip is this wicked-looking punching dagger. 
LAURA: Punching dagger? 
TALIESIN: Punch dagger. 
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
LIAM: With a grip. 
MATT: With that hand. 
LAURA: (gasps) Sick! 
MATT: Yeah, like an awesome katar that locks into their gauntlet on their armor, and it has this crooked, almost kris-like blade that curves in like a talon. 
LAURA: She just-- (pow) Oh! 
MATT: She clicks it and goes, "Whatever inflicts the most pain." 
TRAVIS: (impressed laugh) 
MATT: "I'm going tomorrow to get some of my friends back." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: "Or at least take out as many of them as I can." 
TRAVIS: I want to go with her. I want to go with her. 
TALIESIN: I'm feeling this one. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, think it, don't say it. Think it, don't say it. Think it, don't say it. 
MARISHA: You're going to where? 
SAM: Just to fuck shit up. 
LIAM: To free some prisoners, I thought. 
TALIESIN: Including some Exandrians. 
SAM: Prison break. 
MARISHA: Prison break, but where? 
MATT: (Rashinna) "The Glasshold Garrison, which is on the lower end of the--" 
SAM: Such a glass hole. 
MATT: "-- the Arx Creonum." (light laughter) 
LAURA: Dang it. 
TRAVIS: It's on the lower level of the Arx Creonum? 
LAURA: Glasshold what? 
SAM: Garrison. 
LIAM: Glasshold Garrison. 
MATT: "Now, it's unconfirmed if they're still alive, though likely are being pressed by the Weave Mind and their allies for all possible information, if not made into tools of the Imperium as we speak. They have a habit of turning those they spend enough time with." 
TRAVIS: Shit. How long ago were they taken? 
ASHLEY: There's so much to do. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: "Not but a week before." 
MARISHA: Would we know anyone who also was taken? 
MATT: "I'm sorry, what?" 
SAM: They're your allies, right? They're not our people from Exandria, right? 
MARISHA: Do we know anybody-- Yeah. Well, she said she's from Exandria. 
LAURA: Yeah, but-- 
TRAVIS: I don't think she would know if they knew us. 
MARISHA: If they knew us? 
MATT: (Vezoden) "I have no idea." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Where are you from from Exandria? Are you from Exandria? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I am Exandrian, eh." 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Where from, if I may ask? 
MATT: "First off, what the fuck are you?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Little tin man, asking a lot of questions." 
SAM: Like you, I'm a follower of a deity. I'm a champion-- 
MATT: "Which one?" 
SAM: Well, my god might be more powerful than yours, so don't be upset when I tell you who it is. 
TRAVIS: FCG! 
TALIESIN: Just let it roll, kid. 
ASHLEY: We don't know that. It's just-- 
MATT: "You smell of broken road." 
SAM: Broken road, is that what you call-- 
MATT: Her tongue licks the front of her sharp teeth. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's my favorite ice cream flavor. 
SAM: Broken road? 
ASHLEY: Broken road. 
SAM: Is that what you call the Changebringer? 
MATT: "That's what she is." 
LAURA: That's what she is. 
TRAVIS: The broken road. 
SAM: Oh, I thought you said, "I smell chess." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: She backs up very intensely and goes, "Freedom brings all to ruin in time." 
MARISHA: What did he say? 
SAM: Freedom brings all to ruin in time. 
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs) 
SAM: He has subtitles under him. (laughter) 
SAM: I don't like the way you talk about her. She wouldn't appreciate it, either. So there. (laughter) 
LIAM: So you want to put us-- 
MATT: You watch as the dragonborn-- 
SAM: I don't like them. 
MATT: "(laughs) They're not coming with me." 
LAURA: That's fine. 
TRAVIS: Well, hold on. What're you talking about? 
LAURA: What are we going to do? Are we all going to split up and go on different parts of this mission? 
TRAVIS: I don't know if we should hedge our bets. We should spread the wealth. 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
LIAM: Our three options here is sabotage, right? 
SAM: Detonation! 
LAURA: Detonation, distraction. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Sleuthing to find this Evoroa, a spy. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: Or prison break. 
MATT: (Gaz) "Rashinna, do you think we'll need any help on the, you know (clicks tongue)?" 
LAURA: With the what? 
SAM: There's a fourth? 
MATT: (Rashinna) "I don't know if that would be a good idea, Gaz." 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: What's happening? 
MATT: (Gaz) "I don't know what you mean." 
LAURA: Gaz, what are you talking about, Gaz? 
SAM: Detect Thoughts. 
MATT: Do you Detect Thoughts? (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
SAM: Sure, sure, sure, go for it. 
MATT: Okay. In Gaz's head, you get the sense of-- 
TRAVIS: "I'm so awesome." 
MATT: "Uh-oh, did I fuck up? I was just trying to--" 
LIAM: Arby's. 
MATT: "I was asking questions, you know?" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We have the meats. 
MATT: You see in the head the, "Oh, oh I get it. Yeah, same here. Got it." 
SAM: Oh, because they're getting-- 
MATT: Rashinna's like, "No, the assassination mission, we're keeping it close to our chest." 
SAM: Oh man, that sounds cool! 
MARISHA: Assassination. 
LAURA: In her head, I'm going to say: Who are you assassinating? 
LIAM: Ooh! 
MATT: You hear in your head, "A figure that would buy us more time." 
LAURA: You think I'll have a problem with it? 
MARISHA: Ooh. Ooh! (gasps) 
LIAM: Dang. 
SAM: Oh shit. They're going to (whispers) kill her mom. 
MATT: "Likely." 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
SAM: Oh god! 
LIAM: We don't know this, though. This is all happening in here. 
MATT: You hear in your head, "Would you prefer to helm this mission? 
MARISHA and SAM: (gasp) 
MATT: "Because it's happening whether or not you're part of it." 
MARISHA: My stomach just got woozy. 
SAM: Matricide! 
LAURA: When are you leaving? 
MATT: "Tomorrow." 
LAURA: I might need to sleep on it. 
MATT: "Very well, but let us know at first break, as we have some eager and well-trained figures waiting in the wings." 
ASHLEY: My stomach is-- 
MATT: After that moment of quiet staring at each other, Rashinna pulls back. "Well, we have some things to plot, some discussions to have. We don't have the nicest of Exandrian pillowed feathered quarters here, but you'll be granted a floor, and perhaps a cushion. Rest well." She walks away from the table, and Gaz goes, "Yeah, sorry, her bedside manner is a little brusque, but I guess that's just how we roll down here. Anyway, pleasure to meet you. Come on, little guys," and walks away. 
TRAVIS: Come on, baby! 
TALIESIN: Cushion side. 
MATT: They begin to scatter off in groups, and going about. But there's still always no less than eight or so figures that are watching you at a distance. 
LIAM: So we're just in here? This is where we stay? 
LAURA: Yeah, where are we sleeping? 
MARISHA: Do we have a room? Can we-- 
MATT: There's a moment of silence before you can see two of the little myceit come darting out of a corner. (chittering) Grab your finger-- 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MATT: -- and start pulling you along. 
TRAVIS: (smack) Gah! 
LAURA: No, Chet! (laughter) 
SAM: Salt, salt, salt, salt! 
MARISHA: Did he just pounce one? (laughter) 
MATT: (screeching and writhing) 
MARISHA: That's slugs. 
SAM: Oh. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I know, I was like wait, why? 
LAURA: They're just little mushrooms. 
TALIESIN: You're just going to dehydrate them. 
LIAM: Mm. 
LAURA: (chittering) (laughs) 
SAM: Pepper! (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah, and-- 
LIAM: I do like stuffed mushrooms. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: These are just rough caves. There's no real beds. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: There's no separate rooms. The only real door that exists, at least of what you've seen so far, is the one that led you into the chamber. They lead you over to, there are two small alcoves that look like they were carved out very haphazardly. A lot of the dirt is still resting in the edges of it. It's a 10-foot by 10 open space where you'll have to get real cozy for the night. A moment later, another myceit comes in. (chitters) Throws this dirty blanket in there that lays onto it, one of them, and then he scatters off. 
TALIESIN: Wait. Wait, wait, wait! 
MATT: (chittering) 
TALIESIN: (desperate miming) (glugs mimed drink) 
MATT: Then darts off for a bit. 
TRAVIS: Would they be considered small or smaller beasts? 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Beasts, no. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Well, you're not sure. They're fungal. They're humanoid-ish. 
TRAVIS: I have Speak with Small Beasts-- 
MARISHA: I love them. 
TRAVIS: -- but I don't know if it would work on them. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: I don't have Speak with Small Spores. 
LAURA: I probably could-- (laughter) 
LAURA: -- maybe try to talk to them in their heads. 
TALIESIN: Speak with Spores. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: A moment later you hear (chittering). It comes in, and it's dragging what looks-- 
ASHLEY: Aw, the little noise! 
MATT: It looks like a leather water balloon with a spout on it that's pretty large, and it's (heavy sloshing) that's scooting it in. 
TRAVIS: Bladder of water. 
MATT: It is just a bag of water. 
TRAVIS: Awesome. 
MATT: It just, (sloshing thud) as it hits the ground it-- (undulating) 
TRAVIS: Dibs! 
MATT: -- like a water bed, almost. 
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no, no. 
TRAVIS: Fuck yes! (laughter) 
LAURA: A water balloon? 
TRAVIS: You snooze you lose! 
LAURA: Like a bed? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to toss a silver. 
MATT: (smack) (clattering) (laughter) 
MATT: He just runs off. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Just leaving it there. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Fuck it. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: What's it taste like? 
MATT: What? The-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, is it just straight water in this thing? 
MATT: It's water-- 
TRAVIS: Stop drinking my bed. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Stop laying on my fucking water. (laughter) 
MATT: It's pretty clean, it's pretty crystal. You gather whatever water makes its way through here is pretty heavily filtered through the nearby stone and dirt, so it's pretty clean. 
TALIESIN: It's not, you know, it doesn't kill the pain, but it does hydrate. 
MARISHA: They have a Sparkletts truck. 
LIAM: So it's just us now in a cavern, right? Like a small cave chamber? 
MATT: It's open into the nearby hall, and occasionally, figures do walk by, and you get the sense there are other figures on the outside of it, just posted. 
TRAVIS: Keeping tabs. 
LIAM: So we're in a vestibule, essentially. 
MATT: More or less, yeah. 
SAM: Do we still have thinking up? 
LAURA: You put it up. 
SAM: Yeah, so we'll think to each other, I guess. We got four possible, no, three possible missions as far as we know. 
LAURA: No, well, you heard sort of them talking about it. 
SAM: No, they were just staring at each other. 
LAURA: There is another mission. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Apparently, they are planning to assassinate my mom tomorrow. 
SAM: Okay. How do you feel about that? 
LIAM: How do you feel about that? 
ASHLEY: How are you feeling? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: (laughs) About that? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That's a lot to process. 
LAURA: Yeah. I think-- (exhales) You know, I'd kind of written her off, it's fine. God, I don't know. 
MARISHA: We've had this talk about what happens when we get to this inevitability. Of course, none of us assumed that it would be-- 
LAURA: So soon. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: I thought it would be after we came back, you know? I know she's bad. We've said it, we've made that clear. She does bad things for bad people. But when I made that connection, I felt her wanting me to stay away from him. You know? She didn't want me to connect. I don't know if that's protecting me, or if that's protecting them. 
LIAM: Did they make it seem, when you were communicating with them, that we'd be welcome along for that? 
LAURA: They said I could helm the mission if I wanted to. 
SAM: Do you sense that there's any possibility for redemption in her? 
LAURA: God, it would take a lot, I think. That pull is very strong, and she's got almost 20 years on it, you know? 
SAM: If they do go through with it, and you know, take her out, would you want to? 
LAURA: 10 years, she's got 10 years. 
SAM: Would you rather not be there-- 
LAURA: No, no, no. 
SAM: -- to witness it, or would you rather? 
LAURA: She's got almost 30 years, how old am I? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Sorry, keep going. 
SAM: Are you 10 years old this whole time? (laughter) 
LAURA: I'm-- I'm 28. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: She's been gone since I was tiny, so, she's 25 years with him. 
TRAVIS: It's been a minute. 
LAURA: It's been a hot second. 
ASHLEY: It's been a long time, it's been a long time, yeah. 
LAURA: You hear in your head very loudly. 
SAM: Ow. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: But would you rather be there to see it, or not? 
LIAM: I mean-- 
SAM: To get one more glimpse of her before she goes? 
LAURA: I-- I think-- (sighs) 
SAM: To say goodbye? 
LIAM: To change her mind? 
TALIESIN: To see how you hold up? 
LAURA: What if I try to stop it? 
TALIESIN: That is a question. 
MARISHA: We're also talking about an assassination attempt. Your mother is very powerful. 
LAURA: She is, I wouldn't be able to overpower her. 
TRAVIS: Mm... 
TALIESIN: Otohan may be right there, too. 
LAURA: I won't be able to overpower her. 
TALIESIN: Orb check? 
LAURA: Oh jeez. 
MATT: (chuckles) You see the glow of Otohan far more level than it was when you were above the city. She is somewhere in the heart of Kreviris. 
TRAVIS: Hmm, fuck. 
LAURA: Oh jeez. 
MARISHA: That's what I figured. 
TALIESIN: (clicks tongue) 
LIAM: It's tricky, because we go along, and you face your mother, maybe you could change her mind, maybe. 
LAURA: Maybe. 
LIAM: That could also be a point against us in their eyes here, if that goes the wrong way. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: But-- 
TALIESIN: Or get you killed, and probably us. 
LIAM: But then, if your mother has to be stopped, would you rather strangers do it? Or would you rather it be you with the chance of getting her back? 
LAURA: I don't know. I never even knew her. Speaking of parents we don't know. 
SAM: Yeah, I mean, the other mission might involve icing your dad, right? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, that sounds like. This is a bit of a pickle. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It does, is that detonation one? 
SAM: Well, he's down there-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: He's helming that. 
LIAM: He's on patrol for-- 
LAURA: He's running it, they're running the excavation. 
SAM: And we're to blow it up. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Possibly with him in it. 
MARISHA: And Ira-- 
TRAVIS: Well, maybe. 
MARISHA: Ira, of course, has his vengeance against him, so it makes sense that he's helming that one. 
SAM: How do you feel about seeing dad? 
MARISHA: Well, you said he didn't even raise you. 
ASHLEY: I did, and I just, I don't know him. 
SAM: But what if it could reveal something-- 
ASHLEY: I mean, I feel like-- 
SAM: -- about yourself that you didn't know? 
ASHLEY: Well, that would be, that would be something, but I mean, I don't know him. 
TRAVIS: Can I toss this out here? Because it feels applicable to both of you. Both got questions that you don't even know you have, right? Ah, look, I would love to be crass, and cold-hearted about it, and I am, but this is the last chance you have to ask those questions, or get answers, especially if it's going to fill in the gaps. This is our story. I don't think you can make decisions for other people, or even for Exandria before you take care of yourself first, because then we fall apart. You crumble. We made it to the moon. I think you could get an audience with your mom for one more set of questions. I feel like you could meet with this Unseelie Court guy, that sounds crazy. But we're on the moon! Crazy's kind of what we do. 
LIAM: I'd rather have your mother on our side than against us. 
TRAVIS: I wish there was more than one instance where she was trying to keep you from something that seems dangerous, because that would at least feel like there's something there worth saving. But it's something. 
MARISHA: Your mother can be far deep into whatever this mess is, and still love you. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MARISHA: Those two can coexist. 
LAURA: But does that change the outcome? If she's helping Ludinus, does it matter if she loves me? 
ASHLEY: It could. 
TRAVIS: You only get one mom. 
MARISHA: I think the tricksy part about all of this is that the entire reason for doing one of these missions is to gain the trust of the Volition. (sighs) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: If it seems like we're going on one of these missions to thwart that-- 
LAURA: I don't want to fuck it up. 
MARISHA: -- it could undermine our connection with them, yes. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I feel like if there's parts of your mother that are, there's still care there for you, in wanting to keep you away, there's still something there in her that I think, there's still love there, still care. I say if we want to keep this group on our side, maybe we try to save your mom, and I don't mind, maybe we can take out my dad. I'll volunteer. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah? 
ASHLEY: I mean, I don't know him at all, so. 
TRAVIS: You could also ask him for, it was to buy more time, right? This mission that you heard of? Maybe we could ask for a little more time. I mean, they can try tomorrow, it might fail, it might succeed. Maybe it-- 
LIAM: This could be your last chance, if they go off without us, and they end your mother, that's a decision taken out of your hands. 
TRAVIS: Could also ask how many times they've tried, how many times they've failed, what did they come up against? Does a day or two make a difference? 
TALIESIN: They're in a cave, I don't think they're going to succeed. They've been in this cave clearly a while, or a cave. They don't know what they're going to be hitting. 
ASHLEY: Do you feel like this is a conversation that maybe you could have with Rashinna? Just say, maybe there's another angle here. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: To Chetney's point, this war, and the whole reason we're involved with it, it's been personal since day one. Might not be worth trying to pretend like it's not. 
LIAM: Lot of risks. We could make enemies of both sides. I doubt that the champion of the Strife Emperor are going to be big on our plan. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit! That's just a story where I'm from! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Fucking Strife Emperor! 
LAURA: That's a really evil, evil god, right? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Oh, I've never come across anybody that actually followed him. Them, him, he, I don't know. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's bad stuff; it's like war, and lawlessness, and (growls)! 
LAURA: Why do you want to go with them then? 
TRAVIS: I mean, there's a celebrity. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I just want to see what goes down. Plus, I mean, it's a lot of action, but if I was being practical, I would probably go for option B, the Evoroa, finding them. 
SAM: I feel like our chances are highest with the first one, the detonation one. 
LAURA: I think so, too. 
SAM: Because we know Ira, she's got a connection. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I mean, we-- 
SAM: We're good at breaking things. 
MARISHA: Pretty good. 
TRAVIS: We are. 
LAURA: I mean, we broke the one in the Fey Realm-- 
TRAVIS: The only reason I was thinking that we could do that maybe second, or not at all, is (laughs) because people are looking for us, we're hot. I feel like we'll get hotter doing that one. 
LAURA: Well-- 
SAM: If we're going to, we're hot anyway. We're rolling with the rebels, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I think so, but-- 
LAURA: I also think that, you know, if we are hot already, it's going to be hard for us to infiltrate anything, and find out about Evoro, Evoroa. 
TRAVIS: I just meant we're in this new city, we're now underground, right? We've left the surface, we could take advantage of any, our faces not being quite as known for a little bit longer. If we blow up a tunnel, you know, and we're running, we're going to be hot down here, too. 
LAURA: I think it's blow up a tunnel, and prove ourself to the Volition, and maybe head out. 
LIAM: I also think the demolition is probably the easiest, but what I worry is that you will miss your window if we do anything other than follow your mother. 
MARISHA: Options B and C put us somewhere in the Arx Creonum, which could also give us some answers. 
TRAVIS: Man. 
TALIESIN: Rescuing prisoners is also more data. 
TRAVIS: Good menu. 
LAURA: It is. 
ASHLEY: It's a really good menu. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Maybe we can talk to them about delaying some of these, so we can do more than one. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Or we split up. 
SAM: Right, do they all have to be on the same day? That's crazy, why, who makes plans like that? 
LIAM: If we work fast. 
LAURA: I think the detonation maybe is, you know-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: A distraction. 
LAURA: -- is just-- 
ASHLEY: It's like a double whammy situation. 
LAURA: Yeah, the detonation makes it so that they can get in, and do the rescue mission. 
MARISHA: I mean, is that a crazy suggestion then? That we split up? 
SAM: Could also split up. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
SAM: At least take half and half-- 
MARISHA: Half and half. 
SAM: Because some of these-- 
TALIESIN: That would be a great last-- 
SAM: -- might require a smaller group than just seven big dumb idiots. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, the Strife Emperor probably only needs one other person. 
SAM: (laughs) (laughter) 
SAM: If you want to... 
MARISHA: Solo episode! 
TRAVIS: What a fucking-- Did you see the weapon she had? 
LAURA: It was scary. 
TRAVIS: That armor was sick! 
LAURA: You should think about-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was really cool. 
LAURA: -- carrying a weapon like that shit. 
TRAVIS: That just attaches to my arm? 
SAM: When you're done with that mission, do you mind shanking Vezoden in the side, and-- 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (gasp) 
LAURA: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Would you knight me as a paladin of the Changebringer? 
SAM: I sure would, if that's the Changebringer's wish. 
TRAVIS: I'm listening. (laughs) 
SAM: That's all I have to say. 
TRAVIS: Oh. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm done. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I mean, I think any of these could help us in our standing with the Volition, but only one's got personal stake, and it's really-- 
SAM: Two. 
LAURA: Two. 
SAM: (whispers) Personals. 
LAURA: But yeah. 
LIAM: How close are you to dad? 
ASHLEY: I don't even know him. 
TRAVIS: I've heard of him. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I've heard of him-- 
LIAM: Do you want to? 
ASHLEY: I didn't even know he was my dad until, I don't know, a week ago? 
MARISHA: I would also like to say that your dad has been after you since you were born. So, it could get a little hairy if we deliver him-- 
TRAVIS: Danger close. 
MARISHA: Yeah, directly to him. 
LAURA: He's going to want her if he sees her. 
TRAVIS: It just sucks-- 
SAM: Everybody does. 
TRAVIS: It sucks, because his player's Unseelie Court, whole area of Fey Realm we've never seen before. 
MARISHA: I know, and we get-- 
TRAVIS: This is the worst Denny's ever, I want all the things. 
ASHLEY: Ah! I want Moons Over My Hammies, I want-- 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs) I also want the Grand Slammer. 
SAM: If you get in trouble, couldn't you summon your devil boyfriend to help you out? 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: I was already thinking about that. 
LAURA: Would he be able-- 
ASHLEY: If we need-- 
LAURA: -- to get here? Your devil boyfriend, could he get here? 
TRAVIS: Oh-- 
ASHLEY: Maybe I should try to-- 
SAM: They're on the same plane-- 
ASHLEY: -- try to give him a call? 
TALIESIN: No, this probably couldn't get here. 
LAURA: There might be a problem, you probably can't get him here. He can't get through the gate. 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: Only one way to find out. 
ASHLEY: Shit. Hello? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I think you got to lick it first. 
SAM: Wait-- 
ASHLEY: (slurps) 
SAM: -- if he comes through your ring, then (laughter) 
SAM: -- the ring's already through the gate. 
ASHLEY: He's going to come through my hand? 
SAM: If he comes through the ring, then-- 
LAURA: Yeah, but your coin-- 
TALIESIN: He's not in the ring. 
LAURA: -- is through the gate as well, and-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: -- you're having trouble-- 
ASHLEY: Help! 
LAURA: -- talking to her. 
SAM: Well, let's find out. 
TALIESIN: He's not like a bear, and he's not in the ring. 
TRAVIS: If you summon a demon into the secret hideout-- 
SAM: I'm going to ask-- 
TRAVIS: -- we're going to be in trouble. 
SAM: I'm going to ask the Changebringer a question. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to focus on my coin, 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: -- and ask the Changebringer to answer me one question. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Because I can do that with the coin. 
MATT: Yeah? All right, what question do you ask? 
SAM: Silently, I ask: Is Imogen's mother redeemable? 
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh, ooh! (snaps fingers) 
LAURA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
TRAVIS: Dealing! 
LIAM: Let's go. 
SAM: Heads for yes, tails for no, or if they don't know, it stands on its side. 
MATT: (sighs) You flipping it? 
LIAM: "Twilight Zone." 
MATT: It's interesting, when the coin flips in the air, when you flip it normally, after asking a question, it has this ring to it, this (gentle metal vibration), it has the most beautiful, perfect sound of a coin toss. It's just silent when you flick it, and then it lands. Foof. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
TRAVIS: Just flat, poof, or on the side? 
LAURA and MATT: On its side. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
LIAM: "Twilight Zone." 
LAURA: What did you ask? 
TRAVIS: Did you hit your nose? 
MARISHA: Unhelpful, it's-- (laughs) 
SAM: I asked about your mom, but-- 
LIAM: But it's complicated? 
SAM: But it's complicated. Sources say ask again later, or whatever they want to talk about. 
ASHLEY: Well, that means to me it can go either way, so. 
SAM: But also, it does mean, I mean, coins don't just land like this normally, it means that the Changebringer is connected to me still, even through the gate. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Because the power of my love is strong enough. 
TRAVIS: One thing is certain, we got to fucking sleep. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: We got to rest. 
SAM: I'm somehow at more than max hit points, I don't even know how that's possible, look! (laughs) 
LAURA: I know, did we sleep? We slept, we did sleep. 
SAM: Yeah, but sure, we can sleep again. 
LAURA: But we-- 
TALIESIN: Did we? 
ASHLEY: Mean, I guess-- 
TALIESIN: I don't think we did. 
LIAM: We're going to now. 
SAM: I think we did. 
TALIESIN: Did we? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: When? 
SAM: I don't know. I have-- 
TALIESIN: What about how-- 
TRAVIS: The last time-- 
LAURA: But you need to get-- 
TALIESIN: We took a short rest. 
LAURA: But you need to get your-- oh, maybe we took a short one. 
TALIESIN: We took a short rest, because I would be-- 
TRAVIS: How many levels of exhaustion do you have? Yeah, so we haven't. 
SAM: Oh, we still haven't slept, holy bajonah. 
LAURA: But I've only used two spells. 
ASHLEY: This your last one? 
LAURA: Oh, there's a bunch right there. 
TALIESIN: So, when I wake up, I'll have one. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, we need to get rid of one. 
TALIESIN: That's expensive. 
TRAVIS: (wheezing laugh) 
ASHLEY: You know? 
TRAVIS: That's what sleeping will do! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but wasn't that-- Can't we all-- Wasn't that on the table-- 
SAM: No, no, no, she's right. We can Greater Restoration, and then he'd be at top, top level. 
ASHLEY: Then you'd be at tip top. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, but that's not any fun. 
LAURA: Tippy toppy! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It's expensive. 
SAM: It is expensive, although-- 
LIAM: Not before bed. 
SAM: We have a Scroll of Greater Restoration. 
TRAVIS: Just got to get you a sentient weapon while you're exhausted. 
SAM: That's free. 
TRAVIS: That's the best. 
LIAM: Do you have the boost right now? 
LAURA: But that scroll was to save Planerider Ryn in case we came across her. 
SAM: But I also can do it. 
LAURA: But what if I'm not with you? 
TRAVIS: But what if I? 
SAM: I could do it. 
TRAVIS: (sniffs) 
SAM: Somehow, in all of this craziness, I still have one 6th-level spell left. 
LAURA: I have a lot of spells left-- 
SAM: I'm very good at spell management. 
LAURA: That's why I'm confused right now. I'm not sure what we did. 
TALIESIN: I think using the scroll would be a bad idea, but-- How much-- 
LAURA: How much was the cost? 
TALIESIN: What's the cost? 
SAM: 100 bucks. (laughs) 100, it's a diamond worth a hundred gold pieces. 
TALIESIN: Do you have a diamond-- 
SAM: Or diamond dust worth-- 
LAURA: Oh, we got that. 
SAM: At least 100 gold pieces. 
TALIESIN: You have more diamond dust than a hundred gold pieces worth of diamond dust? 
SAM: I believe so, let me see in my inventory. It says here I have powdered silver, 100 gold, diamond dust, 500 gold worth. 
TALIESIN: Okay, then I will-- 
LAURA: Oh, fuck yeah, that's-- 
TALIESIN: Hey, that's where we're sitting, then I will take that, because this hurts, and I am cranky. 
MATT: You hear these heavy rapid footfalls. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: (fast heavy footfalls) 
SAM: Maybe hold that thought. 
MATT: (fast heavy footfalls) 
LAURA: Is it Gaz? 
MATT: Around the corner, Gaz goes, "Ah, I just remembered you had a question, we totally forgot to get to it earlier, I'm so sorry. What were you going to ask?" 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Good. 
LAURA: I love him. 
ASHLEY: Uh-oh, I-- You're-- Wow. 
MARISHA: (panting) 
ASHLEY: I think it got answered, but I actually, I thought, another thing I was thinking-- 
MATT: "Okay, okay, I as just--" 
ASHLEY: But wait, hold on, hold on a minute, hold on a minute. 
MATT: "Oh, what's going on? All right, yeah." 
ASHLEY: How did you end up on this side of things? 
MATT: "Well, you know, just, it's hard when a lot of what you've been told your whole life you're supposed to be doing just feels wrong the whole time. You know, I had a moment where I'd had a run-in with Rashinna's dad. And I mean, I had him within an inch of his life, really. Had him dead to rights on the ground, and just one little pop, and then, and something in me broke. I don't know why, there was a look in his eye of just pity and forgiveness, I don't know, it's hard to describe, but I just started to cry." 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
MATT: "I've never cried before." 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: "And the tears just wouldn't stop. And he just held me." 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MARISHA: Aw. 
MATT: "And I said, 'Help me.' And he unmarked me, and took me back, and been here ever since." 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: "He was a good man." 
LAURA: Gaz. 
MATT: "Yeah?" 
LAURA: What's the plan for tomorrow with the assassination? 
SAM: And could it be delayed by a day? 
MATT: "I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about that." 
LAURA: Just come on in here, Gaz. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
ASHLEY: Come on, we got it. 
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 29. 
MATT: 29, he's like, "Uh-- There's been a particular figure of interest who's been dealing quite directly with the Vanguard, Weave Mind and, well, seems to be of this latent powerful figure, this Ludinus guy that everyone keeps talking about has been putting on a pedestal, seems real important. They've been hard to pin down, moving around rather quickly, just seeing bits and pieces floating through the city and vanishing and stuff." 
TALIESIN: God, I wonder who that could be. 
MATT: "But recently, I've discovered that she's been held up in this place called the Woven Music Grand Hall. Been gathering a lot of these whatchamacallits. A lot of you Exandrian folk been wandering around here." 
LAURA: Ruidusborn. 
MATT: "That's the one, yeah. Ruidusborn. They've all been conglomerating in that music hall. It's real pretty, looks like a big shell." 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: "Seen there yesterday, and was there for today. So we figure while we have the time here, at some point tomorrow, we're going to send in a strike team and see if we can take her out, maybe wreck up and tangle some of the plans of the bad guys." 
LAURA: And what if she's working against the bad guys from the inside, and, by killing her, y'all hurt yourselves? 
MATT: "Uh... Ow." (laughter) 
MATT: "I don't know, everyone seems to say she's pretty bad, so." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "I don't know, I just do what I'm told." 
MARISHA: And just to make sure we're super clear on this, did the woman, you know what she looks like, does she look kind of like her? 
MATT: "Oh yeah, spitting image. Kind of wild. I was going to ask a question about that. Freaked us out when you walked in, to be perfectly honest." 
LAURA: I'm sure. 
MATT: "We were like, oh shit! Target came to us! Makes it real easy. But no, you're pretty much--" 
SAM: And it has to be tomorrow? Or this is an ongoing meeting that they have there? 
MATT: "I don't know, we just don't know how long they're going to be there, and if they move off site, then we've lost our lead, so it's--" 
TALIESIN: You have a plan to deal with the flying, mysterious stranger who seems to be zipping around? 
MATT: "I'm not the one organizing this. I'm just here supporting the leadership." 
TALIESIN: I mean, there's a general plan that you-- I definitely know you do not have the details, clearly, but there's a notion of a plan through somebody's head? 
MATT: "I trust Rashinna has it all figured out. She's real smart, and we have a lot of intel on this particular figure having all sorts of wild powers in line with a number of the Thought Eaters and other high end Mystics. We have ways of dealing with them, so." 
TRAVIS: Have you ever-- 
LAURA: What ways? Wait, what ways? 
TALIESIN: You're not going to get anything out of-- 
LAURA: No, I-- 
TALIESIN: -- himbo of the moon here. 
LAURA: If it could help us, then-- You have ways of dealing with those Thought Eaters? 
MATT: "I mean, there are a number of ways, yeah. Look, I don't know how they work, but there's sort of scrambling devices, shuts them down for a moment, and then folks like me come in and pop them, you know." 
LAURA: Good to know. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LAURA: All right. Thanks, Gaz. 
TRAVIS: Gaz, have you tried a hit mission on this target before? 
MATT: "No, no, not this one. Never been able to pin her down long enough. She's always been a distant person of interest, and only recently has her dealings and word coming back that she's rather integral to the plan of the Vanguard, which makes her an asset worth taking out." 
TRAVIS: Does the Volition have a decent success rate on previous assassination missions? 
MATT: "I'd put us at about 60/40." 
MARISHA: Which direction? 
MATT: "I'll get back to you on that one." 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: But Gaz, you know it's possible for people to change. 
MATT: "Oh yeah, totally." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Well, you changed. 
MATT: "Oh yeah." 
MARISHA: You just told us. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Real proud of it, too." 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: "You know, it's really impressive. Sometimes if you give someone a chance and a right path, they can turn right around." 
SAM: Sounds like the Changebringer to me. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Turn the path around ♪ 
ASHLEY: It would be a shame if someone killed you before you were able to make that change. 
MATT: "(laughs) You're telling me." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "All right, y'all rest well. I'll see you in the morning." 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you too. 
MATT: (laughs) (heavily armored footfalls) 
ASHLEY: I love him. 
TRAVIS: Can I put the monocle on? I'm going to cast Arcane Eye in this little room, and I'm going to send it after Gaz, following him out. I don't know where he's going. 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: You see him hanging out-- 
TRAVIS: So I sit down. 
LAURA: -- with a little myceit, dancing. 
TRAVIS: I want to see where else people are going outside of this room. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: I'm now officially less worried about your mom being good and more worried about what happens if she's just a manipulative fuck. 
MARISHA: I mean-- 
TALIESIN: Officially, now. 
MARISHA: I don't want to cast any doubt on the Volition and their plans, but if your mother is gathering a bunch of Ruidusborn into a single place, and they think they're going to roll in there and assassinate her, that sounds-- 
LAURA: Like a suicide mission. 
ASHLEY: Really dumb. 
MARISHA: -- like a suicide mission! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That's a terrible idea! Do they even know how powerful the Ruidusborn are getting? 
SAM: Maybe we should go just so that we can protect-- 
MARISHA: Protect them! 
SAM: -- them from her. 
MARISHA: I mean, look at how hard it was just for us to fight that one Thought Eater. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That one 16-year-old kid awoke in that moment! 
LAURA: He was easy to take out. 
MARISHA: Yes, but imagine-- 
ASHLEY: Lots of them. 
MARISHA: -- him times 40! 
LIAM: Also, if we go in there swinging, your mom is going to be really dangerous, deadly. Might be more effective just for you to try to talk her out of there. I wonder if we could pitch extraction Instead of assassination. 
MARISHA: I mean, I hate to say this. This is a terrible, terrible idea, but-- 
TALIESIN: They'll never agree to it, I don't think. 
MARISHA: Couldn't you theoretically talk to her now? 
LAURA: Yeah, I could. 
TALIESIN: Oh, ooh. 
LAURA: But I don't want to warn her if-- 
MARISHA: I know. 
TALIESIN: Not in here. 
MARISHA: No. 
TALIESIN: Somewhere else, but not in here. 
LAURA: God, this shit's complicated. 
MARISHA: It is incredibly complicated. 
SAM: We could maybe see her. 
LAURA: In a dream? 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: We still have the one scroll? We still have the scroll up? 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: Scroll? 
MARISHA: The mind shield-y one. 
MATT: You've used them both. 
LAURA: That one is-- 
MATT: It still affects you right now, it hasn't faded entirely. But over a night's rest, it'll go away. 
SAM: Well, we've got to make a decision. Do we sleep on it and decide in the morning or do we want to take a peeksies at her tonight? 
ASHLEY: But if we take a peeksies, isn't that like you could be giving in back to that thing again? 
LAURA: I don't know! I don't know anything here. I don't know. (groans anxiously) 
SAM: Do you want to visit your dad in a dream? 
TALIESIN: Did you figure out where she was, other than Ruidus, when you were dreaming? 
LAURA: Sure, I could find her exact fucking location. But guess what? She could see me, too. 
TALIESIN: I was curious if locations showed up in dreams. I don't know. My dreams are fucking weird. 
TRAVIS: They seem to here. 
TALIESIN: Shit. Because it'd be great to have that conversation. 
MARISHA: I didn't know if it would maybe add a little bit of extra protection while we still have the barrier of this scroll, but I'm not entirely sure that's the case. I don't know. 
SAM: Yeah, probably. 
MARISHA: A little bit of a one-way call. 
LAURA: I mean, I think it was reaching out to Predathos that called Otohan to us before, so maybe if I reach out to her directly. But what would I say? 
TALIESIN: Other than warning her that we're coming, which is a terrible idea. 
LAURA: That's a terrible idea! 
MARISHA: It's a terrible idea. 
LAURA: I can't do that. 
TALIESIN: The very act of calling might do that. 
MARISHA: Even if the Volition is tipped off, even in the slightest, that she got tipped, it's going to point directly back to us. 
LIAM: We're done. We have no friends on either side. 
MARISHA: We have no allies. 
SAM: What if you reached out to her and lied and said: Mom, I'm in trouble, and see if she is concerned or not? I don't know. 
TRAVIS: I think you've tried that, haven't you? 
LAURA: I don't know. I don't remember. 
SAM: Well-- 
LIAM: Do you think-- 
SAM: All we've got to do is figure out if we're going to go on that mission with them tomorrow or not. 
MARISHA: When you tried to talk to her when we were attacking the Malleus Key, did you feel like there was any possibility of swaying her then? 
LAURA: No. The only time I felt-- At the Malleus Key I-- Yeah. She looked at me for a moment, and it was like she wanted to help, but something pulled her the other way. 
ASHLEY: I feel like she's just in too deep to try to, she doesn't know how to get out. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Do you think there's a way to reach her tonight to ask her to meet you somewhere safe? 
TALIESIN: (unconvinced groan) 
LIAM: Relatively? Outside of here, outside of there? 
TALIESIN: I mean, she can pull-- 
LAURA: I can try. 
TALIESIN: -- the location of this place out of your head. 
LAURA: I don't know where is safe, though. 
SAM: In your dream. 
LAURA: I could talk to her in our dreams, yeah. 
ASHLEY: But isn't that putting you online again? 
LAURA: Kind of, yeah. I mean-- 
ASHLEY: For everyone to know that you're online. 
LAURA: Yeah, but maybe if it happens fast enough, maybe it'll be different with this. 
LIAM: There were less people topside. 
LAURA: That's true. 
LIAM: Maybe you could invite her to meet you above. 
MARISHA: I don't know, seems like dreams is going to be the safest bet. Even leaving this stronghold that we're in now. 
LAURA: If we're going to do it, then-- 
MARISHA: It's going to alert us. 
LAURA: -- we should do it soon, before our scroll wears off. 
TALIESIN: I'll also say, as much as I love all of you fucking complete messes, we're making a lot of assumptions that your mom is actually good. 
LAURA: No, we're not, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: All of these plans and all of these things are taking that assumption that she's swayable, and I want to make sure that that thought does not leave, because no one's mentioned in all this. It's all been, one last chance, we can talk to her, we can bring it around. Just to make sure that we do know that this could go real bad, real quick. 
LAURA: Sure. 
LIAM: I think none of us have wanted to say that second part out loud. 
TALIESIN: Exactly! 
LIAM: Which is, if it goes south, then it's a throw-down, but we all know that. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Need to say it out loud. 
MARISHA: I guess the ultimate question is, are we going to allow this one last chance? Because it seems like if we do it, it really is the last chance. 
TALIESIN: And she can't know-- 
MARISHA: We've already tried. 
LAURA: Honestly, I thought I'd already given up on her. But hearing that she's-- 
MARISHA: She could be gone? 
LAURA: Yeah. There's also a chance that if I go in, I might have trouble coming back out. I don't know if it's worth that risk. 
SAM: Well, it's either a dream or no. One more shot? 
TALIESIN: If we're going to do it-- 
LAURA: Let's do it. 
TALIESIN: -- dream seems to be the thing to do. 
SAM: Sorry, Ashton. You're going to be exhausted tomorrow. 
TALIESIN: I know. Just remember, and I feel like this should be in a couple people's heads, if I've learned anything in my adult life, is that an estranged parent is just a stranger who can make you believe any bullshit. Just be careful. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Let's sleep. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: I try to reach out. 
MATT: You all gather up tightly within this alcove and try and prep, as comfortable as can be, a way that Imogen can slip into unconsciousness amongst the anxiety and concern. It takes some time, but through some concentration and the support of your friends and FCG's comforting presence-- 
TRAVIS: Secret stash of melatonin. 
MATT: Yeah, got a few gummies, just in case. 
TALIESIN: Melatonin farts coming out the back. 
MATT: You slowly begin to slip. And it's here in this space, familiar, warm, red, nothing surrounds you. There's no dust, there's no storm. It's just warmth and color. You cast your spell? 
SAM: I do, but because I'm casting it at such an insanely high level, technically, I could bring us all. 
LAURA: That's kind of cool. 
SAM: Unless you just want it to be you, which is also totally valid. 
LAURA: In the past, y'all have never been able to affect anything. 
MARISHA: It could just compromise us. 
LAURA: Then don't do it. 
SAM: Okay. I think I have to go. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Do you want anybody else with you? 
MARISHA: FCG's going. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: As the gentle, spiritual spark of your friend, Fresh Cut Grass, remains tethered to you here in this expanse, you take in the space, and it simultaneously feels like an endless void, but also the proximity of warm water hugging you. It's an odd mixture of sensation and pressure. What would you like to do? 
LAURA: I'm going to search for my mom, try to find her mind. 
MATT: The minute you imagine her in your mind's eye, you see a light appear. 100 feet, 10 miles, it's hard to tell any distance here. 
LAURA: I go towards it. I try to pull it towards me. 
MATT: Like a rack focus, within but a split second, the light approaches, and there you see, balled up knees to chest and arms around, the sight of your mother, her hair floating, her eyes closed. "Imogen." We're going to go to break. (shouting) 
MARISHA: Are you serious? Are you serious? 
TRAVIS: Yeah! I'm here for it! Okay. 
MATT: We'll come back to that-- 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MATT: -- in just a moment! 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MATT: Yeah, hang tight, we'll be back here in a little bit. We'll see you soon.

LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Roll an investigation if you want, it's basically perfect. Ooo so moody. Ooo so comfy cozy. You need this? You probably need this. Look at this. Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here. Ooo look at this, look at the details, ooo! I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
TALIESIN: Catastrophe lies at the edge of the Vastchasm for any circle daring enough to tempt fate, though when stakes are high, great risk is a calculation worth taking. A long lost and dangerous relic has surfaced from the depths of time. The assignment we've handed to our investigators is simple: Parley with the dealer, recover the artifact, and return to the Pharos. But a circle is at its most vulnerable when a threat is underestimated. And for those lucky enough to return home, Serenity awaits. The Circle of the Crimson Mirror: Assignment #4149, Seeking Serenity.
NARRATOR 1: Jonas Spahr is getting ready for work. NARRATOR 2: Brushing his hair, trimming his beard, adjusting his uniform. He's very critical of his reflection. Everything must be perfect. NARRATOR 3: Or at least look perfect, today. NARRATOR 1: It's kind of hard to concentrate on looking perfect. He keeps getting jostled. NARRATOR 2: Movers are packing up his possessions and moving him out of the consector's mansion NARRATOR 3: Everything's going in boxes. Movers are bumping around, picking things up. NARRATOR 2: And more movers are jostling around those movers. It's very chaotic. NARRATOR 1: Today Spahr is being moved out of his house, and someone else is being moved in. This isn't his house anymore. Tomorrow he will be getting ready for work somewhere else. NARRATOR 2: Normally, his company entourage would be briefing him on the day's events, current affairs, his schedule, et cetera. He doesn't have an entourage anymore though, so he's catching up on the latest the way any other regular trustee would, by listening to the news on the teletheric.

SAM: When the forces of evil threaten Exandria, these heroes are there to answer the call. 
TALIESIN: I'm Super Scanlan! With my Critical Role Twitch subscription, I can watch all my favorite CR shows before they come out on YouTube! Take that, evil doers! 
ASHLEY: Here comes Jester with her Twitch subscription to Critical Role! She can access gnarly emotes and post links in the chat, too. 
TALIESIN: Radical! 
ASHLEY: Boosh! Oh no! Here comes some trolls to jam up our live chat. 
TALIESIN: Don't worry, Laudna will stop them with the help of Critical Role's professional moderators! 
ASHLEY: She's spooky, but I like her. Here comes Laudna's friend, Chetney! He has an Amazon Prime membership, which gives him one free Twitch subscription of his choice. Of course, he subscribes to Critical Role. It's the power of teamwork. Die, die, die!

ASHLEY: I cast Guiding Bolt! 
TALIESIN: ♪ Scanlan's Hand! ♪ 
ASHLEY: Stab 'em, Chetney! And look! There's Caleb with the power of introspection and existential dread! [music stops] (cows mooing) 
TALIESIN: Now that we've defeated all the bad guys, let's gift subscriptions to other users! You can do that by name or randomly. [record scratch] 
MATT: Taliesin! Ashley! Please, I've told you so many times just don't play with those, okay? They're super fragile, custom made, custom painted. You know what? We have to film in about 30 minutes, so why don't you two just come with me. (snaps) Come on. (clicks tongue) [footsteps receding] 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's Major Buzzkill here to take away all our fun. 
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Ah! 
ASHLEY: Is it Thursday yet, bitch? 
TALIESIN: You can certainly die! 
ASHLEY: Oh! Good one!

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. (laughter) 
LAURA: Nope. (laughs) Okay. 
LIAM: Buckle up. 
ASHLEY: I just got so nervous. 
MATT: Here in the dream-- 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: -- your mother unfurls slightly from her somewhat balled up physicality, the bright light of her spirit in this space thrumming with a twinned energy to yours. As she looks up to you, her eyes open. "Imogen. (sighs gently)" 
LAURA: I'm here. 
MATT: "You're as stubborn as your mother, you know that?" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "It seems the harder I try and push you away, the faster you run towards me. Maybe that's my fault." 
LAURA: You make me want to help. I know you don't want to be here. 
MATT: "It's almost over. It's almost over, and you won't have to worry about any of this." 
LAURA: Nobody will. I don't want to lose you. 
MATT: "You don't have to lose me. I'm not going anywhere. I just, I didn't want this to be a burden thrust upon you. But I guess it found you anyway. Maybe that's my naiveté. I'm sorry." 
LAURA: You said before you were trying to make a difference from the inside. 
MATT: "And I am." 
LAURA: In what way? 
MATT: "He listens to me." 
LAURA: You said yourself, he's cunning. 
MATT: "He is." 
LAURA: How do you think-- How do you know he's actually listening to you? 
MATT: "Because I've seen his behavior change. I've pulled him from the edge a few times, and he's done some good after. I'm not saying he's good, but I'm worried what would happen if I wasn't here. If that makes any sense." 
LAURA: But Mama, what if you were fighting him? What if you could stop him, for real? Do you even want to? 
MATT: "I don't know. This is all so much bigger than either of us, but here we are." 
LAURA: Can I reach out? Can I touch you? 
MATT: You see her expression shift, almost like a pained yearning, and there's a hesitation and a worry before she reaches out. As her hand touches yours, they pass through each other, but there's a warmth, there's a connection, there's a nostalgia. 
LAURA: Are you doing this all for Ludinus or do you feel that pull from The Sleeping One? 
MATT: "I'm not doing any of this for Ludinus. I'm doing this because I didn't have a choice." 
LAURA: But you do. 
MATT: "Neither of us do. We're here. I tried to keep this from pulling you here, but you came anyway, and now we're both here in the center of it all and it's going to happen. But I want you to be free of it. Once this is over, all of us will be, all of us who were not given a choice but be born into this red light and changed. You know how much I miss just taking care of those horses?" 
LAURA: (sighs) 
MATT: "You know how much I dream of just walking the fields and making breakfast at sunrise? All that was taken from me. All I could think about was making sure I didn't take it from you. And I failed at that too, it seems." 
LAURA: Mama, I want you to leave him. There's a fight coming. I don't want to fight you. 
MATT: "Imogen, there are children here--" 
LAURA: I know. 
MATT: – "like you, that rely on me." 
LAURA: Can't we just make sure he never wakes up? Put him to sleep. Get rid of Ludinus and keep him asleep. 
MATT: "I don't know if that would just be delaying the inevitable. Being so close to this, I feel like I can guide this the best way it can be. I'm surrounded by some very dangerous people, but they need me, I can feel it, and they listen to me. I'm scared of what would happen if I wasn't here. What would happen to these children? These people?" 
LAURA: Think of the children that will die if you let him free. 
MATT: "I don't know why you think people will die for this. Predathos doesn't want to destroy the world." 
LAURA: Just the gods. Who do you think those gods protect? 
MATT: "That's a good question, isn't it?" 
LAURA: Tell me what you know. I'm here to convince you the other way, but if you have something that could bring me to your side, I need to know it. 
MATT: "What is a god but a tyrant that's always been? They protect those who give themselves to them, like any other king. I know change is hard, and I know that-- (sighs) I don't know why this is all so-- (sighs) Part of me just wants to run away from it all, but I know I can't. It's too late and I--" 
LAURA: It's not too late. It's not too late. 
MATT: "Sweet Imogen. You know I love you, right? I love you and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I wasn't there. Maybe one day when you have a child of your own, you'll understand, or not." 
LAURA: Are you prepared to take my life, keep that child from being born? 
MATT: "Don't say that, Imogen." 
LAURA: It could happen. We're on opposing sides here, Mama. 
MATT: "You just need to run away." 
LAURA: I'm not running anymore. I love you. Daddy still loves you. 
MATT: "If I do this right, maybe we can all go home." 
LAURA: No, Mama. You're lying to yourself. They're lying to you. Ludinus is an evil, evil man, and he's gotten into your head. 
MATT: "History is filled with evil men. But few have the courage to stand up and try and stop them. Where I'm standing, I don't think we're on the opposing sides like you think we are. We just have a different myth, that's all. That's all. Please see it in yourself to understand why I've done and given up all of this." 
LAURA: Maybe it's your turn to run. And I wake up. 
MATT: (long exhale) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: She wakes up, I'm still in there. I'm like: Where'd she go? (laughter) 
SAM: Oh god! 
MARISHA: I forgot you were in there, too. 
TRAVIS: It's nice to meet you. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Hi. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Can I touch you? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: I forgot my-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
TALIESIN: You're locked overnight in a fake-- 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
TALIESIN: Well. 
TRAVIS: That was fucking-- 
TALIESIN: Damn. 
TRAVIS: That was fire. 
MARISHA: She's de-lu-lu. 
LAURA: Yeah. She's in it. 
SAM: Delilah? 
LAURA: Mm. I don't think we're going to convince her otherwise. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
LAURA: She sees the good in it, and she is saving people. I mean, there's children here. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: A lot of children have already died. 
LAURA: And more will. 
LIAM: Is this the middle of the night, the morning? Where are we? 
LAURA: We're still-- 
SAM: Well, she went to sleep. 
MATT: The middle of the night. 
LIAM: She went to sleep. Middle of the night? 
MATT: This is maybe a few hours into your rest. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
LIAM: Did you wake us all up? 
MARISHA: Are we all asleep? Did we stay awake? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, did we stay awake, or--? 
MATT: You tell me. 
LAURA: Yeah, I guess it's up to you guys. 
TALIESIN: I'll wake up for a minute. It's fine. 
TRAVIS: I'll stay asleep. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I don't want to die. 
MARISHA: I have the Treshi scry ball in front on the table. I've been watching it the whole time. 
MATT: It's moved to the surface. 
LIAM: How many hours has it been? 
MATT: It's been a couple hours into the long rest. 
LIAM: A couple? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay, I was thinking of risking an exhaustion point. I'm going to say that Orym's awake and has been sitting with a sword in his lap. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: In case. 
MARISHA: I imagine we can take-- It's probably smart to take watches. 
LAURA: Yeah, take watches, right? 
MARISHA: We should take watches. We're not safe here. 
TALIESIN: I'll take the next watch. I'm fine. 
MARISHA: Do you want to talk about it now? 
ASHLEY: Are you okay? 
MARISHA: Or do you want to talk about it in the morning? 
LAURA: I don't think I should go there. 
MARISHA: To your mother? 
LAURA: I think she's too far gone. 
SAM: I mean, that's fine. Do you have any opinion about whether others of us should go, just to see? 
LAURA: I don't think I could forgive you if you had a hand in it. 
SAM: Well, what if we had a hand in stopping it? Could you forgive us then? 
MARISHA: I have a very strong feeling this assassination is not going to be successful. 
LAURA: I think you're right. 
TALIESIN: I agree. 
MARISHA: It might be best to steer clear of it altogether. I don't know. 
LAURA: I think we should let them know that they're in for more than they can handle. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's wise. 
SAM: All right, and then we'll do a different one tomorrow or a couple. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay, why don't we sleep on that? 
SAM: Sure. 
LIAM: Figure. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Imogen? 
LAURA: Hm? 
LIAM: We're all real sorry. 
LAURA: Thank you. I knew it, you know? This was just a confirmation. She's not bad. It's all gray. 
SAM: It is. Even the gods are gray. I mean, love them or hate them, they bring a lot of order to the world and a lot of joy. But also, you know, there's bad ones, too. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
SAM: Everything's gray. 
LAURA: She called them tyrants. 
MARISHA: The gods? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: But she wasn't talking about mine, right, specifically? 
LAURA: I mean, she said they protect those who serve them. 
MARISHA: It's pretty ironic coming from someone who's dedicated their life serving Ludinus. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Well, he is up for the job, I suppose. 
TRAVIS: What do you think she knows? 
LAURA: She said he was going to do some really bad things. She pulled him back from the brink. I mean, she's one of his generals. She's probably got some-- 
TRAVIS: I mean, what do you think she knows about the gods? 
LAURA: Oh. Whatever Ludinus has told her. You know, she doesn't have any more communication with them than we do. 
TRAVIS: I mean, the people of this moon are incentivized to not let out this thing because it seems pretty clear from the previous crushes and the earthquakes that everything goes down if it does, but what's the knowledge driving all this? What's the perspective? Just unseat the gods because they're tyrants? It's got to come from somewhere, but what? I feel like we haven't-- I feel like we're missing pages out of a book. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: We can't find them here, though, because we're blocked. But maybe when we, if we get back. 
MARISHA: It's also hard when it seems like the only perspective we do have is Ludinus' and-- 
LAURA: He's a crazy fuck. 
MARISHA: -- and he's a crazy fuck. 
LAURA: He just wants power. 
MARISHA: At that point, it's not perspective, it's propaganda. 
LIAM: This whole time, Orym has just been replaying Keyleth getting stabbed by Otohan at the Malleus Key and everything that happened on that day in Zephrah, and listening to his friends try to figure it out. 
TALIESIN: We have our perspective. The perspective from the bottom is one of the better perspectives. I can see the tyrant in the gods. 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: But I can also see the tyrant in the man. 
LIAM: We're not that different from each other, are we? Gods and mortals. 
TRAVIS: I want to know who these five minds are. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
TRAVIS: Are they trying to control it, support it, wake it up? Or are they trying to keep it asleep? 
MARISHA: Also, according to Rashinna, it sounds like the Vanguard and Ludinus is making pretty big promises to the people here, that he's going to give them salvation, bring them to the promised land. 
TRAVIS: Relocation. 
MARISHA: Relocation. So I'm assuming they have no idea to a certain extent what kind of destruction he's planning on bringing. 
LAURA: I mean, who knows? Predathos might just be an energy entity. It might not be anything that would destroy Ruidus, you know? 
SAM: Isn't he called the god eater? 
LAURA: Well, sure, but-- 
TALIESIN: Not a moon eater. 
LAURA: What if waking him up means that he fills, I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Maybe they have been told they're going to get off the moon before it happens. 
MARISHA: I think that's exactly it. 
SAM: The whole thing just doesn't... I think you're right. We are missing something. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, something's missing. 
SAM: They're being told they can go down to Exandria and live the life that they literally can only dream of, but that life won't exist if the gods are gone. 
TALIESIN: Well, it was a version of that before them. 
SAM: I don't think so. 
TRAVIS: It was real messy, though. 
TALIESIN: There really was-- 
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- a version of this before them. 
MARISHA: It was chaos. 
TALIESIN: It was nature. Just nature. 
SAM: I feel like the gods have made Exandria a livable place. If you take them away-- 
TALIESIN: What makes you say that? 
SAM: Because-- 
LAURA: We saw for ourselves that garrison. Without the gods protecting that border, all of the demons coming in from the Nine Hells were set free to just destroy everyone around them. 
SAM: Yeah, they maintain-- 
LAURA: The gods stop that. 
SAM: They maintain nature and laws and hope and redemption. 
TALIESIN: I think there were nature, laws, hope and redemption beforehand. I'm not arguing one way or another, I'm just trying to make sure that we're not... We need to be clear. 
MARISHA: Nature is chaos. 
TALIESIN: Yes and there is a goddess of nature. Is she chaos? Is she violence? Because nature is violence. 
SAM: Your Titan's showing. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, older than the gods. 
TRAVIS: What's Ashton's arm doing? (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm just putting it, it's easy to think that life would be unlivable without a tyrant, that's what they do. 
LIAM: It's a super big coin flip, though, to think maybe it'll be okay if this thing is released. Are you sure? 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: What happens if you're wrong? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Exactly. 
MARISHA: Also, let's just remember what we learned from the texts that came from Vasselheim. A chunk of Exandria was scooped up to create Ruidus to encompass, surround whatever Predathos is. So it doesn't seem like it's just pure energy. They imprisoned something. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Something. Also-- 
TALIESIN: Something. 
TRAVIS: Texts coming from Vasselheim are already written by one side of history, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: My brain just-- 
TALIESIN: That's very true. 
LIAM: -- went to T-E-X-T-S. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I did too. 
LAURA: Like oh, like what? 
LIAM: I just sent a text. 
LAURA: Did you get something from Vasselheim? 
TALIESIN: We all got one. 
TRAVIS: The other part is the latticework, right? The gate around the moon is also the Divine Gate. 
MARISHA: Right. 
TRAVIS: The Divine Gate was made because the Prime Deities promised not to meddle with Exandria. 
LIAM: Right, so whatever that fence work is keeps the Deities off of Exandria and also keeps-- 
LAURA: Predathos off of them. 
LIAM: -- Predathos off of them. 
TRAVIS: If you're all-powerful, shouldn't your word that you won't meddle in common affairs be enough? Why do you need the fence unless you're worried about something coming from the other side? 
LAURA: Well, it keeps the good gods out and also the ones that are not trustworthy, right? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
LAURA: Your Strife Emperor. 
TRAVIS: I don't know if the Strife Emperor is beyond the Divine Gate, I don't know that. 
TALIESIN: They're all, well, how common is that knowledge? 
MARISHA: Well, the gods know, yeah, do we know where the Betrayer Gods went? 
MATT: Colloquially, people know loosely of the history of the Calamity and in the Calamity, all of the gods it's said were sealed into their respective realms and the Divine Gate was placed to keep divinity separate from Exandria. That's what it's said in a casual conversation. 
TRAVIS: Elevator pitch. 
MATT: Yeah. There's details throughout there, but yeah. 
LIAM: The gods coming to Exandria and barring the Titans away off to their other planes of existence and bringing order to the world, that's just, we above table, we know that that's the lore, but that's myth, right? There's no-- 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: -- footage. 
MATT: All myth and history that exists in Exandria and the published books are all based on the perspective of the society that's endured-- 
TRAVIS: The winner. 
MATT: -- past those times. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: The winner. 
MATT: Which is-- 
TRAVIS: (grunt) 
TALIESIN: The winner. 
MATT: Vasselheim, the Dawn Cradle. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: And others beyond that. So like all history, there is truth and there's interpretation. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
LIAM: But what's the answer, Matthew? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I don't think we should set Predathos free. I don't think we should let him eat all the gods. 
SAM: You're anti-Predathos now? 
LAURA: Well. 
SAM: Of course. 
TRAVIS: Just putting it out there, not that you should do this, this is a terrible idea. Don't listen to this for one second. If you can reach out and talk to your mom, can you reach out and talk to Ludinus in your sleep, too? 
LAURA: Talk to Ludinus? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: A terrible idea. 
MARISHA: He's not Ruidusborn. 
TRAVIS: I said it was a terrible idea. 
TALIESIN: That was an absolutely terrible idea. 
MARISHA: He's not Ruidusborn. He covets them. I'm not saying it's not possible, but-- 
LAURA: I'm sure. 
MARISHA: There's a reason why he hasn't shown up in your dreams yet. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's true. He doesn't blink like the rest of them do. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. 
TALIESIN: Also, I cannot believe that I'm actually going to say this, but I've never had this thought before. We have established or at least I feel like through experience, we have established that the gods, they are a bit like us. They're not good, they're just flawed. So maybe the Betrayer Gods are just shits. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Who can occasionally be right about some fucking shit. 
LIAM: I have another big universe question. 
MATT: Sure. 
LIAM: Above the table. 
TRAVIS: Let's do it. 
LIAM: It wasn't that long ago that a fucking mortal man popped out of a shitty dimension and said "Ah" and turned himself into a proto-god and stomped all over everything and that was a mortal. It wasn't a god, that was an uppity-- 
LAURA: Are you talking about the Traveler? 
LIAM: Yes. (laughs) 
LAURA: Well, yeah. 
MATT: Sub-tier. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I'm talking about the a-hole that Vox Machina destroyed. So after the fact, colloquially-- 
LAURA: Whose quest was that? 
LIAM: Across the world, everyone knows that happened, but do people of the world know that that was a dude from ancient history who juiced himself up into being a god? 
MATT: In some circles, yes. 
LIAM: Not this circle? 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: You might know. 
TRAVIS: Also what does colloquially mean? 
MATT: You would know. On a public level, people were aware that there was an imminent threat of some terrifying wizard who attacked Vasselheim and was defeated and had the intent of becoming a god. However, I would say that in some places in the world, the truth of that is obfuscated to ensure that the public doesn't panic at the idea of another human being ascending into divinity. 
TRAVIS: Getting so close. Ooh. 
LIAM: But does the world know a giant stone kaiju-- 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: With a tower on its head? 
MATT: People know of the event. 
TRAVIS: "Wizard." 
MATT: Yeah, but-- 
LIAM: Wizard. 
TRAVIS: A wizard. 
MATT: The Whispered One even then was practically struck from history and since then, it has become a myth in its own right as part of the story of Vox Machina and the assault on Vasselheim. But those who were present and those who are learned and those that are part of these debates-- 
LIAM: Oh no. 
MATT: Oh my god. (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: I take back 80% of what I've ever said to you. You're magical. 
LAURA: Is it really? 
SAM: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LIAM: Don't reach in there, Laura. 
TALIESIN: Don't. 
TRAVIS: It so good. It's so good, you guys. 
LIAM: You just played yourself. 
LAURA: Oh! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Hot boi ♪ 
LAURA: Born of the dunamussy. 
ASHLEY: Dunamussy! 
MATT: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Man, he told that joke with his whole dunamussy. (laughter) 
MATT: (sighs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Okay, this has been a good long rest. 
LAURA: Okay, yeah. 
SAM: My dunamussy fell off. (laughter) 
MATT: You should get that checked out. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Look at all those teeth. 
TALIESIN: No, if you're going to that, do it without rhythm. 
LAURA: Stop it. 
TALIESIN: You got to do it without rhythm, oh god. 
MARISHA: You got to do it without rhythm. 
TRAVIS: Your sand-walking is terrible. Sand dancing? 
TALIESIN: I don't think it landed on sand. All right. 
SAM: Long rest! 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: We act! 
MARISHA: We should take shifts. 
MARISHA: She kind of shook us up. 
SAM: Sure, sure, sure. 
TRAVIS: She kind of told us off. 
TALIESIN: I'll take the next one. 
LIAM: I took first, so I'm going to sleep. 
TALIESIN: I'll take two. 
TRAVIS: She kind of sold me. 
LAURA: (sigh) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Is he being serious? I can't tell. 
LAURA: I think he's serious. But you weren't there. 
TRAVIS: She had so much love for you. I was not there at all, I'm just saying this above table. 
MARISHA: Did she? 
LAURA: She did, she did, she did. 
TRAVIS: She did. 
LAURA: She did. 
MARISHA: She said four times. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You can have love and be delusional. I'm not saying that's not the case. 
LAURA: She had love. 
ASHLEY: She does. 
LAURA: I believe that. 
TRAVIS: To call them tyrants and shit, I want to know why. 
LAURA: Fully. I just think she loves Ludinus more. 
TRAVIS: What does she know? 
MATT: That's fair. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Long rest. 
ASHLEY: The cause? 
LAURA: Sure, long rest. 
TALIESIN: Cult. 
SAM: Long rest. 
MARISHA: Long rest. 
ASHLEY: Long rest. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: We've cycled. 
LIAM: Maybe she thinks she can make it happen safely. She thinks she can take the Ludinus out of it. 
LAURA: Yeah, no, I think-- 
ASHLEY: She's hoping for the best. 
TRAVIS: I'm pushing the button, long rest. 
SAM: I'm doing it too. 
LIAM: Because she said-- 
TALIESIN: You weren't there. 
LIAM: Never mind. 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
LIAM: Never mind. 
LAURA: No, yeah, I think you're right. I think she thinks she can do it safely. It's not going to destroy us. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's so good. 
MARISHA: She also clearly doesn't have the full picture, right? 
TRAVIS: Why can't I just have? 
LAURA: Sure, but neither do we. 
TRAVIS: Can I be Ruidusborn? 
MARISHA: No. I know, but it's clear she's being painted-- 
TRAVIS: Matt, can I be Ruidusborn? 
ASHLEY: Everybody thinks they're right. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: But we don't know. 
MATT: When Chetney dies-- 
TRAVIS: If I lower one of my stats? 
MATT: -- your next character can be Ruidusborn. 
TRAVIS: Minus two, can I be a Ruidusborn? 
TALIESIN: I get to be a dunamancer. 
LAURA: You're just ready for it? 
TRAVIS: So I can go to sleep and be like (swoosh). 
LAURA: "La, la, la, la, I want to talk to her." 
TRAVIS: Tell me! (laughter) 
LAURA: You would dream every night. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: I'd be more annoying than Jester. 
LAURA: They'd be like, "Get out, get out. Go away, you're no longer Ruidusborn." 
TRAVIS: (like Jester) Hi, it's me, Chetney. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Any conversations during-- 
SAM: No! 
MATT: -- the evening's rest or we jump to the morning? 
MARISHA: We'll jump to the morning. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I know. 
LIAM: Some of that was in character, some of it. 
TALIESIN: We'll do it later today. 
ASHLEY: In time. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: How far away are Fearne and Ashton from each other in this room? 
MATT: The room's pretty small. 
LAURA: Are you snuggling? 
MATT: 10 feet. 
LAURA: Are you snuggling? 
TRAVIS: I'm just curious. 
ASHLEY: Little ox tail. (laughs) (chittering) 
TALIESIN: I'm sleeping in the corner of the ceiling. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh, just like Laudna. 
TALIESIN: Staring at you. 
TRAVIS: They are like gargoyles in the room. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: (growls) 
TRAVIS: What the fuck? 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: So wait, we don't clear your exhaustion? Just one point of exhaustion? 
TALIESIN: I get one point of exhaustion off. 
ASHLEY: That sucks. 
TALIESIN: I can now move at a reasonable pace, but I still have disadvantage on my-- 
LIAM: Ability checks. 
MATT and TALIESIN: Ability checks. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Thankfully not saves. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So I'm just shit at things because I have a migraine. 
MATT: After a full night's rest, you all one-by-one begin to wake up. Though it's always odd to wake up in this space where there's no sky. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Or sunlight. You just have to assume it's been enough of a rest. Let the body's circadian rhythm carry you through. 
TALIESIN: This isn't my jam. 
MATT: As you all begin to wake up, you can also hear the energy already echoing through the distant halls as figures are gathering equipment, people are conversing and moving around. It looks like today is definitely a day of action and people are starting to prepare themselves for whatever is ahead of them. What would you like to do? 
TALIESIN: I want breakfast. 
MARISHA: "I want breakfast." 
LIAM: We got to figure out which task we think is the most important. 
SAM: Yeah, should we just-- 
LIAM: We're going to help them. 
LAURA: We should just choose. 
SAM: -- democracy it? 
LIAM: What benefits? 
LAURA: Are we breaking up or are we doing-- 
TRAVIS: I guess I did not cast-- 
LAURA: -- just one? 
TRAVIS: -- Arcane Eye back there. 
MATT: Oh right, we didn't even pursue that. We can go back on that, dude. 
TRAVIS: It's okay, I'll save it. 
MATT: I can go for it. 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
LIAM: Get it. 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
SAM: What did you see? 
TRAVIS: No, it's okay. 
SAM: He's got juice. 
TRAVIS: I'll explore these halls-- 
SAM: He's got juice. 
TRAVIS: -- some other time. 
MATT: That's on me. 
TRAVIS: I wonder if I follow somebody better than Gaz Tomo? 
TALIESIN: There's no one better. 
MATT: He was largely just having a few conversations. 
TRAVIS: And found the ping pong table, he's fine. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: He's playing foosball with the little myceits. 
TALIESIN: I want to see what d20 foosball is like. 
TRAVIS: Mýceits? Meceits? Myceits? 
LAURA: Myce-et? 
MATT: Myceits, yeah. 
TRAVIS: I just wrote "my seats." 
MATT: That's how it's pronounced. 
TALIESIN: Three of them plus him. That is actually a decent foosball game right there. Anyway, sorry. 
MARISHA: Well? 
LIAM: Yeah, what are we landing on here? 
MARISHA: You said you're not feeling going after your mother? 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: So Strife Emperor it is. 
MARISHA: Do we want to-- 
TRAVIS: No, from those reactions. Okay. 
MARISHA: To try and do two of these and split the party? 
SAM: Sorrowlord Zathuda is the detonation one. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Sabotage. 
MARISHA: Sabotage. 
SAM: Then there's infiltration, find Ebor-rar-rar. 
TRAVIS and MATT: Evoroa. 
LAURA: So we can find out what Ludinus is building. 
SAM: Huh? 
LAURA: That's how we find out what Ludinus is building. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: That's the detonation one, you mean? 
LAURA: No, no, no. Infiltration is how we would find out-- 
LIAM: The spy. Evoroa the spy. 
TRAVIS: She was a Bormodo. 
SAM: Rescue, Chetney gets to hang out with a psycho. 
TRAVIS: (sigh) My life calling. 
LAURA: Maybe we could find some allies that have been held in the garrison as well. 
TALIESIN and LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: It's got to be between B and C for me if we're not going after your mom. 
LAURA: But her dad. 
SAM: But her dad. And Ira. Aren't you dating Ira or something? 
MARISHA: No! 
LAURA: She's dating me. 
SAM: I know, but doesn't he have the hots for you? 
MARISHA: No. 
TRAVIS: It's the other way around. 
MARISHA: I think he wants nothing to do with me. I think he probably finds me annoying. 
LIAM: You just have a talent crush on Ira, right? 
MARISHA: I think he's spooky. 
ASHLEY: Is Ira around? 
MARISHA: That's all. 
ASHLEY: Anywhere? 
MATT: Do you want to look for Ira? 
MARISHA: It's fine. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Fearne exits the chamber and you begin wandering through the halls. You get odd looks from folks that are still uncertain. 
LAURA: I think she's going to go flirt with your boyfriend. 
MARISHA: (forcefully) It's fine. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Is it? 
MARISHA: (forcefully) Yes. 
TRAVIS: Says your girlfriend. (laughter) 
MATT: Eventually, you come back to that initial chamber with the large stone table and you can see that people are setting supplies to the side. There are some conversations happening. Rashinna is in the process of having a whispered conversation in the far corner and just beyond that chamber near where you first entered, you can see the shadow of a spider-like figure that is fiddling over a table with a bunch of materials. 
TRAVIS: Jeez. 
ASHLEY: (knocks) Hi. 
MATT: You approach, and you can see Ira with a heavy set of multi-lens goggles that you saw previously many months ago with your folks. They're set, and there are a number of small devices. There are a couple of these odd-- [liquid pouring] 
MATT: -- leaf-like stones that are set up on the side. 
LIAM: That's a lot of gin. 
MATT: He's finished setting up over there. There are two duffel bag-looking bags that are currently closed, and he is in the process of assembling a massive iron cylinder that has strange runes that he's in the process of carving into it. He turns to you as you knock and goes, "Good morning, Calloway." 
ASHLEY: Good morning. I forgot your last name. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wendagoth. 
MATT: "That's fine." 
ASHLEY: So-- So-- 
MATT: (ping) "Yes?" 
ASHLEY: I just wanted to know, what's your plan here? You're just going to go in there and you're just going to blow some shit up? 
MATT: "Well, not as simple as that, per se. I'm going to take a team. I'm going to cloak us in illusion. We're going to find out where the nearest tunnel has been constructed since the last session. We're going to sneak in past the troops and take out the ones that are problematic, get to their drilling device, set up these explosives, exit, and boom! (laughs mischievously)" 
ASHLEY: Wow. So, what's your beef with Zathuda? What's that about? I found out some things. I understand that he's my dad. 
MATT: "Mm." 
ASHLEY: Yeah, some conversations have been had. Still have a lot to figure out there. But, yeah. What's the deal? What's the deal with him? You don't like him? He's not a good guy? 
MATT: "He's a prick." 
ASHLEY: Oh, he's a prick? That's even worse. 
MATT: "I've had dealing with his ilk for many years off and on, and they're just oh so pompous, so self-absorbed and so wishy-washy. I hate it. I hate them. Beyond that, not much else. You know, he just sort of reneged on a deal, and him and Ludinus left me in the lurch, stole my designs, technology, claimed it as their own, and are now here trying to change the course of history and not give me any credit." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: "Also, it's fun and interesting up here. Look at these people. I like it. They're weird." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it is kind of fun up here, huh? 
MATT: "Yes." 
ASHLEY: I like a lot of what I see. Do you have any clue as to why Zathuda was trying to, basically, had me at a certain time. Just wanted to know if you have any ideas as to why that might have been. 
MATT: "I couldn't tell you specifically," as he's tooling on his device over there as he's talking to you, concentrating on his work. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
LIAM: He's got a Wacom. 
LAURA: What is it? What is he making? 
ASHLEY: What are you doing? 
TRAVIS: A tablet. 
MATT: "I'm preparing for the mission, finishing up my inscriptions. In my mind, it seems that Ludinus and the Vanguard's interest involved creating as many Ruidusborn as possible in the hopes that the few odd children might be born special. You were halfway there." 
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, just because I was Ruidus doesn't mean I'm-- That isn't fully what makes me special. 
MATT: "No. Your friend, now she's a special one. That's rare, and that's what they wanted." 
ASHLEY: What do they want? What are they going to do to her? 
MATT: "I don't know. All I know is, and I say this with absolute love and understanding of a disappointing father, as Zathuda might be, he himself might be a little disappointed." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Well-- For him to be disappointed, he would have to be present, so I just don't know him at all. 
MATT: "True." 
MARISHA: Jeez louise. 
MATT: "I know he invested a lot in you. Maybe he just didn't find the potential he was hoping." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Goddamn. 
LAURA: What a dick! 
MARISHA: Christ! 
ASHLEY: Look at you, being a little bit of a dick. 
MATT: "I'm just answering your question." 
TRAVIS: I love how all three ladies-- 
ASHLEY: I know! 
TRAVIS: -- verbally responded. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Activated! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I take no personal umbrage with you, my dear. I find you fascinating. I'm just saying, your father--" 
LIAM: Can't tell a woman her father doesn't love her. 
MATT: "-- might be--" 
TRAVIS: The guys are like-- 
MATT: "-- shitty." 
ASHLEY: All right, well, okay. Last thing. 
LAURA: He's negging you! 
ASHLEY: He is. It's fine. It's fine, I understand. I understand. So here's the thing. 
MATT: "Yes." 
ASHLEY: Is there anything about-- 
TRAVIS: Enchanted? 
ASHLEY: Is there anything I should know about him? A way in? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Fucking amazing. Fucking amazing. The shadow soul of Matt Mercer. 
ASHLEY: Here's the thing. I have no attachment to him whatsoever. 
MATT: "Mm-hmm." 
ASHLEY: So-- 
TRAVIS: Except that he's your dad. 
ASHLEY: That's neither here nor there. So maybe, if you want to give me any advice, maybe I can just wiggle in there and help you, because-- 
MATT: "Ooh." 
ASHLEY: I'm just putting it out there on the table. 
MATT: "You want to turn this into a bit of familial reunion?" 
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, I think that's probably going to happen anyway, so if there's a way that I can help turn the tables. Plus, I really want his mount, the little animal. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: To fly around. That's it, that's all I ask of my dad. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Okay? Just one thing in my life. 
LAURA: (laughs) I want a car, Daddy! 
ASHLEY: I want a pony! 
LIAM: I want a fey dragon, Daddy. 
TRAVIS: I want to fly the dragon! 
MATT: "I'm not against this plan at all, my dear. After all, I would love to see the look on his face when he's taken down a peg or seven. I think that can be arranged." 
ASHLEY: All right. Well, I'm going to go back to everybody, and hope you have a great time. I don't know if we're going with you. I don't know what we're doing yet, but just-- 
MATT: "Up to you. There'd be no better time." 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Just try to be honest with me about stuff, okay? Don't be all fey with me, and I won't be all fey with you. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'll shoot straight. 
MATT: "Girl." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "We both know who we are. And we can't help but being ourselves." 
ASHLEY: Touché. 
MATT: "Let me know who's coming with. We leave soon. (laughs mischievously)" 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
MATT: He grabs the satchels quickly and scurries off into the shadow, leaving a trail of little bits of leftover materials. 
ASHLEY: He is so weird. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to head back to the group. 
SAM: As you return, I'm just finishing the last little bits of my ritual casting of Telepathic Bond. 
MATT: Ah, yes. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
SAM: The Changebringer shall bring us the gift of communication. Ah, done. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: We've lost that scroll again, though. So it's possible. 
MARISHA: We're freeballing it. 
TRAVIS: ♪ And I'm free ♪ 
TALIESIN: It's not worth pushing through a spell to clear me up, or no? 
SAM: I don't know, what are we doing? Let's decide that first. 
LAURA: Are we splitting up or are we going together? 
ASHLEY: I had a little convo with Ira. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes, what'd he say? 
ASHLEY: He wants to do a situation where everybody's cloaked, they go in, they blow it up. You know, if that's something. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: So that's an option. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: You know. I think there's some other things that we could-- I don't know, up to you guys. 
LIAM: You got any stake in that? 
SAM: Do you want to go? 
ASHLEY: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, that's just a blowup situation. 
LIAM: Insight check! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I don't know! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You don't even have to tell me the number. I don't know. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I don't know what the right thing is to do here, guys. 
LIAM: I believe her. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Why don't you know? 
SAM: It sounds fun. 
LAURA: Blowing shit up is always fun. 
ASHLEY: Well, of course, but what's the most important thing that we need here? 
MARISHA: Information. 
ASHLEY: You know what I mean? It's information. 
SAM: We can get information from-- 
ASHLEY: Blowing up shit is fun, but-- 
SAM: I'm sure we can get information from any of these missions. 
MARISHA: Sure, but I think Fearne has a point. I'm not trying to be a dissenter here, but it feels like the Arx Creonum and some of these other things, whatever Ludinus is working on with the scientists or stuff with the Glasshold Garrison, all things, we're here for a very limited amount of time. We need to-- 
SAM: All right. 
MARISHA: We need to figure, reap as much information from our time on the moon while we can. 
LIAM: Yeah, I was pushing for Ms. Temult yesterday, but if it's not in Imogen's best interest, then I'd be behind Evoroa. 
MARISHA: Evoroa? 
LIAM: Information. 
MARISHA: It's Evoroa or the Strife Emperor situation for me. 
TRAVIS: While you were sleeping, I snuck out and hooked up with the Strife Emperor chick. 
LAURA: Mm. 
TRAVIS: It was awesome. 
LIAM: Hooked up or hooked up? 
TRAVIS: Hooked up. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Scales, totally new for me. 
LAURA: Great. Great. 
ASHLEY: How was that? 
TRAVIS: I didn't really do it. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Immediately-- 
TALIESIN: Hey, saved me an insight check. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: With disadvantage. 
SAM: So are we all going to go Evoroa, or are half going-- 
LAURA: I feel like an infiltration, that is a big stealthy sort of situation. 
SAM: Too many people, too many people. 
LAURA: That's a lot of us to do that. 
TRAVIS: Well, only if we're all moving as one unit. 
TALIESIN: I'm not stealthy at the moment. 
TRAVIS: There could be people that move for different parts of it. 
LAURA: That's true, but that's a lot of-- I mean, you can turn yourself into a Bormodo. 
SAM: We can get more information-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can-- 
SAM: -- if we do two things. 
MATT: You hear folks are starting to gather around the stone table again. 
LAURA: We've got to make a choice, y'all. 
TRAVIS: I mean, if we do want to break up, maybe let's ask what the preferred size would be for Evoroa. 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. 
TRAVIS: If it's smaller, then we can break up and do something else, too. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Get some deets. 
TRAVIS: Let's join them in the room. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: I wait for everybody to file out and grab Imogen, pull her behind for a second. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Hi. 
MARISHA: You feel so distant. Lost, almost. 
LAURA: You too. 
MARISHA: Hmm. Are you all right? 
LAURA: No. Are you? 
MARISHA: I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not all right if you're not all right. I'm really protective of you, and I don't want to come across as harsh towards your mother. 
LAURA: Say it. 
MARISHA: As someone who loves you, I don't know how she could abandon you. 
LAURA: You love me, and you have another power pulling at you at the same time, right? 
MARISHA: I do. 
LAURA: I thought we lost Delilah. We fought her. I thought she was gone, and the minute we split up, you fanned that ember back into existence. I feel like that flame is bigger than it ever was before. Does that mean you don't love me? 
MARISHA: Of course not. But I guess getting rid of the pull, just like the gravity of the moon-- 
LAURA: It's complicated. 
MARISHA: -- it's harder to break free. 
LAURA: I'm sorry for what I said with Nana Morri. 
MARISHA: I can't stop thinking about it. You already have to deal with so much. I don't want to be an added burden. 
LAURA: You're never a burden, Laudna. And I can hate Delilah and love you, which I do. I don't know how to let you let her go. I don't know if you can. 
MARISHA: Do you think you'll ever be rid of Ruidus? 
LAURA: That's our path, right? It's either be rid of Predathos or embrace it. I don't think there's a half measure here. But if getting rid of Delilah means getting rid of you, I don't think that's worth it. I just wish I knew why you gave her power again. 
MARISHA: I didn't mean to! It wasn't a choice! She never fully left. I think we all wanted to believe that, and it kills me to know that you all had to go through what you did for what seems like a lot of nothing. It's not fair. 
LAURA: Are you telling me the truth? You wouldn't lie to me again, right, Laudna? 
MARISHA: No. You just said so yourself. It's complicated. This isn't a one-way road. I'm not feeding her. She's feeding me. It's symbiotic. I don't understand how it works. I never have, and I probably never will. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: But if you-- If you can't reconcile with that, it's okay! 
LAURA: I grab the side of your face and kiss her. I'll never let you go. And if you need her, then that's my answer. 
MARISHA: What if by holding onto you, though, I'm holding you down? 
LAURA: What are you talking about? I need you. 
MARISHA: Imogen. You are destined for greatness. Look at everyone around us, they say it, you're special. 
LAURA: That's bullshit. 
MARISHA: It's not! We can all pretend like we're special. Unique, maybe. But not the kind of special that you are. Everything is being set up, is being staged for you to be the savior of Exandria. You have to know it's true, you have to see it. If I, or anyone else gets in the way of that. 
LAURA: Laudna, if you weren't holding me down, I wouldn't be saving anybody but Predathos. You have to know that's true. If you let me go, I'm gone. 
MARISHA: But if I'm not holding you down, then, think of how high you can fly. I don't want to lose you. Don't get me wrong, I just-- I don't know, it's all so complicated. I just can't help but feel like, the bigger these issues become, the bigger the task. The bigger the gulf between us. 
LAURA: I will not let you go. 
MATT: These tiny myceits start walking into the chamber and reaching up and grabbing your fingers, trying to pull you towards the meeting. 
MARISHA: Poignant. 
LAURA: (startled laugh) 
MARISHA: I won't let go. 
MATT: As you both join the rest of the crowd towards the back, the volume of Volition figures that had seen when you came in here has now likely doubled within these chambers. The halls are filled with figures that are armored, up and ready. You see Reilorans, you see Bormodo, you see the Sasquatch-like creatures that you've encountered before with their various degrees of gray and white fur. Dozens of myceits you see, cytaas that are-- 
TRAVIS: We don't know what those are called yet! 
MATT: No, I know, you never asked yet. (laughs) Hey, you could still ask while you're here. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: What are you called? 
MATT: The nearest one, like-- 
TALIESIN: My name is Robert! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: God! 
MATT: "Do you not know?" 
LAURA: Sam. 
TRAVIS: No, no, we've never met anyone of your kind and I feel terrible being in this-- shut up! Being in this room without knowing what you are. 
MATT: "I'm Sheean Common. And I am of the Quanikkas." 
SAM and LAURA: Quanikka! 
MARISHA: Quantica. 
TRAVIS: Sheean-- 
MATT: Quanikkas. Q-U-A-N-I-K-K-A-S. Quanikkas. 
TALIESIN: Quanicus. 
TRAVIS: Q-U-A-N-I-K-K-A-S. 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Quanikkas. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
MATT: The hush hits the room here as Rashinna steps up. "All right, we've all gathered here because this is a day of action. A number of things designed, set forth, and at the ready. So, there are a few loose ends here to be decided upon as we have some, as many of you have seen, guests with promised capability and interest in aiding our cause. So, Bells Hells, Exandrian allies, what is it that draws you this day?" 
SAM: Bells Hells is here to report for duty. We'll go where we are needed. We have a few things in mind, however, we'd like to talk strategy first. 
MATT: "Certainly." 
SAM: The infiltration plan to find Evoroa. Will this be a small mission, compact, few people? Or a large? 
MATT: "Us being unfamiliar with the capabilities of your troop, we would have to rely upon you as to whether or not you felt you were up to the task of a certain size. Classically, small troops have an easier time infiltrating. But I am unaware of your premium capabilities." 
SAM: Some of us are better at stealth than others, if this is to be a mostly stealth mission, then we might just send a few of us. Others are better at talky-talky stuff. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm not one of those, but-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Eh, talky-talky. 
MATT: "Well, there are many ways of infiltration. As the fact that you've made your way here without causing too much of a splash, I think tells me you have some familiarity with many. Indeed, managing to get into the Colloquium of Candescence is an endeavor. As important as it may be, it's also fraught with danger as you'll be stepping closer and closer to the heart of where the Weave Mind resides and flexes its power." 
SAM: Do you think people with strong presence of will and able to resist the pull and influence of these Weave Minds would be best served for this task? 
MATT: "Likely. The spark that sets this off, the great distraction flash, that dual serves as a means of drawing attention away from our other missions of this day, and, in success, to crumble and impede the progress of the Vanguard and the Weave Mind. Sends bombs, explosives under the employ of our ally here, Ira Wendagoth." As Ira steps out, the satchels over his back, a cloth over the front of his face. Is like-- "Yes?" 
MARISHA: What's all this now? 
MATT: "I just felt like dressing up for the occasion." You see his ears are peering out the back. He looks unchanged other than the fact now he has this little like, a little bandit mask over the front of his face. 
ASHLEY: He's amazing. 
TRAVIS: Whatever gets you there, man. 
LAURA: He's wearing one of our Nott-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: (Ira) "Since our entry will be based in a combination of illusion, a bit of silver tongue wagging, and a rapid entry, it would be advised that whoever comes with me is, oh, good at all of these things and perhaps with a special interest in the mission seeing success. Otherwise, you might end up like the last troop that came with me. Which, with all due respect, useless." 
TRAVIS: Ugh. 
LAURA: Hm. 
TRAVIS: Confidence building. 
MATT: Rashinna goes, "It was an unfortunate circumstance, but lessons were learned. Maybe it's best you tell us who would be best suited to join you then, since you know better than we do, Wendagoth." He goes. "Well, I believe little Miss Calloway here has a vested interest, based on our conversation the night before, yes?" 
ASHLEY: Sure. Absolutely. I could-- I could go with you. 
MATT: "Very well." 
ASHLEY: I mean, depending on what everyone else wants to do. Because I'd rather stay with my people, nothing against you, but. 
SAM: I don't think we all need to go, but I'd be happy to join you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
LAURA: Fuck, I think Fearne would be the best at infiltration. 
LIAM: For sneaking, yes. 
LAURA: I know! 
ASHLEY: Little sneaky-sneakies. 
LAURA: You're the one that can disguise yourself as something else. 
LIAM: Pass Without a Trace. 
ASHLEY: Well, I don't have to go with Ira. This is just, I mean, obviously Ira knows-- 
LAURA: I know, she's got to go. 
ASHLEY: Obviously, Ira knows I would be very, very important to the mission and very helpful. 
SAM: Other people can do other things. 
ASHLEY: But, listen. 
SAM: We've got an invisible man over here. 
LAURA: That's true. Chet would be great. 
SAM: You're super good at climbing and sneaking. 
LAURA: I can be invisible, too. 
LIAM: I'm average at sneaking. I can climb publicly. 
TALIESIN: I would be terrible at getting anywhere near those psychics, so I would go down to the fucking pits. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'd be nervous about you going there. 
TALIESIN: I would not want me anywhere near those. 
SAM: I can give you a blessing of extra sneaky ability. 
LIAM: Wild pitch, we stay together. 
TRAVIS: That is a wild pitch. 
SAM: I don't like it. 
TRAVIS: My body wants to go after Evoroa, but my heart wants to go with the Strife Emperor. 
SAM: Follow your heart. Follow your heart. 
MARISHA: Can we break down this Strife Emperor Bane mission? 
SAM: (like Marisha) Bane! 
LAURA: But she doesn't even want us to go with them. 
MARISHA: The rescue. 
MATT: "Ah, the rescue, yes. This is being helmed by Vezoden. As the rest of your arriving troop was taken upon entry, another series of powerful allies promised by the Talonheart, they are held within the Glasshold Garrison, which is a quite formidable prison. It resides on the western base of the Prime Pillar within the Arx Creonum, and will likely only succeed directly after the explosion and would be a rapid hit, grab, and run mission. Infiltration, stealth, will only get you so far at the site of a prison. It needs to be a direct, strengthened blow and escape. Of which the Talonheart seems rather confident, yes?" (Vezoden) "Wouldn't be the first time I've had to break my way into a place I wasn't supposed to be and kill everyone there and get my men out." 
ASHLEY: It's just the coolest voice. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: All right, my heart's not as interested anymore. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: Detonation and infiltration. 
MARISHA: Seems like those are the two optimal ones, right? 
TRAVIS: Evoroa. 
MATT: Then Ira goes ahead and places a case on the table. "By the way, I finished off what you requested," and she goes and takes the bag and opens it up. (Rashinna) "For the final mission tonight, today. We have Gaz Tomo will be leading the assassination team to the Woven Music Grand Hall. Now, we have to be sparing with the use of the screech plumes, but I believe they will enable us-- " 
LAURA: What are screech plumes? What are screech plumes? 
MATT: "They've been one of the few devices that has given us an edge against the Weave Mind, or at least their subordinates in the past." 
SAM: Screech. 
LAURA: The scramblers. 
MATT: "For a moment, but just a moment, it scrambles and holds at bay the capabilities of ones so psychically or magically inclined. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MARISHA: I can't spell worth-- 
MATT: "With enough fire power in that moment, we can do great things. We have in the past. We've just been limited in our resources. But Ira has been quite a boon to our interests. And has been working on these for the past three or four days. You're certain these will function?" (Ira) "Oh, trust me. I was very, very intrigued to learn about the initial build of these and I'm excited to have that capability in my repertoire now. So, five should be enough then, I think?" (Rashinna) "Five should certainly suffice. Very well, Gaz. Take your finest-- well, those suited for the task." (Gaz) "Not a worry. Wouldn't be the first head I've popped in a while. All right, get my blades at the go." 
MARISHA: I say in Imogen's head. Do you want to say something? 
LAURA: She's strong. 
MATT: "Hm?" 
LAURA: She's strong. 
MATT: (Rashinna) "We assumed as such to be of such important, well, to be gliding around like the Thought Eaters themselves throughout the city, we assumed." 
LAURA: Stronger than the Thought Eaters. It might behoove you to take her prisoner instead. If you can. She has a lot of information you might be able to glean. Glean? Glean. 
SAM and TALIESIN: Glean. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: "I appreciate your candor on this, but I think you also understand, as we do, that a being of such power cannot be subdued. We have one chance at this, and there's only one way to be sure." 
LAURA: Cannot be subdued? What do you mean? Of course we can be subdued. 
MATT: "I've lost many men because we've showed a moment of empathy where it was not deserved. This is war, and one must do what is necessary for what is right." 
MARISHA: I think what Imogen is warning against is escalation. Just be careful and know for sure that this is the right move. Because if you are successful, and that is a massive if, knowing how powerful she is, you could right piss them off in a big way. 
MATT: "Sweet girl. We have been the sole thorn in their side for generations. Nothing would make me happier. They have robbed me of everything I've ever cared about. So, I appreciate your words of warning. But you forget who you're talking to. We are soldiers. And we will do what must be done." 
MARISHA: There's a quick thrum in my chest and my face morphs ever so slightly and I say: I'm not a sweet girl. Unsettling Presence. 
MATT: In the room, a few folks take a step back a little bit. "Indeed. Hmph. You are a surprising bunch. I'm beginning to think I'm glad we've crossed paths and are on the same side. Right?" 
LAURA: Of course. 
MATT: "Good. Now then. What intrigues you?" 
TRAVIS: Infiltration. 
SAM: Detonation. 
TALIESIN: Detonation, but let's make sure we're doing, I say three to detonation, four to infiltration. Or do we want to reverse that? 
LIAM: Infiltration. 
TALIESIN: Infiltration. 
TRAVIS: B, B. 
TALIESIN: Got to have muscle for detonation then, so that makes sense. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I think we need at least one more. 
LAURA: You got to go to your dad. 
ASHLEY: I mean, do I, though? Because what if-- 
SAM: Yeah. It's your dad. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what if he's like: Oh great, you're here. This is what we needed. And now we're-- I can do my thing. 
TALIESIN: That's when we kill him. 
SAM: Then you've got friends to protect you. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. I mean, I'm fine with it, but I'm just saying, I'm just wanting to make the right choices here. 
MATT: Whatever you want to do. 
SAM: There's no right choices. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just making sure. 
MATT: There are no right choices here. 
ASHLEY: Fair enough. 
MARISHA: So, detonation, detonation, detonation-- 
ASHLEY: Detonation. 
MARISHA: The rest go infiltration. 
SAM: Who's the third det? 
MATT: Okay, so we have-- 
ASHLEY: Me, you-- 
MATT: Fearne, Ashton-- 
SAM: And? 
ASHLEY: Ashton. 
SAM: Oh great. 
MATT: And who else? 
SAM: Fearne, Ashton, and FCG. 
MATT: FCG. 
SAM: The hard hitters. 
ASHLEY: Team detonation. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs excitedly) 
TALIESIN: This is actually a well built group, all things considered. 
MATT: All righty, and we have Chetney-- 
ASHLEY: Fair enough. 
MATT: -- Orym, Imogen, and Laudna-- 
SAM: Soft touchers. 
MATT: -- on the infiltration team. 
MARISHA: Does that feel right? 
SAM: Sure, man. 
TRAVIS: What's your face? 
TALIESIN: Two combat, two weird shit-- 
MARISHA: Two magic. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Then over there, we have-- 
TALIESIN: Weird shit, combat, and healing. 
MARISHA: And healing. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: You can only make yourself invisible, right? 
TRAVIS: I can make myself and one other person invisible. 
LAURA: Okay, I can make me and one other person invisible, I think. 
TALIESIN: Hey, look at that. 
LIAM: Casters on each side. 
ASHLEY: Which is me and possibly you. 
LIAM: We've got tanks on each side. 
MARISHA: My stealth is pretty high. 
TALIESIN: It's pretty solid. 
LAURA: Actually, I can make all of us if there's not enough spells. 
MATT: One of the figures steps out of the back crew. You can see this very thin-looking Reiloran who is wearing this wide-brimmed hat that's obscuring most of her face in shadow. As she moves forward, you can see she's gliding, as opposed to walking. Reaching out, "If you're to be infiltrating, perhaps I can aid you on your first leg." You see as she talks, she's an elderly Reiloran. Appears to be of the Mystic variety. You can see the headdress not dissimilar to some of the ones that you've summoned in the past. Not dissimilar from some of the Thought Eaters as well. You can see still, the markings across the body, the fingers long and folding in on themselves to the point where it looks like there's more fingers than there should be, but they just curl into themselves in the front. "I'm past my prime to join you, but perhaps I can obfuscate for a bit." 
LIAM: Won't say no. 
MARISHA: What's your name? 
MATT: "My name is Ivanas. I was once a designer for the Weave Mind." 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: It's a pleasure to meet you. 
TRAVIS: Designer-- 
MATT: "You wouldn't say that if you know what I've done." 
MARISHA: (laughs joylessly) I think many of us are walking a path of redemption. 
MATT: "I would agree. (laughs dryly)" What were you saying? 
TRAVIS: Nothing. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LAURA: Ivanas 
TRAVIS: I'll shake her hand at some point. 
SAM: Ivanas. 
ASHLEY: Ivanas? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: She kind of reminds me of Zhudanna. 
LAURA: I know. 
MATT: Fearne, you-- 
LAURA: Just like a evil Zhudanna. 
MARISHA: Like a raspy, scary-- 
MATT: Fearne, you feel these fingers (spindly clutching) around the back of your shoulders as Ira's face comes into view like a Xenomorph-- 
ASHLEY: (startles) 
MATT: -- from the side of your head. He says-- 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
MATT: "Are we to journey together?" 
ASHLEY: Yes, we are. 
MATT: "Good. Get your things. I'm excited for the reunion." 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
MATT: "(laughs sinisterly)" 
MARISHA: Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Just be on your guard. He could be walking you into a trap. But I'm sure you already know that. 
ASHLEY: I was thinking that. I was thinking that. We'll be okay. We'll be on our toes. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I will be on my hooves. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: We'll, we'll be all right, we'll be all right, we'll be all right. 
MARISHA: Despite us being separate, we'll still be able to talk to each other. 
SAM: I think so, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: That's great. 
SAM: Do you need some extra dexterity or anything? 
LIAM: (laughs) No. 
SAM: Oh. Well, you said you weren't-- (laughter) 
SAM: You said you weren't good sneaky. The stealth, oh, stealth is dex. 
TRAVIS: Who has a healing potion? 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Raise your healing potion if you have it. 
MARISHA: I have two. 
TALIESIN: Oh, this is yours? 
MARISHA: I have this one, but I think-- 
ASHLEY: You call should take a healing potion. 
MARISHA: -- I have another one. 
LIAM: Ah! (laughter) 
MATT: Wake you up. 
TALIESIN: Oh, well, now it's on the ground. 
MARISHA: I'm pretty I have-- 
LIAM: This is yours, don't you think? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. I do not have one, so. 
LAURA: Yeah, there's three right there. 
ASHLEY: I wonder if I could give you-- 
LIAM: Are you doing the thing where you give me advantage on it? 
ASHLEY: -- Pass Without a Trace. 
SAM: Yeah, but-- 
ASHLEY: No? 
SAM: If you don't need it. 
TALIESIN: No, my abilities are shot, so I'll take anything you got. 
LAURA: No, you would just give me-- 
SAM: Oh yeah, he might need some stuff. 
LIAM: I was just being a little shit. 
MARISHA: Ew. 
LAURA: I mean, I don't-- 
TALIESIN: It'll be fine. 
LAURA: I think you can replenish my sorcery points, I don't think I can go above what I already have, right? 
ASHLEY: What you already have, okay. Because you're full up, right? 
MATT: You can't go higher than your max. 
LAURA: Okay, and I'm already at max, so. 
MATT: But you can use them to replenish them, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Although I am going to cast Mage Armor before we do anything. 
SAM: I'll pop a quick Greater Restoration into Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Are we going for it? 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! 
TALIESIN: All right. I'll take that. I'm not going to complain. 
LAURA: Look at you. 
ASHLEY: I have a question. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: "I have a question." 
ASHLEY: If I were to cast Pass Without a Trace-- 
TALIESIN: Boom. 
ASHLEY: -- would they be able to continue that, or do they have to be near me? 
TALIESIN: They have to be near you. 
LAURA: 30 feet. 
MATT: Yeah, be within-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, for the duration. 
MATT: -- 30 feet of you. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, I see that now. 
TALIESIN: I have it for free too, if you want. 
ASHLEY: Never mind. 
TALIESIN: So you don't have to spend a spell on it. 
ASHLEY: Well, I was just thinking for them. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we can't do anything. 
LAURA: Because we have don't have Pass without a Trace. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's okay. 
LAURA: But, you know. 
TALIESIN: They'll be fine. 
SAM: I can give somebody advantage on dex checks. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Chet doesn't need it, and I'm pretty high. 
MARISHA: Advantage on dex checks. 
LAURA: I mean-- 
LIAM: Are either of you casters low, low, low on that? 
LAURA: I mean, I'm not awesome at dex, I'm not terrible. 
MARISHA: My dex is a 14. 
LIAM: That's above average. 
TALIESIN: That one. 
LAURA: Yeah, maybe-- 
LIAM: That's the lowest. 
SAM: I'll give you some dex. 
MARISHA: Great! 
SAM: For the next hour, so hurry! 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Sneak quick. 
LAURA: Be safe you three. 
SAM: Eh. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
ASHLEY: You too. 
SAM: We're all going to be fine. We're going to be fine. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: We're going to be fine. 
ASHLEY: Don't make any dumb decisions, don't give into anything. 
TALIESIN: And hey-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You've got somebody with you for this, so loosen up, fucking shy violet, just a little bit. 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
TALIESIN: I'm walking over to you. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Spooky. 
TRAVIS: What's a shy violet? 
MARISHA: I'm not sure. 
TALIESIN: In my experience, every good person has a bad person inside them making it all possible. Yours is just a fucker. Good luck. I tap you on the shoulder. 
MARISHA: Are these supposed to be encouraging? 
TALIESIN: Nope, not encouraging at all. Just want you to remember me if I don't come back. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Orym? 
LIAM: Hmm? 
ASHLEY: Don't be brave, don't do anything stupid. 
TRAVIS: Don't be brave! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Be brave. 
ASHLEY: You neither! 
SAM: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: You all get your asses out of there and be safe. 
TRAVIS: They got great snacks over here. 
ASHLEY: I know, I've been eating them this whole time. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Last meal, I assume. 
ASHLEY: Tooting away with a little oxtail. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, do we have a Heroes'-- 
TRAVIS: (flapping fart) 
MARISHA: FCG. 
SAM: Are you going to give me a pep talk right now? 
TALIESIN: Please, I want to see it. 
MARISHA: Continue to be shiny-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: -- and-- 
TRAVIS: Squeaky? 
MARISHA: -- squeaky. 
TRAVIS: And hard. 
SAM: Don't forget to oil your joints. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: May your wheel always be squeaky. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I feel like my comments have now been upgraded to a pep talk after that. I feel like there's a curve and I'm winning now. 
TRAVIS: Natural upgrade, yeah. 
SAM: Let's roll! 
MARISHA: We'll all be able to check in. Let's try and check in on the hour, once an hour, at least! 
LAURA: I mean, we can talk to each other all the time! 
MARISHA: Text your mother! 
LAURA: We can just talk to each other. 
MARISHA: We can just talk to each other. 
TRAVIS: Let's see if there's any latency in our connection. 
SAM: Why don't we just go! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Done. 
ASHLEY: I'm going now, I don't want to say goodbye. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm just walking away. 
LAURA: We're not saying goodbye, because we're still talking to each other the whole fucking time. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you're right. Okay, okay. 
LIAM: Play it safe if you can, because we have to get back home to report what we find. No unnecessary risks. Unnecessary ones. Thanks. 
ASHLEY: Chet. 
MARISHA: All right, let's go. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: Yes. 
LIAM: Great. 
MATT: Ivanas, the thin, withered Mystic glides forward and-- Actually, that's a good question. 
TRAVIS: Did you have a good question for yourself? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Yes, I did. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: No. To the infiltration team. 
LAURA: Yes. 
LIAM: We get have 25 dexterity? 
MATT: Right? 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: (laughs) "No." 
MATT: She reaches into this side pouch and pulls out this loose pile of what looks like charcoal almost, runs a long clawed thumb through it, and scratches a mark on your forehead. It kind of hurts, it breaks the skin faintly, but it pushes it into the forehead. As it does, your eyes glow briefly, but you don't see much of a change. She goes through and does it to you, does it to you, and does it to-- 
TRAVIS: Fucking wait a second, what are you doing? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Y'all just taking it and shit. What are you doing? 
MATT: "Making sure that you can see each other." 
TRAVIS: I can see just fine. I'm good. 
MARISHA: Don't be rude, Chet. Just do it. 
TRAVIS: I said I'm fine. 
MARISHA: (scoffs) 
MATT: "Very well. (laughs weakly)" (magical energy) Casts Invisibility on all of you. All of you can see each other. Chet can't see any of them. (laughter) 
LIAM: But the invisibles can see each other? 
ASHLEY: You should've done it. 
MATT: You all have See Invisibility on you for the next hour. 
LAURA: Oh, sweet. 
TALIESIN: Except Chet. 
MATT and LAURA: Except Chet. 
TRAVIS: She said she did horrible shit and you just let her dig her fingernail into your fucking forehead. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Didn't blink an eye. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
LAURA: We've all done horrible shit. 
MARISHA: Witches be bitches. You trust a fellow witch! 
ASHLEY: You trust a fellow witch. 
TRAVIS: That is something else. 
TALIESIN: You can't see if we're blinking. 
ASHLEY: And a fellow bitch. 
TRAVIS: I'll see y'all on the other side. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I've been through Ash Wednesday, it's not a big deal. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's incredible. 
MATT: "You have an hour, be careful." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: So we're invisible, and we see-- Oh! 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: So, you made us invisible too? 
MATT: Yeah, the four of you are invisible. 
LIAM: Are invisible. 
MATT: Yeah, she cast Invisibility on a high level on all of you. So, she's going to stay here and concentrate on it for the hour. The three of you have See Invisibility, which is not concentration, for an hour-- 
LAURA: Epic. 
MATT: -- on each of you. 
LIAM: So we are invisible-- 
MARISHA: Cool. 
LIAM: -- and we see invisible. 
LAURA: Sweet. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
MATT: You all see this faint shimmer around your forms-- 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: -- that lets you know that you're you know, in that translucent magical illusion. 
TALIESIN: Like a vampire. 
LAURA: Okay. Cool, cool, cool. 
TRAVIS: And you're all infected. 
LIAM: I think I could pull tricks on you, but I know you can smell me. 
TRAVIS: Bitches, I also have this. 
LAURA: Oh, right. Okay. 
ASHLEY: A low level ring? 
TRAVIS: But y'all are infected by this chick that did-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's a "magic ring." 
MARISHA: (sighs pleasantly) 
MATT: So as people begin to-- 
TALIESIN: So easy. 
MATT: -- gather their materials and start setting off on their various watch points. Through your missions, there are, and Rashinna goes over the plan with each of you for your different troops as well. There are small troops that work as way points along your path to watch your back. While you're doing your mission, they're essentially people who are playing watch out from different points, so that if anything starts going real bad, they can notify you or notify someone nearby. So there's the main teams that are going in, and then there's backup teams that aren't part of it, aren't your troop, that are scattering amongst the city around various areas of interest to relay information, relay any changes in the plan, to try and be backups on this. So, you do have that at least happening now throughout the city. 
LAURA: If we attack or cast a spell, our invisibility ends. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Got it. 
LIAM: It's not Greater Invisibility. 
MATT: For team detonation-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Boom, boom. 
MATT: -- as you begin to gather your things to go, Ira turns to the three of you, "So, what would be your preferred means of wandering? Invisibility? Or do you want to look a little different? Depending on the wards, some might be less effective. Last time we went through, it was under cloak of invisibility, and I was the only one that returned, so." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: When you put Invisibility on everybody else, you were the only one that returned? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Why don't we do the look different thing? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's look a little different. 
SAM: That's always fun. 
MATT: "Very well. I'll think of a few ones I passed by. Perfect!" (magical burst) He casts Seeming on all of you. For the next eight hours, or until he decides otherwise, you all of a sudden take on the guise, the illusion of, you can see, none of you are Reiloran, out of an intentional interest, since you are not psychically gifted, but you are now a tall, burly Quanikka. You are a younger, burly looking Bormodo. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You can decide how you look if you want to. 
ASHLEY: Okay. And FCG, (laughs) because it'd be funny, I'm going to make you a-- 
LAURA: Oh. A myceit! 
TRAVIS: Myceit. 
MATT: I'm gong to make you a myceit, yeah. (excited uproar) 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LAURA: (adorable myceit chittering) (laughter) 
SAM: Amazing. 
LIAM: You've got Seeming all over you. (laughter) 
LAURA: (myceit chittering) 
MATT: You can see, Ira has taken the form of a Reiloran, specifically a Thought Eater, the long robes, the chains, the adorned shoulder bits. 
TRAVIS: Of course. He's looking around at the rest of you. "How do I look?" 
ASHLEY: You-- 
TALIESIN: Overdressed. 
SAM: 10% less creepy. (laughter) 
MATT: "Come then, this way." 
LAURA: And Mister can be your-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh, my little cytaa? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MATT: Yeah, he can do enough of them. Seeming can do more people, yeah. So you have a little Mister cytaa that's on your shoulder if you want to bring him out. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: Adorable. 
TALIESIN: That's awesome. 
ASHLEY: I'll pull him out. 
MATT: Okay, easy enough to do. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! 
SAM: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I mean. 
LIAM: I just got to find some good mushrooms. 
LAURA: Yeah, so we don't have-- Team invisible has no healers, so, we should take-- 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: Take some healing potions. 
LAURA: -- some health potions. 
TRAVIS: That's why I asked. 
MARISHA: I have two. 
LAURA: I don't have any. 
SAM: Take one of Fearne's. 
LIAM: I thought I had multiple. 
ASHLEY: I don't have any on me. 
LIAM: I thought I had three. 
SAM: If Laura's got those-- 
ASHLEY: I don't know. 
MARISHA: And so, if-- 
LAURA: They've just been going around the table, so-- 
MARISHA: Then just take it-- 
LAURA: If we use them, we send in to Matt, so, these are-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- within the party, so-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'll take one of them. 
MATT: Okay. As in this moments, your troop now diverges in two separate places of an unfamiliar subterranean city. 
LAURA: Bye. 
ASHLEY: Bye. 
MATT: A day of tension, promise, and viable anarchy lays before you as you descend from one of the exit tunnels of the pass house infrastructure. Both troops begin to descend the endless winding stone stairs and bridges that continue into the now humming city of Kreviris. You can see the thousands of lantern lights that flicker in and out with the passers by. You can see the spiral-like platforms that carve out of parts of the central massive glass trunk-like spire that carves up the center of this subterranean cavern. You can see the floating Reiloran Mystics that wander from place to place. You can see little flying creatures with wings like (fluttering) taking off from places, that you hadn't quite encountered before. You can hear the distant sounds of conversation, occasional shout, and bit of laughter. Children. You can get glimpses of a society that is bustling. In all of its implied challenges and hardships, there's still life, and color, and vibrancy, and art, you hear music. There are musicians here. As you begin to scatter amongst the town, you can see the architecture itself. A weird smattering facsimile of Exandrian architecture. You see things that almost resemble dwarven rigid structures. You can see some elements of towers that are almost elvish, but filed down, or half remembered. You can see where, after endless generations of being influenced night by night by the various scattered dreams of Exandrians, this is a society based in a mixture of interpretation. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: And in so, something wholly unique. Oddly beautiful. It's about then you begin to notice the presence of the military, as the Dominion of Cruth soldiers and army are thick through the streets. You hear the sounds of drills being run. You see what look like war machines, almost, gathered clusters of armored juggernauts, themselves training in what feels like preparation for a move to the surface at an undesignated future time. Stepping into this bustle, the tension brimming within you, as you lose any sight, or prospect of where you each are beyond the sound of your voices in each other's head, the butterflies curl into your stomach, by whatever emotion you think guides you at this moment, and hope, or pray, that what's to come goes well. That's where we'll end tonight's episode. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MATT: We'll pick up for these two missions next week. 
LIAM: Split missions? 
LAURA: Whoa! 
MATT: Split team missions! 
LAURA: Split missions. 
MATT: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Super smart-- 
MARISHA: Split mish! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Super smart. 
ASHLEY: Supe smart. Wow. 
TRAVIS: Ho ho ho ho. 
TALIESIN: I'm so excited. 
MARISHA: Split mish soups. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good-- 
TALIESIN: Should be great. 
TRAVIS: We're good, we're good-- We're good, we're good. 
ASHLEY: We're okay. 
TRAVIS: We're good. 
MATT: It's going to be fun. 
MARISHA: Wowsers. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Who is the group that's going to betray us? 
MATT: Mm! 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: All right, well, we'll pick this up next week. I'm really excited to see where this goes. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! (clapping hands) 
MATT: Until then, thank you so much. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? 
TRAVIS: Oh baby, we split the party!

Cooldown[]
MARISHA, LAURA, ASHLEY: What have we done?
SAM: Exactly what we should have done.
MARISHA: My eyes are burning.
TRAVIS: Why?
SAM: Why? What happened?
MARISHA: Crying makes your eyes burn.
LAURA and MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Did you lie to your girlfriend again?
ASHLEY: Yes.
MARISHA: I didn't lie.
LAURA: Did you? Did you, though?
MARISHA: Nooo.
ASHLEY: "Nooo!"
TRAVIS: ♪ Baby don't lie ♪ ♪ Don't lie ♪
LAURA: "Nooo!"
TRAVIS: ♪ You're lying as you lie ♪ ♪ Don't lie ♪
MARISHA: This is blasphemy! I will not have it.
LIAM: No-ahh on the ark or no-ahh Wiley?
TRAVIS: Your mom did change her mind a little bit.
LAURA: My mom made some good points.
TRAVIS: Changed her mind a little.
LAURA: Not going to lie.
LIAM: Sum them up.
TRAVIS: I'm a little twisted.
LIAM: Sum up the good points.
LAURA: The good points are... I mean, from her perspective, the gods are tyrants, right? But opposite of that, you don't have to worship them.
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: They don't force you to worship them.
ASHLEY: They don't. 
TALIESIN: It's still their world.
LAURA: Sure, but you also can live your whole life without worshiping anyone. I've gone 28 years without having any connection to the gods so far, right? The only one forcing me to do anything is Predathos.
TALIESIN: We saw a whole town of people when we were running around that were--
LAURA: Sure.
TALIESIN: --getting completely fucked with by a god they did not believe in.
LAURA: But I wasn't there.
MARISHA: Well, that's a little-- that gets complicated because that's not necessarily-- That is man's interpretation of god's will.
TALIESIN: We actually did commune a little bit with the--
LAURA: The Dawnfather? Wasn't it the Dawnfather?
TALIESIN: It was the Dawnfather.
TRAVIS: Big chief.
TALIESIN: The Dawnfather was very, "No, I'm cool with this." You know, there was very much a "No, I'm cool with this."
TRAVIS: Yeah, I feel like we don't have the perspective that Ludinus is sharing with his top brass.
TALIESIN: I'm not saying--
LAURA: But I also think he's got a very biased--
TALIESIN: It's a very Greek pantheon.
TRAVIS: It may be very biased, but like where did it come from? When did it happen to him? How long has he had it, and what kicked it off? Like how old is that dude? Was it Pre-Calamity? During the Calamity? Post-Calamity? Was it in the dust settling from it? Were there promises made? Did those help resettle the world and they were just abandoned? Like, what was it?
LAURA: Are the numbers wrong? Has the Weave Mind, those five, have they been around since the beginning? Are they what is holding Predathos? What is holding Predathos? Are they connected directly to him?
MATT: Man, you should ask him.
MARISHA: Well, hang on.
TRAVIS: Ask who?
LAURA: Ludinus?
TRAVIS: That's what I'm saying.
LAURA: I know. I wanted to--
ASHLEY: You guys are going to the Weave Mind, right?
LAURA: We're going to actual-- we're going to that--
TALIESIN: If you find a fun place to plant that seed, by the way. I'm going to keep putting that in your head.
LAURA: No, I know, I know, I know.
TALIESIN: That shit's going to be great.
LIAM: Is the offer to bring--
MATT: Hey, man, find out where he is.
MARISHA: Three levels of exhaustion.
LIAM: Is the offer to bring everyone to Exandria just like a really shiny timeshare brochure?
LAURA: I mean, that's the thing, though. What's to keep us from bringing people to Exandria? Why can't we bring them to Exandria and not wake up Predathos?
TRAVIS: You mean us, or--
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: The people stuck on Ruidus are definitely owed some sort of recompense.
LAURA: Yeah, I agree, for sure.
SAM: They were stolen from Exandria and made to suffer for hundreds of years. Thousands of years. Hundreds of years?
LAURA: Thousands, I think.
TRAVIS: I thought they were born here, right? So they don't--
LAURA: Well, they've been born here, but--
SAM: I know, but their people were removed from the Exandrian gene pool and forced to evolve--
TALIESIN: If they can hold their breath for a while, I can come back and go to Honkeytown.
SAM: --into beasts of burden and things.
LAURA: But creatures like the myceit... myceit? Am I saying that right? That don't resemble anything that we have on Exandria.
ASHLEY: So they were from here, like indigenous?
SAM: Well, they resemble fungus.
LAURA: I guess that's true. Evolved from--
TRAVIS: Which needs a couple things to grow.
LAURA: Maybe Predathos woke up different types of creatures, you know.
MARISHA: Well, also, too, we learned that there are basically biomechanics working for the Weave.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.
MARISHA: That are basically making--
LAURA: They've been waking things up.
MARISHA: Yes, and morphing. Which is probably why we have the different Reilorans. Because they've been basically--
TALIESIN: Nobody knows how many generations, too.
MARISHA: They've been CRISPRing Reilorans.
SAM: But the people trapped on this rock are definitely victims. They should be brought down and shown a good time.
LAURA: Yeah, I agree. They should get whatever life they want. If they want to stay on Ruidus, cool. If they don't, cool.
TALIESIN: Or just vacation.
LAURA: I want that they should have the option.
ASHLEY: Yeah, you have the choice of where you want to go.
LIAM: Yeah, but back to what you said earlier. I'm not opposed to there being two-way traffic. But I don't understand why you have to unleash something that's potentially destructive.
SAM: But you can't have two-way traffic with the...
TRAVIS: Divine Gate?
SAM: --the Divine Gate up. If you put the Divine Gate down, it will release him. So you got to either kill Predathos--
LAURA: We've got to kill Predathos.
TRAVIS: Inside the Gate.
LAURA: We have to kill Predathos, and then open up the Gate around Ruidus.
SAM: Or somehow get--
ASHLEY: If Predathos is a thing.
TALIESIN: Or teach everyone to hold their breath for a very long time and take them Spookytown.
SAM: You think Predathos doesn't exist?
TRAVIS: Well, it's just a name, right?
ASHLEY: I don't know. It's just a name. I don't know what it is.
TRAVIS: We don't know what he looks like, what he does...
LIAM: Yeah, we don't know what it means.
TALIESIN: Could be anything.
ASHLEY: What does it mean? Whatever it is.
LAURA: What if it's like Aeor where they developed a weapon that could take out the gods. Maybe it's just a weapon like that.
TRAVIS: What if those two gods were going rogue and were trying to throw everybody off and they trapped him in this scoop of land, right? I mean, it could be anything. Predathos might not even be--
SAM: Wait, two gods? You mean the two Primordial--
TRAVIS: The history said something like the two deities disappeared.
LIAM: Predathos came from elsewhere and showed up and Pac Manned them.
SAM: Ate them.
LIAM: And the other guys went, "Nope!"
LAURA: Goodbye.
TALIESIN: Would the creatures in us maybe know something since they were around for fucking ever?
LAURA: Maybe.
TRAVIS: The creatures?
LAURA: The titans. The ancient titans.
SAM: Oh, the creatures in you. 
ASHLEY: Are we allowed--
MATT: You can certainly try to commune with them, if you'd like to.
ASHLEY: To try to commune with them?
MATT: With the right location, the right setup, anything's possible.
TRAVIS: Is that Primordial earth titan outside Vasselheim still around? Can you go and tap him on the cheek and be like, "Great-great-grandfather?"
MARISHA: Hey, wake up!
TALIESIN: Grandpa, I want a pony!
TRAVIS: "What was it like back then?"
MARISHA: We also have the super old hippie tree in the Shattered Teeth that we can go back to.
TALIESIN: Hippie tree liked me. I made friends with the tree.
SAM: As we noticed this session, we noticed that we're lacking the perspective of the Prime Deities, too. We've never really talked to them.
MATT: When you get back to it, once you have the information you think is sufficient enough and you want to go back, you got a handful of really fun things you can do in Exandria to try and tie up some of these bits, too.
LIAM: You all want to call a god?
SAM: I would love to call a god.
LAURA: Just call a god.
TRAVIS: We can't let Ira know that we have that section of machinery, that Aeorian section of machinery.
LAURA: No. Who has that, by the way? It's not with Ira, right? Who has it?
TRAVIS: It's in the hole or the bag.
MARISHA: It's in the bag, I think. Or in the hole.
LAURA: Who has the-- You have the bag.
TALIESIN: It was in the hole because it's a little too big.
MARISHA: It's too big for the bag.
TALIESIN: It's in the hole. I was going to offer quietly--
LAURA: But you have the hole.
TALIESIN: I do, but I was going to quietly see if you guys wanted to take the hole. That was one of the other reasons why I would have walked over.
MARISHA: Well, he's got the bag and you got the hole.
TALIESIN: Are we good with that?
MARISHA: Yeah, you're with--
SAM: What can we do with that thing?
MARISHA: We don't know enough about it.
TALIESIN: Thousands of julienne fries.
LAURA: Just don't let Ira get it.
TRAVIS: Imahara Joe might know, because he worked with that a little bit.
LIAM: We're so in the dark because Ludinus has a plan that we do not fully understand yet, and Mama Temult has a plan that's different than Ludinus' that we also don't understand.
LAURA: Is it bad-- should I have tried to get more information out of her? I ended the conversation.
SAM: You really blew it.
ASHLEY: I think you got more than you could even--
MARISHA: I know. I don't think she's going to say much more.
TALIESIN: I think you kicked ass on that one.
ASHLEY: She's not going to say much.
MARISHA: I think it's exactly that. I think she's got her own perspective. I think she's been fed a decent amount by Ludinus. I think the promise to Exandria is a shiny timeshare pamphlet.
LIAM: She's in "The Departed".
MARISHA: I think there's something else.
LIAM: She's deep undercover with whatever she's doing. She seems like she doesn't want to risk whatever position she has found for herself.
LAURA: Should I fucking have warned her?
LIAM: I don't know.
TALIESIN: No, I think you did the right thing.
TRAVIS: You did, you told her a fall was coming.
MARISHA: Yeah, you said we're going to fight.
LAURA: I kind of did.
TRAVIS: "Are you going to kill me if we're on either sides of this thing?" Right? Plus, I think she's of the opinion that it's not going to change your mind, and you knowing what she knows isn't going to change the outcome. So she's not trying to burden you with it. Right? That's the thing that was so great, was that there was still love there and she was conflicted, but not enough to change her mind. She thinks it's just a runaway train, regardless of what you or anybody else says.
LAURA: Yeah, we're not going to be able to stop it.
LIAM: She seems like she thinks she's stopping some worse, like, the worst case scenario somehow. That she has to be there to make sure it's not.
LAURA: Which is what somebody in a cult thinks.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Like she's been fed and fed and fed.
TRAVIS: Maybe.
MARISHA: Out of all the things she said, because I feel like I'm a little more critical of what she said than some others here. I do think-- The thing for me was her being like, "I am keeping him from just going fucking nuclear and going Plan Z.
LAURA: Yeah, she's gone.
MARISHA: What has she talked him off the ledge on?
TALIESIN: Or what has he allowed her to think? What has he allowed her to think he's talked her off the ledge on?
LIAM: What skeeved me out, and Orym I don't think knows this much detail, because it was in your dream when she said, "Well, he's done some good things."
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: What good things?
TRAVIS: He gave me the ability to fly.
LAURA: I can fly. That's from Predathos.
LIAM: That guy Ludinus has been along for a long time. He's been plotting for centuries. He's playing everyone around.
LAURA: And if he thinks that sucking her power up in him would do any good, he would do that. He would kill those around him in a heartbeat.
SAM: I really want to see the Weave Mind people and figure out what they--
TRAVIS: The five minds?
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: I want to see their little raisin bodies. 
SAM: I'm still so confused as to the mechanism by which these dreams are drawn to them and funneled through them to Predathos, through Predathos.
TALIESIN: I think it's like the funnel in Dark City. I think it's just that big--
LAURA: It's like a giant--
TALIESIN: Shut it down, shut it down forever.
LAURA: It's like our harness. It's a giant harness.
SAM: That's funneling the experiences of Exandria down?
ASHLEY: All of the Ruidians?
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, it's taking...
LIAM: Do you think he has a mega funnel to funnel Predathos up his own butt?
TALIESIN: Do they recognize people if we went up there?
SAM: I feel like that's the plan, right?
MARISHA: What did you say?
LIAM: Funneling Predathos. He's got a mega funnel--
SAM: Ludinus?
LIAM: --and pulling Predathos' power into himself.
LAURA: You think?
LIAM: Kills Predathos.
SAM: Yeah, he wants to unleash Predathos so he can suck up--
LIAM: Kill Predathos, and take his--
SAM: Predathos' power.
TRAVIS: If he's got an improved funnel? For sure. Why would you unleash Predathos if you can just be Predathos?
MARISHA: Become Predathos.
TRAVIS: The Talonheart is what you --
LAURA: Oh my god, yeah.
SAM: Maybe that big glass thing is--
LAURA: Is just his funnel.
SAM: Is just his funnel. Like a city-sized funnel.
TALIESIN: A straw.
TRAVIS: That's Predathos' peen.
LAURA: Because it's been around as long as the Weave Mind has, right?
ASHLEY: Predathos?
LAURA: No, no, no. Ludinus.
SAM and ASHLEY: Ludinus?
MARISHA: So he's been around longer.
LIAM: Longer. Than we've been told.
TRAVIS: As far as we know.
LIAM: We were just told something like three or four or five hundred years. We know that Ludinus has been around for something like 800 plus.
ASHLEY: Longer than that, yeah.
LIAM: Probably much, but--
MARISHA: Well, we know, because remember what we got from Ludinus' notebooks. He was around during the Calamity.
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: He watched the gods go (rampaging), stomping on sand castles--
LIAM: Storm and stomp, yeah.
MARISHA: --on his land. So he has childhood trauma from witnessing a god war on his home turf.
LIAM: He could have been middle-aged when that happened.
MARISHA: Then never let it go. So yeah. So Ludinus has been around for 800 to a thousand years.
LAURA: He's got middle-aged trauma. So his ultimate goal: Suck up Predathos, become--
SAM: Be a god.
LAURA: Become Predathos, then suck up the other gods, because then he has the power that Predathos has. Eat all the other gods. 
ASHLEY: Then he's all powerful.
LAURA: Then he is the ruler of the universe.
LIAM: Then he's the head honcho.
MARISHA: Ultimate cosmic power.
LIAM: Plus the Cerberus Assembly box had that machine part, and there's obviously many of those. So maybe those are just-- maybe he's 3D printing parts to his giant mega funnel. Those parts are going to connect to whatever. Maybe it's the spire in the middle and he's like, "Eh, I'll just plant 500 of these doohickeys around."
SAM: Do we know that prior to the red bridge, the ruby bridge...
LAURA: The Bloody Bridge.
SAM: The Bloody Bridge, thank you. Do we know that Ludinus made trips up to the moon before that?
LAURA: I don't think he was. I don't think he could. I think this whole thing--
SAM: So he didn't build the Weave Mind.
LAURA, LIAM, TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: No, we don't know.
SAM: He's been talking to them.
MATT: As best you can tell, the whole purpose of the Malleus Key was to begin his ability, and the Vanguard's ability, to get to Ruidus.
SAM: But he could have been talking to them before that.
LAURA: He's such a dumb shit, because it was there in the lake the whole fucking time.
MARISHA: I know, we can't forget about this lake portal.
LAURA: What a dummy.
SAM: What an idiot.
LAURA: What a fucking idiot.
TALIESIN: We found one portal. There's probably more.
LIAM: Could be.
ASHLEY: Yeah. But how do we know he doesn't know about that?
LAURA: Because he would have used it. 
TALIESIN: There would have been someone there to kill us.
ASHLEY: Maybe he did.
TRAVIS: Vezoden Amerai, you called them the Talonheart.
TALIESIN: He would've been insane not to leave it guarded. Properly guarded.
MATT: The Talonheart is their title.
TRAVIS: Is their title?
LAURA: If Ludinus knew about that, that lake would be drained.
LIAM: There would be Ruby Vanguard on both sides patrolling it. 
MATT: If you want a little fun back lore for that little portal. This doesn't have any impact on things. Much like the tease of the portal you found very early in the campaign, where you stepped into that one fountain in the Heartmoor Hamlet, it had a portal to the water elemental plane. That way it could continuously pour water. This was actually a similar portal. It was designed to have a continuous source of running water into this elven city. But this happened before the creation of Ruidus.
MARISHA: So it got scooped up with it.
LIAM: So it's a magical aqueduct.
TALIESIN: That never got turned off.
ASHLEY: The portal got scooped.
MATT: That is in its legacy. So it happened before the creation of Ruidus, so that was never broken.
TALIESIN: So there's possibly a bunch of different-- there's probably a dozen of those rolling around. 
MATT: There's probably some poor schmucks throughout history who swam in that lake and went through and then found themselves in this crazy ruin, didn't know what they were doing, and couldn't get back. Their bones are somewhere in the--
LAURA: That's what those little skeletons were.
MATT: Some of them are, and some of them were probably the people who lived in that elven city when Ruidus was created.
TALIESIN: You could do a little bit of research and probably find a whole bunch of haunted fucking lakes.
LAURA: It's like "The Descent".
TALIESIN: Bermuda Triangle your shit.
LAURA: Except the creatures that killed them are the little myceit.
MATT: They're so cute! Then all of a sudden, "Oh god, oh god!"
TALIESIN: I like your little gummy dozers.
TRAVIS: All right, guys, I'll see you later.
MATT: All right, see ya, buddy.
MARISHA: Bye.
