Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. (random hollering) Yeah! Before we get into our episode tonight, I believe our last episode of the year, let's get some announcements taken care of, beginning with a sponsorship from Incogni tonight. Sam, if you would please explain. 
SAM: Data brokers, Matt. Data brokers are collecting and trading your personal data without permission, but a new service called Incogni, it's true, will make them remove it. Incogni reaches out to data brokers, requests your personal data removal, and doesn't take no for an answer. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
SAM: They can help wipe your home address, court documents, and other personal information from sites that share them on the internet. To show you how it works, Taliesin will be playing the part of Incogni. And Liam will be a shady data broker. Guys, take it away. 
TALIESIN: (menacingly) Hey, creep. You have information about my client, Robbie Daymond. 
LIAM: Pfft. (NJ accent) Maybe I do, maybe I don't. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Robbie Daymond doesn't want anyone to know he was bedwetting up into his mid tweens and you are going to wipe that information from your database or else. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay! I'll delete it. I'll delete it, I swear! 
SAM: You see, that's how effective Incogni is by protecting your privacy. 
ROBBIE: Sorry, Sam, why is-- Why is my name in the scene? 
SAM: It's a dramatization, Robbie. It's not real. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
SAM: Incogni can also wipe your financial information. Taliesin and Liam, please demonstrate. 
TALIESIN: Word is you found out Robbie Daymond purchased a life-size Realdoll of Ryan Phillippe from a store called Cruel Intentions Fandom Depot. Well, you're going to forget you ever saw that. 
LIAM: I swear, I never saw that he actually purchased two Ryan Phillippes, one in sweaty PJs and the other in the towel he wore in "I Know What You Did Last Summer." (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Again, why am I being used as an example and it's Ryan Phillippe? (laughter) 
SAM: It's a dramatization, Robbie. It's a metaphor for how Incogni keeps your data safe. Now, in this next scene, we'll see how Incogni can eliminate Robbie Daymond's literal Social Security number from the-- 
ROBBIE: Okay, no, we're done. 
SAM: Fine. That's fine, too. Visit incogni.com/criticalrole and use code CriticalRole to get an exclusive 60% off an annual and family Incogni plan. That's incogni.com/criticalrole. Now, Matt, Robbie's social security number is... back to you. (laughter) 
MATT: Thank you, Sam, thank you, Incogni. I'm so sorry, Robbie. Marisha, you have an announcement to make. 
MARISHA: I do. You guys, did you know this is our last Critical Role episode for the year? (groaning) 
TRAVIS: It can't be! Not possible. 
MARISHA: What a year it's been! Next Thursday-- 
SAM: I thought you were going to recap the year. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Ready? Go. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's start January 1. Next Thursday, you can look forward to our Daggerheart Critmas Story live. (cheering) 
MATT: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Which will be available on Beacon with an exclusive Cooldown and the Critical Role Twitch and YouTube channels as well. But it's better on Beacon. But don't worry, (chuckles). 
LAURA: (whispering) It's better on Beacon. 
MARISHA: There will be plenty of content to hold you over over on Beacon. Check out our most recent Fireside Chat with this guy, Robbie Daymond. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
MARISHA: And a new episode of Narrative Telephone next Wednesday, plus new episodes of the Re-Slayers Take, Tales from the Stinky Dragon, and UNEND. 
SAM: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: UNEND. 
MARISHA: There's so much content. 
SAM: That's great exclusive content. 
MARISHA: It's great exclusive content. We'll be back with Campaign Three, episode 118 on Thursday, January 2nd after our short winter break. 
LAURA: That's if we don't all die tonight. 
MARISHA: That is correct. 
TRAVIS: That's true. 
MATT: All right, thank you, Marisha. Liam, you have an announcement. 
LIAM: Oh my gosh, I'm so excited. I'm going to keep it New Jersey. Our friends at Dark Horse Comics and Prime Video have released the first "The Legend of Vox Machina" graphic novel, "The Whitestone Chronicles, Volume 1: Ripley." 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LIAM: A prequel to the animated series, unveiling the origin story of Dr. Anna Ripley, written by Marieke Nijkamp with art by Tyler Walpole. But that's not all. The first-- 
SAM: Tyler's name sounds really good in a New Jersey accent. 
LIAM: The first art book for "The Legend of Vox Machina"-- 
TRAVIS: Let's go! Let's go! 
LIAM: -- is also available right now in both a standard and a deluxe edition! Authored by "Legend of Vox Machina" writer, Meredith Kecskemety, with fantastic season one and season two art from the Titmouse team. Look at this shit! Look at this fuckin' shit right here! Look at that. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Hey! 
ROBBIE: Hey! 
LIAM: We got the fuckin' Fey right there! Look at this lady, ah! 
ASHLEY: Can I see that, Taliesin? (laughter) Look at this! It's iridescence. 
LIAM: They're really beautiful books, we're so excited they're here. For more details on them at darkhorse.com on where you can get all of those new releases. 
TRAVIS: Forget about it. 
LIAM: Forget about it. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: It's so good. 
LIAM: Look at her. 
LAURA: I know. 
LIAM: Who wouldn't break the world for that lady? 
MATT: (chuckles) All right, all right, calm down. (laughter) 
MATT: I believe that concludes our announcements. 
TRAVIS: Oh no!

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So last we left off with this troop. As we return to Bells Hells, they had come back to the moon Ruidus, escorting or being escorted by, traveling with the hidden heroic group known as the Mighty Nein, who have since left on their portion of this plot to go and assail the Arx Creonum citadel that lies built into the Prime Pillar of this Ruidian capital city. As they shoved off on their part of the mission and you were left to prepare for yours, a sudden vision came to Imogen, her mother, seemingly saying her goodbye and trying to give you the strength to finish what you've started before she's gone. As you watched her essence being drained by Ludinus Da'leth, in a more modern reconstruction of his Quintessence Array, surrounded by other Exaltants holding her in place somewhere below. We return to you as that moment fades from your vision and you all still stand laying low within and near the core of the city Kreviris. 
LAURA: They found her out. 
ASHLEY: What? 
LAURA: They have my mama. Ludinus, he's made another harness. He's-- He's-- He's using her, he's absorbing her. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
MARISHA: Let's go then. 
LAURA: How long does it take, Chet? 
TRAVIS: For a creature? It's, oh-- 
LAURA: We have to go. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: It was happening as I was watching. 
MARISHA: I think it takes an hour. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It takes an hour. 
LAURA: We can get there. 
MARISHA: We can get there. 
ASHLEY: We can get there, we can get there we can get there. 
MARISHA: As long as he hasn't it souped it up and made a better version that goes quicker, so let's go. I'm just saying, let's go. 
TRAVIS: It's not a trap. 
TALIESIN: It's clearly a trap. I'm not saying we don't go, I'm saying it's clearly a trap. 
MARISHA: We're going there anyway. 
TALIESIN: Which means when we go in, let's know that they're expecting us. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Let's be smart about it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: She said he knows that he-- 
LAURA: He realized she was working against him. 
TRAVIS: And it was real? 
LAURA: It felt real. 
MARISHA: It's not an illusion? 
LIAM: Just starting? 
LAURA: Yeah, they were holding her down, I saw her falling apart. 
TRAVIS: Then fuck it, we go. Yeah! 
ASHLEY: How do we know it's an hour? That's our harness, right? 
MARISHA: I know but that's the thing, if he made a better version. 
TRAVIS: It's true. 
LAURA: So then we go now. 
MARISHA: So we go now, but let's not pretend like we have an hour. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
LAURA: Let's go then! 
TRAVIS: How do we navigate this? 
LAURA: It's on the other side of the-- Fuck-- 
TRAVIS: Kreviris? 
LAURA: Yeah, on the other side of the tower, the core. 
MARISHA: The Arx Creonum. 
LAURA: The Arx-- 
ASHLEY: (babbling) 
LIAM: Flux capacitor. 
MATT: You got it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Arx Creonum. 
LAURA: The path down is on the other side. We got to go. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
LIAM: I like how long Matt's letting you twist in the wind. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's like, "That's fine." 
TRAVIS: I mean, they're all winners. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah, I'm taking notes, all this shit's going into the next game. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, well, you are still under the effects of the Seeming spell that was left upon you by the Mighty Nein. That should last quite a while, so you're all still currently under the illusion of being various civilians of Kreviris itself. Is there anything else you wish to do before you head out into the partially-evacuated city and likely the side of the city that has been mostly evacuated? 
MARISHA: Even though we've got these disguises, it seems like they're ushering all of the civilians the other direction. 
TALIESIN: Then we have to not be civilians. 
SAM: Wait, so we're still under Seeming, is that right? 
LIAM: We are. We covered in Seeming-- 
TRAVIS: Matty-- 
LIAM: -- but we can't alter anything. 
TRAVIS: Has anybody of station been holding anything that would denote importance or office or station or a pass, or a staff or anything on them that would be like "Get out of this person's way if they walk by?" 
MATT: Sure, make a history check for me. 
TRAVIS: All right. 17. 
MATT: 17. I mean, there are different types of armor that you've seen, that connotate in its level of decoration and quality of its make, stationed within the hierarchy of Kreviris and the general Ruidian society. You've seen a few that seem to be at the head of other groups of general soldiers. Less so on the surface, but more so in the core of the city. You can see there's intricate craft scrolling at the end of their mantles and armor. Sometimes they have these-- A lot of the leaders of various troops, what you imagine the captains of larger groups have these long strips of tooled leather that has all manner of designs in it. The brief time that some of you had come face to face with the general of the Ruidian army, he had multiple of these dangling from his armor, from Cruth's armor. But you do know that those bands, those hanging straps across some of the pieces of armor seem to carry some social weight. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: We can make another illusion if we can put one of us at a higher station who clearly should be here, then they can speak for the group, they can usher us through no one needs to know who we are. 
LAURA: Did Caleb not make any of us look higher station? 
LIAM: Widogast made Reilorans and Bormodo for size, but never specified. 
LAURA: Okay. Well, then we have to make do unless we can find some armor along the way. 
LIAM: Yeah, I mean I think sneaking through the city, he probably wouldn't have thought that they should look like the elite upper echelon. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I mean, I've got Silent Image. I think a few of us have Silent Image if we need to make something. 
TALIESIN: Just might be-- 
TRAVIS: Or Minor Illusion. 
LIAM: Maybe, yeah, you could Minor Illusion doctor up. 
TRAVIS: Maybe. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Silent Image is a 1st-level spell and has some fair limitations just so you know. It's useful, but-- 
TALIESIN: I don't think you can travel either. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Okay, let's do it, we got to go. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right, just so we're aware, I'm keeping tabs on two different clocks as you travel towards the possible encounter with Ludinus and your mother. 
LIAM: But why, though? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LAURA: To see how much time has passed and see if we can save her. 
ROBBIE: I thought we were in fantasy time. 
TRAVIS: Make us earn this. 
MATT: Based on choices, based on successes, based on failures, I'll be marking one or the other and you will, in time, maybe discover what one or both are about. 
LAURA: Jeez Louise. 
MARISHA: We don't know which one is the dead mom clock? Don't know which one? Okay. 
MATT: You don't. 
LIAM: That's my least favorite clock. 
ROBBIE:: The clocks are ticking. One way or the other. 
TALIESIN: We've been asked to do a thing with a time limit and we-- 
LAURA: We need to go. 
TALIESIN: Got to make sure we do what we need to do. 
MATT: Okay, so who is leading the trek to try and locate and head towards the entryway to this secondary tunnel? 
LIAM: Well-- 
LAURA: I can. I can do it, I can try. Try to use my pull to Predathos and see if I can sense where I should go. 
SAM: I have Locate Object, but we don't know what-- 
LAURA: What the object is unless it's the other harness. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: You did see it. 
LIAM: You saw it. 
ASHLEY: Can I try to assist? 
LAURA: But you would know vaguely what it looks like as long as it didn't lead us to our harness. 
TALIESIN: You could put the image in his head and then he would know exactly what it looks like if you saw it in your vision. 
SAM: I don't want you around my head, though. 
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sakes, don't be a baby about it. 
LAURA: In your head you hear: Too fucking bad. 
SAM: (slaps) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: All right, I don't know do you want to try that? 
LAURA: I just did! 
SAM: (groans) I see it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Your vision was strongly on your mother and you saw details of people and Ludinus around you, I'm going to have you roll a perception check to see if you were to pick up enough details of the harness to have it be strong enough for this particular step. 
LAURA: Perception, six. 
MATT: (sighs) 
LAURA: Not so much? 
MATT: I'm going to say you recognize the funnel in the back because you have a Quintessence Array, but the details on this one, to be able to draw the information from somebody else's vision is pretty tough. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: Let me check in on the spell. 
LAURA: Oh, what about the locket? I gave her the locket. 
SAM: What locket? 
LAURA: Two halves make the greater whole. 
SAM: Have I ever seen this thing before? 
LAURA: No, but it's that strongly in my head. 
MATT: That is strongly in your head. Do you want to do that? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Good idea. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: It's beautiful in its craftsmanship, and it's meaningful, too. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I like the chain. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's lovely, isn't it? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: It's silver. 
SAM: I can see. 
LAURA: Yeah, obviously. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay, so you cast the spell and begin to concentrate. 
SAM: Yes, I will do that. 
MARISHA: What's the range on? 
SAM: 1,000 feet. 
LIAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: So maybe wait 'til we get closer. 
TALIESIN: It also lasts an hour, right? 
SAM: It lasts 10 minutes. 
TALIESIN: Okay, then we wait 'til-- 
LAURA: Wait a little bit, let's get further in the city. 
SAM: How do we know if we're closer? 
LAURA: Because we know what's on the other side of this fucking core. 
SAM: All right, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait. 
ROBBIE: You've been there before in your previous travel. Do you have a general idea of where we're going? 
LAURA: We know that the tunnel that they've opened up is on the other side of this core. 
ASHLEY: Where we went to with Ira when we tried to blow it up? 
MATT: That was the previous tunnel that you had destroyed. This is a new one that's been built one since then to continue to head towards the core of the Prime Pillar. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to walk up. Everyone taller is Reilorans? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. I'm going to walk up to the front to Imogen and put my hand in between her shoulder blades and push her forward to lead us to go, and I'm going to go with you. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: What's our landscape right now, where we are? 
MATT: So right now you are sitting somewhere deep in The Villums, which is a dense residential and in some ways industrial portion of this city. The clustered walkways and numerous buildings around you pile up at odd heights and you can see the Prime Pillar still glowing high and large and the sky, pulsing slowly as the energy seems to flow. You are, I mean, the streets are predominantly empty other than the occasional civilians with their last belongings heading out towards what would be the equivalent of an eastern direction, if we're looking at an overhead map. That's where you saw the majority of the busyness of the folk of the city when you had that brief overhead view upon your arrival from the old Volition pass house. 
LIAM: But now we're not above, we're in it, so-- 
MATT: Correct, you're in the city and you've been hiding in one of these additional hideaway homes that the Volition had used and now they've all gone off on their mission. So you are in a fairly dense part of the city that's not directly against the core of the pillar, but maybe about a 10-minute walk from it to get there. If you're being careful and stealthy about it, probably a little slower, but up to you guys. So are you going to search for this just using your connection with Predathos, using your connection with your mother, trying to tap into your Ruidusborn essence or are you trying to? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That. 
MATT: So for that, I'll say roll a d20 and add your charisma modifier. 
ASHLEY: Can I help assist in any way since I have a little bit-- 
MATT: Because you are Ruidusborn, and for the record, now that you've gotten this deep into the city, when the rest of you have a moment to sit, especially with this moment of tension flaring, you can see this ever so faint tether of red energy that drifts between Imogen and Fearne pretty much at all times. It's hard to see at a distance, but when you're sitting with them for as long as you have been, when you look past them, you can see it gently drift there. 
MARISHA: Can see their aura. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: (sneezes) 
LAURA: 26. 
ASHLEY: The aura makes me sneeze. 
LIAM: I'm going to pad alongside Imogen and look and listen and make sure that nothing springs out at us, just any enemies. 
MATT: Sure, we'll get to that in just a second. 26, you added your charisma modifier or your saving through over that? 
LAURA: Just kidding. 21. 
MATT: 21. 
LAURA: Thank you, sorry. 
MATT: Okay, got you. No worries at all. So as both of you take a moment to focus in, you let your consciousness expand beyond just your physical bodies for a moment, which is a very easy, familiar place for you. Something that you are still getting used to, but because you're doing it together, you both share a space, and as you do, you begin to feel the pulse of the Prime Pillar, the glass itself, the way the energy flows, and it has a, from below and up flow to it. and it has a, from below and up flow to it. (slow pulses) And you feel it move through you. As you do, you begin to feel that pull below ever so faintly. First time for you, maybe, but strong enough for you that, that sense of on the edge of toppling, and you feel, as part of that tug, the tug is also trying to draw you there the best way that it can, and as it does that, you feel the direction, like something's pulling on your clavicle and slightly dragging you in this direction, in the direction of the pillar. And you're like, "That'll help us get there." So you follow that? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: The rest of you follow suit? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: No. 
TRAVIS: Dang it. 
LAURA: Why? 
TRAVIS: I feel like it's the bad choice wheel. 
MARISHA: Or is it a good choice wheel? 
TRAVIS: What is a good direction, left or right? (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Don't make us choose. 
ASHLEY: Just tell us. 
MATT: So you begin to beeline with your troop through the streets, through the alleys. Are you going directly or are you going stealthily? 
LAURA: What do you guys think? 
SAM: We have an hour, but it could be less. 
LAURA: So just go? 
SAM: We just go. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Just project that unearned authority and we should be fine. 
MARISHA: I guess, let's not get in trouble. 
SAM: If anyone tries to stop us, we bop them on the head and keep going. 
LIAM: We're a bunch of aliens hurrying through an alien city, Again, I'm trying to look and listen to anticipate any problems. 
TRAVIS: There's urgency here, it's not like people are relaxed anyway. 
MATT: Yeah, there is a palpable intensity to the people you see that still exist in the city. Many of them are keeping a very strong eye probably for an imminent Volition attack. So you rolled what perception? 
LIAM: A natural 20. (gawking) 
LIAM: And a one, let's see if I get two 20s. 
MATT: Just to be a dick? 
LAURA: I just saw the one. (laughter) 
LAURA: And I was like: Oh shit. 
TALIESIN: You rolling a d12? 
LIAM: It's an instrument. Oh, that is a-- 
TALIESIN: That's a d12. 
LIAM: That's a d12. So the 12 got a one. 
MATT: Okay, I was like, "How'd you get a 20 on a 12?" 
LIAM: That one's just a 12, but I got-- 
LAURA: You got a Dorian 20. 
LIAM: A Dorian 20. (fawning) 
TRAVIS: Barf. (laughter) 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Well-- The inspiration guiding your eye is true as you begin to trudge into the open walkways and the massive streets that carve their way through The Villums, trying to keep to the side. Are you taking more of an import versus a civilian position, right? 
LAURA: Do we look like civilians? 
MATT: You look like middle ground civilians. The illusion did not carry any sort of air of import. 
MARISHA: Authoritay. 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Authority? Do we try to pitch that we're hurrying to pitch in around the city? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: If you walk like you belong somewhere, almost no one will ever stop you. 
SAM: Hold a clipboard. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Do we have a clipboard? Does anyone have a clipboard? 
SAM: Let's mime clipboard. 
ASHLEY: Just scream. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Minor Illusion! 
MARISHA: Minor Illusion clipboard. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: But it also rolls down into-- 
SAM: Oh, I have Minor-- 
TRAVIS: -- a hard case looking scroll. 
SAM: -- Illusion Also. 
TRAVIS: Like a hard case scroll with a ribbon on it and a wax seal. 
MARISHA: It's a good idea. 
SAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Ooh, good, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Only opened by-- 
SAM: Mine is one of those-- 
TALIESIN: Where do they get wax up here? 
SAM: -- clipboards that was clear because I always wanted one of those as a kid. 
MARISHA: Those were always the coolest. The clear ones? 
MATT: Great. 
TALIESIN: I have no response for that. 
MARISHA: I pull out the Pipe of Remembrance to look more distinguished. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: My fucking pipe. Okay. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: At least it's getting use. 
MARISHA: Does it look-- (laughter) 
MATT: Following-- 
MARISHA: This is my most heroic moment! 
MATT: -- Imogen's lead, like a bloodhound, trying to remain as unfocused on your surroundings, so you can keep that essence of where it's pulling you strongly and at the forefront of your mind, you move from street to street to alley to street. Orym, keeping a close eye out to help guide and avoid clusters of soldiers that are heading to meet off with your path and temporarily stopping the troop to let them pass before continuing onward. It doesn't take you terribly long, under 10 minutes or so to carve through the streets with both of those rolls, to avoid being noticed upon reaching near the opposite end of the Prime Pillar. It is a massive, central part of this city. And, thankfully, your expediency allows you to get mostly in that direction within a short period of time. But you can also see where you are being drawn towards. There are a number of walls that have been built and constructed. It looks like you can just make out, with your perception roll, not at the base of the pillar itself, almost like either they've carved an additional rock tunnel to coincide the exterior of it that heads down below. This massive hole that is burrowed into a piece of rock that rises up against the pillar. This might actually push into the pillar or at least continue down below alongside it. But it is about a 20, 25 foot wide arch that looks like it's been burrowed in, into shadow below. You can see there's risen parts of red rock around and number of other Reiloran and various Ruidian soldiers are walking around and keeping an eye and a pace on the ground. 
LAURA: Is anybody going into it? 
MATT: At the moment? No. You do see flanking the entryway on each side are two Thought Eaters that drift, their arms crossed in the front, as they glow and float. In the center of it, acting like a goalie, you see a massive armored Reiloran Juggernaut with two glass blades sheathed on its sides. It sits there for a second and then yawns and keeps an eye out there as other soldiers slowly crisscross. You get the sense that it's sparse here. There isn't a lot of density to watching this space, which could mean that, well, for one, a lot of the army has been pushed towards the Bloody Bridge and is heading towards the imminent invasion of Exandria, if you will. So what's here is sparse but likely, fairly capable. 
LAURA: Have the explosions gone off-- 
MATT: Not yet. 
LAURA: -- that Mighty Nein was setting? 
MATT: Not yet. 
MARISHA: That'll be good when that happens. 
LAURA: Yeah, if it would happen soon. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
LAURA: It should be happening any minute, because-- 
MARISHA: It's got to be happening, literally, any minute. Because that was one of the first things that happened after they left. 
LAURA: They were above us, right? They were heading up the core to shoot into the tower? We're at the base of the tower now? 
MATT: Well, you're not quite sure-- 
LAURA: We're on the other side. 
MATT: -- where they went, necessarily. They went to a-- 
ASHLEY: Ugh. God. 
MATT: It comes for us all, Ashley. 
ASHLEY: Cool. (laughter) Cool. 
LAURA: What? What? 
MARISHA: But you-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: -- look good. 
ASHLEY: No. 
LAURA: Oh, look at you! 
MATT: That's some Tiger Beat shit. 
SAM: It's impossible to find-- 
LAURA: That is Tiger Beat. 
SAM: -- a bad picture of her. 
MATT: It's true. 
ASHLEY: That is not true. 
LIAM: It is true. It is true. 
ASHLEY: I can provide some. 
LAURA: Why are they all on an orange shirt, though? 
SAM: They're not. They're all different colors. 
ASHLEY: They're different colors. 
LAURA: Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: They're not. That is a burnt orange. 
MATT: Yeah, fair. 
MARISHA: It looks better with your skin tone, though. 
SAM: It's the colors that her shirt was last campaign. 
LIAM: Aw. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS: I'm going to barf. 
MATT: So you-- (laughter) 
MATT: Carefully situate yourselves within visual distance of the outer wall that's been constructed and it looks like the stone has been risen up to create the wall. Not smoothed or well-chiseled, by any means. Probably as part of a ramshackle resort given the expedience in which they had to rebuild this entire burrowing endeavor. You wait 30 seconds more. A minute more. They're still walking their patterns. Do you want to wait for the detonation? 
LAURA: God! 
LIAM: What are our options here? We can either try to take these guys down fast and keep going. Maybe you could bullshit your way through? 
MARISHA: We have to walk past the Juggernauts, you were saying? 
MATT: Well, the entryway where this burrowed tunnel that they're very clearly guarding-- 
MARISHA: They're standing guard. It's two of them? 
MATT: There are two Thought Eaters, one to each side and one Juggernaut that is heavily armored with glass blades sheathed at its side. So they're kind of-- 
TRAVIS: We chance it. 
MATT: All three of them-- 
TRAVIS: We chance it. 
MATT: -- guarding at the front. 
LAURA: We have our red robes, though. Don't we? 
SAM: Red robes. Red robes. 
TRAVIS: Well, we're covered-- 
LIAM: Red robes. 
TRAVIS: -- covered in Seeming. 
LAURA: I know we're covered in Seeming. 
LIAM: Red robes! 
LAURA: But if we don't have the Seeming, can some of us drop Seeming and some of us have robes on? 
MARISHA: So that we look like we've captured-- 
LAURA: Part of the-- 
TRAVIS: Ruby Vanguard? 
LAURA: Yeah, part of the Ruby Vanguard. Because I mean, it's the Exaltants that are heading down there. Right? 
MARISHA: Mm. 
LAURA: So if we base the deception in a truth, it should help us, right? 
SAM: I don't think-- 
LIAM: I think Caleb has to release Seeming. 
SAM: Yeah, I don't think we can drop Seeming. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't think-- 
LAURA: Really? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah, it gets stuck on you. 
MATT: I'd say if an ally who has the spell effect on you wanted to drop it on themself for whatever reason, I wouldn't be against that. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: It's more like feeling that magical tether inside and dispelling it internally. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: I would allow that. 
TRAVIS: We have to find a spot to change. The robes are in the bag. 
TALIESIN: It's a good option amongst bad options. We could open up the hole really quickly, let someone hop in, use it as a changing room. 
SAM: Sure. We could also-- Are we luring them out or--? 
LAURA: Just trying to get past? 
SAM: We're just trying to bullshit our way past? 
TRAVIS: I think it's bullshit because if we have things that are meant for Ludinus and we're taking it to the cage. 
SAM: Sure. Okay, let's try it. 
TRAVIS: They could be the ones that will reap-- 
SAM: But it has to be you because you can talk to them. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: So, I'm still a Reiloran? Okay. 
SAM: I guess. Right? Because we can't talk to them. 
ASHLEY: Or we go balls to the walls and you're yourself. That's a bad idea, I was just throwing something out there. 
SAM: That's not bad. 
TRAVIS: We've used it before. 
TALIESIN: There's no good idea right now. 
MARISHA: You being your mom, basically, or trying to pretend you're your mom? 
SAM: You could surrender. Just go out there and say, "I'm here to surrender to my mom," and they'll take you in and we can follow them! 
ROBBIE: The opening to this entrance, this tunnel, it's not covert at all. It can be seen from-- If we scrap-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: -- everybody in the area is seeing it? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: It's not covered. It is in an open walkway. Probably a good-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: -- 50, 60 feet of space between where you are now, to the exterior wall and then from the wall to the rocky base that eventually, the Prime Pillar emerges from, as the incredibly-- What's the word I'm looking for? The vertigo-inducing scope and scale of the Prime Pillar, from that far base, goes above it. That's about 120 to 150 feet from where the wall is built. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, I can try and Phantasmal Force him and make him think he sees something that he doesn't, to pull him away. What are the Thought Eaters? They're creatures, right? 
LIAM: They're Reilorans. 
MATT: The Thought Eaters are Reilorans. They tend to be the ones that are more honed for mental prowess, psychic and psionic prowess. 
ROBBIE: Are they going to pick up-- 
TRAVIS: And these are clearly Thought Eaters? 
LIAM: Yeah, that's how he described them. 
MATT: They are drifting and adorned in-- There isn't a uniform. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea. I take that back. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: I know it hurts to wait but-- 
TRAVIS: We also don't know how long we'd be waiting. 
LAURA and ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: If we're going to try and push past, having enemy number one as a prisoner and some documents just for Ludinus' eyes-- 
SAM: Let's do it. 
TRAVIS: I'm still pushing it. 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: Let's do it. 
TALIESIN: Worst case-- 
LAURA: Then I can drop the Seeming. 
TALIESIN: -- is that we just beat the fuck out of them if it doesn't work. 
MARISHA: But the only problem is we can't speak to them. She's the only one who can-- 
LAURA: I'm the only one that-- 
MARISHA: -- speak in their heads. 
LAURA: Then maybe Fearne drops it and we have Fearne. They know her, too. 
MARISHA: It's true. 
TRAVIS: Will they see your tether? 
SAM: No. 
TALIESIN: We can see it. 
ASHLEY: Would we know that? 
MATT: You're uncertain if they would be able to notice it. 
ROBBIE: Ah! Yeah! (laughter) 
MATT: It's only been noticeable by your troop, after spending stationary time together. 
MARISHA: A lot of time. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: It's grown brighter since you've arrived in Kreviris. 
LAURA: Maybe you stand right behind me. 
ASHLEY: Yeah but if you're an-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: -- Exaltant, Exaltants hear. 
TRAVIS: Yup. 
ASHLEY: It would still show for them. 
TRAVIS: Yup. 
LAURA: Right, so you drop it. I'll be a Reiloran. 
ASHLEY: I like this idea. All right, I'm your prisoner, baby. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm your prisoner. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! Do what you will with me. 
SAM: You going to rough her up a little bit? 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: You want me to just-- 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: No? 
ASHLEY: Do you want to hit me? (laughter) 
SAM: Kind of. (laughter) 
SAM: Kind of. Kind of. 
ASHLEY: No, no. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: No. This has to look real. 
LAURA: All right, then let's go. 
MARISHA: All right, let's do it. 
LIAM: Wait, so is the crowd of us going up? 
LAURA: Yeah, let's just go. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: We're trying to get down-- 
MARISHA: Escorting. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We should get in formation, though, four by four, two by two. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wait, would I be tied up or anything? 
LAURA: Flying V. 
SAM: Of course. 
ASHLEY: Flying V. Flying V. Flying V. Love the flying V. 
SAM: Yeah, tie her up. Someone got some rope or something? 
ASHLEY: I don't know, would they-- 
LAURA: I don't know. Do we need rope? 
ASHLEY: No, I'm outnumbered, anyway. 
LAURA: We have mental control over her. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Let's go. 
ASHLEY: Am I acting like I'm mentally controlled? 
SAM: I think you should, yeah. Play it up a little bit. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Just put your hands behind your back. 
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly. Just be like, "Oh, no!" 
LAURA: All right, we'll walk around. 
LIAM: I'm going to go subservient Bormodo next to you-- 
LAURA: Sure, sure, sure. 
LIAM: -- so that you've got a sword right by you. 
MARISHA: All right, we're in formation. (claps) 
MATT: Okay. So what is your formation? Just so I'm aware. 
LAURA: Oh, jeebies. 
ROBBIE: Oh come on. 
TALIESIN: Two lines. 
LIAM: Are you familiar-- 
TALIESIN: Two lines. 
LAURA: With the flying V. 
MARISHA: Flying V. 
MATT: I am, yes. So with Fearne at the front? 
LIAM: Yeah, so flying V. 
LAURA: No, with me at the front. And Fearne-- 
ASHLEY: I'm behind. 
LAURA: Yeah, behind. She's in the middle of the V. Everybody else is a V and Fearne is in the middle of the V. 
MATT: Right, okay. Who's to the right and left of Fearne? 
ROBBIE: I'll flank opposite Orym. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think I'll go-- 
MATT: Yes, I'm familiar with the flying V. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, Laudna behind me. 
TRAVIS: Emilio Estevez is my hero! 
TALIESIN: And I'll go behind and then maybe Braius sitting to block her from going in the middle. 
MARISHA: That's good. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, right there. 
TRAVIS: Chet will be the caboose! 
MARISHA: We'll pyramid it. Yeah. There we go. 
MATT: You are the flying arrow. 
ASHLEY: Yeah yeah, like it, like it. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: That's fine. 
ASHLEY: Okay, cool. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: We're just a clump. It's just a clump, guys. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: We're just a clump. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Just the tip. 
MATT: You all set yourselves up. You drop your illusion and-- 
LIAM: Are those geese? 
MATT: How do you bind? 
LAURA: Wait, what is your dad's name? 
MARISHA: Sorrowlord-- 
ASHLEY: Sorrowlord Zathuda. 
TRAVIS: Zathuda. 
ROBBIE: Zathuda. 
MARISHA: -- Zathuda. 
ROBBIE: Zathuda. 
LAURA: Zathuda. 
MATT: Athion Zathuda. 
LAURA: Athion Zathuda? 
TRAVIS: Nobody calls that bitch by his first name. 
MARISHA:Yeah. We're not on first name basis. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
TRAVIS: He dead. 
MATT: You don't have to use it. Kind of just thought-- (laughter) 
MATT: I was just offering lore info. 
ROBBIE: You killed his prized NPC, can't even say his first name. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We'll do what we want. 
MATT: It hurts. Hurts a little, but it's okay. I'll move past it. 
TRAVIS: Summon the dragon. Summon the dragon! 
MATT: (laughs) Yup. 
LIAM: You built callous up long ago. 
MATT: That's true. Long ago. (laughs) So, Fearne, you said you're bound by some--? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: What are you bound by? 
ASHLEY: I am bound-- 
LAURA: By your marsupial pouch. 
ASHLEY: -- by my ribbons. I was bound by my ribbons. 
MATT: By ribbons. Okay. 
LIAM: Pull my ouch out wrap it around myself. 
LAURA: My pouch around me. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Before we go in, I will say to you, Imogen, This is very important to you and remember, your family is important to all of us. I'll give her Inspiration, 1d6. 
LAURA: Oh, thank you. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Okay. Something. 
LAURA: It's something. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to give you Guidance. 
LAURA: Thanks. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: With that, you all step from the nearby structures and shadow and begin to walk briskly across the gap that leads to the exterior wall and the opening which at the moment, looks like the two patrolling guards that walk back and forth are-- You wait for a moment where they're both separated. You step through the wall's entryway, into the wider, opening gap where you can see there are some distant battlements on each side. Other soldiers are sitting and resting off, keeping an eye up above. And beeline towards this entryway. Two of the nearby soldiers that were part of that patrol, notice your rather large cluster of figures entering the space and turn to begin to briskly approach, while the two Thought Eaters drift a few inches into the air, acknowledging your presence. They both look towards the Juggernaut, who places his hands onto the edges of his blades upon your approach. So now you have two soldiers, the two Thought Eaters and the Juggernaut all kind of-- 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Looking upon your troop, as you approach. 
TRAVIS: Not one pair, not two pair, but four warriors. We got four warriors. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's five! That makes five! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: "Top Gun." (laughter) 
SAM: We know. We know. 
ASHLEY: The pause. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Do you like that movie? 
ASHLEY: "Top Gun." 
TRAVIS: A little bit. (laughter) 
MATT: The right hand Thought Eater drifts from the top of his pedestal, where he was keeping watch. While the other one hems down below and waits, keeping about 15 feet back from the one to the right. That one, you can likely tell, based on just that physicality, maybe has a little more presence or station amongst those that are currently here. The Juggernaut patiently sits back and keeps its dark, shark-like eyes upon you. The Thought Eater begins to approach about 60 feet from where you are before you hear in your head, Imogen, "What is it you bring here?" 
LAURA: An escaped Exaltant. Called by Ludinus. She wanted to escape her duty. 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MARISHA: Come on. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! Nicely done, let's go! 
ROBBIE: Yeah yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to put on a show, I'm trying to-- 
LIAM: Pick a good one. 
LAURA: I know. 
LIAM: A real good one. 
ASHLEY: This is a disaster! 
SAM: I'm going to kick her in the back. 
ASHLEY: Ow! 
MATT: So you're aiding her with this? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay, so you can roll one more time. 
ASHLEY: How dare you! 
LAURA: Oh, I get to-- 
MATT: Well, she was aiding you with this. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
LAURA: Advantage. Okay. Okay, well, I'll take the other one. 
LIAM: Was that a one? It's not because I'm by you. 
LAURA: Oh wow! Okay! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
MATT: Halflings, man. 
LAURA: Natural 20! (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: (screams) 
ASHLEY: Why? Why? Why, though? (exclaiming) 
LAURA: Maybe it's good stuff! 
TRAVIS: It could be a counter! Which means we can't roll good things on the balance! 
LIAM: He's actually adding stuff to a grocery list. 
MATT: Oh yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: I'm getting this on the way home tonight. Oh, Taco Bell sounds nice, let's go get that. It cocks its head towards you. And shifts back to you. You hear in your head, Fearne, "And what makes you so special?" 
ASHLEY: I'm not! I just-- I mean, I am so special. 
MARISHA: I'm that thicc bitch. 
ASHLEY: I don't know! 
LAURA: This is Zathuda's child. 
ASHLEY: I don't know. Yes, Zathuda is my father. 
MATT: "A prime prize, then. I think he would be rather pleased of your acquisition. What of the rest of our compatriots?" 
ASHLEY: I'm not telling. 
MATT: You don't hear it. It's in her head. (laughs) Oh, you know what? No. They're expanding consciousness to you. Because it's more fun that way. A little more fun that way. (laughter) 
LAURA: The rest of our team, formed by Ludinus. 
MATT: "Her compatriots." 
LAURA: Oh. Escaped. 
MATT: "So then we shall keep an eye out for them." 
ASHLEY: Lucky bitches got away! 
TRAVIS: (wheezes) 
SAM: I kick her again. 
ASHLEY: Ow! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: The Juggernaut at the back is like-- 
LAURA: Calm it the fuck down! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll dial it down. 
MATT: "You don't have to kick her." (laughter) You hear in your head. 
SAM: Does he say that? Oh. (laughter) I just look embarrassed. (laughter) 
MATT: The Reiloran goes, "We appreciate your aid. We'll take her to Ludinus ourselves." 
MARISHA: (huffs) 
ROBBIE: (groans) 
MATT: And it extends its hand this way, and you feel this pull on your wrists forward. 
MARISHA: It's always the way it goes! 
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Shit! 
SAM: Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! 
MATT: (explosion) 
TRAVIS: Oh! (shouting) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: A massive detonation, followed (explosion) by another one rocks the interior of this cavern. Flame and shrapnel begins to spray out from the opposite side as dust and smoke pours out from the opposite end of the Prime Pillar, filling the upper cavern- scape of this space. The echoing sound of the explosion bounces around inside causing this horrible, horrible blasting ring in all of your ears. You watch all the soldiers communally turn and look, the light reflecting briefly off of their various bits of armor and their face adornments. At which point, suddenly panicked looks start going around as silent commands are being thrown psychically between different Reilorans, and you watch all the various soldiers begin to gather up and rush over to see what has happened. They begin to station up at this point. What are you doing? 
LAURA: I'll look at the Thought Eater that was talking to us. We'll move forward with her. 
MATT: Go, go! Quick! (whooshes) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No, no, no! 
LAURA: Shut up! Go! (laughter) 
MATT: You watch as the two Thought Eaters glide off and begin to scoot around, heading towards it to get a perspective of the Arx Creonum. 
ASHLEY: I'm trying, just keeping the bit. (laughter) 
MATT: The Juggernaut-- 
ASHLEY: I'm scared! 
SAM: I kick her again. 
MATT: -- pulls its two blades out and begins to jog past you all, trying to follow up from there. Going, trying to keep a visual on this. As it comes by, it kicks you in the knee a little bit. 
SAM: Ugh! 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
SAM: He was right. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: We were doing a bit! 
MATT: "Prisoner or not, be respectful." 
TRAVIS: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: I like him! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm glad we didn't kill him. I'm glad he's-- 
LIAM: He's got to die. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: He's about to die. 
ASHLEY: He's got to go. 
LAURA: I hope he lasts. I hope him and Gaz become best friends. 
MARISHA: He's the one who eats shit on the ball bearings. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah, that is the one. (laughter) 
MATT: At this point now, dozens of feskuls that were flying in the air or were currently grappled to parts of the cavern in shadow dislodge and start flying, and you hear the shrieks (shrieks) echoing throughout the chamber. This city has suddenly become a war site. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: You can hear the sounds of also distant explosions and bits of rock falling from the ceiling, from the sheer immensity of the detonation. As you're stepping inside the cavern, you can hear pieces of the, probably, barely loosened bits of rock on the high end. It took that long to fall from the top of the cavern before-- 
LIAM: Dang. 
MATT: (impact) Hitting the ground with a heavy crack, dust being kicked up around, as you step through the entranceway to this tunnel and hear the muffled sound of distant action and conflict begin to get quieter and quieter. Now-- 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MATT: -- you have entered the beginnings of this secondary tunnel. You now get to figure out how to navigate these caverns and tunnels to try and stay on the tail of the Ruby Vanguard. 
LAURA: Maybe now you can use your Locate Amulet. 
SAM: I could try. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Lead you on that path. 
TRAVIS: As as a precursor while he is doing that, can I give a sniff, wolf nose, and see if it picks up anything that's familiar or that would divine one route from the other? 
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Okay, can I use advantage because of the (mumbles)? 
MATT: Yep, you can. 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
MARISHA: Hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina. 
TRAVIS: Double natural 18s for, it was a perception check? 20. 
MATT: 20. That's great! Okay. 
SAM: All right, I'll try to locate the object as well. 
MATT: Okay, so you take a moment. Focus on the image of this locket that you placed within Braius's mind, and as you do the spell finds no purchase on it. 
SAM: It's all right. We're just not close. 
MATT: Which at least lets you know that they're further than the range of that spell. So you may have to travel quite a bit. 
LAURA: Oh god! 
MATT: You don't know how far down this is or how far down where they're going and where they are might be. But you do know they've spoken in the past of heading towards the core. 
LIAM: Core. 
LAURA: How long has it been since the vision? It's been-- ♪ It's been-- ♪ 
MATT: Roughly 15. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (to the tune of "One Week") ♪ 15 minutes ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: 15 or so minutes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But as you step into this chamber, you can see now it doesn't take too long for the Prime Pillar itself, now exposed on the left hand side of this tunnel. You can see the extremely dense glass pulsing, giving you a little bit of light. You can see now, as the tunnel progresses down in a fairly steady incline, elements of the wall, this tunnel has been dug alongside, almost spiraling around the pillar as it goes, breaking the rock to use it as a light source. Otherwise, it would be pitch black down here. There are no brazers, there are no torches, there are no glowing crystal lanterns that you've seen so far, just the pulsing light of the occasionally exposed window to the Prime Pillar lighting it up, and as it does, the entire tunnel, as you progress brightens. it then falls to shadow and then brightens again, the actual tunnel itself almost feels like it's breathing as you continue to descend deeper, deeper within. You trying to keep a sense. This tunnel is pretty one note, and following it along the way, you don't see much in the ways of any diversions. The occasional alcove off to the side you go and investigate quickly and see that this was probably a rest place where a couple of tossed aside tools that were part of this dig, though, you're not quite sure what they do. There aren't pickaxes necessarily, but you see some long poles or pipes and things, they had some sort of mechanical purpose that some of them bent, like they were damaged in the process and discarded off to these alcoves. But no sign of any immediate Reiloran present within this tunnel, which means they are probably far below in the process of digging, or they've already dug. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Hmm. 
MATT: Continuing to push below, you do notice a familiar smell. This, at first you pick up, (sniffs) it's adjacent to the faintest, a urine-type smell, and you remember it being not dissimilar from the smell of the breath of the avadons that were hunting the arrival of the Bloody Bridge. It's about that time that you can hear-- (animalistic panting) 
LAURA: Oh wow! 
MATT: Things that were deeper in the tunnel are now being called up to investigate the source of the detonation. So, all of you stand here in the middle of this, maybe, I'd say right now, 25, 30 foot wide tunnel. 
TRAVIS: It's a burrow, right? 
MATT: Yeah, it's burrowed through. You hear, now that you point it out, the steadily increasing volume of avadon-like creatures approaching. What would you like to do? 
LAURA: Wait! Wait! Avadons. Avadons. 
MATT: Avadons are the-- 
LIAM: The dog thing. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but there was a place they liked to be scritched. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: That's right. 
SAM: We're going to just Force scritch them? 
LAURA: Listen, I have telekinetic-- 
LIAM: It was on their back or between their shoulder blades. 
LAURA: I have it written down, but I don't-- 
MARISHA: Or their snoots or something? I think. 
ROBBIE: Time to get out of this. 
TALIESIN: There was one note Laura Bailey definitely kept. 
MARISHA: They also don't have eyes, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Ashton, is there a way to get us into the stone or anything? 
TALIESIN: There's a way to get me in the stone. Honestly, if it comes to that, it's been a pleasure, all of you. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Would have been great! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Amazing! 
TRAVIS: We have the hole. We do have the scepter that could make a pass wall, which builds a door into the wall if we could-- 
LIAM: Homer into the hedge. 
TRAVIS: -- cover it up somehow. But that's using all the charges, basically. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Which feels like a waste. 
ROBBIE: There's not invisibility for our smell? 
TRAVIS: There's Banishment. There's no invisibility for the smell. 
SAM: I can Speak with Animals. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Oh man! 
MARISHA: I don't think they're animals. 
TALIESIN: Closest to invisibility for smell is a bath. 
TRAVIS: Off of the smell, can my keen ears pick up a rough number of avadons? Does it sound like-- 
MATT: I'd say using that same perception test, 
MARISHA: Animals are just like bears or wolves. 
MATT: You can assess three at the minimum. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: What if we throw down the hole and they go over the edge like lemmings into it, and then we roll it up? 
LAURA: Sure. 
TRAVIS: 20 feet wide. 
LAURA: Are you playing-- 
SAM: No, I'm trying to look up something. 
MATT: By 20 you said it's 20 feet wide and the hole is what, 10? 
LIAM: 10. 
MARISHA: We can also throw the hole on the side of the wall, right? Looney Tunes-style? 
TRAVIS: Does it stick? 
LAURA and TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: No. 
MATT: It's a flat surface. 
MARISHA: Flat surface? 
TALIESIN: It needs a flat surface to lie on. You can't be-- 
TRAVIS: I mean, the 10 foot hole in the middle of the tunnel. 
MARISHA: Yeah, and we can also always roll it up a little bit. 
TRAVIS: Because it's just five feet on either side. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do that. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's do it. 
MATT: All right, so what are you doing? 
LAURA: We open up the hole in the middle of the tunnel. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Will it unfurl properly in the middle of the tunnel? 
LAURA: It's flat. 
MATT: In the brief moment you have, one of you can search for a spot that can be the flattest. 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Flat, flat, flat, flat. 
MATT: So perception or investigation. 
LIAM: Perception. Oh! 20. 
MATT: 20. Okay. (animalistic panting) It gets louder and louder. As you see one portion where some fallen rock made it look rougher, but you quickly brush it aside and see a space that might work. 
LIAM: Ashton over here! Set the table! 
MATT: It's hard to tell if it's flat enough for it to-- 
TALIESIN: Throwing it down. 
MATT: You throw it down? 
TALIESIN: If you've got one. 
MATT: Ashton, roll a d20 for me. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: On a 10 or higher it is flat enough for the surface to function. 
TALIESIN: 19! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (cheering) 
LIAM: Yes! 
MATT: You set it down and there's a brief moment where you all hold your breath and then, (whooshes) the familiar space as the edge goes to shadow. What do you do? 
TALIESIN: I'll take corner number one if we're going to be ferreting them through. I'll take the the way on the right. 
LIAM: Yeah, I'll take the other side, ready to bumper strays into the hole if need be. 
TALIESIN: Yep! 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Tiny tots on the left. I'll join Orym. 
LAURA: And we'll all back up on the other side and wait for them to approach us, right? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, because they'll probably try and jump it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Right? 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: So somebody will-- 
TALIESIN: If they notice. 
MATT: So let's make a group stealth check then to see if-- 
SAM: Hmm. 
SAM: I could stay in the middle and bash them into it. We're trying to force them into it, yeah? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh wait! (laughs) I'm standing next to you? 
LIAM: Oh, did you get another one? Yeah, you're 30 feet away from me. Yes. 
ROBBIE: Ooh! Okay. 
MATT: All right, so starting on this side. 
LAURA: I've got to stop using these dice. 
MARISHA: 14. 
TRAVIS: 32? 
LAURA: Wow! 
MARISHA: 32, 14. 
TRAVIS: Wait. 
MATT: 32. 
TRAVIS: How high did this get? 
MATT: 14. Okay. 
TRAVIS: That was a natural 20. 
ROBBIE: 25? 
MATT: 25. Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, but it was a natural 20? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I had a natural 20. 
MATT: Oh! 
MARISHA: Okay, good call. 
MATT: That's good to know. 
MARISHA: In case one of us fucking biffs it. 
SAM: 12 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's what it is. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: 32. 
ASHLEY: 14. 
MATT: 14. Okay. 
LAURA: 15. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 26. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
ROBBIE: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: That kind of balanced it. 
MARISHA: It's a little shaky. 
ALL: (In squeaky voice) Okay, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's okay. 
MATT: So-- (laughter) 
LIAM: You hear about this? You hear about this? 
MATT: There's an alcove not terribly far that some of you can hide in it. Otherwise, the rest of you are pressing yourself up against the edge of this carved tunnel that's slowly corkscrewing down along. I say slowly because the width of this pillar, you can barely tell that there's a curve-- 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: -- until it pulses up, and you see it begin to fade a few hundred feet down. So as all of you pick up to the side, you begin to see the shapes emerge, rushing full four-legged pound-- Galloping forward. (animalistic panting) 
TRAVIS: Here they come! 
MATT: You all keep to the sides about, it would be-- 
ASHLEY: Just little French Bulldogs. 
MATT: -- about 60 feet from where you're all hidden, one of them picks up something. You recall they have no eyes. And with many things here that are psychic-related in how they were created or how they have developed, it seems to sense the presence of other minds. The other two do not. So, two of them go rushing past as one stops and goes (animalistic grunting) and begins to glance about. The two rush past and begin to slow down as they see this open hole in the ground and they move around the sides of it. 
LAURA: They saw it real easy. 
SAM: Mm. 
MATT: You two are on the sides? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, I need you both to make shove attacks if you're going to do this. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't need to shove attack. I can shove with my hammer. 
MATT: Oh yeah, that's true! Yeah, you can do that. 
TRAVIS: I was with Orym, too. Tiny tots on the side. 
MATT: Yeah. Okay. 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to make a pushing attack. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Brutal so-- 
TRAVIS: Can I assist you? 
LIAM: That is-- 
TRAVIS: I'm a strong, old-ass bitch. 
TALIESIN: Natural 20. 
SAM: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: Nice! 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
MATT: That's to hit, right? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: All right! Roll damage. 
TALIESIN: I'm not even raging. This going to be hilarious. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Don't get cocky! 
TALIESIN: No, no, no. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Let's see. Three, six. 
MATT: What'd you roll, Orym? 
LIAM: Well, I'm making a Battle Master pushing attack, so I rolled an 18 to hit. 
MATT: 18 hits. 
LIAM: So, it's a strength save DC 19, but maybe if Chetney helps shove on this thing, the DC will raise? 
MATT: Well, what I'll say is, if this fails, then you'll have one chance to try and shove it in there as well. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: This is a 19. 
LIAM: Meets it, beats it. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Well, it's still hurt so-- 
MATT: Yeah, you still do damage to it. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So you strike it, (grunts) push it back, and it catches itself on the edge of the hole from the side that you and Chetney are on. You did how much damage? 
TALIESIN: 45 points of damage. 
MATT: 45 points of damage? 
SAM: Whoa! 
LIAM: Ugh! Barp! 
MATT: (yelps) It gets hit and then falls into the hole and you can barely hear it moving. It is injured! 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: 18? Yeah, 18 times two plus nine. Yeah. Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I did 21 points of damage on my doggy. 
MATT: Okay. So it's a 19? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: But it did not get shoved. 
MATT: It did not. (impact) It barely catches itself on the edge. You have one more shot at it. Are you making a shove attack to try and push it in? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think so. 
MATT: All right, so for you that would be an athletics. 
TRAVIS: Okay. With advantage-- That's in my hybrid wolf form. 15, 16 plus nine. 25. 
MATT: A seven. It rolled a natural two. 
TRAVIS: (relieved exhale) 
MARISHA: Nice! Nice! 
MATT: So as it barely holds on, you, wham, hit it with all of your gnomish might. (laughter) 
MATT: For a brief moment, you tap into the wolven curse in your blood-- 
TRAVIS: (howls) (laughter) 
MATT: -- and drawing on that strength of the beast within, for as small size as you are and what little room there is to move, an unnatural amount of strength comes in your impact on it and it (groans) creaks in, and now two of them have dropped inside the hole. The one that you hit, it would've had time, probably, to try and get its way out if it wasn't so injured, and it's currently now on the ground, barely moving, while the other one falls on top of it. The third one still stops and sees this moment happening, goes (growls) and is rearing back for an attack. What's everyone else doing? 
LAURA: Can I try to telekinetically pull it to the hole? 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: How far back is it? 
MATT: It stayed back about 30 feet. 
LAURA: Oh! Okay, okay. 
MATT: Because as soon as it sensed to you guys, it slowed down while the others kept it going. But you can pull it closer, if you'd like. 
TRAVIS: Can you psychically tame it? 
LIAM: (panting) 
ASHLEY: Can I just go (smooches) so he'll come a little closer? 
LIAM and MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: Are you trying to-- 
ASHLEY: To get him in her grasp close enough. 
MATT: Do you want to try and draw him towards you? 
ASHLEY: (smooches) Come on! 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Make a persuasion check. 
TRAVIS: With your mind powers. 
ASHLEY: They can still hear. 
TRAVIS: With mind bullets! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MARISHA: I was just thinking that, too. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: That's telekinesis, Kyle. 
ASHLEY: 32. (laughter) 
MATT: 32. You have successfully taunted it and as soon as you do that, it goes-- 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
MATT: (growls) Slobber drips from its jaws, its teeth are exposed, and where its head is not present, just an open mouth of teeth and its central shoulders, and (growls) it begins coming after Fearne. 
LAURA: As soon as it's close enough, I'm going to try to pull it into the hole. 
MATT: Okay, if it succeeds on this roll, it's going to get a round of attacks on Fearne. 
LAURA: Oh god! 
ASHLEY: That's okay. I asked for it! I asked for it! 
MATT: All right, so what's the DC? 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: 18. All right, I'm going to roll above this for tension. 
ASHLEY: Come on, big boy! 
TRAVIS: (wails) 
MATT: Natural 20. (groaning) 
ASHLEY: Oh shit! 
LAURA: For shame! 
MATT: You pull it, and unfortunately, its momentum is so intense that you end up pulling it towards Fearne-- 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: -- as it clears the hole. It does rush towards you with a multiattack. This massive barbed tongue (slurps) whips out of its mouth as it's approaching and leaping in the air towards Fearne. It's going to come at you. 
ASHLEY: Wait, can I Shield? 
LIAM: Oh, it's happening. 
MATT: Well-- 
TRAVIS: Do you have Shield? 
ASHLEY: I think I do because of-- 
MATT: You do. However, let's see if it hits you or not first. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That would be a 21 to hit you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: That hits you? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Do you want to Shield? 
MARISHA: It's plus five AC. 
MATT: It's plus five? 
LAURA: Woo! 
LIAM: Yeah, it's your AC. 
ASHLEY: Okay, Shield. 
MARISHA: So only do it if it makes sense. 
TRAVIS: Also, is it going to hurt that much? You want to waste your Shield now? I don't know. 
ASHLEY: Oh, is it not going to hurt that much? 
MATT: You don't know. 
LAURA: It was just a reaction. It's just a reaction, right? 
MARISHA: Can you do Shield as much as you want? 
MATT: Well, it uses a spell slot. 
LIAM: It's a low-level spell. 
LAURA: Oh, it's a one-level. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's a one-level spell slot? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Let's just take it. Ah! 
MATT: (laughs) Up to you. What are you doing? 
MARISHA: Do it, do it, do it! 
LAURA: You were going to Shield. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you were going to do it. 
LIAM: Makes total sense. 
ASHLEY: Okay, Shield. 
MATT: Let's go. 
MARISHA: You still still want to save those hit points. 
MATT: So that misses you. 
LAURA: Yes, that's a 22 to AC. 
ASHLEY: That misses me. 
MATT: Okay. So it leaps, its tongue tries to grab you, snap around you and dig in with its barbs. You put the shield up, and it keeps it at bay. Instead, it crashes into you and it's trying to make a claw and a bite attack on you simultaneously. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: The bite attack is going to be a 23. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
MATT: Does that hit? 
SAM: Is Shield still up? 
ASHLEY: That hits. 
MATT: Shield is still up. 
LAURA: Oh, great. Oh, it still hits. 
MATT: Shield lasts for one round. 
LAURA: It was 22. 
ASHLEY: That hits. 
MATT: That hits. Okay. 
SAM: Are you sure? 
MATT: The claw attack-- 
SAM: What's your AC? 
MATT: -- is a natural one. 
ASHLEY: 22. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: So yeah. 
ASHLEY: So one hit? Okay. 
MATT: So one hit. The bite does hit you. 
TALIESIN: Came around. 
MATT: 17 points of piercing damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: And make a strength saving throw for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: That was claw. 
MATT: The shield manages to deflect-- 
ASHLEY: How much of damage did you say? Sorry. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
ASHLEY and MATT: 17. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Its claw gets put off to the side, but its jaw or the jaws in its shoulders push forward and the shield (cracks) breaks away and it manages to bite onto the side of your left arm and dig into it. 
ASHLEY: 12. 
MATT: 12. You are grappled by it currently. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: It holds you in place. Now, Laudna, Dorian, Braius. 
SAM: Yes? 
MATT: What were you plotting to do? 
SAM: Well, seeing this-- So is Fearne on this side of the hole or the other side of the hole? 
ASHLEY: I was put on the-- 
MATT: Fearne's on the opposite side. Or, yeah, she's now-- I'll put it this way. If the hole's here, right? 
SAM: We'll use that napkin. 
MATT: Use this napkin for it. 
TALIESIN: Perfect. 
MATT: So where it was in my mind, we had Ashton on this side. We had-- 
LIAM: Orym. 
MATT: -- Chetney and Orym on this side. Probably had Fearne trying to draw him over the hole this way. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: The rest of you were likely hiding off to the side here. 
SAM: So it has leapt over the hole. 
MATT: I imagine. Correct. We'll say-- 
SAM: Gotcha. 
MATT: -- two of them are currently now in the hole. 
MARISHA: -- temporary hit points is they don't stack. 
MATT: One of them has leapt over it and is now engaged with Fearne and has her grappled. 
SAM: Yeah, I mean, I would run up and try to bash it into the hole if possible. 
MATT: Okay. So how many, you have two attacks in a round? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: You can make two shove attacks, if you'd like to. 
SAM: All right. 
MATT: All right, so you move. 
SAM: Is this shove plus my strength or something? 
MATT: It's your athletics. 
SAM: Athletics. 
MATT: It's contested. 
SAM: Okay. Here's one. That's a natural 20. 
ROBBIE: Jeez! 
TRAVIS: Let's go, Braius Doomseed! 
MATT: I mean-- 
ROBBIE: Oh, everybody's on fire! 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: You have to treat a woman with respect! (laughter) 
SAM: I just learned that like five minutes ago. (laughter) 
MATT: I'm not even joking. It rolled a natural 20. 
SAM: Whoa! 
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: What?! 
MATT: I'm not even-- 
SAM: Mine's a plus seven. 
TRAVIS: Clash of the titans. 
MATT: Right. It's a plus five, so it still fails. (laughs) (cheering) 
MATT: That-- Dang. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
LAURA: Woo! 
TRAVIS: Wow. Big guns coming out. 
MATT: So it grapples onto her. You rush forward, and describe to me how you slam it. 
SAM: Well, I was going to use my flail to sort of baseball swing. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: Crack! As you hit it on the side of the shoulder, it tears its jaws free from grabbing onto Fearne's left arm and (yelps) it falls back, tries to catch itself on the hole. 
TRAVIS: Order up! 
MATT: No, not with that roll. 
TRAVIS: (grunts) 
MATT: Not with a three. It falls in. At this point, now all three of them are in there, but the ones below are going to try and get out. 
SAM: Sure they are. 
MATT: What are the rest of you doing? 
MARISHA: Wait. He's in it? 
MATT: Yeah, all three of them are pushed in. Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm going to Mage Hand flip it up. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Pick up the hole. 
MATT: (hole gathers up) The hole lifts up, and they are-- 
ASHLEY: Awesome! 
TRAVIS: Fucking great idea! (applauding) 
MATT: -- gone. 
ASHLEY: That was a great idea. 
SAM: We've got a bag of wolverines. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Just in case-- 
LIAM: For 11 minutes. 
LAURA: Then they're dead. 
LIAM: Then they're a slurry. 
LAURA: How long do they have to breathe, though? Because they don't have a face. 
TALIESIN: We're going to find out. 
LAURA: They might not have to breathe. 
MARISHA: Well, they have a face. 
LIAM: That's a tomorrow problem. 
MARISHA: It's just a vagina face. 
LAURA: Yeah, but it's a void face. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: It's a void face. 
TRAVIS: What's your experience with vaginas? 
LAURA: Do they breathe through-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We're going to learn so much about them in a couple hours. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: But that's a couple hours from now. 
SAM: Thanks, Marisha. Now sex is ruined for me. (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's okay, you have two kids. (laughter) 
MARISHA: So no. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We start booking it, right? 
LIAM: Yep. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: We're going. 
TALIESIN: Full speed. 
TRAVIS: Oh! (panicked yelling) 
LAURA: That's a success! That's a success! 
MARISHA: It's a good one! 
SAM: It could be a failure. 
MARISHA: Right? It's a good one. 
TRAVIS: Look at him frown when he does it. 
LAURA: It's the good wheel. 
TALIESIN: They both look like Trivia Pursuit pieces. 
ROBBIE: We're going to wrong direction. 
TALIESIN: I don't know what's going on. 
LAURA: Possibly. 
TRAVIS: He's using a red marker. 
LAURA: No, he was using a blue marker. 
ASHLEY: He was using a blue one! 
TRAVIS: You're color blind. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
SAM: He put a blue cap on a red marker to confuse us. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Oh man! He's a genius. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh, look at our napkin. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: I just realized you made a napkin with our dog. 
MARISHA: So cute! 
MATT: Yay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You guys are in a hole. 
TALIESIN: That was actually really fun. 
MATT: I'm going to put you right there. 
TRAVIS: Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. 
TALIESIN: Back in the hole. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Alvin, Simon ♪ 
MATT: Back in your hold. 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and SAM: ♪ Theodore ♪ ♪ Do, do ♪ 
ALL: ♪ Do, do, do, do ♪ 
MATT: We are old. 
LAURA: The Chipmunks. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You bet your sweet ass. 
MATT: Yeah. All righty. 
LIAM: Alvin! 
MATT: A brief pause, a breath as you roll up your hole, which right now is pretty-- 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah? 
LAURA: Our hole is what? 
MATT: Your hole is pretty filled. 
TALIESIN: It's packed. It's packed. (laughter) 
MATT: It's at capacity. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Filled and stanky. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
LIAM: If you've ever left-- 
TALIESIN: We'll clean it out later. 
LIAM: -- lentil soup out for too long. 
LAURA: Ew! 
MATT: Fucking kill me. 
LAURA: Yeah, we have some bodies in that hole still, don't we? 
TRAVIS: Bag of holdings and holes. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: That is a-- 
LAURA: That's a foul hole. 
ASHLEY: -- stinky, gaping hole. 
TALIESIN: It's funnier when you say it. 
LIAM: I've heard that about Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Hey! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You're continuing further and further down the tunnel. About five minutes of walking and it begins to branch. You begin to see the tunnel continues downward, but other caverns begin to appear. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Layers of subterranean open spaces, pockets of air that were crafted when this space was crafted long ago, just natural empty crevasses, different openings in the rock. Shadow-filled, no light, except for the occasional bit of glimmering, glowing blue. You remember long ago when you gave into a vision and felt yourself fall through this red Moon of Ill-Omen, and felt yourself fall through this red Moon of Ill-Omen, that below the surface, there were many ancient, forgotten, locked caverns below. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Do you happen to remember the right one? 
LAURA: No, I just-- There was a lot. It's deep. 
MARISHA: Can we tell which one-- 
MATT: Well, the tunnel continues downward. 
MARISHA: -- continues to go down? 
MATT: This is just the first-- 
SAM: These are offshoots. 
MATT: -- cavern you see off the side. 
LIAM: Down is best at this point. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Like capillaries, right? 
MATT: Yeah. All spiraling off. You're uncertain what might exist there, good or bad, but you keep your eyes on the prize and follow down the slowly corkscrewing path on the outskirts of the Prime Pillar. The pillar itself, too, the further down you go, its exterior grows less smooth and more rootlike. its exterior grows less smooth and more rootlike. Parts of the glass push out. Some seem to branch like tree branches out for three or four feet from the side, like the carved bit of rock couldn't quite pierce fully the bit of exposed glass and they had to burrow underneath it. You can see these veins that wrap around where the tunnel had to make a shift in its path and dip below to push beyond that thick piece of Ruidian glass. You also begin to pick up a smell. An old, musty smell, something that reminds you of rot, something that reminds you of fungus. 
ASHLEY: Pee-ew, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Not me. 
MATT: It's about this point, as you come upon one of these caverns to the side, and one of the exposed windows of the Prime Pillar's glass glows. You see dozens of reflections in the chamber to your right of just enough of a reflection to see eyes, of just enough of a reflection to see eyes, it looks like, in the shadowed expanse to your right. 
LIAM: Ooh. Within crystal of column or in the dark, in this chamber? 
MATT: In the cavern to your right. 
LAURA: There's a shitton of eyes in the cavern? 
MATT: Yeah, the glass is on the left-hand side. As it lights up, you can see in this one exposed cavern that you're passing by, numerous-- 
LIAM: Fungal smell and lots of eyes. 
LAURA: Is it the little myceit? 
MATT: -- reflective glimmers. 
TRAVIS: Little pinpoints of light? 
TALIESIN: Wait a minute. 
TRAVIS: Or is it like a huge-- 
MATT: It's like a bunch of reflections of the glow of the glass. 
LAURA: Yeah, we need to do that. 
TALIESIN: This might be the place. I don't know. 
LAURA: I'm going to pass the seed. I trust you, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Or-- 
LAURA: You find a place. 
MATT: You watch as something shifts in the shadow. 
LAURA: Do we recognize the smell? You said it was something familiar. 
MATT: Meaning it smells like rot, decay. 
LAURA: Oh okay. 
ASHLEY: Should we send a little light in there? 
LAURA: I don't-- 
MATT: You see movement in the shadow as you hand over the seed. Emerging from the shadow are three, six, 12 are three, six, 12 small myceit stepping out, these little fungal folk half-teetering and some wandering out, their shapes different. You can see what the reflection would've been, you thought might've been eyes, are portions of their caps or their exposed fungal bodies that have a smooth little knot that itself glistens and reflects. Some of them have what might be an eye or eyes in places, but they're all varying shapes, and they all emerge curiously. 
ROBBIE: Good or bad? Good or bad? 
LAURA: They're good. They can be good. 
ASHLEY: I think they're okay. 
TALIESIN: (friendly whistle) 
MATT: (soft chirping) 
MARISHA: We had some nice ones-- 
ROBBIE: Okay. All right. 
MARISHA: -- that we ran into earlier, but who knows? 
ASHLEY: They could've been on another side. 
MATT: It's at this moment, as you're listening to Fearne, you look down and one's right there, almost ninja cat in front of you and looking up at you. (curious gurgling) 
SAM: Do they speak? 
LAURA: Can I say in their head: Do you know where the group, the people from the Blue Dream, do you know where they are? 
MATT: (soft, sad gurgling) There isn't so much language as there is an odd mixture of emotion and color. You get the sense that it knows where things are happening. (affirmative gurgling) 
LAURA: One of them is in danger. We need to help. 
MATT: About two dozen more slowly emerge and they're filling up the cavern around you all. 
LAURA: I'm a little nervous about this. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Miners, not minors. 
ROBBIE: I speak Primordial. Does any of this sound ancient? Am I making out any words or anything like that? 
LAURA: I speak Primordial, too. 
ROBBIE: You do? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: I would think if they're an ancient being of some sort, it feels old. 
TALIESIN: I do as well. 
TRAVIS: I also Speak with Small Beasts. Are they considered beasts? 
MATT: They are not considered beasts. There isn't a language purely, but as people that have knowledge of the Primordial language, there are certain sounds and reactions that sound akin to what would be like the Common version of "Yeah. Huh? Sure." 
LAURA: Cute. 
MATT: There is some sort of an ancient connection in some way to these myceit and something Primordial, likely long ago. 
TALIESIN: You throw me a little light and ask them if I can plant this real quick and then we can be on our way. 
LAURA: We're in a hurry, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LAURA: I'll send out some lights. 
LIAM: Is the vibe okay as they-- They seem innocent. 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Pretty good for me. That's a 20, dirty 20. (oohing) 
SAM: Whispers. Whispers. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: Guys, go buy stuff in our store. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) Where's your little sheet of paper? 
SAM: Oh, this is for battles. 
ROBBIE: Ah, all right. 
SAM: I can't tell you what this says. 
TRAVIS: Have a great end of your 2024. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's the end of the year. 
MARISHA: Have a good holiday. 
TRAVIS: Last episode. 
SAM: Yeah, so go buy stuff. 
MARISHA: Eat lots of food. 
TALIESIN: Eat food. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah! 
SAM: It's the holidays. Celebrate by buying stuff. 
MARISHA: Apple cider, mulled wine. 
SAM: Happy Hanukkah. 
LIAM: No sudden movements. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm trying to be-- 
LAURA: You get a bad vibe? 
LIAM: No, they're just-- I don't know. They seem curious. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: But I can't-- Just, let's not-- 
MATT: (curious critters) 
TALIESIN: I'm keeping low to the ground and I'm trying to-- 
LIAM: Startle them. Let's not startle them. 
MARISHA: Give him a strawberry. 
TALIESIN: Do I see anything? We've got some light in there. Do I see this is a good place to plant something or is this not? 
MATT: You light up the chamber that they're coming from and as you do, more and more chambers open up. It is a sprawling network of caverns throughout-- 
LAURA: This is where they come from. 
MATT: -- that some places have, it looks like where crystal has been mined from, the crystal glass, the Ruidian glass. It looks like there are veins that have been pulled from and there are some signs that this area might have been used elsewhere, if not by them. It doesn't look as refined as you'd expect from Reiloran work. So perhaps the myceit themselves, this is one of their hidden caches. You're uncertain. But the smell, that smell, that fungal smell is faint around them. But it was strong-- too strong in the air to be just this group present. 
LIAM: Laudna had a good idea. Orym squats down and makes a strawberry using Druidcraft appear in his hand and holds it out for them. 
MATT: One of them takes it and seven of them gather around and look at it. They're like (melodious chitters). 
MARISHA: I'm going to, while they're distracted, tell Pâté to go invisible and then have him seek out that stench in the cavern. 
TRAVIS: Further into that crevasse. 
MARISHA: Further into the crevasse. See if he sees anything. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: As soon as Orym says no sudden movements, too, I'm going to start quietly humming a familiar tune to myself and will continue to for the foreseeable future. 
MATT: It takes the strawberry and crushes it up in its hand and smears it on the top of its cap. 
MARISHA: Oh! (laughs) 
MATT: (chitters) 
MARISHA: Oh my god. I love him. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
MARISHA: Is he a mushroom man wearing a strawberry hat? 
MATT: Well, it's a mushroom man who's smeared strawberry streaks on the top of it, so. 
MARISHA: I love him! 
LAURA: He's so cute. 
ASHLEY: I love him, too! (laughter) 
LAURA: Don't make them attack us, Matt. They're so cute. Don't make them turn evil. They're cute. 
ASHLEY: Don't! They're so cute! 
MATT: There's six other ones that have gathered expectantly at you. (chitters) 
LIAM: I give them a blackberry. 
MATT: (gurgling) 
MARISHA: -- more strawberry. 
TALIESIN: Let's slowly maybe back-- 
MATT: (smearing) They smear it on their heads, too. More and more are starting to approach and gather in towards Orym. 
LAURA: Maybe-- 
MATT: (gurgling) 
ASHLEY: That's probably enough. 
LIAM: I start to move to the side of the entrance to clear the entrance a little bit in case any of my friends want to-- 
LAURA: No, I want to move on. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Anything from-- 
LIAM: We can just go. 
MARISHA: ♪ He hasn't asked me yet. ♪ But we can go. 
ROBBIE: Is there any significance, since I haven't been here, to the Ruidian glass, these veins that you're talking, that are moving through the wall? Do they have a purpose? 
LAURA: It's part of Predathos is what-- 
MARISHA: We think. 
LAURA: -- they say. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
SAM: That is psychic energy? 
MATT: The lore that has been conveyed by various Ruidian allies you've had in the past, Evoroa as well, it is thought within the study of Ruidus' history from the Ruidian society that the Ruidian glass is the remains of Predathos' original form when it was defeated by the gods and titans long ago. The glass itself still carries a very strong psychic resonance within it. It is very difficult to mine and manipulate, but weapons and tools that have been made from it have additional properties that are psychically resonant. 
ROBBIE: Can I really quickly investigate the walls in the area, the space that we're in really quick? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Just absentmindedly. I want to see if there's any true to their name, like any sort of organic webbing or mycelium that's in the walls that could be interwoven with the glass. 
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I appreciate the time being spent on this. I feel like-- 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MARISHA: (excited noises) 
TALIESIN: Oh wow! 
LAURA: Yes, yes! 
ROBBIE: Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Let's go, baby! 
ROBBIE: What is happening? With the perception, it's not great. 21. 
TRAVIS: Blue Dream. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: That's great, though. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: So as they're having this gathering of myceit that are swarming Orym and the odd mixture of like, they're cute and I'm unsettled, that has fallen over the troop, you step past them into the entryway and you see other myceit that are coming out of the walls and you look and there's like, the walls are porous in places. There are small tunnels, little entryways throughout where they're emerging from. You get close to one of the sides there. Amongst the rock that's in this space, and the occasional little veins of the Ruidian glass, you do see some sort of a soft, sticky texture on it and you follow it. There is the faintest bit of a mycelium material, almost like a thin skin membrane that's stretched from place to place that seems to embed itself in the rock in places. You go towards one of these openings where one of the myceits runs by and you look in and it looks like a tunnel that descends out of sight. 
LAURA: We can use that tunnel instead, straight to Predathos. 
MARISHA: Good job, Dorian. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: They're tiny, though, right? These tunnels are super tiny? 
MATT: They're small. They're about maybe three-foot high. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: About two and a half feet wide, at least the one that you're looking at now. Also, they're all over the different walls, coming from different locations. So you get the sense that there is a mass network of these little tunnels and a mass network where these myceits communicate or maneuver throughout these cavernous spaces. 
LAURA: Can I try to communicate with one of them in their head and-- 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: -- ask about the tunnel? 
MATT: Yeah. (gurgles) 
LAURA: Is there a bigger one that leads down, down to the cage? 
MATT: (gurgles) 
LAURA: Predathos, the heart. 
MATT: You put the image in its mind of Predathos, being a Ruidusborn, being an entity that has a connection with the very core of this world. Then myceit, as it looks towards you, its head shoots up straight. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: (vocalizes) And it grabs your hand and starts pulling you towards the room. 
LAURA: Uh-oh, I think these are part of Predathos. 
SAM: No, no, maybe he's showing us. 
MATT: Others begin to gather-- 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: -- and look at each other like they're all quietly communicating in an instant and all of them begin to swarm up around Imogen and they get behind her-- 
LAURA: Does it feel threatening? 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
TRAVIS: Insight the fungi. 
MARISHA: What were you going to say? 
ROBBIE: I was going to say. Oh, wait, wait. [chair cracks] Ooh! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I got so excited, I broke the chair. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MARISHA: It's happened before. 
ROBBIE: Ooh, it's happen-- has it? I broke it. 
MARISHA: It's not you. 
TRAVIS: I've done-- yeah. 
LAURA: 21. 
ROBBIE: Oh no, it's a sign from the gods. 
SAM: Oh boy, some whispers are happening. 
ROBBIE: Whispers. 
TRAVIS: Fertilizer. 
SAM: As he whispers, why don't you take this opportunity to buy some shit in our store? 
TRAVIS: Fucking holidays! Enjoy the end of the year. 
SAM: Enjoy the end of the year. 
TRAVIS: Eggnog! 
SAM: Make some New Year's resolutions. 
ROBBIE: Dear Santa, can I have a chair for Christmas? 
TRAVIS: That can support that keg. 
ROBBIE: It's close. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. You snapped it down the fucking leg. You separated that bitch. 
ROBBIE: Okay, okay, I'm not going to die. 
TRAVIS: Don't let it pinch your butt. KYLE: Get up right now. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: That's broken. 
ROBBIE: It's okay. It's just a chair. 
LIAM: You got excited. 
ROBBIE: I got excited. 
MARISHA: I think Ashley broke the last one. 
ROBBIE: Thank you, Santa! 
MATT: Thank you, Keo! 
ROBBIE: I think I'm two inches shorter now. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: This one's going out because I always go back like this. 
LAURA: Don't do that. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
LAURA: These chairs need-- 
ROBBIE: There's a slippery one. 
LAURA: Maybe at the start of the new year, we can get new chairs. 
MATT: So the rest of you are watching these myceit have all shifted their attention, their scattered curiosity to all focus on Imogen. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: They're all pulling her hands and getting behind, pushing her towards the-- 
LAURA: Well, this might be a faster way down. 
MATT: -- the tunnel they emerged from, the room with the chamber. 
LAURA: It's definitely taken-- 
SAM: Wait, they're pushing-- 
ASHLEY: What's going on? 
SAM: -- her back to the place where we came from? 
LAURA: Through the hole, the tunnel. 
MATT: They're pushing her towards the network of caverns that they emerged from. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait. 
MARISHA: You going to get it out. I'm dying to know what you're about to say. 
LAURA: What do you want? 
ROBBIE: No, it's okay! Everyone's talking, we're all talking together. 
LAURA: Robbie, what is it? 
ROBBIE: Sorry, I can't, I've got a cushion on the way. (laughter) (clapping) 
ROBBIE: As they're pulling her, Dorian's going to try to make his way to her and be like-- 
LAURA and MARISHA: ♪ Makin' his way ♪ 
ROBBIE: You know, my father's favorite tutor always had a strange theory. He told me that he thought all of the mushrooms were connected under the ground. They spoke to the trees. I think they might be speaking to someone other than the trees! 
LAURA: No, yeah, I got that. 
ROBBIE: Are you okay with this? 
LAURA: It'll get there faster. 
ROBBIE: Okie dokie. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: The hole's three by two! I mean, that's fine for me and Orym. 
LAURA: Can you make the hole bigger for all of us? 
MATT: Well, that's the one hole that you saw. There are dozens and dozens. It looks like a porous rock cavern. 
LAURA: We'll know if this is bad when he marks the red mark. 
TRAVIS: We'll do it, we'll do it, let's go, let's go. 
ROBBIE: I'm saying there's a non-zero chance that someone else is listening. 
MARISHA: Hang on. 
LAURA: I'm pretty sure Predathos knows we're coming. 
SAM: Be brave, Dorian. 
SAM: These guys look good. 
MARISHA: Is the myceit pulling her into where Pâté went to go figure out what the stench was. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that Pâté, he did the invisible thing. 
MATT: Pâté has now like, he's flown into this cavern beyond them and there are numerous other myceit and the caverns sprawl out. You can see hundreds of feet into shadow, but beyond his perception where the cavern breaks off into two different other caverns, that branch off into other caverns, he could be spend hours in here exploring these. 
TRAVIS: There's no moon glabrezu sitting 50 feet in the cavern. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I told him-- to look for the rotten. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LAURA: The stinky smell. 
MARISHA: Jesus. Is it my percept-- I forget. 
TRAVIS: Is it you? Are you starting the downward trend? 
MARISHA: It's his. It is me starting the downward trend. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
ROBBIE: Don't roll next to me. 
LIAM: Familiars aways suck. 
MATT: It's a natural one? 
MARISHA: No, no, no, that's a seven, that's a seven. 
LIAM: With their rolls. 
MARISHA: So eight. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Familiars cannot roll to save their life. 
MATT: Smell's ever-present. It's not super strong, but it's definitely ever-present. 
MARISHA: But he doesn't see shit. 
MATT: He's like, "Well, I don't know, this is sort of a big cavern." 
MARISHA: Yeah, that tracks. 
MATT: "Sorry." 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: (Pâté) Honeycomb, pink, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: One day. 
SAM: I'm going to focus in and use Divine Sense just to see if there's any good, evil, fiend, undead things. 
MATT: You don't pick up any fiend, undead, celestial presence here. 
SAM: Okay, great, great, great. 
MATT: You don't pick up anything that marks your personal sense of morality. These are mushroom people. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: They continue to push you further back into the cavern. You see it branches off into two larger places. You can hear a distant drip of water that echoes every few seconds off to the right-hand side, but they're pushing you to the left, and eventually-- Are you lighting up in front as this goes? Are you leading your-- 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: -- or are you letting the shadows take you? 
LAURA: No, I want light. 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. The chamber they lead you into descends downward. It's a small, compared to the massive room you were in, a small, 40-foot wide descending turn that leads to a roundish sphere-like alcove where there are five other door-like tunnel entrances. As you walk in some the lights, you can see there's that stretched bits of thin fungal film that seems to emerge from some of the holes, and they all-- There's one that will likely fit you and they all go, (croaking) and start pushing you towards the hole. The one's tugging you, pulling you into it. 
MARISHA: Go down the water slide. 
LAURA: Do they look like they're smiling? 
SAM: It's fine. 
LAURA: It's fine. Y'all are coming, too. (all speaking at once) 
LIAM: We're following your lead. 
LAURA: Shall we go in? 
ASHLEY: I can always go in a different way? 
LAURA: No, Fearne, you're coming. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we're follow. 
LAURA: Are we doing this? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We're doing this! 
LAURA: What if this dumps us out right into the-- 
MARISHA: This could "Chutes and Ladders" us right to the-- 
ASHLEY: Right to the thing. 
MARISHA: Right to Predathos. 
TALIESIN: Easily eight out of 10 times when I listen to a mushroom, it goes very well. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go to one of the little mushrooms. Is there one for my size? I don't want to get stuck. I get really nervous in small, confined spaces. 
MATT: (cooing) 
ASHLEY: Big, big. 
MATT: (squeak) 
ASHLEY: Big hole? 
TALIESIN: I think this is, might be as big as it gets. 
ASHLEY: So I probably shouldn't go. 
LAURA: True shape? 
ASHLEY: I should stay? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Beast Shape. 
MATT: Imogen, you have been pushed towards the entryway here. It's about maybe a little over three and a half feet tall, about Orym's height-ish, standing. And about three feet wide, mostly circular oval. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: The smell is strong of that fungal smell and they're all like (mushrooms squeak-talking) 
LAURA: I'm going to use a sorcery point and my eyes, as I look down, are going to flare up white. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And white smoke is going to pour out of them. 
SAM: Ooh, cool. 
LAURA: And I can see invisibility, I can see-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- anything now that is in front of me. 
MATT: As the area alights within, the entryway is the size of the tunnel and it progresses into a downward slope and what you notice is that strange fungal film is all across it. It's almost like it's a slide. It glistens ever so faintly. 
LIAM: Slide. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
SAM: This is going to be great. 
MARISHA: Let's go. ♪ Slide, slide, slippity slide. ♪ 
LIAM: The penguin is there. 
ASHLEY: The penguin is there. 
LIAM: Slide. 
LAURA: All right. I'm going to look back at the-- 
TRAVIS: Slide. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: Slide. I'm going to turn back to the group. 
MARISHA: Let's do it. 
LAURA: Slide. 
MARISHA: Let's slide, baby. 
LAURA: Then I hop in. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Slide. 
MATT: You lean down a bit and before you can even get a moment, the one that's pulling your hand pulls you in and vanishes ahead of you and the other ones give you a push from behind and-- (whooshing) (fast-sliding) 
LAURA: Oh god. You guys better get in here. 
MATT: You are now cruising and sliding around, lugeing through this lightless space. 
ASHLEY: She's going in by herself? 
MATT: Your flicker of light cannot keep up with the speed you're going and pretty soon you are rocketing towards shadow, nothing but the sense of hot wind. 
LAURA: Good thing have my light I can see, I can see. 
MATT: It's like having headlights at the front of a black descent into-- 
TRAVIS: You are a Miata. 
MATT: (swooshing) You all watch-- 
LIAM: Having Action Park flashbacks. 
MATT: -- Imogen vanish into darkness. 
MARISHA: No. 
TRAVIS: No, no. We're going in after her. We're going in "Goonies," baby. 
ASHLEY: We're going in. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: It's our time down here. (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's our time! 
MATT: All right, all of you, one-by-one begin to push in. I'd say the two that would have the hardest if anybody would be the two of you. It can fit you. 
LIAM: Those horns. 
TRAVIS: Get naked! Sorry, did I say out loud? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We do have a potion for this. 
MARISHA: You have the slippy potion? 
TRAVIS: Takes one minute to apply. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, you have to butter yourself up? 
ASHLEY: It's fine, I'm totally going to fit. 
MATT: The two of you are the ones left. Is one of you helping the other? 
ASHLEY: I take a little bit of the slime and I shimmy it around my cake-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: -- as I get through it. On my tum-tum and my cake. (laughter) 
SAM: Do you want a shove? 
ASHLEY: And I got like this. 
SAM: Oh, you're just going to go? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I was going to go last, as a clearing marble. 
ASHLEY: ♪ It's my life ♪ 
MATT: Feet first or head first? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go head first. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oof! Jesus. Action Park on your tummy! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: (swooshing) 
ASHLEY: It's more streamlined. 
MATT: All right, Braius. 
SAM: I'm looking to see what I have. I take out my canteen of water and pour it all over me. Maybe that'll help? I don't know how things work! Ahh! I'm going. 
MATT: You dive in. 
TRAVIS: It's lube. (swooshing) 
TALIESIN: Here we go. 
SAM: It was lube. 
MATT: You all, one after another, are shooting through this black, slick, lightless tube-- 
ROBBIE: (wheezes) 
MATT: -- into wherever the depths of Ruidus it'll take you. I need a-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, this is actually so fun! (laughter) 
MATT: (swooshing) 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: It's in my mouth, it's in my mouth. 
MARISHA: Was there a 16-year-old myceit being like, "Next, next, next." (laughter) 
MATT: There is a moment-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Imogen. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Where it (swooshing) curves and come to a bit of a slightly narrower space and it evens out and you slow slightly. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MARISHA: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
MATT: (Laudna crashing) (laughs) You get taken out from behind by Laudna as you both now are sliding together. 
MARISHA: Sorry! Sorry! 
MATT: Going over a steeper ridge (whooshes) shooting down at a very extreme decline. The rest of you continue through. I need a group athletics or acrobatics check. Your choice. For the first leg of this slide journey. 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
ASHLEY: Acrobatics or athl-- Okay. 
LAURA: Eugh. 
SAM: You still got Inspiration, young Imogen. 
LAURA: No, I used that one. 
SAM: Oh, you did? 
MATT: Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I was about to say-- No, I was going to say rage doesn't help with this at all. 
MATT: Nope. 
TALIESIN: Athletics. Sorry, nat 20. 
TALIESIN: So that's-- 
LIAM: We are lucky tonight! 
TALIESIN: 29. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: 18, and Orym's using Gust to go like air hockey all the way down. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: Oh nice. 
MATT: Imogen. 
LAURA: 11. 
MATT: 11. All righty. Fearne. 
MARISHA: That tracks. 
ASHLEY: Four. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Braius. 
SAM: 15. 
MATT: 15, okay. Robbie. 
ROBBIE: 22. 
MATT: 22. All right. 
MARISHA: Six. 
SAM: Six, six, six. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
MATT: 19, all right. These tunnels are slick at first, and then elements of the walls and ceilings begin to grow more ragged. 
ROBBIE: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Oh. (bumpy sliding) 
MATT: Bits of exposed rock shooting by and you're all having to adjust as you go. At a certain point, the bottom of the tunnel, you have such an intense speed and then just air. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: Then (whooshes). You didn't even see what happened, but you left the tunnel for the moment and caught another one. 
LAURA: Oh my god. That's terrifying. Is that myceit still in front of me that pulled me in? 
MATT: You haven't seen it. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. That little shit. 
TRAVIS: We should patch that! 
MATT: However, the process does bang up a number of you and knock you around, throw you off course for a bit. You end up getting stuck and lodged in at one point having to push through and the expediency of this slide ride does unfortunately slow things down a little bit. (yelling) 
ASHLEY: Another one! 
MARISHA: We thought it was the fast one! 
TRAVIS: The dark wheel. 
MARISHA: Now we know. 
TRAVIS: The dark timer. 
TALIESIN: Bad wheel. 
MATT: Eventually a faint bit of light seems to appear below you when you are traveling at one of your fastest speeds below as you feel the air rushing past and you see the light get larger and larger and you look like you're about to impact what looks like hard floor. (whooshing) 
LAURA: Oh, uh. I want to use a ki-- a sorcery point-- 
TRAVIS: A ki point. 
SAM: A ki point. 
LAURA: A ki point and fly. 
MATT: Okay, you emerge and arrive into a fairly decently-sized subterranean opening. A cavern with stalagmites that hang from below and the area where you would've impacted, you could see the ground itself has a spongy growth where it would be. The rest of you (sproing) impact. 
MARISHA: Feather Fall. 
MATT: Feather Fall. 
MARISHA: On whoever needs it. 
MATT: You gently tumble into it and bounce before you land onto the rock beyond. Whoever else would've been in vision, in sight to you would've been the next person. 
MARISHA: Choose up to five falling creatures including myself, so that's four. 
MATT: That you can see, right? 
MARISHA: Well, we know these two were last. 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
LIAM: You can skip me if you need to. 
TALIESIN: And you can skip me if you need to. 
ROBBIE: I'm good. 
MARISHA: I'll give it to Chet. 
TRAVIS: Ohh, elderly. 
MARISHA: I'll maybe give it to Braius and two because they'll be coming in last so I can turn and look at them. 
MATT: Okay. So I'll say that you as you turn around to do that. All of you begin to slowly impact this spongy cushion of fungus material that takes the brunt of your impact and bounces you about 10, 15 feet before you land on your feet if you catch yourself in time. 
MARISHA: This is awesome. 
LIAM: That was sick. 
MARISHA: That was great. 
ASHLEY: That was so fun. 
LAURA: I light up my orbs so we can see what the fuck's-- 
MATT: Your orbs light up-- 
LAURA: -- around us. 
MATT: -- And you can see there are a handful of myceit that have probably gone in before you went down, the one that pulled you in, and then a number (myceit bouncing) being emerging from behind (laughter) where you were like a distribution tunnel that is filling a factory floor. You watch as dozens of myceit are now following suit behind. They're piling up at the bottom, almost filling it up before they begin to disperse a bit and follow, but you now have a small cluster of myceit that are following you here. The smell, that smell that you picked up in the cavern earlier when you began to step over to the side is extremely strong here. 
SAM: Is Locate Object still up by any chance or has it been 10 minutes? 
MATT: I'd say it's probably been 10 minutes from now since you've cast it last time with all the conversation, investigation with myceit tunnel. You do also see that stretched bit of fungal film is much denser here, and covers probably about 40 to 50% of the exposed rock and glass that exists. You can see pulsing bits of the Ruidian glass in proximity, not actually part of the Prime Pillar you know of, but pulsing at the same pattern, but are obscured slightly with this film, giving it almost a faintly opaqueness to its glow. The cavern opens below. You could see there's a little bit of this pool of some sort of liquid that sits about 20 feet beyond where you all landed. What would you like to do? 
TALIESIN: I think this is the place to do it. 
LAURA: Yeah, do that. 
TALIESIN: Pool or the weird spongy bit. 
LIAM: Does Orym see or hear anything lurking? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LAURA: It likes moisture. 
LIAM: That is a, it's real high. That is 32. 
MATT: 32. As you're having this conversation, you see these thin tendrils of, looks like dangling fungal strips that seem to be swaying and shifting as they slowly snake from the ceiling above you. 
LAURA: Oh no. Are these myceit fucking with us, did it pull us? 
TRAVIS: Do the seed. Do the seed! 
TALIESIN: I'm doing the seed, yeah. 
MARISHA: Drop it in, just drop it in. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we put the seed-- 
MARISHA: It's moist down here. 
TALIESIN: -- put the seed into the water. 
MATT: Place the seed into the water? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You put it towards the edge of the water and place it in there. As it settles in, the tendrils (fast whooshes) suddenly strengthen in incredible speed darting towards your hand, and as the seed leaves your grip into the water, now it looks like 12 different long, thin somewhat tattered-looking tethers of fungus all converge and pull the seed from the water where it was and it just dangles, all of them holding it in the middle of the air there. You watch it turn, almost like it's inspecting it or shifting it in the air. 
TRAVIS: Ashton grabbed the seed because it went into the water? 
SAM: Maybe the water's holy or special or something. 
TRAVIS: Protected? 
LAURA: How do these tendrils work? Are these tendrils-- 
LIAM: Yeah, are they coming out of goo in the ceiling or is there an entity above? 
MATT: Do you expand your light in the chamber? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: Darkvision 60 feet. I look up. 
TALIESIN: I rage. 
MATT: You look up. There's no singular entity, but you see the entire ceiling is just clusters of this similarly colored fungus as to the myceit, though less solid and, you know, quadrupedal, I guess, or bipedal. Just all shifting and moving, and you can see elements of it, the strips are coming free, like it's unfurling slowly, like vines that are beginning to dangle down like feelers. But you don't see a singular source. It continues, these little clusters of fungus all across the ceiling that are all connected by these long stretched tethers. 
LIAM: We're lit up and they're not extending towards us in any way? 
MATT: Not at the moment. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I am-- Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You moved, you walked-- 
LAURA: Is there an exit to this cavern? 
TRAVIS: -- towards the water, right? You took footsteps? 
TALIESIN: I did. 
LAURA: Do we see an exit to the cavern? 
ASHLEY: Maybe it's like a zipline system. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LAURA: Yeah, can you help me, Orym? 
SAM: I'm going to go over to the water and just-- 
LAURA: Do you see an exit, Orym? 
SAM: -- dip my toe in, just to see what will happen. 
MATT: Okay. You dip your toe into the water. 
ASHLEY: Your hoof. 
SAM: Uh-huh. My hoof. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: Natural 20. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: What? 
TALIESIN: Where has this been? 
ROBBIE: Who doesn't have one? 
MATT: You guys are rolling-- 
SAM: I've had one. 
MATT: -- absurd tonight. 
SAM: Except this is all-- 
MARISHA: I'm the cooler tonight. 
SAM: -- useless rolls. 
LIAM: It'll stop when the fight begins. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the thing. 
ASHLEY: That's great. Great. 
ROBBIE: That's crazy. 
LAURA: That's happened before, and then when we got to the fight, it went-- 
ASHLEY: Let's don't do that. 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: You don't have to say that. You don't have to-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: (knocks on wood) 
MATT: You dip your toe into the water and it feels cold, same general temperature as the air here, which is warmer than just outside the cavern. Just the presence of this fungus gives a bit of a warmth to the air, as well as-- 
LAURA: What if Predathos is just a big bunch of mushrooms? (laughs) This is Predathos. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
MATT: But nothing seems to react to you touching the water at all. 
TRAVIS: The underarm. 
SAM: Tendrils don't shoot down and prevent me from touching it? 
MATT: No. 
SAM: Okay, so it's specific to the seed. 
LAURA: Interesting. 
TALIESIN: Yup. 
MATT: But as the seed's held up, you can see the tethers are almost, I wouldn't say caressing it, but feeling it, touching it, learning it through touch, almost like it's turning it in its hand. Where it touched the water, the seed, which had been a solid hard object, there's one little expansion where it touched the water, the tiniest bit of a root or something that had broken through. 
TALIESIN: I am going to, since I am-- I'm going to try something. I am going to attempt to take a little bit of water. What am I going to, yeah. 
LAURA: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and splash it up and see what happens. 
TRAVIS: Splash it up. 
MATT: Onto the seed? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Make an initiative roll for me. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You're going to fuck us. 
TALIESIN: I also might add that I am raging and I have a probability rage right now, so I've got that. So that means that I'm a little luckier than I should be. 
LIAM: He's probably raging. 
MATT: You also have advantage on-- 
TALIESIN: I have advantage on initiative. 18. 
MATT: Okay. You watch this happening, and all the myceit that have gathered around that are all now focused on whatever it was that is now being held, this seed, but they don't fully understand. This is being held from this, you know, 20, 30 feet of extended, stretched, vine-like tethers of fungus holding and turning it in space. You reach down and take the water and splash it, just as the myceit see you move in that direction and shift almost to reach for you as you do. The water splashes on the seed and you watch as (emerging cracks) these odd, capillary-like, yellow-green roots begin to emerge from it, and some begin to reach up into the tethers. 
TALIESIN: Imogen, we could use some telekinetic water here. 
LAURA: What are you talking about? What am I supposed to do? 
TALIESIN: Pick up some water and put it on the seed. 
TRAVIS: Can I-- 
LAURA: What if it is angry about that? 
TALIESIN: Well, a little late now. 
TRAVIS: While this is happening, can I take out a bottle of slickshimmer oil, and I'm going to start, I'm going to hand it to Braius and be like: Time to lube up, big boy. (snickering) 
SAM: (Veth) My butt-- 
TRAVIS: Shut up and take it! 
SAM: (Braius) My butt? (laughter) 
LAURA: Nott just took over right now. (laughter) 
SAM: Okay, you're putting it on me? 
TRAVIS: I'll help you put it on yourself. 
SAM: Okay. (slick spreading) Mostly the boobs. The udders. 
LIAM: The moobs. 
TALIESIN: How does this relationship between the seed and the myceit seem to be going right now? 
MATT: Make an insight or nature check. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to hold off on splashing more water until I know if it's aggressive. 
TALIESIN: I am bad for both of these, so I'm going to let you know how that goes. 
LIAM: Fun. 
TALIESIN: 19. 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
MATT: Okay. It seems more of a curiosity. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: A foreign body has been introduced to a long-balanced ecosystem, and it is inspecting it, as it is suddenly moving in erratic and unexpected ways. It is cautiously investigating what you've brought to its home. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Fair enough. 
TALIESIN: I'll slow down, although still, I have a little while longer while I've got my wonderful little rainbow sparkle happening. 
LAURA: I have a natural 20 for looking for an exit. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: I have one more of these. 
ASHLEY: One more of the slippery slippies? 
MATT: You can see there are a number of other tunnel escapes from here, much like the one that you took. At the moment, as the masses of ceiling fungus are inspecting the seed, you watch the holes slowly grow over with fungus, like it's currently closing the exits. 
MARISHA: Are we in something's stomach? Are we being eaten? 
SAM: I think it just doesn't like the seed. 
TALIESIN: Little late now. 
ROBBIE: Mushrooms are less of a stomach. They're more of an absorbing-- 
LAURA: If my mom dies because you splashed water on it, Ashton. 
MARISHA: Yeah, they feed on-- 
TRAVIS: Wait, what's in the pool? 
TALIESIN: I mean, that would be ridiculous. 
TRAVIS: What's in the pool? 
SAM: It's just water. 
LIAM: What's in the pool? 
TALIESIN: Just water. 
TRAVIS: How deep is it? 
SAM: You want me to go down there? Can cows swim? I'll dive in and see. 
MARISHA: Can cows swim? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Fearne got the other slickshimmer oil. 
MATT: Okay, got it. 
ASHLEY: What does that do again? 
LAURA: It makes you slippery. 
ASHLEY: Makes me real slippery? 
TRAVIS: It takes one minute to apply, but you get 10 temporary hit points, which would wipe out your other ones and replace them if it was less than 10. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: And it gives you advantage if you get grappled to break free of it, as long as the temporary hit points are still there. 
MATT: Braius, you step into the water and get about waist deep. Your feet, it's like stepping into a very thick, like a pond sludge at the edges, where the mud itself is very sticky and your boots, especially with your armor, sink in, and you find a point where your feet aren't really moving, and then you feel the ground crawling around your boots-- 
SAM: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. 
MATT: -- and up your armor. The rest of you watch as Braius all of a sudden starts lifting out of the water, and you watch as the water begins to overflow and spill out into the chamber as a core pillar of this odd purple, red, black fungus seems to invert out of the center of this pool, and Braius is now almost thigh deep in whatever this is. 
SAM: Quicksand? 
MATT: You're now lifted about eight feet in the air at this point, before it stops. It just holds you there with little fungus tethers reaching and slowly crawling, but at no exponential rate. Just kind of feeling. 
LIAM: This whole room is shellacked in living organism. 
MATT: The seed is still turning in. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: You, (laughs) the best I can say is right now, whatever's happening, there is judgment being decided. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: What do you wish to do? 
LIAM: What are the myceit doing? 
MATT: Right now, they're all just quietly watching. 
ASHLEY: Orym, can you give it-- 
MATT: They're all still and watching. 
ASHLEY: -- a strawberry? 
SAM: Maybe we should just get the-- 
ASHLEY: Give it a strawberry, Orym. 
SAM: -- seed back and take it with us? How big has the seed grown to? 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: It might not let us have it back. 
MARISHA: It might think it was an offering. (mutters of agreement) 
TALIESIN: It is an offering. 
MATT: The seed's about that big, but now it has all these splintered out-- 
MARISHA: Do you think it would want one of those, the angry void dogs? Should we give it some-- 
LAURA: I feel like that's aggressive. 
TALIESIN: Let's just let this roll. 
MARISHA: Well, they're dead. 
LAURA: Are they? 
MARISHA: Does it maybe want food? 
TRAVIS: I don't think it's been-- 
LAURA: Are they dead? 
TRAVIS: -- 10 minutes since we went slip and sliding. 
LAURA: I don't think they're dead yet. 
ASHLEY: Where do we go from here? Because maybe it'll just let us go. 
LAURA: Well, all of the exits are closed. 
ASHLEY: Oh. That's right. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying really hard to just breathe slowly and stay very still. 
ROBBIE: You're still grappled? 
MARISHA: Judgment. 
SAM: Yeah, am I grappled or just being held? 
MATT: I mean, you can't move your legs. 
SAM: Great, great. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Dorian, are you singing? 
ROBBIE: ♪ (humming) ♪ 
SAM: You can't soothe emotions because they don't have emotions. 
LAURA: No, but-- 
TALIESIN: Let's just, yeah. 
LAURA: Can it speak? Does it have a mind? Can I try to sense a mind on it? 
MATT: You want to Open Mind? 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
LAURA: Could be super dangerous to do here. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I got mind on it ♪ 
LAURA: Do you have Speak with Plants? 
ASHLEY: I have Speak with Plants. 
LAURA: Talk to the plants! 
ASHLEY: I have Speak with Plants. 
SAM: I don't think fungus is a plant. 
ASHLEY: I don't, I know. 
SAM: Are they? Let's find out. Let's find out. (skeptical groaning) 
TRAVIS: It grows from the soil! 
MATT: In the broad spectrum-- 
MARISHA: Technically not a plant. 
MATT: -- of D&D categories, (uncertain groan) you can certainly try. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'll try. I'll try. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Hell yeah. 
ASHLEY: I mean, worst that can happen, it doesn't work. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
ASHLEY and MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: It's all right, Sam can make another character. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to step forward to where some of the tendrils are, a little bit closer to Braius, and just hold my hand out. 
MATT: Okay. You hold your hand out to where Braius is locked in, the seed being turned over in front of you. The occasional bits of exposed Ruidian glass, pulsing and glowing, giving light to the space beyond what you have used to light it from within. You reach your hand out and you watch as that pillar of matter, a pseudopod of it emerges (slippery squelches) and (clutches) wraps around your wrist and (growing clasp) up your forearm a bit. 
ASHLEY: Maybe that wasn't a good idea. 
MATT: You are connected. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
MATT: You feel a consciousness touch yours-- 
MARISHA: Wait-- 
MATT: -- in a different way than how Imogen has spoken into your mind, but you feel suddenly, you can sense the chamber. You can sense all the myceit around. 
ASHLEY: I know kung fu. (laughter) 
MATT: You can sense whatever you're speaking to isn't here, it's here. 
LAURA: (whistles) 
ASHLEY: Hello. How are you? I'm fine. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: We're just passing through. We don't mean any harm. The myceits are our friends and we were just kind of sliding on through. 
MATT: The colors in your mind shift-- 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: -- from the blues and pinks of curious welcoming to a questioning yellow, and the seed has descended slightly towards you. You get the sense it wants to know why and what. 
ASHLEY: About the seed? Do you like the seed? Do you want the seed? I can take the seed and we can go away forever. 
MATT: "Why? What?" 
SAM: Pitch it to him. 
ASHLEY: Ashton, It wants to know why-- 
TALIESIN: I can't hear it. Oh. 
ASHLEY: -- you wanted to plant the seed here. 
TALIESIN: It's a friend who wanted to explore. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: It was lonely. 
TRAVIS: A new home. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I love all those things. 
TALIESIN: It was a friend who wanted to explore and see something else. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll say that. This is just a friend that's lonely and wants a home to explore. Would love to have a new home. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: From the dream. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
SAM: Persuade the mushroom. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Aren't you really persuasive, or is that deceptive? 
ASHLEY: I'm persuasive. 
ROBBIE: Don't make that face. Crush it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Crush it. 
LIAM: Roll a 20. Get your 20. 
LAURA: (gasps) You did. 
ASHLEY: But-- 
LAURA: That's a 20! 
SAM: That's a 20. 
LAURA: It's a 20, dude! 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: So, that would mean 33. 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. 
ROBBIE: (silent laugh) 
TALIESIN: What is happening? 
ASHLEY: I mean, yeah? 
LAURA: That's a 20. You can read it as a 20. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh, we're-- 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
ROBBIE and SAM: (excited sigh) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh! 
ROBBIE: Good omen? Bad omen? 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MATT: One of the numerous alien consciousnesses that call Ruidus home. An entity that you can't begin to understand or grasp its history, its longevity, its true capacity for knowledge or communication. But in this moment, this interconnected moment, you just speak from the mind of something that has known loneliness and convey that memory of your own as the bridge of understanding to this entity. It seems that it understands very well what it means to be lonely. 
ASHLEY: Aw! I'll also try, with my fingers, just try to twirl some of the tendrils with-- 
MATT: As you do, all the myceit in unison go, "(giggle)" 
ASHLEY: Aw! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I love that. 
MATT: It offers back a sense of emotion as well. A series of dark expanses, of misuse, of being taken from its children. You see flashes of the Weave Mind. You see flashes of an odd limbo that it exists between what is above and what is below. It is aware of what's below. You're uncertain if it has any opinion on it, but it acknowledges what it is you ask and what it is you offer, and as its tendril pulls away from you, the seed is lifted up and embraced within the fungal tethers, and slowly you watch as the expansion of the seed's green and yellow root-like reaching pseudopods begin to intertwine and weave with the core of the immediately visible cluster. Then it comes to a moment of equilibrium. (whooshes) All the other tunnels that had closed off earlier open up. (relieved sighs) 
LAURA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! Color in that blue wheel, baby! 
LAURA: Come on, blue wheel! 
TALIESIN: You sexy fucking legend. 
LAURA: Ashton, I apologize. That was smart. 
ASHLEY: That was smart. That was smart. 
TALIESIN: It was dumb. It just worked out well. Justi's going to owe us so fucking much when we get home. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'll take lucky. 
LAURA: Let's go. 
ASHLEY: We'll chase you till we go-- 
SAM: Guys, guys, guys. I'm still stuck in here. 
TRAVIS: Braius stuck in the red rock and the foam thing. 
MATT: The minute you start moving, it (slurping) in almost an apologetic way, like, "Oh, right." (squelches) 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry. 
SAM: (huffs) Okay, okay, okay. I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. 
MARISHA: All right, are there any more slip and slides? 
LAURA: Is there a way through the myceit? Myceit? 
MATT: At this point, the rest of the myceit continue to grab your arms and fingers and pull you along to the far end of this chamber, and as you move, you can watch the floor the spreading aspects of the fungus almost seems to pull away to offer a nicer walking path before leading you to one particular larger exit tunnel than the one that you had previously pushed towards. 
TRAVIS: As we're moving, is it water that was in this pool, or is it some other kind of viscous liquid? 
MATT: Make a nature or an investigation check. 
TRAVIS: Natural 19-- 
TALIESIN: Guests per minute on this ride is kind of low. 
TRAVIS: -- for a 27. 
MATT: It has the consistency of water if only slightly thicker. Best you can tell, it's probably a combination of either condensation or liquid that has been funneled from elsewhere in this cavern network that has been gathered here to maintain a part of this network, a level of moisture that it prefers. 
SAM: Oh, you're going to lick it? 
TRAVIS: Just a little taste. 
ASHLEY: Just a little taste? 
MATT: You taste a little bit? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: It has a metallic taste. Not like in like a penny or copper, but almost like a-- 
TRAVIS: Minerally? 
MATT: Very minerally. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Like water that's been left out a couple months. 
MATT: Yeah, hard water. It tastes like the "Pirates of the Caribbean." (laughter) 
MATT: A little bit. A little bit. 
TALIESIN: And he's out. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: That seed is going to turn into something we meet in campaign five. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm hoping so. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Let's go check out the holes. 
SAM: (chuckles) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: To the exits? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Although, the myceit might-- 
LAURA: Yeah, they sent us to one specifically. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Well, they were pointing us the direction while you were licking water. 
TRAVIS: (babbles) 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Imagining "Tron." 
TRAVIS: (chuckles) 
MATT: You're the one at the front. 
LAURA: I keep going. How much farther-- Can I communicate with them and try to see how much farther it is along the tunnels? 
MATT: You extend your consciousness to it and the best you can ascertain is this tunnel actually divides a couple of times and you get the sense to go truly down, stay to the left. 
LAURA: Okay. Glad I asked. Let's go to the left. 
MATT: Okay. This one is gradual. You get in and you have to scoot yourself a little bit, before it begins to descend. As you do, that similar sort of liquid that you had just tasted almost seems to-- I don't want to say excrete, but it is funneled into this chamber to make it a little easier to traverse. Right as you (whoosh) into an extreme drop. (whoosh) Into darkness below 
LIAM: Antica... (exclaims) PATION! (laughter) 
MATT: (whooshes) 
TALIESIN: Action Park. 
MATT: It widens a little bit and you feel yourself-- Normally you use your hands on the sides to keep yourself going. Now it's getting harder to reach the edges. It's like a much wider slide. 
LAURA: I just keep my body leaning left so that if it goes then it'll go that direction. 
SAM: Sure! 
TALIESIN: I'm doing the-- 
TRAVIS: The water slide? 
TALIESIN: -- water slide drop. 
TRAVIS: I have control, I have control. 
MATT: I would like another group athletics or acrobatics check. 
SAM: Here we go. 
MARISHA: Oh man, let me not biff it this time, please. 
TALIESIN: Eh, not as good. 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
ALL: Yeah! 
MATT: Whoo! 
ASHLEY: Why? Why? 
MARISHA: Why? 
LIAM: We're gonna die! 
MARISHA: Why?! 
ROBBIE: Have we collected them all yet? 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MARISHA: I don't like it! 
MATT: All right. 
ROBBIE: 29. 
MATT: Ooh. 
SAM: 25. 
MATT: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Four. (laughter) 
LAURA: 21. 
TRAVIS: Is it a negative, though? 
LIAM: 22. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: 12. 
ASHLEY: No, I rolled a two and I get plus two. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Rocks. 
ASHLEY: Same roll as last time. 
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Rocks! 
ROBBIE: Ooh, it matters. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: You guys have rolled so good. 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Makes up for the zip line. 
MATT: (whooshes) 
LAURA: Yeah, no joke. 
TRAVIS: (pings) 
MATT: You scoot back and forth along it and at one point it seems to even out and as it flattens a bit, the slight chute-like shape of it becomes a little harder to guide your position. You're just sliding in a direction. With a brief moment of recognition, you see a divide coming your way where it splits off in two different paths. 
LIAM: Oh jeez. 
MATT: You push off to the left, the rest of you following her lead and utilizing what light you have trailing behind you and communicating verbally, one by one you all manage to get over to the side. A couple of you wing it-- (groan)-- and spin off and slide for a second before you have to catch yourself, scooting at an angle a little bit. But you continue down the pathway, it turns into a large corkscrew. (whoosh) 
LAURA: Oh, creepy. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah! 
LAURA: This is awesome. 
MATT: You leave the path again, into the air. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
MATT: You were the one up front, what do you have to set the light? 
LAURA: I have my light in my globies. My globies can I light them up as soon as I hit the air and see what's around us? 
MATT: As soon as you hit the air you can see the path just descended quickly below you and you're about to meet it again. But there is also a massive chasm below that is just empty darkness-- 
ASHLEY: Oh man. 
MATT: -- that this shoots over and across. You can see there are stretched thin tethers of fungus that reach like tightropes, but they are spread out below and you see an abyss below you. Using that light, and a little bit of your psychic power to push yourself to the left-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: -- and hit what is a wide portion of that without careening off into the chasm to the right. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Jeez. 
LIAM: Wow. 
MATT: The rest of you follow suit, catching off that point. I would like one more acrobatics or athletics check from the group. 
SAM: Here we go, this is it. 
TRAVIS: Either one, right? Acrobatics or athletics? 
MARISHA: This is where fuckin'-- 
MATT: Yep. Your choice. 
MARISHA: Acrobatics or-- either one. Okay. 
MATT: Starting over here, Ashton. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: That's a-- where'd it go? 17. 
MATT: 17. 
LIAM: 14. 
MATT: 14 
LIAM: Rolled real bad. 
LAURA: Nine. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Same, four. 
MATT: Same, four. 
LIAM: Four? 
SAM: Nine. 
LIAM: Wow. 
ROBBIE: 17. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: 27. 
TALIESIN: Phew. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: A couple good ones. 
LAURA: The last time that happened-- 
TALIESIN: Very middle-y. 
LAURA: -- we got some bankeys. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: As you all begin to clear this chasm, and thankfully you all do, but the process of trying to not fall into endless darkness and what horrible death awaits you below. You all scatter on what is now not a chute but a smoothed plane of slightly damp rock. but a smoothed plane of slightly damp rock. It's like-- you are skidding a bit across it but you're also spreading out a little bit and it takes a moment for you to realize that you're all separating in different points. You can see other tunnel entries coming your way rapidly and you all begin to try and arrange it before you all continue your path on different slides. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ALL: Oh no! No! 
ROBBIE: We didn't do so good! 
LAURA: No! This feels like one of the rooms-- 
TRAVIS: Damn it, Fearne! 
ASHLEY: I know! 
LAURA: -- the middle spaces. 
MATT: The middle spaces. 
ROBBIE: She got those hooves. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
MATT: Subterranean Ruidus, very much hits that. Eventually the slide comes to a close and you all you are in a darkened cavern space with no light (spooky voice) and no doors. No. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Who rolled lower than a 10? 
MARISHA: What do you mean? On our last roll? 
LAURA: On our last roll. 
MATT: The three of you emerge together. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: But it's only you three. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Where's everyone? 
MATT: The other four of you all end up gathering in another tunnel. 
SAM: Those guys failed! (laughter) 
LAURA: Lights. Where are we? 
MATT: Lights. You are at some sort of a platform almost like where the slide came to an end there is a somewhat oval-like shaped natural rock pillar top that has that long mineral deposit buildup on it where it has the edges almost like they're wrinkled as they remove, but you know, you can sense moisture in the air. But a lot of this looks dry where you sit at the moment. You light up around you and there are other platforms around and you step to the edge and you can see the faintest glimmer of a fairly massive distant pulsing part of a fairly massive distant pulsing part of Prime Pillar glass. But it's a number of platforms below. 
LAURA: Oh man. Like we're going to have to leap that? 
MATT: The other four of you, as you begin to take in your surroundings you can see that as well down there. You also see on another platform about four different points off. You can direct where it is. You can see Imogen's globules emerge and glow. Giving you at least a little bit of visual beacon to where your friends are, though definitely in a different part of this massive chasm. 
LAURA: How long has it been since that other chamber? 
MATT: Since the previous one? Couple minutes. 
LAURA: Okay, so I still have Fly. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: So I can float up. 
MATT: Well-- here, I'll tell you what. Roll a concentration check for me. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: This is not like casting Fly, though, this is Havoc's Embrace. 
MATT: Okay, well then, yeah, then you still have fly, its not a spell. 
ROBBIE: Maybe how long since the previous cavern when we first met our little friends? Not the scary cavern. 
MATT: Since then? 15 minutes or so. 
ROBBIE: Okay. Cool. 
LIAM: Failed roll group is higher than successful roll group? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: All right. 
SAM: So we're up, we have to get down? 
ASHLEY: So we didn't get down as far. 
LAURA: Yeah, we have to make it to that. 
MATT: You have to meet up with your other friends. 
ASHLEY: I can Fly and you can hop on my back. 
SAM: Can you carry me? I'm sort of heavy. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I can carry you. 
SAM: All right. 
LAURA: Great. 
ASHLEY: Shoebill. 
MATT: And shoebill. 
ROBBIE: Are they closer in proximity to the faint glow of the pillar down low? We're further? Or you're further? 
SAM: What does that slippery oil do that you put on me? 
TRAVIS: Slickshimmer gives you 10 temporary hit points, as long as the hit points are there you have advantage against being grappled. You have advantage on any attempt to escape being grappled or restrained as long as the hit points are up. 
SAM: Okay, how long does it last? 
TRAVIS: As long as those 10 temporary hit points are there, even if there's one left. 
SAM: Does that replace the seven temporary hit points? 
LAURA and MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yes, it does. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, so you're-- It doesn't stack. Yeah. 
SAM: You lost yours since-- 
MATT: So the troop of those three Sorry, I didn't specify. The troop of those three are further up in the darkened cavern. The rest of you are closer to this exposed part of the Prime Pillar glass. 
MARISHA: So we have a better view of it? 
MATT: You do. 
MARISHA: Do we see anything? Does it look like there's a platform? Does it look like we're getting close to Predathos? 
MATT: I can help with some of this. So to give a little visual range here. 
TRAVIS: Just reaches down next to his chair and grabs some fucking awesome little set pieces. 
MATT: (laughs) Just down by the chair of Mercer. 
ROBBIE: So did you two just take off? 
SAM: We're about to. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Whatever lies below the DM screen. Wait, a fuckin' hourglass? 
ROBBIE: We can see you down there. 
TALIESIN: But it always makes me nervous. 
MATT: So this might help for a visual. 
TRAVIS: It's always a fricking hourglass of doom. 
TALIESIN: So while they get over to us, we've got to figure out the best way to get over there. 
MATT: So you are all up on top of here, we'll say, and then the rest of the group is down there below. 
LAURA: We're trying to get where? 
MATT: Down over this space. 
LAURA: Oh! So we're closer to it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Our fail got us further. 
SAM: No. We're up there. 
MATT: Sorry, I misheard you guys are up top here. 
LAURA: Oh. We are? They're down there. 
MATT: Yeah. The other group is down here and it's about-- 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: -- as you take a little bit to move the light globules around to get a better sense of space and gap here. It's about 60 or so feet from that platform to this one at a downward angle. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: You're going to fly. 
LAURA: Yeah. We'll fly. Yeah, we fly. 
MARISHA: This is amazing. 
MATT: Yeah, you'll just roll another 20, let's go. 
LAURA: We just fly, the three of us. 
ASHLEY: How do you all get down? 
LAURA: Well, we fly down to the other group. 
MATT: You fly down and meet up with the other group. 
LAURA: Yeah. Then how far is it to get to the other light source? 
MATT: To where the pillar of light is probably about 200 feet. 
TRAVIS: Before we do that-- In the darkness, 60 feet, looking around, anything above us? Any tendrils, any creatures? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Great. 
MATT: At disadvantage. You have darkvision actually, so you're fine. 
TRAVIS: But just regular roll. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Nat 20. 
TRAVIS: 11. 
MATT: 11. Don't really see a ceiling in here. It's just open space from what you can make out. 
TRAVIS: Any-- since I can't see, can I give a (sniffs)? Anything familiar or totally no? 
MATT: So with the same roll-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. It smells like the intensity of that fungus smell has mostly left at this point. It still lingers faintly, but it looks like you've probably moved through the layer of Ruidus' levels where it was most dense, where it would probably have called it its home. 
TRAVIS: Okay, 200 feet. 
MARISHA: That Prime Pillar, does it have a surrounding platform? Do we see any movements? How close? 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
MARISHA: Okay. This one's been doing me good. 
LAURA: All of us are on the lower and we're trying to get all the way over. 
MARISHA: I said it out loud, too. 15. 
MATT: 15. You get a pretty decent view of where the glass glow is and you can see just a sheet, But as it pulses you can see some variation to the texture to where it looks like there are branches that push out of the glass, almost like a broken tree branch that pushes outward this way. At first you didn't notice it because it looked like a solid bit, but as you move side to side, you can make out that it's stretched loosely in your direction. That's about as much as you can make. 
TRAVIS: Are there any bridges from these platforms to each other or are they just singular and outcropping? 
MATT: They're just singular outcroppings. 
TRAVIS: If you look down over the edge of it, it's just down into darkness as well? 
MATT: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Fucking shit. 
LAURA: That's creepy. 
TRAVIS: So we got to fly. 
LIAM: Have we joined the two groups? 
MARISHA and LAURA: Yes. 
LIAM: Thank you. 
SAM: As we fly, I'm going to, as I hold onto your back, I'm going to pump in 17 points of healing with Lay on Hands. 
ASHLEY: That's exactly what I need. 
TRAVIS: How do we fly? 
LAURA: Well, we can cast it. 
ASHLEY: I give you a nuzzle. 
TRAVIS: On enough people? 
TALIESIN: Do we have enough people? Can we get everybody across this thing? 
SAM: Can't Fearnie here just ferry people back and forth? 
ASHLEY: I think I can carry two, right? Yeah. 
LAURA: That's true. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (squawks) 
MARISHA: If we save some spell slots. 
SAM: How long does it last? 
LIAM: Right, it might take some time. 
LAURA: I can carry you. I mean, I can carry somebody small. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Dorian can fly, right? 
ASHLEY: Five hours. 
MARISHA: Do you have to cast? 
ROBBIE: And I got one cast of Fly in my mandolin, too. 
SAM: But she could just ferry people over. 
ASHLEY: I can ferry people, I have it for five hours, so whoever needs a ride. 
LAURA: All right, cool, let's go back and forth then. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: I'll save it. 
MARISHA: It's only 200 feet, that's not too bad. 
LAURA: I'll grab Orym with me. 
MATT: Not too bad. So cruising around, it takes a few minutes to get everybody over to that point. Roll a d20 for me. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: One of the good ones. 
ASHLEY: I don't like the way that you said that. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I don't appreciate your tone. 
ASHLEY: I don't appreciate your tone, sir. (laughter) Okay. 
ROBBIE: It's just for how tasty your snacks are. 
ASHLEY: But I love you. (laughter) 
SAM: And I hate you. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
ROBBIE and TALIESIN: Hey! 
MATT: Yeah. Navigating the space, even as dark as it is with your friend's light, it goes pretty quickly. Indeed you find this outstretched, now that you get closer to it, it is stretched a good 30 feet out from the side of the glass. It has almost a hand-like look to its protrusion made of that solid, jagged-looking Ruidian glass. As it merges in with the wall, the pillar, as you get next to it, you can see the reason why this part is glowing is because a lot of it is still embedded in the wall and there's almost a marbling to it where this section of it, the rock or the glass is slightly more porous or maybe it's not as strong as others, where the Prime Pillar is solid mass. Here, it looks like some of the rock is merged with it, and it looks like some of it has crumbled away. You do see some nearby tunnel openings where it looks like a continuation of a burrowed tunnel has come to an abrupt end and fallen into nothing. 
LIAM: A burrowed tunnel? 
MATT: Meaning the size of the tunnel that you guys entered here from. 
MARISHA: So a carved tunnel. 
MATT: Whatever burrowed the original tunnel through seems to have burrowed out-- 
LAURA: And dropped. 
MATT: -- and dropped, or at least ends into nothing. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: So are we on the edge of a singular pillar with nothing around us? 
MATT: It looks like a little bit. 
LAURA: ♪ The edge, the edge ♪ 
ASHLEY: So we don't know where to go. 
ROBBIE: We're still trying to make our way to your mom. But here's the question. Anybody who has an innate sense of direction, I would think Chetney-- 
LAURA: Do we just go down? 
ROBBIE: Would know that we're going-- Because when we headed off, we had an idea of a direction, at least. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Now we've been, I mean-- 
SAM: I have Labyrinthine Recall. I always know which direction is north. And I have advantage on any survival check to navigate or track. 
MATT: Make a survival check for me with advantage. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
SAM: 19 plus survival, plus one for 20. 
MATT: As you're all looking out into the darkness and looking at this glass, from where you are at the end of this, you look at the wall, the solid wall, the weird texture of where that marbling and stone blends in in places. You step to the right, step to the left. You can see it's almost like an illusion where what would be striations of cracked glass, there's actually gaps that are overlapping. There are parts that are closer, parts that are further. 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
LAURA: (Australian accent) Don't go that way. 
MATT: Yeah, not dislike that. You begin to walk along the rest of this glass branch, it glowing and pulsing beneath you. At this point, at this depth, too, every time it pulses, there's this faint (buzzing) bassy buzz in your mind. (buzzing) bassy buzz in your mind. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I was wondering, does it give us a weird (retching) feeling or something? 
MATT: Not yet. 
MARISHA: Not yet. Okay, great. 
ROBBIE: Not barfy yet. 
MARISHA: Not barfy yet. 
MATT: But following Braius along this branch of Ruidian glass, you eventually come to the exterior of it. Indeed there is a cavern, a cleft part of it where glass had broken or it's been broken and it looks like it continues inward. At a quick glance, too, there are traces of dirt and rock inside that you're like, "Someone's been here." 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Does it look like we can go down, or? 
MATT: It looks like it goes straight in at the moment, but you can only see about 15 or so feet before it winds off. 
LIAM: It's reversible. 
TALIESIN: We'll say if he is trying to absorb your mom, we're about to really, really make him want to leave. (exhales) 
LAURA: Well, let's go. 
TRAVIS: Let's go down. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Does it feel-- I mean, there's no way to know. Will we go and we are up there when we're getting there? 
ROBBIE: Are we there yet? 
LAURA: Are we there? (laughter) 
LAURA: Are you there, Predathos? It's me, Imogen! (laughter) 
MATT: Following Braius' natural instinct to weave through broken and difficult pathways, there are parts where these glass paths branch off, almost like a hall of mirrors. It's pulsing around you in all directions. It's very hard to grasp what's up and down at certain points. It's an odd fun house that is not fun at all. Some branched paths you look over and can begin to follow if you want to inspect it. It eventually comes to an end, like a pincer point where you would be stuck if you were to push any further and you pull back. But Braius feels strongly of a position, eventually emerging from the glass out of the center of the Prime Pillar and back into a cavern. And you can hear voices muttering. And a soft, faint weeping 
LAURA: (softly) Mama? 
LIAM: Can I tell the rough distance how far away we are? 
MATT: Make a perception check. It's just the echoing of the sounds and the noise in here. 
LIAM: That is a 29. 
MATT: I love it. (laughs) Can't be more than a couple hundred feet from where you are right now. It's echoing through the halls. 
MARISHA: What's our play here? 
SAM: Attack fast, quick. 
LAURA: Go in and jump on them. 
LIAM: Take a look at it and then when we're ready-- 
TRAVIS: I could send the eye to go look fast. 
MARISHA: It's a good idea, I like it. 
TRAVIS: It's invisible. 
TALIESIN: Cast Pass Without a Trace on us, too, just to have it up in case we want to start walking. 
TRAVIS: I'll pull out the Monocle of True Essence and Mr. Peanut that shit and I'll cast Arcane Eye to move towards the direction, towards the sound. 
MATT: Towards the sound. 
TRAVIS: It's invisible. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Has no limit on its distance. 
MARISHA: Maybe you should have this pipe, it would really go with the aesthetic. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: The Arcane Eye apparates and your vision pushes into it as it begins to, rapid as it can, glide through this weaving rock cavern that emerges from this exterior of the glass pillar and seems to coast around the base exterior of it. It's on the far left, following the same spiral pattern you first entered this cavern from. It doesn't take too long for it to come around the bend. You can see there is a fractured tunnel You can see there is a fractured tunnel that looks like it pushes directly into the Prime Pillar. Around it, various platforms of broken red and dark rock. The exposed 30, 40 feet of this cavern space of the Ruidian glass itself pulsing, its jagged bits pushed up onto it. On this platform, you see is a very faint field, like a spherical shell that is encasing a familiar Ludinus Da'leth who stands there with his hands together. And floating above him, slowly turning catatonic, it seems, quietly whimpering, is Liliana Temult. You see figures standing around it. Make a perception check for me. 
ROBBIE: Come on, baby. 
TRAVIS: Does the eye have a better modifier than me? 13. 
MATT: 13. At a quick glance, you see four figures that are standing around that are focused on the two of them wearing Vanguard attire. They themselves, from what you can see along their arms that are exposed from the robes, reddish, purple, jagged designs faintly glowing up their arms, denoting these likely to be Exaltants helping enable this process. Liliana, her hair white, her skin pale, her fingertips crumbling. (gasping) 
TRAVIS: There's at least 10 of them in there. We got to go. Your mom does not look good. 
LAURA: Let's go. I start moving forward. 
MATT: Rest of you follow suit? 
MARISHA: Well, you said we're about 200-- 
LIAM: And someone said Pass Without a Trace? 
TALIESIN: I put up Pass Without a Trace. 
MARISHA: Mirror Image. 
TRAVIS: I take off the monocle and quietly (muffled werewolf transformation). (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Wolf out. 
MARISHA: I will also Form of Dread. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Yeah, right as I get close, I'm going to activate my robe. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Is it an Otiluke's Resilient Sphere or something? 
TRAVIS: Some kind of protective sphere. 
MARISHA: Protective sphere. 
TRAVIS: But I mean, we have a staff that can-- 
LAURA: Wait, should we have used that short rest thing? That's mid fight. That's a mid fight situation. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: As you make your preparations and charge in behind Imogen towards-- 
ASHLEY: I'm going to bring up Mister as well. 
MATT: Bring up Mister as well. 
SAM: I'm going to inspire Imogen. 
MATT: How do you inspire her? 
SAM: I inspire her by quickly taking out my paintbrush and doodling a smiley face on my armor right here. (laughter) 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: Take your d6. 
ROBBIE: From behind us, there's a faint yellow glow and no sound as Coriolis walks down the path up behind me. I'll go to Orym and say, "It's up to you. Do you want to be a mounted fighter?" 
MARISHA: Oh shit, that's dope. 
LIAM: It's hard to pass up. 
ROBBIE: Put my hands down like this, even though you've got a 30 foot vertical. 
LIAM: Yeah. (giggling) 
LAURA: Oh, right. As we're getting close to it, I'm also going to touch Chet and cast Jump on him. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: That gives you-- 
LIAM: Probably a quick kiss on the cheek as he passes up and over and onto Coriolis. 
SAM: I start crying. 
LAURA: Once on each of his turns until this spell ends-- (laughter) 
LAURA: You can jump up to 30 feet by spending 10 feet of movement. So if something's in the sky, you might be able to get to it. 
TALIESIN: Anybody got some intelligence resistance shit? Because that's definitely a place where I will become a problem. 
SAM: Intelligence resistance. 
LAURA: Didn't somebody give you that? Did somebody give you that before? 
TALIESIN: I'll double check but I feel like we did maybe. 
TRAVIS: As we're making these preparations, Matt said. 
ROBBIE: And he can understand you. 
TALIESIN: I'll double check. 
MATT: As you finish these preparations-- 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: -- and go charging into the chamber to face the Exaltants and Ludinus Da'leth himself in what could very well be the final moments of Liliana Temult. We're going to go to break. (groaning) 
MATT: We'll see you guys here in a few minutes. Enjoy! (groaning)

The cuteness! It's overpowering. Check it out. Look. It has pockets. Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself. Oh my gosh, it's so amazing. This is a lot of stuff, you guys.

♪ (posh orchestral music) ♪ 
TALIESIN: (British accent) This week on "Critical Roadshow," we've traveled to one of several sets in the Critical Role studios. This particular set is where "4-Sided Dive" is filmed, along with other famed productions, such as that one Critmas Promo, that other Critmas Promo, as well as several other promos. We've brought in our finest antiques dealer to evaluate and appraise items that have been brought in from every corner of the building. We go now to our first item. 
MATT: As I understand, there's an interesting story about how you came into possession of these items. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I was playing a game of street dice in Macau, and the stakes got pretty high, I almost lost some fingers, but I didn't. And, you know, I came out on top. Won a Soviet submarine. No big deal. 
MATT: This is a rare find. These keys, user manual, and, most importantly, signal beacon, are from the Shchuka-class Project 671RTM. And while they had a payload of Zircon hypersonic and Onik anti-ship missiles, they were never able to provide an exclusive Discord, pre-sales for live events, or 10% off merchandise. I'd appraise a functional military sub of this era at about $400,000,000. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! It is docked in Vladivostok right now, but I'm going to go pick it up and bring it back here. No problem. Yes! 
MATT: Truly a rare find. So what do we have here? 
JARED: Well, I heard that you're giving away tons of cash for people who bring in cool stuff, so I brought this. 
MATT: Is that a photo of Kevin Beacon? 
JARED: I'm sorry, did you say Kevin Bacon or Kevin Beacon? 
MATT: Wonderful actor. Classic photo and signed. However, unlike a Beacon membership, it does not provide instant access to all new content. So, I'd estimate this between $6 to $7. 
JARED: That's it? Okay, fine. I'll take the money. 
MATT: Oh, I don't buy any of the items. I just estimate their value. 
JARED: And you get paid for this? 
MATT: Yeah. 
JARED: Wow. I need to become a voice actor. 
MATT: Truly a rare find. Now, this is a truly exciting discovery. 
TRAVIS: (sad and offended noise) 
MATT: This beacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich is exquisitely crafted, beautifully designed. While you can enjoy a meal like this for a few minutes, a Beacon membership unlocks thousands of hours of entertainment, now available on desktop and mobile. 
TRAVIS: I'm trying to eat my lunch. 
MATT: Truly a rare find. 
TRAVIS: (intimidatingly chews) 
MATT: And what do we have here? 
MARISHA: Yeah, you said you needed stuff with the word "beacon" on it, so, I found this prop from an old Beacon promo. 
MATT: Ah, yes. Beacon promos are great and well-written content. But Beacon also has a number of original series such as "Re-Slayers Take," "Critical Role Cooldown," and "Crit Role Abridged," as well as more to come, all available when you have membership to Beacon. I'd value this record at 75 cents. 
MARISHA: Okay. I think you can dial it back, sweetheart. 
MATT: Truly a rare find. And what did you bring? 
SAM: What? No, I didn't. I'm looking for Jared. He took my signed Kevin Bacon picture? I signed it myself. Jared, no? Not ringing a bell? He's our Junior Lorekeeper. Jared. Jared, I think. Maybe. I'm gonna say, Jared. 
MATT: Truly a rare find. Now, this may be the find of the day, a Beacon membership. (chuckles) May I hold it? 
LAURA: Yeah. Just be careful. 
MATT: Of course. Of course. (sighs happily) The craftsmanship, the design, the understated beauty! A Beacon membership is only $5.99 a month, but is absolutely priceless. Truly irreplaceable-- (glass shattering) 
LAURA: Dude. 
TALIESIN: Well, that was most interesting. But please do become a Beacon member because the poor sap who wrote this has added this text to the teleprompter to say that they will get sacked if this ad doesn't do well. The end. The end? Who writes "The End" at the end of a teleprompter feed? Don't let whoever did that touch the teleprompter ever again. Worst writing ever. God!

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. All right, so as you all come charging in from the far hallway, this is the rapid visual of what you see from that perspective. 
SAM: Oh my goodness. 
MATT: These four and one fifth member, concentrating that was not seen-- 
LAURA: Oh! Was hidden! 
MATT: -- from the perspective of the eye from behind here. 
ROBBIE: Five. 
MATT: While the rest of you come charging through that side. 
ROBBIE: Holy smokes. 
MATT: So, what order are you all entering? 
LAURA: I feel like I'd be leading the charge. 
MATT: Flying, of course? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: If it's a trap, can I go in front of you? 
LAURA: You can go in front of me. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Age before beauty. Back up. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah. 
MATT: All that went in the middle there. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, crunching. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to be doing it the whole game. I'm nervous eating now. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I got gum when these chips are gone. 
MATT: So we have the rest of you all entering from this back tunnel entryway. We'll say those who moved the slowest-- 
TRAVIS: Put me 10 in front. 
MATT: You said 10 in front? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, 10 in front. 
LIAM: Say again? 
TALIESIN: Is this "smoke 'em if you got 'em" time? 
TRAVIS: Oh, and in werewolf form. 
LIAM: Ah, I don't know. 
MATT: Oh that's right, yeah. He transformed. Let's go. So 10 in the front there. The rest of you. Imogen to the front entering as well. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: Laudna probably behind her 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll be behind. 
MATT: Okay, and Imogen would be flying, probably up a little closer than other folks. Then Coriolis who can also fly, right? 
LAURA: Amazing! 
ROBBIE: Oh yes he can fly. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
ROBBIE: Yeah, baby! 
LAURA: Hi. Hi, pookie. 
LIAM: Let's go. I would think I would help lead the charge as well. 
MATT: All right. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
MATT: Let's make that so. 
LIAM: Just a pennant flapping in the wind. 
LAURA: Whoa, and you can fly, too. You can fly, too, for all I care. 
SAM: (sneezes) 
MATT: Gesundheit. 
LIAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: That was a dad sneeze. 
MARISHA: Bless you. 
SAM: Sorry about that. 
MATT: There we are. 
SAM: I just wanted attention. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) You got it. You got it. 
MATT: Okay. As you all begin to rush into the chamber, Orym, you also glance-- 
SAM and LIAM: Uh-oh! 
MATT: -- out sight on this side it looks to be-- 
SAM: More buggies! 
MATT: -- another Exultant right there-- 
LAURA: Shit! 
MATT: -- with a glass blade that they have at the ready. As you all come running through, the sound of footsteps does reverberate into the chamber enough where everyone who's concentrating glances over in your direction. You hear Ludinus speak out. "Let them not interrupt her judgment. Her gift shall remain key to freeing us from the tyranny of the divine." I need everyone to roll initiative. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Wow! 
MARISHA: Her judgment. 
LAURA: Yeah, because she fucking was-- 
MARISHA: She fucked up! 
LAURA: -- betraying him. 
LIAM: Whoa. 
SAM: This combat is brought to you by WizKids and their Baby Trinket life-size figure. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Life-size? 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: Baby Trinket life-size?! 
LAURA: He's the life-size of a baby Trinket. 
ROBBIE: Baby. 
SAM: Okay. Available for pre-order now. Say hello to Vex'ahlia's animal companion in this adorable 12-inch tall baby Trinket. 
LAURA: Yeah, he's real cute. 
MATT: It's super cute. It's really cute. 
SAM: Uh-huh. Pre-order at your local game store or at wizkid.io/babytrinket. I was picturing a bear-sized. 
LAURA: No no no. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Baby. (laughter) 
LAURA: He's real sweet. 
MATT: All right, 25 to 20? 
LIAM: I biffed it. 
TRAVIS: 21. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh really? 
LIAM: I biffed it real bad. 
TRAVIS: You did? 
LIAM: Yeah. I rolled a two and a four. 
ROBBIE: Wow! 
MARISHA: No! You never do that. 
ROBBIE: Oh no. Chet, you're first? 
MARISHA: This is so unlike you. 
LIAM: I used all my 20s. 
MATT: 20 to 15? 
LAURA: Don't say that. 
MARISHA: 15. 
SAM: 16. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Fearne, Braius. 
TALIESIN: Fearne, Braius. 
MARISHA: Fearne, Braius. 
TRAVIS: Dead woman. 
MARISHA: Laudna. 
MATT: Laudna, your dexterity is? 
MARISHA: Ooh. My dexterity is 16. 
MATT: All righty. 15 to 10. 
LIAM: 10. 
LAURA: 13. 
ROBBIE and TALIESIN: 14. 
SAM: Uh oh. Triple rollies. 
MATT: 14-- I have Ashton and? You got 14 as well? 
ROBBIE: Yep. 14. 
MATT: Let's rollies, let's go. 
ROBBIE: Ooh. 
SAM: Triple rollies. 
TALIESIN: Ready? 
LAURA: No, I'm not a rollie. 
SAM: Just do it anyway. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Make eye contact. Oh shit! 
ROBBIE: Three. 
TALIESIN: Seven. 
LAURA: Wow. Okay. 
TALIESIN: So Laudna, Ash-- 
LAURA: Ash-- Dorian. 
MATT: Dorian. 
LAURA: Imogen. 
TRAVIS: Orym. Oh, sorry. Orym's after Imogen. Wait. Imogen, Orym? 
LAURA: Imogen, Orym. 
MARISHA: Imogen, Orym. 
ROBBIE: But I've got so much dex. 
LAURA: Balls. 
TALIESIN: Whew, okay. 
MARISHA: You get on the horse and you're like, h'ya! Ya! 
LIAM: Stop eating grass. (laughter) 
LAURA: Pull up, pull. 
MARISHA: Me on a horse. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. So as the field still slightly shimmers and surrounds Ludinus, who is towards the end of completing this devouring ritual. 
LAURA: We rolled so many blues. 
MATT: You did, you did. That will come into play somehow. But the two that you failed, means you have three rounds to set her free. 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
LIAM: Whoa. 
ROBBIE: Set her free! 
LIAM: Damn! 
LAURA: That's it? Three rounds and then she's dead? 
LIAM: Well, that's 4.3 hours. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ROBBIE: We assume that he's trying to kill her? 
LAURA: Yeah, he's soaking her up and then he will be more powerful. 
MARISHA: Okay, well that changes things actually. 
TALIESIN: What is the vibe of that dome, by the way? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: The vibe of it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: It's pretty chill. 
SAM: How does it work? Who's casting it? 
MATT: You see these five figures are, they're all turned towards it and concentrating on it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: What you can see around them is this shimmering field. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so it's like a psychic woo woo vibe. (laughter) 
MATT: Technical term. 
TALIESIN: Technical term is woo woo. You know what it means. 
LIAM: He's a little woo woo. 
MATT: Chetney, you're up first. 
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm going to run in with 40 feet of movement. I'll head that way. 
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30. 
LAURA: Now, remember you have Jump so you can get another 30 out of a 10 foot. 
TRAVIS: I'm okay for here. I'm going to use-- I'm going to check this with the DM real quick. A Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind is a bonus action, you curse a creature you can see within 30 feet that is concentrating on a spell or a feature that requires concentration. Cursed target has disadvantage the next con saving throw it makes to maintain concentration. Would that work for this Mr. Fantastic in front of me? 
MATT: This guy right there? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: I'll do it, bonus action on him. 
MATT: Okay, so as you-- Describe how you curse him with your blood hemo magic. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll run forward and as I head up, I'll say, Hey, heads up, it's a full moon! (laughter) And get those dulcet tones in his ear as you see my claws come out. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: You see as you do that his nose like, bleeds a little bit and he's just looking at you. Keeps his concentration while staring at you. All right, so that's your movement, that's your bonus. You still have an action. 
TRAVIS: I will-- Can I hit him from here? 
MATT: With Fearne on deck. 
LIAM: How high is the roof of this chamber? 
MATT: And, Fearne, you do have Mister out with you. The roof of this chamber is about 40 feet up. 
LIAM: Okay, so as high as these guys? 
MATT: Yeah, that's about as tall. 
LIAM: Got it. 
TRAVIS: Well, I'm stuck out in the middle of nowhere here. That was the priority. I do have just, I have a base chisel I could try and throw at him from here. I could pull from my belt and try and chunk it at him. 
MATT: Yeah, you want to? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll try it. 
MATT: Let's go, roll an attack. 
TRAVIS: Would that just be plus my strength mod? 
MATT: Yeah, it should be your strength mod and your proficiency mod. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: 17 plus five is 22. Plus four, 26. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Okay, great. Throwing a wood chisel. What do you think? Usually the wood chisel when I swing with it is a plus 10 and a 1d6 plus nine. So what do you think throwing it might be? 1d6 plus or just 1d6? 
MATT: No, it's the same. 
TRAVIS: Oh it is? 
MATT: Because it's a thrown weapon you can use strength or dex as a-- 
TRAVIS: Killer. Sorry, 12 points of slashing damage. 
MATT: 12 points of slashing damage to him. (grunts) Takes the chisel, it's stuck in the side and you see it keeping focused, is now dividing the focus from that and you, and is now definitely taking you as an immediate threat. 
TRAVIS: And because of the Muddled Mind, does he have to make a check to maintain his concentration on the spell with disadvantage now because of the curse? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Awesome. It's the whole point, hopefully 
MATT: Dual 14s. 
TRAVIS: It's a con save-- 
MATT: Sorry, that's natural 14. 
TRAVIS: Gotcha. So he probably saves. 
MATT: It would be a 16. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, he does. Awesome. Cool. Good deal. What is the con save on? Okay. 
MATT: Your DC on your hemocraft, it should be under your Blood Curses. 
TRAVIS: I'll find it. 
MATT: Your hemocraft DC. All right, so that finishes Chetney's go, Fearne's up with Braius on deck. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I have something that-- I have Dispel Magic but can that-- Is that what? 
TALIESIN: This isn't magic. 
ASHLEY: This isn't magic. 
SAM: We don't know. 
LAURA: I mean, it might be. 
TRAVIS: 16. 
MATT: Oh, so he just makes it. 
MARISHA: The orb? 
TALIESIN: I'd be very surprised if it was. 
SAM: It's magic Of some sort. 
LAURA: I mean, they're actively doing a spell. 
MATT: What was it, its concentration check is half the damage you deal and DC 10 is the minimum. So he would've made it regardless. That's all right, I was thinking of the DC of the ability. But for concentration it's half the damage or 10, whichever is highest. 
TRAVIS: That means more damage is higher chance of failure. 
ASHLEY: I don't have-- 
LAURA: Anything higher? 
ASHLEY: Okay, you know what? 
TRAVIS: On a single hit, not a series? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 
MATT: But they have to roll for each hit. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: Could be Force Cage which would mean seventh level. 
ASHLEY: What I'm going to do is-- I'm going to-- 
SAM: (mocking) I'm going to-- 
ASHLEY: Where'd it go? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Fucking dick. Scorching Ray. I'm going to Scorching Ray at the nearest-- 
SAM: There's a guy down-- 
MATT: There are these two here that are concentrating, these three concentrating. This one was noticed and has a big glass blade. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So who are you aiming for? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go to the one that's standing that I can see. 
MATT: Right there? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Right there. 
MATT: The one that Chetney just threw a chisel into? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. 
MATT: Hell yeah. Go for it, so that's three, level two you're doing it? 
ASHLEY: I am doing it at-- 
TRAVIS: Got to do my blood maledict. 
ASHLEY: I'll do level three. 
MATT: At level three. So that's-- 
ASHLEY: First one doesn't hit. Roll another one. Second one is a 28. Second one is a 28. 
MATT: 28 hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. That was higher, that was 19 nine plus the-- 29. 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Or 30. 
SAM: Woo. 
MATT: You roll three times, or sorry, four times if it's a third level, right? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 17 again. 
MATT: Okay, so three hit, so that's 6d6 fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: Okay. (chuckles) Okay, so 22 plus because Mister was out I get an additional d8. 
MATT: Mm-hmm 
ASHLEY: That's an extra three. 
MATT: So that's 31 points of fire damage. (thudding) Gets hit, has to make three concentration checks. That's a success, barely. Success. And a failure. So he takes the hit and like, "Ugh," drops for a second and the sphere itself seems to slightly shake and vibrate. It still maintains itself, but currently there is one less person concentrating on it at the moment. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. I'll stay where I am and Mister will shoot Flame Seed at the guy to our left. Or sorry, your right. 
MATT: This guy right there? 
ASHLEY: Yes, the one that we just noticed. 
MATT: Oh, right there. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. Have Mister go ahead and roll an attack against them. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Come on, Mister! 
ASHLEY: Take him out. 
SAM: (monkey calls) 
ASHLEY: 17? 
MATT: 17 as he-- And is this through his flaming shit gun or? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: (shrieks) (gunshot) Fires. It comes arching towards this figure, Like in a "Wanted" style half arc. It shouldn't quite do that, but it's magical monkey poo, what're you going to do? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, what're you going to do? 
MATT: This figure moves to the side and puts its arm up and you see this psychic shield apparate on its arm and it scatters across it. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
MATT: This one looks like it's-- It's dressed a little differently than the other Exultants that are present. 
LAURA: Which one? 
MATT: This one over here, has the glass blade in one hand and it just created a psychic shield, like a buckler on the other hand. Is he concentrating or is he there like? 
MATT: He's not concentrating. 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's my turn. 
MATT: All right, finishing Fearne's go. Braius, you're up with Laudna on deck. 
SAM: I will run towards the beefy guy. 
MATT: Okay. What's your movement? 
SAM: 30. 
MATT: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, will get you right there. 
SAM: Then I will Misty Step to the guy up there. 
MATT: Up there? 
ROBBIE: Ooh, yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Nice. 
SAM: Then I will swing away with my Poison Pen. 
MATT: Let's go. 
SAM: Let's see what we can do. I'll swing twice. Do I attack twice? I attack twice. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I love it. Okay, one is a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! 
MATT: Oh! 
ROBBIE: It was yours. (chuckles) 
SAM: And the other was a 19. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: 19 total? 
SAM: 19 to hit, yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. That hits. Both hit. 
SAM: Okay. Both hit. Okay. First one I'm going to pump in a Divine Smite and also a charge from Poison Pen. Which sprays black ichor all over the place as it swipes through. 
MATT: You got it. 
SAM: This will be-- (yelps) And this is the nat 20, so what do I double? 
MATT: You double all the dice that you roll for it, the Pen and the Divine Smite, which was at 1st-level? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. So you roll your 1st-level Divine Smite, which is an additional 2d8. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yep. Plus your Poison Pen, plus your weapon. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: Then double those dice. 
SAM: So double everything. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. Okay. Here it goes. Let me do some math. That's all really good. 37 plus, Jesus, another 14 is-- 
MATT: 51. 
SAM: 51, doubled. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
SAM: Plus seven. 
LIAM: (snapping) 
LAURA: 109? 
TALIESIN: What? 
MATT: Okay, so what dice are you rolling for the Smite? 
SAM: So, the smite is 2d8. 
MATT: Correct. Yeah. 
SAM: The weapon is 2d8. 
MATT: Right, because of your-- 
SAM: Then I did a charge, which is another 3d8. 
MATT: That's true. Yeah, but you spend the charge. Yeah, that's nasty. And you rolled really well for that. Yeah, you just. (thudding) (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Braius Doomseed! 
MATT: You teleport up-- 
SAM: As I swipe in, I say: Heads up, it's a full moo. (laughter) 
MATT and TRAVIS: Amazing. 
MATT: So as you tumble up, you splatter them and as you do, their body breaks in half and where it has bisected the, what would've been blood, instead now sprays this black against the rocks. 
LAURA: Aw. 
MATT: Changed by the enchantment of your weapon. 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: But that finishes your turn, right? 
SAM: I mean, I have a second attack, but no one to attack. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: So I just swipe it around and I make cool shapes. 
MATT: Hell yeah. I love it. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: "Sandstorm" starts playing. 
MATT: It's about there that you notice another one of these figures right there, now that you're within eye shot of it, both of you check off at the right and you see another one with a psionic bracer that appears, or a buckler that appears on their arm and a glass blade to the side. 
MARISHA: Shit, shit 
MATT: All right. That finishes Braius' go. Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: Okay. So as we ended break and as we entered this battlefield, Laudna starts to crack her bones and her head flies back, and then she leaps onto all fours as she goes into her Form of Dread and starts skeletal dog galloping forward-- and starts skeletal dog galloping forward-- 
MATT: Horrifying. 
MARISHA: -- as her mouth is agape with a black void. 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
MARISHA: Five-- 
MATT: Right behind-- Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- 10, so I'm going to jump. 
TRAVIS: Mouth is agape with a black void. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Five, 10, 15, 20. I'm going to go here. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Can I see these two fuckers far from here? Are they in my line of sight? 
MATT: These two? They are, indeed. 
MARISHA: Okay, then as I gallop forward and my jaw opens, the bottom of my jaw unhinges, and I summon forth my Hound of Ill Omen that also leaps from my jaw. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: How far does it leap? 
SAM: Gross. 
MARISHA: 120 feet is what I can summon it by. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MARISHA: So I want to put it right between those two fucks. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Yes, baby! 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Should he go on my initiative? He's technically supposed to roll initiative. 
MATT: He'll just go on your initiative. It's-- 
MARISHA: I'll have him go after me. 
MATT: I got eight players. 
LIAM: Out of the dog's mouth comes a hairless cat. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: That jumps across another 120 feet. 
TRAVIS: Simplification. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: So I'll do him after me, and then I'm going to stand up and form a flaming bead right over top of him and (blasts) do a Fireball right on top of those guys. 
MATT: Fireball right on top of them? 
MARISHA: Because they're both next to the Hound of Ill Omen, they get disadvantage. 
LIAM: Nice. 
SAM: Oh, nice. 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LIAM: Smart. 
MATT: So you can get-- 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: -- those two right there. 
LIAM: Scary shit. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: With the Fireball. 
MARISHA: Can I get him? 
MATT: You can get-- 
LIAM: Oh, that one's gone. 
TALIESIN: Nevermind. 
MARISHA: Can I get him? 
MATT: If we played by those rules... You can get, with this explosion-- 
MARISHA: If I scooch it over? 
MATT: -- either these two or these two. 
MARISHA: I'll get the two in the back, since we already have-- 
MATT: You maybe could get these three back here. 
LAURA: Ooh, yeah. 
MATT: If you want to. 
MARISHA: Can I? 
MATT: Actually, no because of the angle you're at, you would strike the shield. 
LIAM: JK. 
MATT: So yeah, because you're down below. 
MARISHA: Oh, it strikes his shield? 
MATT: Meaning it would strike here and explode and it would get that far. 
TRAVIS: Hurts. 
LAURA and LIAM: (chuckle) 
TRAVIS: Six feet under the-- 
MARISHA: Okay, whatever you think. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: -- ground below. 
MATT: These two? 
LIAM: Someone's going to do that meme of us looking away from "Hamilton" at "Hadestown." 
MATT: Yeah, because if you get that one there, it's not going to get the other one. So you can choose either these two or the two that are next to the hound. 
MARISHA: I'll do two in the back because we already have Chet up front to those guys, so those guys are harder to reach. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: Once again, my-- I will do this Fireball-- 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Fireball. 
MARISHA: -- at... Sorry, sorry. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MARISHA: Let me remember. 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: What level are you doing? 
MARISHA: What level is my Fireball? 
LAURA: Pivot. 
MATT: Base level three is 8d6. 
TALIESIN: I have three options. 
MATT: Then it's an additional d6 each level thereafter. 
MARISHA: An extra d6. I'll stick with 3rd-level for now. Yeah, I'll stick with-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Your mom's not worth anything more than 3rd-level. 
LAURA: More than a 3rd? Wow. 
TRAVIS: Future mother in law? I don't think so. 
MARISHA: (groans) I'm trying to look and see. I'll do 4th-level. I'll do 4th. Eh, no, I'm doing 3rd. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: 3rd-level. 
MATT: All right, so 8d6 fire damage. Go ahead and roll that up. 
LAURA: I mean, pretty great. 
TALIESIN: That ground, the soldiers I think would be fine. 
MARISHA: ♪ (dice gathering hum) ♪ ♪ Should have prepped this ♪ Four, five, six, seven, eight. Come on. Big money. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
TALIESIN: No whammies. 
MARISHA: It's perfectly mid. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Yep. 
MARISHA: Three, six, nine-- 
LIAM: What happened? 
LAURA: I know. You rolled like a cleric. 
MARISHA: 12, 14, 16, 25. 
LIAM: What, I'm a cleric. 
MATT: 25 points of fire damage, and they have disadvantage on their saving throws because of your hound. 
SAM: Nice! 
MATT: (laughs) With the disadvantage, one of them gets a four. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: And the other gets a five. 
MARISHA: Great. 
MATT: (laughs) They both fail. That's 25 points of fire damage to each. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: Boom, boom. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Now my doggo goes. 
MATT: Yes, he does. 
MARISHA: Good boy. Who's a good boy? 
SAM: Lot of animals out here. We got a steed-- 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: -- a cow, a wolf. 
ROBBIE: (chuckles) 
SAM: A dog. 
MARISHA: Doesn't he have Pack Tactics? 
TALIESIN: Technically, there's such a thing as a pet rock. 
LAURA: Laudna, can your dog move? 
MARISHA: He can move. Do you need him to move? 
LAURA: I don't know. 
SAM: A monkey. 
LIAM: You better. 
TRAVIS: Is that it? 
MARISHA: That's okay. 
ASHLEY: We got a monkey. We got a horse. 
SAM: We got a dog. 
ASHLEY: We got a dog. 
MARISHA: I'll do a bite attack to the far guy. 
MATT: Right there? 
MARISHA: Yeah, the one-- That one, yes. 
MATT: Okay, let's go. 
MARISHA: (laughs) No. Eight to hit. 
MATT: That's going to miss. I'm sorry. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Worth a shot. That finishes your go, Laudna? 
MARISHA: Yeah. He technically-- Do you need him to move? Are you going to go there or something? 
LAURA: I was going to do something there, but I don't want to hurt him. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Don't worry about it. 
LIAM: He's dead already. 
MARISHA: He's a ghost dog. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Don't worry about him. 
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. The Exaltant knights are going to go first. This one is going to go ahead and run up on-- 
TALIESIN: No, no. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: Rush up to Laudna. 
ROBBIE: (groans) 
LAURA: Well, that might change my mind. 
MATT: This one here is going to leap up-- 
SAM: Ah! 
MATT: -- and try and avenge the slaughter of his friend so it's going to be two attacks against you, Laudna. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: With its glass blade. So the first attack is going to be a 21 to hit. 
MARISHA: Hits. Let me see if it hits my Mirror Image. (laughs) It's Caleb all over again. 
MATT: (laughs) Aw. 
MARISHA: No, I take it. 
MATT: Okay, that's going to be 10 points of slashing damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Best spell. 
MATT: And-- 
MARISHA: Oh, wait, wait. Before we move on too far. 
MATT: Yeah? 
MARISHA: Both of those fucks in the back have to roll a wisdom save to see if they're afeared of me. 
MATT: That's true. And they have to roll to see if they maintain concentration. 
ASHLEY: Afeared? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Afeared. 
TALIESIN: Was there a disadvantage part of that too? Oh, no. 
MATT: Now, they had disadvantage on all saving throws while they're in five feet of it? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
LAURA: Or just against you? 
MATT: Or just the next one? 
MARISHA: Just spells, I think. 
LAURA: Just spells? Oh, then yeah, for that. 
MATT: I don't think it's all saving throws. That would be broken. But also, who knows? What's it say? (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (mumbles description) "The hound... five feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spells you cast." 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Got it. 
LAURA: You cast. 
MATT: All right, cool. 
MARISHA: I cast. 
MATT: All right, so-- 
MARISHA: These my puppies. 
MATT: That's going to be 19 on the first one. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: That-- Sorry. That saves. 
MATT: Okay, the other is not going to make it so that one is frightened of you. 
LIAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Roll that one up here. Frightened. Roll dice with that-- 
TRAVIS: Is Jump 30 feet up or across? 
LAURA: 30 feet-- 
TALIESIN: What kind of damage did he do to you? 
LAURA: -- any direction. 
MARISHA: Fire. 
TALIESIN: That dude did fire damage. Oh. 
MARISHA: Wait, who? 
TALIESIN: The guy who's slashing at you. 
MARISHA: I don't know yet. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: I'll say that this guy here is frightened of you right there. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay? 
TALIESIN: Making a plan. 
MATT: And now concentration checks. They both have advantage on them. Maintains and maintains. Okay. For the Fireball. Now coming back onto your turn. Thank you for that reminder there. That first attack was a 21 to hit you. 
MARISHA: Yes, and it hit. 
MATT: That hit. The next one is going to be a 22. Just one over it. 
MARISHA: See if that one hits my Mirror Image. That one does so just one attack. 
MATT: Okay. All right. So with that, you take 10 points of slashing damage. 
MARISHA: Slashing damage, Ashton. 
MATT: You have disadvantage on intelligence saving throws until your next turn from the glass blade cutting through you, its psychic resonance. (buzzing) It's causing this part of your brain to sliver open. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Well, shit. 
MATT: The one that's attacking you, Braius. 
SAM: Bring it on! Yeah. 
MATT: Oh, that's going to be a 27 to hit. 
LAURA: Oh! 27? 
SAM: Hits. 
MATT: Rolled really high. A natural 20. (laughs) (groaning) 
TRAVIS: Talk about vengeance. 
LIAM: Pre-vengeance. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
ASHLEY: Vengeance vengeance. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. 
LIAM: That was his brother you killed. 
TRAVIS: Wait. The walk sign-- 
LAURA: How far? 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs. 60 feet. I think it's in range. 
LIAM: Silver. 
SAM: Silvery Barbs? Isn't that just against spells? 
TRAVIS: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30-- 
MARISHA: I just make him reroll. 
TRAVIS: 35, 40, 45. It's on the-- 
SAM: Broken spell. 
TRAVIS: ♪ It's on the edge of glory ♪ 
LIAM: ♪ Living on the edge ♪ 
MATT: I would say he is-- 
MARISHA: It's that guy, yeah. 
MATT: Just out of range. He's 65 feet from you. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
MATT: That's right on the edge. Of glory. 
SAM and LIAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Why didn't you scoot-- 
MATT: Okay, so the first strike against you-- 
MARISHA: I know! Just side step. 
MATT: -- it is a-- 
MARISHA: Hang on, I got to save my friend. 
MATT: -- 10 against you. 10 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: Ha! 
MATT: And the crit, that's going to be 22 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: Doubled? 
MATT: No, that was with the double. 
TRAVIS: 13? 
MATT: It does crit you. I'm going to roll to see if its glass blade shatters. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MATT: That's a d20. It does not shatter. Okay. But you do have disadvantage on intelligence saving throws until end of its next turn. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to finish their go. Ashton, you're up, with Dorian on deck. 
TALIESIN: Okay. That changes things. 
MATT: Oh, you know what, at the other guy is going to use his bonus action to pick up concentration from the one that died. 
SAM: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Who dis? 
MATT: So now that one-- 
LAURA: They can do it? 
MATT: They can fill in for each other. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM and ASHLEY: Ah. 
LAURA: Dicks! 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay. So, my little cosmic shining head with my little pocket universe and my hammer being strangely translucent, I'm going to take 35 feet straight towards me. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: (wind whipping) 
MATT: That's going to be 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 will put you there. 
TALIESIN: Do I have to go around a thing for that? 
MATT: No, that was just straight. 
TALIESIN: Really? 
MATT: Yep. Because you were right next to Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. 
TALIESIN: All right, for safety I'll take that one last, 40. While I'm running by. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a little (whistles) Come on, over here. I am going to attack with a-- Where did we go? Wormhole Strike. 
MATT: (laughs) To which one? 
TALIESIN: To the one that's bothering-- 
MATT: Laudna? 
TALIESIN: Bothering Laudna. I don't-- 
MATT: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: So that is-- I'm going to, gain advantage, I'm going to make it, so. 
MARISHA: Where did he go? 
SAM: He's behind-- 
TALIESIN: So-- 
MATT: Over there. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LIAM: Sneaky sneak. 
TALIESIN: That's a-- I didn't do that well. That's a 19 to hit. 
MATT: A 19 to hit? That just hits. It's going to use its Psychic Buckler reaction to add five to its AC against the attack and other attacks this turn, so no. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
MATT: So you go to strike and it (clings) deflects it off of its Psychic Buckler on the side and then gets itself ready with the shield at the ready. 
SAM: Psychic Butler? 
MARISHA: That's what I heard. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
MATT: Psychic Buckler. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, buckler. 
ASHLEY: I heard butler. 
LAURA: I mean, that's what I heard. 
MATT: Sorry. 
TALIESIN: Fuck it, I'm burning another. 
MATT: Psychic butthole. 
ASHLEY: There it is. 
TALIESIN: Might as well. 
MARISHA: Just a man that talks posh. 
TALIESIN: I don't like them being there. 
MARISHA: He's like, "Oh, pardon me, sir. Don't hit my master." 
TALIESIN: Jesus! Again. 19 to hit. 
MATT: No, it maintains until the end of the turn. 
TALIESIN: I have nothing else fun to do. My god, that totally killed my theory. I'm so sorry. Nevermind. 
MATT: That's okay. 
MARISHA: How dare? 
MATT: That finishes your turn, Ashton. Dorian, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
ROBBIE: Well, sure. I'll engage my winged boots, and I'll fly with the homies. 
MATT: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: I just burned a lot of shit. 
ROBBIE: I got 40 feet of movement. Can I get to that rock to the right of Orym, by any chance? 
MATT: Right here? 
ROBBIE: Can I fly up there with 40 feet? 
MATT: This technically is the ceiling. 
ROBBIE: Oh, it's a ceiling? 
MATT: Yeah, so you can get-- 
LIAM: Next to it. 
ROBBIE: There-ish? 
MATT: Next to it. I could say you can get-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: More or less, I'll say-- So this-- 
TALIESIN: It was a terrible turn. 
ROBBIE: Okay. Cool. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: What is it you're hoping to do? 
ROBBIE: In the sky, out of my pocket, I'll pull out a little tube and I'll crack it and it's a little iridescent glow stick. And then I'll just start dancing. (laughter) And-- 
MATT: Love it. 
ROBBIE: (techno music) I'll cast Hypnotic Pattern. I think I got 120 feet. They're all locked in looking on that ridge-- 
MATT: Correct. 
ROBBIE: -- toward Ludinus. I'll try to put it in front of that bubble. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ROBBIE: And try to catch as many of them looking that way as I can. Maybe those three or-- 
MATT: A 30-foot cube within range. 
ROBBIE: Oh, I thought it was 120. 
LIAM: This is actually happening at Fyre Fest. 
MATT: The range is 120 feet. But it weaves through a space of 30 foot by 30 foot. 
ROBBIE: Got it, got it, got it. 
MATT: So, you could pretty much put it anywhere you want to. 
ROBBIE: Just maximum visibility for those three concentrators on the ridge. 
MATT: Right. You can get-- 
LIAM: (quiet scatting) 
MATT: You can get these two up here. These two are 35 feet apart. 
ROBBIE: Okay. Oh, I got you. Okay, I'll take the two on the top then. 
MATT: I guess if you were to do a cube like this-- Yeah, if you were turned to the side, you could probably get all three, now I think about it because if you diagonals, edge to edge. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah. It's 30 feet? 
MATT: It's 30 feet cubed, so-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah, okay. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
MATT: So that'll work. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, let's do it. Okay. Cool. 
MATT: Okay 
MATT: I dig it. 
ROBBIE: Wisdom 16 save for all of them. 
MATT: You got it. All right. So for these here-- 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: Probably pretty brainy. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, but-- 
LIAM: Oh, no, they still got-- 
SAM: But maybe they're-- 
LAURA: They might be charisma if they're sorcerers. 
ROBBIE: Fingies. 
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
MATT: All righty, so-- 
LIAM: Come on. Get all three. Three for three. 
MATT: So it's wisdom, you said? 
ROBBIE: Wisdom 16. Yeah. 
MATT: Got it. This one here, it's going to be a 15. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: He fails. He's charmed. 
MARISHA: (snaps fingers) 
SAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: For the purposes of this, I'm going to go ahead and put the-- 
LIAM: Charmed drops one attack, right? 
MATT: This charm means they become incapacitated. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, they can't move. 
MATT: It doesn't mean they break their concentration. 
LAURA: They can't make dex saves. They can't-- 
MATT: Correct. On their turn, they don't make any actions. 
LIAM: Awesome. 
MARISHA: That's great. 
MATT: That one there. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Natural one! 
LAURA: Whoa! 
SAM: Wow. 
LIAM: Ah. 
MATT: This is not going in their favor. 
MARISHA: He is scared and charmed. 
MATT: Yep. 
ROBBIE: They're pretty sick dance moves. 
MATT: That one there, (laughter) that's going to be a 19. 
ROBBIE: That's what I get for gloating. That's what I get for gloating. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) (laughter) But those two, as the beast is there nipping at them, they're still focusing and looking to the rest of you and you see them, while one part of their mind is focused here, they begin to prepare something else. Red glow begins to emanate from their bodies and then both of them get lost in this weird, shifting pattern of colors and magic in the air around-- 
ROBBIE: So it looks like a 2008 visualizer from LimeWire. 
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah-- 
MATT: Winamp visualization plug-in, yep. 
ASHLEY: That is a pull. 
LIAM: LimeWire reference for y'all. 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Llama's ass. 
ROBBIE: For the kids. 
MARISHA: We're doing great. We're doing great at appealing-- 
MATT: All righty. That's great. 
MARISHA: -- to a younger audience. 
MATT: Bonus action or? 
ROBBIE: I think, well, is Laudna within 30 feet? Probably. 
MATT: Laudna's probably a little further than 30. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. Okay, then I'm donzo. 
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go. Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: That's huge. 
LAURA: Okay. I am going to focus my energy towards those two on the ridge as well. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Right where our beautiful puppy is, a storm is going to start swirling, and I'm going to cast Whirlwind right in between the two of them. 
MATT: Whirlwind. 
LAURA: Which "howls down to a point you can see on the ground within range." It's a 10-foot radius, 30-foot-high cylinder. 
MATT: Heck yeah. 
TRAVIS: 30-foot radius. Wait. 
LAURA: 30-foot-high cylinder. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
LAURA: 10-foot radius. 
MATT: Yeah, 10-foot radius. I'll place this. 10-foot radius is about this distance. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So we'll say this here is the-- 
LAURA: I'm using a Quickened Spell on this to cast it as a bonus action. 
MATT: You got it, so (wind whipping) Whirlwind picks up from that point. 
LAURA: Okay, so they have to make dexterity saving throws when they enter it, which I don't know if they can because they're-- 
MATT: They're incapacitated. 
LAURA: They're incapacitated. 
MATT: Indeed. Double check on-- 
TRAVIS: Stack on team attacks. 
ROBBIE: Inadvertent combo! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Incapacitated means they can't take reactions or actions, but they still technically make dex saves. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Double checking that. Stunned, I think they automatically fail that-- 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: Okay, so that is a dex save, you said? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. Fail and succeed. 
LAURA: What is-- 
MATT: A 22. 
LAURA: A 23. 
MATT: Oh! 
LAURA: Because I have my robe activated. 
MATT: That's right. So yeah, that would be both failure. 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
MATT: So they both take 10d6 bludgeoning damage. 
ASHLEY: Oh! Yeah, baby. 
LAURA: Yes. Two, three. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
SAM: Do you have to roll for the dog, too? 
MARISHA: Yeah, does the doggo have to roll? 
MATT: He would, yeah, because he's technically in the space as well. 
LIAM: (poofs) 
TRAVIS: (barks) 
LAURA: Seven. 
ROBBIE: Signal him. 
TRAVIS: Is he a wolf or a dog? 
MARISHA: He's a dire wolf. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) My brethren. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Little cousin. 
MARISHA: I don't think he can actually-- You said 22? No, he fails. 
MATT: Okay. So he takes full damage on this, too. 
MARISHA: Huh? 
MATT: So he takes the full damage on this. 
LAURA: 29, 33, 39 points of bludgeoning damage. 
MARISHA: Oh, he's dead. 
LAURA: Each of them. 
MATT: All right. (booms) They're both being battered around. They're restrained if they fail strength save, correct? 
LAURA: "Dexterity save, creatures-- In addition," yeah, they must make a strength saving throw or become restrained. 
MATT: Both fail, so they're both restrained. 
LAURA: Okay, so now I'm going to use my action. So they're restrained and they're pulled five feet higher inside of the whirlwind. 
MATT: Right, so they're both lifted up a little bit. 
LAURA: I'm going to use my action to move the whirlwind. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And try to capture, move it 30 feet and try to capture this guy right here. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
LAURA: As well. 
SAM: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Baby twister. 
LIAM: Are they down? Are they borked with their concentration? 
MATT: We're going to find out in a second. 
LIAM: (goofy noises) 
MATT: They do have advantage on their concentration checks here so that would be... 36. 39? No, that would be 19. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
MATT: (laughs) Natural 20 and a natural 17. (groaning) 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So first guy succeeds. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Other one a 19. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So yeah. 
LAURA: So they're getting (whooshes) around. 
MATT: Yeah, they're keeping focus on it. 
LAURA: Okay, and I'm going to try to move my whirlwind with my action and try to gather up this guy right here. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Unless, Chet, you want me to aim for the other one? I think I can get this one with my 30 feet because they were 35 feet away from each other. 
MATT: Correct, so this one here? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, so you now all three of them are dragged-- 
TALIESIN: (whispering) Yeah! 
MATT: -- and lifted up inside this whirlwind. 
TRAVIS: That's awesome. 
MARISHA: That's sick. 
TALIESIN: That's cool. 
MARISHA: So they're closer now. 
ROBBIE: And incapacitated. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you got it. 
ROBBIE: They're just flopping. 
MARISHA: (yells) (laughter) 
LAURA: Okay, so now he has to make a dex save. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we got cows. 
LAURA: As well. 
ROBBIE: Another good one. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: From the original. 
MATT: Oh! He has... 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: No, he fails. 
ROBBIE: 1980... 
MARISHA: Speaking to those youths. That sounds about right. 
LAURA: 15, 20. 
LIAM: Tarv. How bad you fuck that guy up? 
LAURA: 25. 
TRAVIS: Not at all. 
LIAM: Not at all? 
TALIESIN: No, not yet. 
LAURA: 30, 36. 
MARISHA: "Twister." 
TRAVIS: Like nine points. 
LAURA: 38 points of bludgeoning damage. 
MATT: All righty, and-- That is going to be a 24, so yeah, he succeeds as well. 
LAURA: He succeeds on his save. What about his concentration? 
MATT: No, that was his concentration. 
LAURA: That was his concentration? Okay, for his strength save. 
MATT: Strength, he got picked up. 
LAURA: He got picked up? Okay. 
SAM: Excellent work. 
MATT: Oh, to see if he's restrained, right. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: This is a single roll, sorry. No, he fails that. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) So he's also. All three of them are restrained and like-- (wind hisses) In this psychic whirlwind that's been summoned and dragged across the stonework. It's filled with bits of rock and stone, and shredded glass also spinning and tearing through them. Hell yeah, does that finish your turn? 
SAM: She killed a dog. 
MATT: Do you stay put or you want to move? 
SAM: She killed one of our friends to do that. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) By herself. 
SAM: She's a bloodthirsty animal. 
LAURA: I'm going to shift so I'm not stacking up-- 
ROBBIE: It was a ghost. 
LAURA: -- with everybody else. If I can move to where I'm, yeah. 
SAM: No, it was a real dog. 
MATT: There? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. 
SAM: She definitely killed a real dog. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn. 
ROBBIE: It's up for adoption. 
MATT: It is now the regular Exaltants' turn. The one that's next to you, Chet, is going to go ahead-- Hmm. 
SAM: Oh. 
ROBBIE: Hmm? 
SAM: Not my brother in tattoos. 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: RTA... Respect the Asmodeus. (laughter) 
MATT: It's going to release a blast of Synaptic Static right there. That is a 20-foot radius. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
TRAVIS: Synaptic Static. 
MATT: That's going to be-- No, it'll get everyone below here. Actually no, it can get all three of them right there. So it'll get Laudna, it'll get Fearne, it'll get Mister, and it'll get Orym, and it'll get your-- 
TRAVIS: Steed. 
MATT: -- your Steed, yeah. I need you all to make intelligence saving throws. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
ROBBIE: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: I knew he was setting us up for something. 
SAM: Do one of you have disadvantage for that? Laudna does, right? 
MARISHA: I do. 
LAURA: On what? 
MARISHA: Intelligence saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Is this a spell or other magic? 
MATT: It is. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Well no, this technically is a spell, yes. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
LIAM: That failed. 
ASHLEY: Cocked. Ooh, looks pretty good. 
MARISHA: No wait, no, it's a seven. I mean, okay, it's not a natural one, but it's not so bad. 
MATT: Okay. So. Laudna. 
MARISHA: Nine. 
MATT: It's going to be 32 points of psychic damage. 
SAM: Yikes. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: And-- 
MARISHA: 32, you said? 
MATT: Yes. For the next minute, any rolls that you make that's an attack roll or an ability check, as well as a constitution save to maintain concentration, you subtract a d6 from it. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
LIAM: d6 down. 
MARISHA: So minus d6 to-- 
TRAVIS: Each time? Or roll a d6 once and keep that number? 
MATT: I think it's each time, just to keep it part of the roll. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So attacks, saving throws. 
SAM: Ability checks? 
MARISHA: Pretty much anything. 
MATT: Not saving throws. Ability checks... attacks, ability checks, and constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
MARISHA: And cons. 
TRAVIS: Got you. 
MATT: All right, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: I rolled a 23 and Mister rolled a 14. 
MATT: So Mister takes 32 points of psychic damage, you take 16. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: And Orym? 
LIAM: I failed, 10. 
MATT: Okay, so you take 32 points of psychic damage, and also your attack rolls have disadvantage. Sorry, minus a d6, not disadvantage. 
MATT: And Coriolis? 
ROBBIE: Oh, I gave you the sheet. 
LIAM: Oh, Coriolis. 
ROBBIE: It's low, six maybe. 
LIAM: That is a... Oh, minus four? 11. 
MATT: 11's a failure, so you take 32 points of psychic damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Is he alive? 
LIAM: It is. 
MARISHA: Who was this that hit me, by the way? 
MATT: This one right here. 
TRAVIS: Mr. Fantastic. 
MATT: The one that got stabbed by Chetney. 
MARISHA: Is he looking rough, or--? 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: He's looking like he's taken a hit or two, but he's not looking terrible. 
MARISHA: I will dump-- 
TRAVIS: That's very kind of you. 
MARISHA: -- a Hellish Rebuke into him, because I can do that-- 
MATT: Let's go! 
MARISHA: -- and I never do that. 
MATT: Okay, and his save, oh, he fails with a four. 
MARISHA: Great, that's 3d10 damage to him. 
MATT: Natural four. Let's go! 
LAURA: Yes, Hellish Rebuke! 
MARISHA: What are dice? What's a 10? Here's a 10. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's also a 10. That's a 10. Okay. Ooh. 
TRAVIS: That's-- (excited babbling) 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 10, 15, Okay, wait. 19, 24! 24 Hellish Rebuke damage. 
MATT: Yeah, let's go! 
MARISHA: I got a nine, a 10, and a five. 
MATT: Now he's starting to look-- 
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Take it. 
MATT: -- a little hurt. (laughs) Describe how you rebuke him. 
SAM: Hellishly. 
MARISHA: I think as I feel this intellectual ping in my brain, I get this tingling jolt of trauma from feeling that way by Delilah all the time, and I just, in my Form of Dread, I instinctually lash out and scream at him. 
MATT: As you scream, he screams in reaction and grabs the sides of his head and bends forward. He's going to see if-- He has to make a concentration check as well. 
MARISHA: Come on, bitch. 
MATT: Natural 17, so he makes it. 
TRAVIS: Damn, they're rolling pretty good. 
MATT: They're rolling pretty good. They also have advantage on their concentration checks. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Ah. 
LAURA: Except for that guy, because he has disadvantage now, because you cursed him. 
TRAVIS: On concentration checks. Disadvantage on concentration checks-- 
MATT: That's right. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: -- until the end of my next turn. 
MATT: That's true! So let me roll for him, one dice. 
MARISHA: Come on! Good, good, good, good. 
MATT: Nope, that'll fail. (cheering) 
MARISHA: Queen shit! 
TRAVIS: Thanks for playing my character better than I am. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: A+ student. 
LIAM: Keen Mind. 
MATT: So now there's one less concentrating. One guy picked up by the other's. There's still five concentrating on it, but now there's four at the moment. All right, that finishes your turn. Oh sorry, the Exaltants are still going. That was that one there, and there. 
LAURA: So Exaltants go after me? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: I am the full caboose. 
ROBBIE: What? 
LAURA: When did those bladey guys go? 
LIAM: I am the full caboose to the initiative order. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: When did those bladey guys go? Did those go after Laudna? 
ASHLEY: After Laudna. 
SAM: Bladey guys. 
ROBBIE: Bladey guys! 
TALIESIN: After Laudna and right before me. 
TRAVIS: To blathe. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: One of the ones inside the twister, angrily, is going to still focusing best he can, release Phantasmal Killer in your direction. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: I need you to make an intelligence, sorry, a wisdom saving throw. 
LAURA: A wisdom saving throw. 
LIAM: Come on. 
TALIESIN: We have advantage on those. 
LAURA: I have advantage on those. 
SAM: We do? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Heroes' Feast. 
LAURA: Yeah, because of our feast. 
LAURA: Heroes' Feast. 
SAM: We had a Heroes' Feast? 
LAURA: Yeah, we had a Heroes' Feast. 
MARISHA: We did, with everybody. 
LAURA: That's what gave us our-- 
LIAM: All right, roll again for-- Oh, you got two dice. 
LAURA: Yeah, there's two dice in here. 
TALIESIN: That freaks me out. 
LAURA: That's low. That's a 13. 
SAM: You have inspiration. 
LAURA: I don't know if it's going to beat it, though, if it's a 13. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. Then forget it. 
LAURA: 14. 
SAM: Garbage. What a waste of an inspiration. 
LAURA: Garbage, garbage. What a fucking waste. You're the one that made me do it. 
MATT: (sympathetic laugh) 
SAM and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: That was so intense. 
TRAVIS: Hear it when it comes out? It's the dragon. 
LIAM: (intensely) Just a casual game amongst fucking friends. (laughter) 
MATT: There we go. I found them, I found them. All right, so you are now considered frightened. 
LIAM: Oh no. 
SAM: You can't be, you can't be. 
MARISHA: Wait, she's frightened? 
SAM: She can't be. 
TALIESIN: She can't be frightened. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right! 
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Heroes' Feast. 
MATT: That's right. So you're immune to it. 
LAURA: I can't be, Heroes' Feast! 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yay! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LIAM: Got rocked! 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: This is your brain on Heroes' Feast. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm! 
ROBBIE: He's cooking up all the ways. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, the GM's mind. 
MATT: However, you are still affected by this. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Wait, no. It says, "On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration, at the end of each of the target's turns--" 
ROBBIE: How long does Heroes' Feast last? 
MARISHA: 10 hours? 12 hours? Something like that. 
MATT: I'm going to say that completely negates that spell because the whole point of it is it makes you fearful of the illusion that it creates and take damage imagining it, but you're immune to that. So-- 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: -- that's going to ignore that ability on him. 
SAM: Oh no, Matt's mad now. 
MATT: That's going to change their tactics, though. So the other two in there, are instead-- One's going to Dissonant Whispers. 
LAURA: ♪ Dissonant Whispers ♪ 
MATT: At 3rd-level. 
LAURA: Oof. 
MATT: So you need to make a wisdom saving throw. 
LAURA: I really should not have pulled these guys close to me. (laughs) (like Jester) That was maybe not the smartest move. (regular) Advantage because of Heroes' Feast. 
SAM: Just because. 
TRAVIS: Jester came out. 
LAURA: Sorry. Yeah, Jester came out. 
TRAVIS: Sometimes he'll come out, he'll come out. 
LAURA: He'll come out! He will come out of the movies and kick my ass. Nine. 
MATT: That's a failure, unfortunately. You take 16 points of psychic damage. 
LAURA: I'm resistant to psychic damage. 
MATT: Okay, so you take eight, and you have to use your reaction immediately to move as far away from the target as possible. What's your speed while flying? Is it 60 feet? 
LAURA: I don't know if it's 60, let me check. 
SAM: Is it in the Fly spell? 
LAURA: I don't know. Is it in the Fly spell or would it be in Havoc's Embrace? 
MATT: Havoc's Embrace is where it would be. 
LAURA: Hold on. Wait for me. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Wait for me ♪ 
LAURA: 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet. 
LAURA: No wait, no, no, no. That's my fly speed. (babbling) 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: It just says, "Gain flying speed equal to walking speed." 
MATT: Okay, so 30 feet. 
LAURA: 30 feet. 
MATT: Okay. So you move-- 
SAM: ♪ Wait ♪ 
MATT: -- over to there. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MARISHA: From "Hamilton" to "Hadestown." 
MATT: Sorry, Laudna. I keep knocking you over. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I'm coming, wait for me ♪ 
MATT: All right, and then the other one. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I hear the walls repeating ♪ 
LAURA: ♪ The falling of my feet ♪ ♪ And it sounds like drumming ♪ 
MATT: That's one's going to cast Telekinesis. It's pissed. 
LAURA: That's a concentration spell. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. Concentration-- No, you're right, that is. 
MARISHA: Do it. 
LAURA: Do it, cast it. 
MATT: No, it's fine. 
SAM: Maybe they can do double concentration because they're-- I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Then they would have to roll with no advantage for their concentration saves. Actually, I think even at disadvantage, some other penalty if I recall. 
MATT: You know what? (laughs) It's going to retort with a Hypnotic Pattern. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
MATT: Using the same tactic against where you are, and Laudna at the 30-foot, we'll say there. Yeah, that'll be enough between the two of you. I'd like both Laudna and Imogen to make wisdom saving throws. 
LAURA: I really-- 
SAM: You have advantage on wisdom saving throws. 
LIAM: Advantage on wis. 
LAURA: I know, I know. I really need to beef my wisdom. 
MARISHA: Attacks, abilities, and cons. Okay. 
LIAM: Plenty time in the campaign left to do it. 
LAURA: 19. 
MATT: 19, you succeed. 
LAURA: (sighs) Okay. 
MARISHA: (long inhale) (puffs exhale) You guys. 19. 
MATT: Yeah, you both succeed. 
MARISHA: Thank god for Heroes' Feast. 
ROBBIE: Which guy was trying to do that? 
TRAVIS: Which guy was trying to do that? The one down below, next to Laudna. 
LAURA: Down below? (laughs) 
MATT: No, that was all three of those right there. 
LAURA and LIAM: (snicker) 
MATT: All right. And then-- 
ROBBIE: I feel like he's really intent now. 
SAM: He's pissed at us right now. 
LAURA: I know. He's really-- 
ROBBIE: He's mad at us. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: He wants to fuck us up. 
TRAVIS: I'm just riding a bike under this table. I've got like three and a half miles, no problem. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: These legs are just pumping. 
ROBBIE: Turn one's about to be over. 
MATT: Okay. No, they're still caught up in the whirlwind. However, I do need you to make concentration check for me. 
LAURA: For that nine points of damage I took? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Shouldn't be too hard. 
LAURA: Yes, that's what we say. 
SAM: Don't blow it. 
LAURA: Hold on, I'm looking for a specific dice. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
LAURA: There. 
SAM: It's just a concentration check. 
LAURA: Which I get advantage on, which is a 15 plus constitution. 
MATT: You're fine, you're fine. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right, that's going to finish the Exaltants' go, Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: Okay. Orym, surveilling the chaos, he wants to get in and help with the main objective. He sees-- 
LAURA: He's focusing them. 
LIAM: -- Laudna in the thick of it. He's torn, and then starts to gallop this way, but as he goes, he thrusts Seedling out towards the enemy facing Laudna and I send Grasping Vine out of it and I'm going to try to grab, fisherman grab that character. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: It's a DC 17. 
MATT: Dexterity save? 
TRAVIS: ♪ The golden fisherman ♪ 
SAM: ♪ It's the golden fisherman ♪ 
LIAM: Yes, dex save. 
MATT: That's going to be a 21. 
LIAM: Oh jeez, that super saves. Okay, well, then I continue on. I'm going to-- It can fly 90 feet. 
TALIESIN: That guy's been a dick. 
MATT: To where? 
LIAM: To here. I want to fly right down next to-- 
MATT: Next to that guy? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Equal to, so flanking with Braius. 
MATT: Put you with this guy. 
SAM: Shouldn't you be helping your boyfriend? (laughter) 
SAM: I don't need you! I don't need anyone! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Look at him ride. (laughter) 
LIAM: I lean in, finally having gotten this equine dragon to fly, I lean close and say, Fuck them up, Areolis. (laughter) 
SAM: It's Braius! 
TRAVIS: Areolis? (laughter) 
SAM: My name is Braius! God, he doesn't even know my name. 
LIAM: So first, Coriolis will attack, gets one beak, one dragon bite, and then two hooves. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
MATT: Let's go. 
LIAM: That is a miss with the mouth, unless 11. 
MATT: Nah. 
LIAM: Yeah. Okay, now for the hooves, that is 17. 
MATT: 17 misses. (gasping) 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
LIAM: 20, that is-- This is going to miss too, that's 16. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
LIAM: I start swinging from Coriolis' back. 
MATT: Let's go. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LAURA: Coriolis! 
MATT: As the hooves come down, they're hitting the Psychic Buckler-- 
ROBBIE: He got him there! 
MATT: -- and then one point the buckler doesn't hit and his hoof comes down, just looks at it and a field knocks it off. With these Exaltant skills and techniques have variability beyond what you've seen before. 
TRAVIS: Piece of shit. (laughter) 
LIAM: So attacking, three attacks, first one is a tripping attack, flanked. So that is, come on, come on, come on. 27 to hit. 
MATT: 27 does hit. 
LIAM: So that is a strength save. 
LAURA: (real coughing) 
TRAVIS: Stop it. 
LAURA: (fake coughing) Listen. Calm it down. 
MATT: Natural 18. 
LIAM: Natural 18, okay. So that's fine. 
MATT: 21. 
LAURA: Drink your fucking water. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) Okay, so that is two plus nine is 11 plus-- So just 13 points of damage for that. Second attack is also pushing, or tripping attack. That is a 25 to hit. 
MATT: That hits 
LIAM: Same DC. 
SAM: Tripping the off attack. 
MATT: That's going to be a 12. 
LIAM: 12. So Orym's sword slashes. I lean, holding onto the webbing of Coriolis' wing and lean down and cut along the back of his leg, sending him sprawling onto his back. 
MATT: How much damage was that? 
LIAM: That is 10, 16 points of damage. 
MATT: 16 points of damage, all right. It's going to be two con saves to see if he maintains concentration. Yep, and yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Natural 19, natural 18. 
LIAM: Then we'll make the last attack goading. I'll reroll the one. That's another one. So that is-- that's going to miss. No, that's a 11, 20, 25. 
MATT: 25, yeah, that hits. 
LIAM: Yeah, that hits. 
MATT: I can't even use the Psychic Butler against that. 
TRAVIS: Oh really, Psychic Butler? 
MATT: That's what they were joking about earlier. 
MARISHA: I still hear butler. 
MATT: I said "Butler" that time as a joke. 
MARISHA: Oh. (laughs) 
LIAM: Because of Otohan's blade that I absorbed, prone characters take a d6 of force damage as well. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: My word. 
LIAM: So that is five plus nine is 14. The superiority die is 18. 20 points of damage from that. 
MATT: 20 points of damage. Con save. Yeah, natural 16. He succeeds. 
LIAM: He does? 
MATT: Yep. 
LIAM: We need to get her out of there. Action surge. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Reroll the one. That is a 24 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Prone, so I'm not going to use any more superiority die. 
SAM: He rolled one on something. 
LIAM: Four plus nine. 
SAM: Oh, I get my bardic inspiration back. 
LIAM: Is 13. 19 for the first. 
MATT: That's true. 
SAM: When there's sadness around me, I get more inspired. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: I forget you've got some bard in you. 
LAURA: A bard of tragedy. 
MARISHA: He go that bard in him. 
MATT: 19 points of damage? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: That's tracks. 
ASHLEY: Tragédie. 
MATT: Yeah, natural 17. 
LIAM: Literally pressing with my feet against the side of this creature, holding onto the edge of its wing, just sword-fighting like Errol Flynn. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's a 25 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Errol Flynn. 
LIAM: Six. 
MARISHA: Another choice reference for the youths. 
ROBBIE: That was like 100 years ago. 
LIAM: 14 for that. 
TRAVIS: We don't even know that one. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: 14. 
MATT: He maintains concentration. 
LIAM: Motherfucker. 
MATT: A lot of natural 15s with that advantage. 
LIAM: That's high, that is 29, 33 to hit. 
MATT: That'll hit. 
TALIESIN: There we go. 
LIAM: Let's make it a goading attack. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
MATT: All righty. Wisdom save? 
LIAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Three. 
MATT: That's going to be an 18. 
LIAM: Okay, three, six is nine. There's 14. 
ASHLEY: Come on, take this guy out. 
LIAM: And one more. 19 points of damage. 
MATT: 19 points of damage, nice. 
LIAM: Concentration check. 
MATT: Concentration check. 
LIAM: Dang, he's a beefy boy. 
MATT: Natural 16 and a natural 19. Yeah, they're rolling-- 
LAURA: Bastard. 
MATT: -- pretty good on that save. 
LIAM: He is. 
MATT: He's looking hurt. He's definitely looking hurt. 
LIAM: Wait, so he has advantage and he got a 19, that's what that was? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Okay, okay. Then I am donezo. 
MATT: All right, that finishes Orym's go. End of the round is going to be the Ludinus Da'leth. 
LAURA: (gasp) He gets to go? 
MATT: The prospective vessel. 
ROBBIE: No. 
TRAVIS: Well, he rolled like shit, huh, Matt? 
MATT: He rolled really bad initiative. 
TRAVIS: Oh okay. 
MATT: Let's see. 
TRAVIS: Luda! 
MATT: From behind there. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Just lower the dome, dude. 
LAURA: I thought-- 
TRAVIS: Lower the dome. 
SAM: He can't do anything from inside an Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. Unless it's not. 
MATT: It's not an Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. 
SAM: Ah. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait. 
SAM: He went outside the manual. 
LAURA and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
LAURA: Maybe it was a Force Wall, but made into a dome. 
MATT: Now, here's the interesting point. He can't cast any spells through it. 
SAM: Oh, so it's like-- 
LAURA: But he can do stuff to-- 
MATT: But he will-- 
SAM: Lair actions? 
MATT: He will attempt to use his Crush Will ability. 
MARISHA: Ah. 
ROBBIE: What's that? 
MATT: That was once a Liliana ability. 
ASHLEY: Crush. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
ROBBIE: No! 
LAURA: He's already got an ability from her? 
ROBBIE: Pilfered it? 
LAURA: (gasp) Matthew! 
MATT: You drain the power after just a short time. It's the hour that takes it permanently. 
SAM: If he drains her permanently, do you have to call him Mom? 
MATT: (laughs) I think that legally she does have to. (laughter) 
LAURA: No-wah! 
SAM: I mean, technically, he'll be your mom. 
LAURA: Don't say that. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Maybe he makes excellent cookies now. She never made cookies for you. 
LAURA: She never made cookies. 
LIAM: We've got two rounds. 
MATT: On his turn, he's going to be like "Oh, maybe you'll get to watch each other crumble this day." And he puts his hand out-- 
MARISHA: What if he-- starts speaking in-- 
MATT: -- and he closes his fist-- 
MARISHA: -- a Southern accent? 
MATT: -- towards you. 
ASHLEY: Mominus? 
MATT: I need you to take an intelligence saving throw, please. 
SAM: You have disadvantage on those or are you okay? 
LAURA: No, I'm okay, I'm okay. I just have no intelligence at all, I'm real stupid. 
SAM: We knew that. 
MARISHA: Don't talk about-- 
TRAVIS: That's not true. 
MATT: That's a d10. 
MARISHA: -- Imogen like that. 
ROBBIE: No, you're simple, you're sweet, you're emotionally intuitive. 
ASHLEY: Should it be Mominus or Ludiny? 
MARISHA: It's so underhanded. "No, you're emotionally intuitive." 
TALIESIN: I can't see it, but it don't look great. 
SAM: Nothing. 
LAURA: Four. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Four. Take 30 points of psychic damage. 
TALIESIN: Ugh. 
LAURA: Reduced to 15. 
MATT: Reduced to 15, indeed, and you are stunned until the end-- 
LAURA: Fuck! 
TRAVIS: Stunned! 
MARISHA: Stunned. 
MATT: -- of his next turn. 
TRAVIS and ROBBIE: Stunned! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
SAM: Stone cold. 
MATT: You (crackle) (grunt) and feel he crushes the core of your mind for the moment, and you hear that (static crackling), that endless breaking of-- 
LAURA: Until the end of my next turn? 
MATT: The end of his next turn. 
SAM: Oh, that's a whole round! 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
LIAM: Took a whole turn away from you. 
ROBBIE: Whoa. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that sucks. 
ROBBIE: Does the Whirlwind go away? 
LAURA: No. 
ROBBIE: It stays? 
LAURA: Look, if they're-- 
MATT: But you still have to roll a concentration check. 
LAURA: -- fucking (Whirlwind whirling) up in there-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: ♪ Up in here ♪ 
MATT: So what was that again? It was 30... 
LAURA: 15 points of damage is what I took. 
MATT: 15 points, yeah. So what'd you roll? 
LAURA: So I rolled a 12 plus seven. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You maintain concentration. So he finishes that and just watches you (grunts) in the air, barely holding yourself up with the sheer force of the Exaltant power courses through you. "(devious laugh)" 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
MATT: That's going to finish his turn. 
SAM: (groans) 
MATT: Chetney, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to-- 
LAURA: That's a whole turn to save her. 
ASHLEY: That's a whole turn. 
LAURA: Look, they're caught up in there. You can still send spells into my Whirlwind. 
TRAVIS: I'll use 10 feet of movement to move up towards Mr. Incredible. He really looks like Mr. Incredible from where I am. Just red and black cape. 
MATT: (laughs) Perfect. 
TRAVIS: I don't know what he's wearing, but I just see black and red. 
MATT: I love it. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'll take an unarmed strike. Bonus action, I'm going to rake my claws against my titties-- 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- and draw blood. 
SAM: I would like to rake. 
TRAVIS: I will, it's a d8 now, two points. Okay. First one is-- Where the hell? Where the hell did it go? 20 to hit. 
MATT: 20 to hit? 
LAURA: Damn. 
MATT: He's going to cast Shield (whoosh) and deflects that. 
TRAVIS: It's all right, it's all right. This one will definitely hit. 29 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Great, and the third one is 28 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah, both of those hit. 
TRAVIS: Natural 19 and natural 18. Great, okay. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MATT: Well, that was three attacks, but you used your bonus action to use your-- 
TRAVIS: I did. It should just be two. It just should be the one. 
MATT: So one hits. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you. 
MATT: No worries. 
TRAVIS: And 1d8. Eight plus six. 14 plus four is 18 points of slashing damage. 
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage. 
TRAVIS: And that's it. Boy, worst time to use that fucking bonus action, isn't it? Goddamn it. 
MATT: Yeah, he's looking real hurt. 
MARISHA: He's looking real hurt. 
MATT: Also, as a note-- 
TRAVIS: Fuck! 
MATT: -- the first round has completed. 
TRAVIS: I should've just-- 
MATT: You watch as the tips of Liliana's feet begin to crack-- 
LAURA and ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: -- and begin to crumble into a powder. Finishing Chetney's go, Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. ♪ We're going to do ♪ another Scorching Ray ♪ ♪ Scorching Ray ♪ 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Wait a minute, do I want to do that? 
SAM: ♪ Everywhere you turn, it's a Scorching Ray ♪ 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Wait, let me see what level this is. Hold on one second. I'm sorry. I'm not going to do that. Okay, Scorching Ray. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: At 3rd-level again. 
MATT: Okay, so that's four rays. Who are you aiming them at? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to aim them into Imogen's Whirlwind. 
MATT: Okay, so which one-- 
ASHLEY: So it's just like (scorching rays wildly flying). 
MATT: All right, so one at each guy and one get hits twice? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Exciting. 
MATT: Go for it. So they are restrained, so technically you have advantage on the attack rolls. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! Okay. 
LAURA: They're clumped up in there. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we're going to get this all clumpy. Okay. Okay. 27 for the first hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: 16 for the second. 
MATT: Misses. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: 28 for the third. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: And, yeah. 
SAM: 27. 
ASHLEY: 27 for the fourth. 
MATT: Great, yeah. So three hit, so that's 2d6, 2d6 and 2d6 since they're different targets. 
ASHLEY: Where are my teeth? There they are. 
TALIESIN: ♪ She wants a shoehorn ♪ 
ASHLEY: Teeth. 
LAURA: (laughs) So funny. 
MATT: 3d8 against one of them, if I recall. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so how many? I'm so sorry. 
MATT: Or sorry, an additional 1d8 against one of them. So it's 2d6, 2d6, and 2d6. Let me know what those numbers are. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
SAM: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So we've got-- 
LAURA: Those are pretty good. Then 1d8 again to one of those rolls. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought that was a seven. 
LAURA: I did too. 
ASHLEY: Ah, damn. Okay, so we've got 10. 17. Shit. 
LAURA: No, it's 2d-- 
SAM: You got to do them separately. 
LAURA: Yeah, 2d6 against each, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: So there you go. This is one of them-- 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry. 
LAURA: -- is 10 on one, 10 on another and seven on another. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay, there we go. 
ASHLEY: Because there's three in there. 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, I thought there was two in there. 
MATT: Did you add your extra d8 against one of them because Mister's out? 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I did. 
MATT: Okay, cool. All right, so for that, each of them has to make a concentration check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: I'm just going to double check something here. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
LAURA: Let's triple check. 
MATT: Correct. All right, so the first one-- 
ASHLEY: Teeth! 
MATT: -- fails. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Yay! 
MATT: Even with advantage, so that's now two of them that currently don't have concentration. I'm going to mark that here. 
ASHLEY: Are you freezing? 
TALIESIN: All right, all right, all right. 
MATT: Going to mark these with green. 
ASHLEY: I'm sweating. 
SAM: I have no body fat. 
TRAVIS: Matty, I'm so sorry. Did you roll the... 
ASHLEY: (teasing) I have no body fat. 
SAM: I don't! 
TRAVIS: Con save. 
SAM: I'm just a skinny, skinny athletic boy. 
LAURA: Oh, and Matt. 
MATT: Yeah, he's fine. 
LAURA: Just so you know, on their future turns, they can make strength saves to get out of the-- 
MATT: They have to spend an action to get out of it to do it, though. 
LAURA: Yeah. Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. Okay. So yeah, I'll say that one of them has lost concentration there. Was it this one that lost? No, this one lost concentration when you were fighting it, right? 
LIAM: I don't think he did. 
MATT: Which one was it? 
LIAM: He kept saving the whole time. 
MATT: That's right. 
LIAM: Yeah, it was one in the maelstrom. 
MATT: I think it was, yeah. So there's two in the maelstrom that lost concentration. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: Double check that. 
ASHLEY: That's something, that's something. 
LIAM: That guy rolled concentration checks like a champ. 
MARISHA: So we have two-- 
MATT: He did actually. 
MARISHA: -- people concentrating on it right now? 
MATT: You have one, two at the moment concentrating, yes. 
LAURA: The other two have lost their concentration, or three have lost concentration? 
MATT: This one still has it. 
LAURA: Okay. That one still has it. 
MATT: This one still has it. Two in there have lost-- So actually, there's three that have concentration currently. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: All right, so finishing Chetney's go. I'm sorry, Fearne, is that the end of your turn? You want to move? 
ASHLEY: I'm also going to roll for Mister to throw some flaming shit. 
MATT: Okay. Do you want to move at all, or you want to stay put? 
ASHLEY: I think-- ♪ (hums little ditty) ♪ I think I'm okay there. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Actually, I'm going to move in a little bit this way. 
MATT: Okay. 10 feet? 
LAURA: Don't clump in. Don't clump in. They can do big bubbles. 
ASHLEY: Don't clump in? I know. I'm going to stay where I was at. I'm going to go with my first instinct. 
MATT: Let's go. 
ASHLEY: All right, roll for Mister. 
LIAM: Let's go. 
ASHLEY: I don't think that works. 18? 
MATT: Against? 
ASHLEY: Against-- 
MATT: The one that's hitting-- 
ASHLEY: -- the one near Chet. 
MATT: The one near Chetney? He still has Shield on, I think. 
ASHLEY: Nevermind, wait. I'm going to go for this guy right here for flaming shit. 
SAM: Which guy? 
MATT: The guy that's on the ground? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, that'd be at disadvantage because it's a ranged attack against somebody who's prone. 
ASHLEY: 17. 
MATT: 17 misses unfortunately. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Good try. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, I'm done. 
MATT: Finishing your go, Braius is up, with Laudna on deck. 
SAM: Oh! That was your whole turn? 
ASHLEY: That was my turn. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: She shot four-- 
LIAM: Fuck 'em up, beefcake. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Okay. I will finish what you started, little warrior. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. (chuckling) 
SAM: I will, with the hilt of my, the handle of my flail, which has a sharp tip, I will stab down. 
MATT: Hell yeah, let's go. 
LIAM: Sick. 
SAM: Do I get advantage because he's prone? 
MATT: Yes, you do. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. (grimaces) Hope it's better than that. 
LIAM: Was it a one? 
SAM: No, it wasn't. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Not great. 
LIAM: (silly) Was it a one? 
SAM: 17. 
MATT: 17 misses. He rolls out of the way. 
LAURA: We have a lot. 
MATT: Slams into the rock. 
LIAM: So much right about here. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, there is. 
SAM: I will try again with my second attack. 
MATT: Let's go! Second attack. 
SAM: Yeah. I wonder if I want to do a bonus action first. Can I do a bonus action in the middle of the two-- 
MATT: If you want to, yeah. 
SAM: -- actions? Yeah, I'll do-- He's going to die if I hit him, but whatever. I'll pump in some-- I'll do Wrathful Smite at level three. 
MATT: Okay. Let's go. 
SAM: No, I'm sorry, Matt. I'm just going to do a level two Divine Smite. 
MATT: Okay. Let's go. 
SAM: If I hit him, sorry. One of them is a one. 
LIAM: But is it the lower one? 
SAM: It is the lower one. 
LIAM: Fuck that. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: No, no. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Yeah, reroll the one. 
LIAM: You can, but it's a reaction. So I've use my reaction to-- 
SAM: Oh, well then I don't need to because the top one was an 11 plus 12 is 23 to hit. 
MATT: That will hit. 
SAM: Okay, so that's just 4d8 damage. 
LIAM: Cave in that skull. 
MATT: Let's see. 
SAM: They're all bad. 
MATT: Well, it's still-- No, it's this turn, not this-- Yeah. So he doesn't have the Shield ability. 
LAURA: Oh, great. 
MATT: His Parry ability only lasts that turn. 
LAURA: Oh great. Okay. 
SAM: 18 points. I said Divine Smite at level one or two? 
LAURA: Two. 
MATT: You said level two. 
SAM: Okay, then one more. Another seven. 
MATT: Another seven? 
SAM: Yeah, 24. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
ROBBIE: All right! 
MARISHA: Come on! 
SAM: I will stab down with my flail, but I will never leave eye contact with Orym. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: Just twisting and twisting, and making sure that blood and ichor spray on my face in a hot way. 
LIAM: Orym is hypnotically held. 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Plot thickens! 
ASHLEY: Uh-oh! 
LIAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: All right, Braius. 
TRAVIS: It's always something else. 
MATT: Do you want to stay where you are, Braius? 
TALIESIN: You get bucked off the horse immediately. 
SAM: I can't do anything else. 
MATT: There's a massive Whirlwind just-- (forceful whooshing) 
LIAM: Did he say "moo"-- 
SAM: I don't want to go in there. 
MATT: -- filling the space up here. 
LIAM: -- or "Moo-urns"? 
SAM: I don't want to go in there, so I guess I'll just stay put, right? 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I don't know what else to do. 
LAURA: You can't fling anything into it? 
ROBBIE: Are there enemies anywhere else? 
LIAM: Could you just swing from the edge? 
SAM: I did my two actions already. 
LAURA and LIAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: There are three enemies in the Whirlwind. One here and then one over there. 
ROBBIE: Mm. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh, there's three in the Whirlwind? 
LAURA: Yeah, I got three-- 
TALIESIN: Three the Whirlwind, only one holding concentration. 
LAURA: -- in the Whirlwind. 
SAM: If I go in, do I get hurt? Is it a hurt thing? 
MATT: Yes, you do. 
LAURA: Yeah, you'd take bludgeoning damage. 
SAM: I don't want to, right? 
LAURA: No, you could take a lot. 
ASHLEY: No. 
SAM: Oh wait. 
TALIESIN: Bludgeoning damage, good to know. 
SAM: I can cast a spell. That won't help me. (frantically searching for helpful spell) "Wisdom save, on a failed save, they're drawn to you, compelled to your divine command." What would that help? That doesn't help. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Does anyone need a Healing Word? 
MARISHA: I wouldn't say no to it, but I don't know if I'm close enough to you. Wait, no, it's 60 feet? 
SAM: I think it's 30. 
LAURA: 30 feet. 
TALIESIN: You haven't used your move yet, though. 
SAM: I haven't. I could get closer. Oh, it's 60 feet. 
MARISHA: It is 60 feet, right? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: I think you're further than 60 feet because you tried to do Silvery Barbs before. You're too far. 
MARISHA: I did try to do Silvery Barbs. 
TALIESIN: So you would have to move. 
LAURA: It's 65 feet. 
SAM: I'll get within 60 feet of her. 
MARISHA: That would be, you'd need to move-- 
MARISHA: It's like one-- 
MATT: -- there. 
SAM: Great, and I will Healing Words her. 
MATT: What level? 
MARISHA: Just do a basic one. 
SAM: Just a basic. 
MATT: You got it. So 1d4 plus your wisdom. 
SAM: Okay, great. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Or charisma, sorry. It's your charisma-- 
MARISHA: I wouldn't say no. 
SAM: Okay, six points. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: You heal six points, Laudna. 
LIAM: Would you be able to-- 
MATT: Finishing Braius' go, Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: I am uppity up. The guy in front of me, does he have metallic armor on? I think you said earlier that he does or some elements of metal. 
MATT: There are elements of metal, yeah, but the armor, it's interesting. When they're attacked, psychic fields tend to block and protect. What they're wearing metal-wise is more ornamental. 
ROBBIE: Hmm. 
MARISHA: In terms of them taking advantage because they have metal on them for a Shocking Grasp? 
MATT: I'll allow it. 
MARISHA: Okay, so I'm going to reach forward and grab his metallic bracers with my fucked up face right in front of him. 
MATT: "(unsettled noise)" 
MARISHA: Do Shocking Grasp. 
MATT: Let's go. 
MARISHA: I have advantage. Then this is an attack, so I have to minus a d6, correct? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Roll low. Okay, that's good. So that is going to be-- 
SAM: Rolo! 
MARISHA: Fucking-- 17 plus 12, it's going to be 20, not nine. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, 29. 3d8 damage. I'll just, shit, shit. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Let's just not fuck this up. 
MARISHA: Okay, 17 damage, 17 electric damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: And he cannot take reactions. 
MATT: All righty! 
MARISHA: So I'm going to ♪ move away from him. ♪ I'm going to go one, two, three, five, 10, 15, 20, 25. Can I tuck on this side? 
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. 
MARISHA: Okay, so I'll go there. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to-- Yeah. I'm going to Quicken a spell. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: I'm going to Quicken some Eldritch Blasts and start popping some people off. 
MATT: Let's go. 
MARISHA: You said this guy in front of Chetney is looking real rough, right? 
MATT: Yeah, he's looking pretty gnarled. 
TRAVIS: Should've been more if I wasn't fucking it up so much. 
MATT: No. 
SAM: So there's three people concentrating right now? 
MATT: Correct. Oh, no, there's two currently. 
LAURA: Two left. 
ROBBIE: Can I ask a question? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Theoretically, if it's a spell and they've lost their concentration, potentially when it comes back around, they could choose to spend their action to reengage-- 
MATT: Their bonus action to reengage concentration. 
ROBBIE: Their bonus action? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Got to kill him. 
MARISHA: All right, this guy in front of Chet. Oh god, that misses. 
SAM: With what? 
MARISHA: First one, I rolled a two. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: That had a chance. 
MARISHA: It does not. 
TRAVIS: What the fuck? Three. 
MARISHA: That's better. Jeez Louise. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: A three. 
MATT: I saw that, two and a three. 
MARISHA: 28 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
MARISHA: (chuckles) That's a little bit of something, 15 points of damage. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) (clapping) 
MARISHA: That's something, that's something. 
LIAM: I'm applauding for my shirt, not the move. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Because my mouth is so like-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, I didn't even-- 
MARISHA: -- unhinged-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- from my jaw, I go like: Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah! (laughter) ARISHA: Shoot Eldritch Blast out of my mouth. 
MATT: He's concentrating, looking at Chetney. Hears that noise and goes-- 
LAURA: Gah, gah, gah, gah. "What in the-- (screams)" (explosion) (laughter) 
MARISHA: You know, like those Halloween skulls. 
MATT: Yep, yep. 
MARISHA: Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah. 
MATT: And gets blasted against the rock and crumples into a pile. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Have you guys heard my Ben Folds Five cover band? 
MATT: That finishes your turn? 
LAURA: Yeah, you look-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, no kidding. 
MARISHA: Yes, that finishes my turn. 
ASHLEY: ♪ She's a brick and I'm-- ♪ 
MATT: Okay, the Exaltant Knight that's still standing is going to start by taking his glass blade and he throws it and psychically it (swooshing) fires up towards you. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LIAM: Oh, fuck off. 
ROBBIE: Towards who? 
SAM: To Imogen? 
LAURA: Me because I was stunned. 
MATT: 40-foot range. 
LAURA: He gets advantage. 
MATT: He does. Yeah, it's going to be 25 to hit. 
LAURA: That hits. 
MATT: All right, and another hit coming at you. (chuckles) With advantage, a natural one and a natural two. 
LAURA: Oh great. 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: So that's going to be a-- It's only going to a 12 so only one of them hits you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You take eight points of slashing damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: And you have disadvantage on intelligence saving throws until its next turn. 
LAURA: Jeebies. 
MATT: Then it's going to run five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. It's going to use its bonus action to begin concentrating to hold the shield. 
SAM: No! 
LIAM: (growls) 
MATT: Finishing their go, Ashton, you're up, with Dorian on deck. 
TALIESIN: How far away is that fucking ninja motherfucker for me? Is it within 40 feet or no? 
MATT: This one here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the one that just ran away, that little bitch. 
MATT: He's about 50 or so feet from you through the rock. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk out to the other side of the rock. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Just that far, yeah, and actually, I'll be able to get that, that's okay. 
MARISHA: (sneezing) 
MATT: Gesundheit. 
TALIESIN: Is that as little as I can move right there, or is that-- 
MATT: That is 10 feet there. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so five feet wouldn't do it to get visual on him. 
MATT: You can, but he'll be considered half cover, which gives him a bonus to AC. 
TALIESIN: All right, never mind. All right, giving this another go. Motherfucker, get over here. And I'm doing another-- Goddamn, I'm burning another Chaos Burst and taking my advantage and it's a Wormhole Strike. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Come on, don't be a dick. 
LIAM: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: That's 24 to hit. 
MATT: 24. Yeah, that'll hit. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Okay, he takes-- It's been a while. Let's see. 
LAURA and MARISHA: ♪ It's been a while ♪ 
TALIESIN: (mumbled reading) Okay, let's see. Chaos Burst, make a ranged attack. Okay, so that's Seven-- 19 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: (impacts) 
TALIESIN: And-- 
MATT: Natural 16, maintains concentration. 
TALIESIN: That's okay because as that happens, as the hammer comes and smacks him from the side of the rock-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- he suddenly falls through a portal and is now directly behind that rock over there, 15. I'm just tossing him over there using the Scattering Blow. I'm just tossing him over there using the Scattering Blow. 
MATT: Okay! 
TALIESIN: So he finds himself suddenly tumbling out here. 
SAM: Ooh, nice. 
TALIESIN: About all the way in the back, 15 feet away from me in that direction. 
MATT: Here? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LAURA: Does that break concentration if he has visual? 
MATT: Hmm? No, he's still concentrating. 
LAURA: (groans) 
ROBBIE: (winces) 
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to walk up and: Perhaps I didn't fucking make myself clear. I'm taking another shot. 
MARISHA: Come on, Ashton. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
ROBBIE: Hit him in the face. 
TALIESIN: 21. 
LIAM: Break his face. 
SAM: Brain him. 
MATT: 21, he is going to use his reaction to Psychic Buckler and add five to his AC, so that misses. 
TALIESIN: All right, that's okay, I'm right up in front of him. I'm also, that will push him five feet away from me, too, just the shove. No, I have to do damage, never mind. 
MATT: Okay, fair. All right, that finishes your turn, Ashton? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm pretty good. 
MATT: All right, Dorian, you're up, with Imogen stunned on deck. 
ROBBIE: Since I flew straight up with her, I think right next to her, I'd like to fly directly over to Imogen, if I can, use my movement to get to her, and I want to try to reach out for her and I know it. I want to shake her and see how she's doing, put hands on her and she's out of it, right? 
MATT: Yeah, her eyes are rolling back and you can see there's a little bit of blood from the ears. 
ROBBIE: But she's upright, too, right? 
LAURA: I'm up, I'm just stunned. 
MATT: Yeah, her flying is erratic and hovering more than anything. 
SAM: Draw a mustache on her face. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to grab her hand and hold it tight and just say: I love my mom, too. 
LAURA: (whimpers) 
ROBBIE: Then I'm going to cast a 5th-level Lightning Bolt straight down the shoot at all those guys. 
MATT: Oh, these guys here? 
ROBBIE: A hundred feet. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: It's five feet wide so I think I should-- 
MATT: You can get all three. 
ROBBIE: -- catch all three of them. 
MATT: The way they're sit right there, yeah. 
LIAM: Billiards. 
LAURA: That's great. 
ROBBIE: As I do it, Imogen's got this beautiful purple lightning and mine's yellow like the sky, and as he sends it out to them, there's a little purple sparkle to it. 
LAURA: Through my stun, you feel a little bit of a squeeze on your hand. 
SAM: Aw! 
MATT: I love it. 
SAM: Come on. 
ROBBIE: It's all right. 
SAM: Come on. 
ROBBIE: 12, 13, 10. Better. 19. 21, 23, could be better. 24. 
MATT: 24, they do have disadvantage on dexterity saves because they are restrained within the tornado. 24, you said? 
ROBBIE: 24. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Some of them have already been hurt, right? 
ROBBIE and LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: That one's going to fail. He's looking real bad. This guy right here. Succeeds. So takes 12. Yep, and the last guy natural one, no, fails. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: One of them is deeply wrecked. The other two look pretty hurt. That's awesome. 
ROBBIE: Sweet. 
MATT: That's your turn? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, and then for my bonus action, I'll say: Get up. And I'll give her bardic inspiration. 
MARISHA: Aw! 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: His is a d10. 
ROBBIE: Yep. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
MATT: You see all this through the fugue haze and this static, you hear his voice, you see the flash of light and hear the distant psychic screams of the other Exaltant connected to you via the tethers of Predathos. You begin to call yourself back. You spend your turn stunned, but you're starting to bring your consciousness back. Finishing that go, it's now the Exaltants' turn. As a bonus action, they're all going to maintain concentration. 
TALIESIN: Got to kill them all. 
LIAM: ♪ Got to kill them all ♪ 
TALIESIN: I also assume I yelled loud enough that you know I got one back here, by the way. Yeah. 
SAM: ♪ Be bop a do ♪ 
MATT: Okay, so they don't keep taking damage when they're in it. It's for the initial pickup. Okay. So with that, one of them is going to cast Hypnotic Pattern on both Orym, Coriolis, and Braius. I need you three to make wisdom saving throws, please. 
LIAM: At advantage because of our Heroes' Feast? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Oh, goddamn it. 10. 
SAM: Are you within-- 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm real close to you. 
SAM: -- five feet of me. 
LIAM: Five feet. 
SAM: Still probably not going to help. You get a plus four. 
TALIESIN: Five feet. 
SAM: Are you within five feet? 
LIAM: No, I don't think so, 
TALIESIN: That's real tight. 
SAM: Oops. Well, I rolled two. 
MARISHA: That was a wisdom save you just did? 
MATT: They're no longer. 
LIAM: I'm going to use Indomitable and roll again. 
MATT: Okay, let's go. 
LIAM: Where is it? Where is it? I'm not sure if this is good enough. 17 for me. 
MATT: 17 succeeds. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: Better, way better. 20. 
MATT: 20, okay. The next one is going to try it again. 
SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Both roll again. 
SAM: Okay. Wisdom save? 
MATT: Shouting to each other in the middle of the room, "Just hold it! Hold it! They're close!" 
LIAM: 21. 
MATT: 21. 
SAM: 16. 
MATT: 16 just fails. (groaning) 
MATT: Braius is charmed and currently-- 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. 
MATT: -- standing there. 
LIAM and MATT: Wait, wait, wait. 
LAURA: He moved closer, too. Oh, but you moved away. 
TALIESIN: How does it that the joke we never died? It's so old. 
MARISHA: I know. 
SAM: Oh, it died. We just keep going. 
TALIESIN: Just keep going there. 
LAURA: We have Revivify. 
TALIESIN: Don't know how to stop. 
MARISHA: No, I didn't pop it off, never mind. Nope, sorry, Braius. 
LIAM: This is Purgatory. 
SAM: It's fine, I know you don't really like me. No one respects me. 
MARISHA: Help you. 
LAURA: Don't you do it, don't "What's my mother's name?" 
SAM: No one respects me. 
ROBBIE: Does Coriolis have to make a saving throw? 
TRAVIS: I respect your alpha, Braius. 
LIAM: He has two of those saves, right? 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: You're the only one-- 
LIAM: He did not eat the Heroes' Feast. First one is-- It's minus stuff. That's an 11, the first, and a one. 
LAURA: (gasping) Which he can reroll because he's within five feet. 
LIAM: I could give my reaction to him, but the first one already ate shit, so. 
MATT: Yeah, so Coriolis is now no longer moving and is just in place floating, looking at this beautiful light. 
LIAM: (horse whimpering) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: Would you have to be above a certain intelligence level to have Hypnotic Gaze? 
MARISHA: This poor horse. 
ROBBIE: Him and your dog are just hanging out. 
MATT: What? 
LAURA: Above a certain intelligence level for Hypnotic Gaze to work. 
MATT: How intelligent is Coriolis? 
LIAM: Coriolis has an intelligence of two. 
MATT: Two, let's see. 
LIAM: Coriolis plummets to the ground. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Naur. 
MATT: That's only on some other things, but no good looking out, though, good looking out. 
TALIESIN: All right. All right. 
MATT: All right. 
ROBBIE: He's a sweet boy. 
MATT: Last one, he's going to cast-- 
LIAM: You motherfucker. 
MATT: -- Phantasmal Killer on you. 
LIAM: Oh cool. 
ROBBIE: What? 
MATT: So I need you to make another wisdom saving throw. 
LAURA: You're immune to fear, too, because of our Heroes' Feast. 
MATT: Oh, that's right, no, we agreed to that, never mind. I'm going to hold that back then. Instead-- Heroes' Feast, man. I have it in mind, and then I forget it when I build some of these things, but that's how it would work, too. It's not like I want to build to try and get around what you guys prepared for, so this is working out great for you. 
MARISHA: No, it's okay, you can be honest. 
TALIESIN: We forgot, too, for a little bit, so that works out. 
MATT: You know what? One of them is going to drop concentration to cast Telekinesis. 
TRAVIS: Whoa? 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: What?! 
MATT: It's going to-- It's going to cast it on you. 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
LIAM: Wolfie! 
MATT: I need you-- 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: -- to make a strength check. 
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm-- 
MARISHA: You're strong. 
TRAVIS: Not a saving throw, but just a strength check, right? 
MATT: Yep, so just add it, roll a d20 and add your strength. 
MARISHA: Roll high. 
LIAM: That was-- 
MARISHA: No. 
TRAVIS: -- fucking balls. Double fives, nine. 
MATT: Nine, as you are there in wolf form, suddenly you feel yourself bound by an invisible force that pushes you 30 feet back and holds you aloft in the air. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Wow, they have shit. 
TRAVIS: That is unbelievable. Let's do that again. That would've been better. 
MATT: You are now-- 
LIAM: That's my emotional support wolf. 
MATT: -- being held up in the air right there. 
TRAVIS: (wolf yelp) 
MATT: Restrained and unable to pull free. On your turn., you can try and break free, if you'd like to, but now you are currently held there. All right, that's going to finish their turn. Finishing the Exaltants, Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: I scooch the side of Coriolis' head and say: I'll be back, boy. I'm going to leap and pinball off of this rock down to where I hear Ashton yelling. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
LAURA: (whimpering) 
LIAM: Live, Coriolis. 
MATT: Leap down to where-- 
LIAM: Boom. 
TALIESIN: Hey, look at that. It's almost as if I tried to set it up. 
LIAM: Set 'em up, knock 'em down. 
MATT: Let's go. 
LIAM: Okay. Attack! That is a-- That's good, that is a 29 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Let's make it-- Nope, I'm going to save it. I'm going to save it, so it's not going to be a huge hit. That is nine points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Second is a 26 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
LIAM: That is 14 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Last one, I reroll my own one. That is a 24 to hit. 
MATT: Okay, that hits. 
LIAM: That is 13 points of damage. So I crisscross really fast across this character's back before they can even turn around. 
MATT: First one succeeds on maintaining concentration. Second one, natural 20. 
LIAM: Jesus, these guys. 
MATT: Third one, yeah, so it succeeds. Each hit, their DC's 10. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: And they get their constitution saving throw. 
LIAM: Yeah, they're master psychics. Yes. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We'll take that. 
MATT: But he's starting to look a little hurt. 
LAURA: A little hurt. 
MATT: That finishes your go, Orym. 
TALIESIN: One good crit would be the end of that. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's it. 
TALIESIN: Keep him locked in. 
MARISHA: Damn. 
LAURA: We have one more turn. 
MATT: It's now Ludinus' turn. See if he gets that back. He does not. So he-- 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: There's two now because one dropped. 
LAURA: There's two in there that have concentration up. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the bubble. 
LAURA: And this guy that you guys are attacking, so there's three. 
MATT: He is going to Mind Sliver. 
ROBBIE: What? 
TALIESIN: We need to murder them all. 
MATT: With extended range. 
TALIESIN: Is it almost worth dropping the ship? No. 
MATT: He's going to sit there. And go like, "You would've been so useful. Maybe there's still a chance. Show me how well you can endure." 
TALIESIN: Oh, fucking-- 
MATT: "We'll see whose right this is." He's going to do Mind Sliver on you. So you make an intelligence saving throw. 
LIAM: At disadvantage? 
MATT: At disadvantage because you hit with the blade last time. 
ASHLEY: So I gave you Guidance earlier. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: So that should help you in this moment. 
LAURA: I did, I did use it. 
ASHLEY: You did? Oh. 
LAURA: I did use it. Four. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
MATT: That's going to be 15 points of psychic damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Reduced to seven, since you're resistant. 
SAM: That's not so bad. 
MATT: And your next saving throw before the next turn, subtracts a d4. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: As he does this to you, he reaches up and pats the side of Liliana's face as she's "(gasping)" gasping for breath. He says, "Soon you'll rest here." 
LAURA: I'm stunned. Can I say anything? 
MATT: End of the turn, you're no stunned, you can. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: That's right. 
SAM: No longer stunned? 
MATT: It's the end of his turn. 
LAURA: Fuck you. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
LAURA: You're going to die here. 
MATT: "I know. Not before I finish everything I've wanted to do for so long." Top of the round, Chetney, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Ugh! 
SAM: I love him. 
LAURA: (grunts) 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Fearne, you're on deck. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to-- I'm restrained, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: I can try and break free of it? 
MATT: You can, yeah. 
TRAVIS: I'm going-- 
MARISHA: Did you bring-- No, you don't have slippery juice. 
TRAVIS: No slippery juice for me. I'm going to try and Misty Step out of it. 
LAURA: Yeah, that'll work. 
MARISHA: Hell yes. 
LAURA: Pop pop! 
TALIESIN: (speaking gibberish) 
ASHLEY: Okurrr. 
MARISHA: (hums "Okurrr.") 
TALIESIN: Batta bap! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: All right, all right. 
MATT: Yes, you can spend an action, try and break free of the things. You want to do that? 
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to Misty Step? 
MATT: Oh sorry, Misty Step. Yeah, you can totally do that. 
TRAVIS: Great, Misty Step 60, 30 feet. 
MATT: 30 feet. 
TRAVIS: Towards the horrible bubble. 
MATT: That'll put you pretty much right back on where you were. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
MATT: There. 
TRAVIS: Then can I spend 30 more feet of movement to run towards the booble? 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: 30 more feet? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Go in the booble? 
MATT: 15, 20, 25. 
TRAVIS: Don't they all need to die? 
MATT: 30. 
TALIESIN: They all need to die. 
MATT: That'll get you right there. 
SAM: Did you want to go into the bubble? 
TRAVIS: Well, I have claws and sharp things. 
SAM: Then you should have Misty Stepped towards the orange bubble. I think he Misty Stepped you towards the blue bubble. 
MATT: Oh, I misunderstood. 
LAURA: So you could have gotten within. 
MATT: So that would've been there. 
LIAM: Further. 
LAURA: Then 30 feet of movement would get you into the booble. 
MATT: You would be there. Then five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 would get you within range of one of them. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, and then I'll use jump with the last 10 feet of my-- 
LIAM: ♪ Go ahead and jump. ♪ 
TRAVIS: -- movement to jump in and start swinging. I'm going to jump into the bounce house with a bunch of knives. 
MATT: You go, you enter it. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw as you leap into the Whirlwind-- 
LAURA: I hope you don't get restrained though by it. 
MATT: -- picked up with it and spinning. 
TRAVIS: Who cares? This is great. 
MATT: Hell, yes. 
LIAM: I love it. 
TALIESIN: Good times. 
LAURA: Dex save. 
TRAVIS: Dex 27. 
LAURA: Okay good, you resist it! So you'll take half damage. 
MATT: And you take half of that because it is bludgeoning. 
ROBBIE: Ooh, so many dice. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yeah, it rolled real well, too. 
TALIESIN: Wow, yeah, that was great. 
MATT: See, this is the fun bit. Where you're like, what can I endure? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not here to come out of this squeaky clean. 
LAURA: 22, 26, 30. 
ROBBIE: The terms for saving were three full rounds, correct? 
LAURA: 34, 30. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: 34, 39 points of bludgeoning. 
MATT: We're in the last round. 
LAURA: Halved-halved. 
LIAM: We've got to down the psychics. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: So 40 to 19, 19 (mumbling). 10? 
LAURA: Eight. No, I think you'd go down nine because 19 halved-- 
MATT: 19 would be-- Half that would be nine. Nine points of bludgeoning damage and then make a strength saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Do I have advantage of that? 
MATT: You do in wolf form, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Natural 20. 
LAURA: Fuck yeah. 
MATT: Oh yeah, you're fine. 
LAURA: Fuck yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: So you are not restrained. Your attacks go through fine. They are, so you have an advantage on your attacks against your targets. 
MARISHA: Come on, Chet! 
LAURA: Yes! Get 'em, Chet. 
TRAVIS: I'll take three swings. Oh, no, just two swings at one of them. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, 17, 27 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Six plus 12. 16, 17 points of slashing damage. Six points of lightning for the, bleh, bleh, bleh. What's it called? Crimson. 
TALIESIN: Crimson Rite. 
MATT: You got it. 
MATT: Now you see this Whirlwind and arcs of lightning as this wolf is spinning up into it and slashing into one of them. 
TRAVIS: Sick. 
LIAM: Wolf storm. 
TRAVIS: 25 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: And-- Nine, 10, 11 plus five, 16 points of slashing, five of which are lightning. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? 
ALL: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: I literally run in, jump, I hit the fucking typhoon. It spins me all around. I just go (growling). (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (claws slicing) 
LAURA: That's awesome. 
MATT: So you guys watch as the whirlwind spins and these arcs of lightning. You watch as blood (swooshing) sprays out across bits of it and watch an arm like (arm flopping, bouncing) hits the ground with a Vanguard sleeve on it. 
TRAVIS: (howls) 
SAM: (chuckles) 
TALIESIN: Do you have have one more attack still? 
TRAVIS: No, because I used my bonus action to Misty Step. 
TALIESIN: Ah. 
TRAVIS: So that should be it. 
MATT: All right, finishing Chetney's go. Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Shit. Okay, so you're in that bubble now. 
TRAVIS: That's right, rock it. 
SAM: The he just killed wasn't the one-- 
TRAVIS: Danger close, danger close. 
SAM: -- concentrating on me. 
MATT: Yeah, two of them are still concentrating in there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You know what? Roll a d6 for me. On a one or two, you killed one of the ones that was concentrating. 
TRAVIS: Oh, on a one or two? One! (cheering) 
MATT: There we go. So now there's currently one concentrating there. 
SAM: And the other is concentrating on me. Or on the-- 
LAURA: Hypnotic. 
SAM: -- the Hypnotic Pattern. 
MATT: Correct, yeah. 
MARISHA: So we have two dudes concentrating on the sphere? 
LAURA: Oh wait, one was concentrating on Hypnotic Pattern? And one was concentrating on Telekinesis? So there's only one guy concentrating on the-- 
MATT: Right, Telekinesis guy would've been killed, then, and that's how-- Yeah, you're right. Because one of them, so you don't know which one's concentrating so the one that you killed was the one that was holding you then. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So we've got one of the guys pinned down here so they won't want to fuck with them. 
LAURA: Yeah, so there's currently two people concentrating? 
ROBBIE: The charmer and shield holder. 
MATT: Correct, yes. 
ROBBIE and LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Two dudes are concentrating. What does the shield look like? Is it like, (buzzes) Gah gah gah gah gah? 
MATT: It's still holding, but with each death, lack of concentration you watch it shrink slightly. Shrink slightly. 
ROBBIE: We've got to incapacitate Luda or kill him before he ever takes a turn because when he takes his next turn-- 
LAURA: You got to knock him out. 
LAURA: So we've got to get the bubble down-- 
LIAM: Or get her away from him. 
ROBBIE: -- round three is over. 
LIAM: Or rip her away. 
ROBBIE: He can never take a turn or it's over for your mom. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: This is it. 
TRAVIS: We haven't even taken a shot at the bubble, right? We're just assuming-- 
SAM: I won't have a turn unless-- 
LAURA: We can't. 
SAM: -- unless you disable the guy who's-- 
TALIESIN: We need our motherfucker, too. In the back. 
ASHLEY: The two in the bubble. 
TALIESIN: No, well-- 
ASHLEY: Are they looking pretty rough or no? 
MATT: I mean, it's hard to tell. They're being thrown through a Whirlwind. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Because I want to do this, okay. 
TRAVIS: It's nice in here. 
ASHLEY: What I'm going to do is-- What I was going to do, I don't want to hurt Chet, though. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
SAM: Fuck up Chet. It doesn't matter. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm serious. 
ASHLEY: I was thinking, I want to shoot Wall of Fire, but you can do it as a ring. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: So I was thinking of making the ring. It's a 20-foot radius. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Is there any way I can do it and not have Chet right on the outside? 
MATT: Unfortunately, in the Whirlwind, because they're all being rolled around. I will say it will hit all of them. 
LAURA: Make it a fire funnel. Which is kind of cool. 
SAM: That's kind of cool. 
MATT: Which you can totally do. Just so you'll know, Chetney is in a line of fire, so if that's what you want to do, you can't concentrate it when they're all being dragged through a Whirlwind. 
ASHLEY: I can do that or I can try to Scorching Ray them and try to get them down. 
TRAVIS: Drop the big hammer, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: They're both restrained, so if you Scorching Ray, you do have advantage on the attacks because they're restrained in there, so it's up to you. 
ASHLEY: Because I feel like this is a not a final-- 
MARISHA: What's the damage? What's the damage? 
SAM: Whatever does more damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so Wall of Fire just happens and it's 5d8. 
MARISHA: Then Scorching Ray. 
ASHLEY: It's dexterity-- Scorching Rays are 2d6. 
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of here. 
MATT: But you do three Scorching Rays. 
ASHLEY: Three Scorching Rays. 
LAURA: So you can hit, 
ROBBIE: But Wall of Fire you can-- 
ASHLEY: Technically-- 
LAURA: Can you-- 
SAM: 6d6 versus 5d8, right? 
ROBBIE: But also Wall of Fire, can't you control what side the fire comes off of? Couldn't you put it between them? 
ASHLEY: You can, yeah, so you can-- 
ROBBIE: It's 20 feet tall. 
LAURA: It's a whirlwind. 
SAM: It's a whirlwind. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
MATT: They're all (whooshes) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: You got to do the Wall of Fire. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: Go big. 
ASHLEY: We'll do the Wall of Fire. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: It becomes like a 20-- We'll make it a ring, a ring of fire. There you go. 
SAM: A scorching-- 
LAURA: A scorching ring of fire. 
ASHLEY: It just happens, dexterity saving throws of 19. 
SAM: A whirlwind of fire. 
LAURA: Which they have disadvantage on because they are restrained. 
ASHLEY: Which they have disadvantage on. 
MATT: Yep. 
LAURA: But Chet has-- 
TRAVIS: Not me, I have advantage. 
LAURA: Yeah, he's not restrained. 
MATT: Okay, Whirlwind-- Wind wall 20 feet in diameter. Yeah, so you can make the ring go through here, essentially. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: So it tears through that edge there. So the whirlwind (whooshing). You watch as the spiral of wind and debris now becomes a spiral of burning red and orange flame. (fire roaring) It was the shadows of figures screaming as they're whirled up within. So roll your damage, 5d8 fire damage 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, come on. 
ASHLEY: Too much shit. 
ROBBIE: Let's go. 
ASHLEY: Is what's happening. 
TRAVIS: No, really? 
MATT: Too much shit on it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so it's 5d8 and then one additional d8 because of Mister. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah! 
ASHLEY: You got-- 
ROBBIE: Do it, do it, do it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, seven. Plus five is 12. 
SAM: 12. 
ASHLEY: How many dice did I roll? Four. Plus additional seven. 
SAM: That's 19. 
ASHLEY: But this is six eights. Shit, okay, that's fine, that's fine. So 19 points of damage? That's it? 
SAM: I thought you said you got-- 
TALIESIN: 5d8. 
MATT: 5d8. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Plus an additional d8, so 6d8, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Six. 
ASHLEY: 19-- 
MATT: 19 point of damage. 
ASHLEY: -- point of damage, that's really shitty. 
MARISHA: Did you roll super low? 
ASHLEY: Shitty really low. 
MATT: All right, so over here, dex save. 
ASHLEY: God dermit. 
MATT: That's going to be a 20. 
ROBBIE: 19 points. 
MATT: What's your DC? 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MATT: Okay. So it's going to take nine points of fire damage on that. 
TRAVIS: Me too, I rolled 26. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
MATT: Nine points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: It's a good roll. 
MATT: The other one fails. How do you want to do this? 
TRAVIS and ROBBIE: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah? 
ROBBIE: Let's go! 
MATT: They were both on the edge, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
ROBBIE: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Fearnie, Fearnie! 
MARISHA: That was consolation prize. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to look up at Imogen and I'm going to say: We're going to get her, Imogen. It's okay, we got this. Then I'm going to step forward and try to, you know, make it happen. Oh shit. 
MATT: As that massive flame tornado consumes those inside, you hear the screams of the Exaltants within that have been silenced as a flaming werewolf is now being lobbed around on the inside of it. 
TRAVIS: (growling yell) 
LIAM: (howls) 
MATT: With that, the charm fades from Braius. 
MARISHA: Good, good, good. 
TALIESIN: Perfect fucking timing. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, good timing because he's next. Fuck. 
TALIESIN: We need people over where we are. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: So that finishes Fearne's turn. Braius, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
ASHLEY: Ugh! 
MARISHA: Dude, take him down. Braius, can you get there? 
SAM: Take who down? 
MARISHA: There's this-- 
TALIESIN: We got the last one, man. 
ROBBIE: Oh my goodness. 
MARISHA: One last fuck. 
SAM: I can't-- 
TRAVIS: He's a long way. 
SAM: I'm a long way away. 
TALIESIN: Do you have any-- 
MARISHA: Can you bamf? 
TRAVIS: Do you want to get right up on-- 
SAM: I can't-- 
LIAM: Luda and hold? 
SAM: I could. 
TALIESIN: Oh, what good idea. 
SAM: But I can't do that either because he's surrounded by a bubble. 
TRAVIS: But as soon as it drops. 
LIAM: Soon as it drops-- 
LAURA: You can get close enough that once it goes down, you could hit him? 
SAM: Can I get next to him? I mean, that thing is-- 
LAURA: You can get next to the bubble. 
MARISHA: You said the bubble has been slowly decreasing. 
MATT: Yeah, I mean it's like, you know, you can get probably within five feet of him there. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Then I can hit him. 
MATT: If you want to. 
LAURA: When the bubble goes down? 
SAM: Okay, I will move to him. I can hold one attack or both attacks? 
LAURA: It's an action. 
MATT: Rules as written, it's a single attack. I think it's bullshit, so I do, if you hold an action you can do both of your attacks, but enemies can do it, too. 
TALIESIN: Okay, we got a while. 
LAURA: The final-- 
SAM: But first I got to figure out how to get there. 
LIAM: Right. 
LAURA: Final thing on the ground. 
ROBBIE: There's only one guy holding back behind there? 
TALIESIN: Okay, so we got-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: So you guys can take him out. 
ROBBIE: Ride my horse, baby. 
TALIESIN: Laudna, Ash. Well, we really need to-- He's hard to hit. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, absolutely. 
SAM: How do I get on your horse? 
ROBBIE: (whistles) 
MARISHA: He's a spectral horse. 
LIAM: You just jump. 
ROBBIE: He's our homie. 
MARISHA: Be a cow riding a horse. 
SAM: Does he move on my turn or on your turn? Or--? How does this work? 
ASHLEY: I forgot to go for Mister. Can Mister take two Flame Seeds at the guy right here? 
MATT: Sure. Mister has to move to see him. 
SAM: How? What? 
LIAM: You could say that he, well, Matt could say that he doesn't go on my turn anymore as soon has a mount. 
TALIESIN: Whatever rider. 
ROBBIE: His selected mount. He'll do whatever I say next. 
MATT: I'd say because we were going your turn, it's still your turn, so you wanted to he hold an action on him, have him move it somewhere in position and then-- 
LAURA: Just jump over and stand on the-- 
SAM: I can get over there. 
LAURA: Yeah, jump over there. 
SAM: I can get over there. 
MATT: It depends on what you're trying to do. If you want to get next to Ludinus, you have to figure out a way to get there. But we're shooting a Flame Seed over here. 
LAURA: Can you leap, leap, get to the-- 
ASHLEY: Nine points of damage. 
MATT: Oh, did it hit? 
ASHLEY: It did hit, it was 16 plus, where's the thingy? 
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So nine points of damage? 
ASHLEY: Yar. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You got it. 
ROBBIE: You're going to hold it until the shield drops? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Pretty badass. Yeah, do it. 
MATT: What you doing, Braius? 
SAM: I got to get over there and it's more than 30 feet of movement, right? 
MATT: I mean you can try and jump it. 
LAURA: You could jump, jump and do an acrobatics check and jump from the crystal to the-- 
MATT: It would be an athletics check to try and do a full jump from this point. 
SAM: Is that my action? 
MATT: No. 
SAM: I'm so confused. 
MATT: But if you fail, it's going to cut your movement down. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: And you'll stumble onto the ground. So it's a little risky, but-- 
SAM: Okay, I will try it, I will jump and hopefully try to use the speed of the Whirlwind to propel me over. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's right. 
MATT: I love it. All right, roll an athletics check for me. 
SAM: Even if it hurts. 
MATT: Here's what I'll say. 
SAM: Okay? 
MATT: If you want to take the damage from the Whirlwind, I'll give you advantage in that roll. 
SAM: I will take that, yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Awful. What is this, athletics? 
MATT: Athletics. 
SAM: Ugh, 14. 
LAURA: That's not terrible. 
MATT: 14's not terrible. So roll the damage from your Whirlwind. 
LAURA: Oh my god, the whole thing? 
MATT: He said he wanted to use it. 
SAM: Yeah, man. Get over there. 
ROBBIE: It's a rocket jump. 
LAURA: Okay, I rolled low on that. 11, 15, 16, 18. 
MATT: Make a dex save, Braius. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: 20, 25. 
SAM: Natural 20. 
LAURA: Oh no, 27. 
ROBBIE: (gasp) What? 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: So yeah. So what was that? 
LAURA: 27. 
MATT: 27, so you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage. 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: The extra wisp from it (whoosh) shoves you over to this side and you stop, landing right in front of the field where Ludinus-- 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: -- is now staring at you through it. 
SAM: May I do a bonus action and then hold action, or the bonus action is holding my action? 
MATT: No, your action's held. You can bonus action and do something else, if you want. 
SAM: Okay, the bonus action I will do is Shining Smite at level three. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Then I'll hold my action to strike. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: And that's it. 
MATT: All right, so as you stand there at that way, Braius, that finishes his go. Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: How fucked does this guy look over here? 
MATT: He's looking like he's taken a few hits. 
TALIESIN: He needs some fucking damage. 
MATT: He's not on death's door. 
MARISHA: Okay, that answers my question. 
SAM: Yeah, that's right. 
MARISHA: I'm going to move my full move. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, I think-- 
MATT: 30's about there, yeah. 
MARISHA: Five, 10-- Yeah, that should be good. I'm going to-- God, my heart is racing right now. Let me double check something real quick. Actually, I know I can-- Hang on, hang on. Void Puppet, Void Puppet. 
TALIESIN: (excited grunt) I think Void Puppet is a bonus action. 
TALIESIN: I'm excited. 
MARISHA: Bonus action, okay. I'm going to bonus action Void Puppet right next to that guy. It's going to take the form of his fucking friend that I just killed, the other Exaltant, and he comes out of the rock face and goes like, "We have cursed the world!" Then-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: So he gets disadvantage on saving throws. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: I am then going to, because hopefully we can get it back with our little sphere that Caleb gave us, 6th-level spell Disintegrate. 
LIAM: Yo. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: That Shining Smite I'm going to do at level four, by the way. 
MARISHA: Huh? 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I tell Ashton, I say: Duck! And a drip, all the dripping black void from my fingertips congeals into a straight fucking ray. 
MATT: With disadvantage on that saving throw, it was a natural 19-- (wincing) 
MATT: -- and then a five. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: So go ahead-- 
TALIESIN: Holy shit. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage as you just barely duck out of the way of this odd, pale beam. 
MARISHA: Four, five, I'll do this twice. It's 10d6. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Come on, big money. 
LIAM: 10d6 plus 40. 
MARISHA: Actually, I'm going to do something. It is 10d6 plus 40. 
LAURA: That's amazing. 
MARISHA: I lied. Wow! 
LIAM: That's an all or nothing spell. 
MARISHA: Seven, eight, nine. 
MATT: Yeah. If he succeeds, nothing. 
LIAM: Nothing. 
MARISHA: 10, 11, 12. 
LIAM: Bigger risk. 
LAURA: High risk. 
MARISHA: 13. Actually, hang on. Two, three. 
TALIESIN: Man, this would work out so fucking well if this happens. 
MARISHA: Five. Depending on how this goes here. Okay, okay, hang on a second, sorry. 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 28, plus four is 32 plus 40, what is that? 
MATT: 72. 
ROBBIE: 72. 
SAM: Jesus. 
MARISHA: I can, before you call this, spend a point to Empower the spell and reroll some of these ones. 
TALIESIN: Why fuck around? 
MARISHA: Just because we still have a lot of shit to do. 
TALIESIN: I know, that's fair. 
MARISHA: He said he's taken some hits. 
TALIESIN: Not as many as we'd like. 
TRAVIS: Leave no doubt. 
MARISHA: Okay. Spending a sorcery point. 
TALIESIN: Since you're here. 
MARISHA: To Empower the spell. Luckily, it's just one sorcery point to do that, so I'm going to reroll. I can reroll up to one, two, three, four, five, so I'm going to reroll these ones and twos. Keep these off to the side. I'm sorry. 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
TALIESIN: Love it. 
TRAVIS: Hell yeah, great call. 
MARISHA: Yeah, better, okay. So six, 12, 18, da da da da. 21, 18, right? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: 19, 20, 21 plus four is 29 plus three is 32. 36. 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
MARISHA: 37, 38, 39 plus four is 43, plus 40, so that's 83. 
MATT: 83. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yes. 
MARISHA: Points of necrotic damage, I think. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MARISHA: Please kill him, please. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
LAURA: That's all of them. Is that all of them? 
ASHLEY: That's that's all of them, baby. 
LIAM: And I think it's force damage. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Yeah, like I said. My Void Puppet that I just made reaches out from the rock and grabs him by the head and slams it up against the rock and keeps him there as I beam him with a black necrotic beam. 
MATT: He's like (impacts). "(panicked groaning)" (sizzling) "Ah!" (sizzling) And just atomizes into dark dust on the ground. 
ROBBIE: Doof. 
MATT: Woof. 
LIAM: Boosh! 
LAURA: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Brutal. 
MARISHA: That's my turn. 
SAM: I swing for her mom. (laughter) 
LAURA: What?! 
TRAVIS: We knew it was coming! 
SAM: I knew it! 
TRAVIS: The inevitable betrayal! 
LIAM: The heel turn. 
MATT: The shield drops and Ludinus is still staring at you. As it drops, he goes "Hmm." Take your attacks. 
SAM: Okay. The Herald of Asmodeus brings word from the Hells. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
SAM: A two. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh no! (laughter) 
MATT: For a total of? 
SAM: 14. 
MATT: That's going to miss. 
SAM: Okay. Second attack. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: (squeaky) Oh, five. 
ASHLEY: No! 
ROBBIE: No way! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: For a total of? 
SAM: 17. 
MATT: That's going to miss. 
LIAM: Oh! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MATT: You strike towards him. Each time you strike-- 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: -- you bring your weapon back. 
TRAVIS: Unbelievable! 
LAURA: What! 
MATT: These little lightning-like veins (bulge) up his neck. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: Not unlike those you've seen on Imogen. 
SAM: Oh no. 
LAURA: He's stealing her power. 
MATT: Your brain (warbles) blurs for a second and you swing, and your swing went wider than it ever should have. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: Angrily, you swing with the other one and he focuses in once more, they flash and (static buzz) in your mind and you swing, completely missing him again. He's like, "What's wrong? Having a hard time concentrating, are we?" 
SAM: Oh Jesus. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: Now, she's still floating up there and is still being pulled in, just the shield's down. That's going to finish-- 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: -- Laudna's go. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: There's no more enemies left. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: Ashton, you're up, with Dorian on deck. 
SAM: It's really up to you. 
TALIESIN: How close can I get to that fucking yellow bubble? 
MARISHA: It's so close. 
TALIESIN: I want to run as fast as I can as close as I can get to the yellow bubble. 
MARISHA: I just went. 
TALIESIN: I'm not sure which is the best way to go. 
SAM: It's really up to you. 
TALIESIN: I can ignore difficult earth terrain. 
MARISHA: Imogen's back now. 
MATT: I know. 
MARISHA: She's not stunned anymore. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, so it's up to you two. 
MATT: 75. 
SAM: Because I don't think anyone else can-- 
MARISHA: And Orym. 
TALIESIN: I'm only going 40 feet. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go 40 feet towards it as far as I can go. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I can't get there and I don't think Ashton can either. 
MATT: 25, 30, 35, 40 is right there. 
TALIESIN: 40 is right there? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: All right. Hold on, sorry. I'm figuring out my shit. 
SAM: Shit. I rolled so badly! 
TALIESIN: After me, it is Dorian, Imogen, Orym. 
SAM: If only someone had inspired me. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Wow. I want to keep a little tighter towards it because I want to curl around that way if that's okay. 
MATT: Okay, yeah. We can do there to there. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That'll do. Okay, I'm taking one of my Chaos Bursts and I'm making an attack on Ludinus. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh! You can do this. 
TALIESIN: I'm taking-- 
MATT: From where you're standing-- 
TALIESIN: That's 60 feet, right? I thought while I was rolling by. 
MATT: That's 40 feet is what you wanted to do, right? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I might have to go around the other way, actually. I was trying to figure out the-- 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: The other way might be-- 
LAURA: Yeah, you'd be able to see him. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that'll be easier. 
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 will get you there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's much better. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: He does have half cover because of where the angle is and Braius in the way, that whole thing right there, he has half cover. So he just gets plus two to his AC. 
TALIESIN: (grumbles) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Here we go. 
MATT: Are you rolling with advantage? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm rolling with advantage. We don't have time for this shit. 26 to hit. 
MATT: 26 hits. 
TALIESIN: (exhales) Okay! 
SAM: Okay, that's something. 
TALIESIN: Oh, this is better than something. 
MATT: You know what? He's going to-- 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: Use his butler? 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: Alfred. 
TRAVIS: Get him in his butler. 
SAM: Mr. Belvedere. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Go ahead and roll-- 
SAM: Another reference for the kids. 
MATT: What were your rolls? 
TALIESIN: Hmm? 
MATT: What were your rolls? 
LAURA: Mr. Belvedere. 
TALIESIN: I don't remember. 
MATT: It was a three and then what did you roll for the actual one? 
TALIESIN: No, I think it was a-- 
SAM: Benson. 
TALIESIN: -- seven and a-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) Benson. 
TALIESIN: It would've been seven and a-- 
SAM: Is he a butler? I don't even know. 
LIAM: No. 
TALIESIN: Seven and a 16, I want to say. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I think. 
MATT: He's going to Silvery Barbs. Roll one more dice. 
TALIESIN: Roll one more die? 
MATT: Yes. He gets to pick which one he wants. 
TALIESIN: 11 which would be 22. 
MATT: Okay. He's going to pick the seven. 
TALIESIN: Okay, obviously, of the three? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Never saw it. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so he would've picked that. Okay yeah, it didn't matter unless it went lower. So that's a miss no matter what. 
MATT: Well no, what's your bonus onto the seven? 
TALIESIN: Oh, that would've been 11. So that would've been 18. 
MATT: 18 misses. So he Silvery Barbs you, and your miss goes wide. 
MARISHA: Oh, he Silvery Barbs. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so it keeps my lowest roll no matter what. 
MATT: Well, he gets to pick which one. 
MARISHA: What a bullshit spell. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: You rolled at advantage. 
TALIESIN: I rolled at advantage. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: Do I get to reroll both of those then? 
MATT: No, you roll an additional die and he picks one. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that makes sense now. Well, shit. 
LAURA: Wait, you rolled at advantage. 
TALIESIN: I did. 
LAURA: So it would've gone with the higher number, and then you roll a second one. 
MATT: And then use the lower roll was the spell. 
LAURA: Of the two. 
TALIESIN: Of the three. 
LAURA: Of the three? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: You reroll one, essentially. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I would have rerolled the seven then. 
MATT: One second. 
TALIESIN: Right? 
LIAM: One plus one plus two plus one. 
MATT: This does work differently than the-- Hold on. Sorry, I don't get to use Silvery Barbs very often, you guys. 
MARISHA: It's a great spell. 
TALIESIN: It is a great spell. I was curious of why am I rerolling? Because he just picked the low one. 
MATT: No, so 11 was the other one you rolled then, right? 
TALIESIN: It would've been 11, and the higher one would've been, I want to say 16, yeah. 
MATT: "Triggering creature must reroll the d20." 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: He would have you reroll the high one, which would've been 11. So you keep the seven. So it's still a miss. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that works. So yeah, so you swing it wide to go ahead and portal the attack through with the hammer. As it (whoosh) apparates next to him, he casts something with his fingers, now that the Shield is down, and now his spells are not being kept at bay from the field. 
TALIESIN: Anything else I can do? 
MATT: He just (gestures) does a mark through the air and you watch a rune appear. It strikes the rune and the hammer stops before returning through the hole back to you. 
SAM: That got rid of his reaction, though. 
TALIESIN: It did. 
SAM: Maybe that'll help the next person. 
TALIESIN: Just for weirdness, I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: This is close. 
TALIESIN: I have to use a bonus action to drop rage, right? I can't just drop it at this point? 
MATT: No, you can drop it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to wait then for-- All right. I'm going to use my bonus action to shift rages then. 
MATT: Okay, so you drop it and then re-rage. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: Come on, do it for me. Nope, nothing changed. Oh well. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's fate. 
MATT: (laughs) That finishes your go, Ashton? 
TALIESIN: Can't fight fate. Yeah. 
MATT: Dorian, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LAURA: Can you pick up the harness? 
ROBBIE: I turn to Imogen. 
LAURA: I don't think so. 
TALIESIN: Fuck him up. 
ROBBIE: This has to be your choice. I have an idea. Can you get your mom? 
LAURA: I can try. 
ROBBIE: All right. I'll use all of my movement. I'll fly over to the right. 
MATT: 60 feet? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. No, only 40. 
MATT: Only 40. 
ROBBIE: Because it's my walking speed with the boots. with the boots. 
MATT: That's right, yeah. That would put you over here. To there. 
ROBBIE: Fuck. It's never worked this entire fucking campaign. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
ROBBIE: I don't care. I'm going to try to cast Forcecage on Ludinus. 
MATT: Forcecage. 
ROBBIE: No magic can get in or out. 
LAURA: It's separating them? It's not going to include her in it? 
ROBBIE: It is separating them. 
SAM: It might put me in there with him. 
LIAM: There's a way to do it. 
SAM: That's okay. 
LIAM: If you think of the box and Ludinus in the corner. 
ROBBIE: I think it's up to-- Yeah. 
LIAM: 10 by 10? 
ROBBIE: It's up to 10 by 10, yeah. Or is it just 10 by 10? 
LIAM: There's two different versions of it. The smaller, tighter wizard-proof one is 10 by 10 and he could still teleport out, but it's a chance. 
ROBBIE: "A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on the side, creating a solid barrier." 
LAURA: Up to, okay. 
MATT: So where are you placing your Forcecage? 
ROBBIE: (sighs) I want to try to put him directly in the corner. 
LAURA: Yeah, get him in there. 
ROBBIE: Where it splits up-- 
LAURA: Up to 10 feet, so it can be smaller. 
ASHLEY: Smaller, do five feet. 
ROBBIE: As tight-- 
LAURA: You can just do a five-foot box. 
ROBBIE: -- as humanly possible. 
ASHLEY: Like an oubliette. 
SAM: You sure you don't want to trap me in there with him? 
LIAM: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: It's an hour and I can't drop it. 
ASHLEY: We need you, Braius. 
LIAM: He will liquefy you. 
SAM: All I need's a minute. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so you are trying this, essentially. 
ROBBIE: That is the goal. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But yeah, a five-foot-- 
MATT: There is no save on this. 
SAM: It just happens. 
ROBBIE: I'm preparing it. I'm pulling the ruby. 
MATT: He just used his reaction. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
SAM: He did. 
MATT: So he cannot Counterspell. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's right! 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Woo hoo hoo! 
MARISHA: That's right. 
LAURA: Oh my god, you just Forcecaged Ludinus! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: As the Forcecage (crackle) appears, the tether from his harness is severed and Liliana (thuds). (screaming) (oohing) (cheering) 
ROBBIE: Get her! You still have to get her. You still have to get her because he can get out. He can roll to get out. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: It's never worked except when it mattered. 
ROBBIE: That's because last time, I've always been doing this (gently blows) This time, I did it like LeBron. (claps) Pah! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (claps) 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MATT: As it appears around him, he goes "Hmm. (sigh)" and just simmers for a second. 
SAM: I'll put my hand right next to his. (laughter) 
MATT: He goes. (laughter) 
SAM: That's right. 
ROBBIE: Save your mama. 
TRAVIS: ♪ A lonely heart ♪ 
MATT: Oh man. All right, that's a move and an action. 
ROBBIE: That's it. 
MATT: Bonus action? All right. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to fly forward 30 feet. 
TRAVIS: Woof. 
SAM: That was good. That was great. 
MATT: 30 feet. 
LAURA: I'm going to drop my, I like that Laudna is coming with me. 
SAM: It was either you or her. 
MATT: Oh yeah, sorry. 
LAURA: Drop the Whirlwind. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And I'm going to cast Telekinesis and pull my mom to me. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: Woo. 
ROBBIE: Let's go. 
SAM: Do I get an attack of opportunity? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
TALIESIN: Sam's really going all on. 
ROBBIE: It was instinct. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: You pull your mother out of the grasp from the top and as you drift and pull her forward, she is fragile, like made of paper. She's waifish and gaunt and on the cusp of expiration, but still here. 
LAURA: Can I use my bonus action to pour my Cure Wounds into her, my healing potion into her? 
MATT: If you want to. 
TRAVIS: The chonky boy? 
LAURA: That's what I got. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: That's your mom. 
LIAM: That makes sense. Let's go. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Of course, she could become an ally. 
MARISHA: Bitch better. 
LIAM: Wow. That's amazing. 
LAURA: That's a lot of fours. 
ROBBIE: Great, wow. 
LIAM: Careful where you step. 
TRAVIS: That resin is so cool-looking. 
MATT: I'm so happy with how it turned out. 
SAM: When you do stuff like that, Matt, is that in your kitchen? Are you in your kitchen doing that? 
TRAVIS: He does it on the porch. 
MATT: For resin, I do outside. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Because it has fumes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: So 24. 
MATT: But a lot of things I just do on our game table. 
LAURA: 24, 28... 30, 32, 35. 
SAM: Dude, this is a huge potion. 
TRAVIS: It's the big boy. 
LIAM: It's shaped like a heart. 
LAURA: 40, 45 plus-- 
SAM: Fat as fuck. 
LIAM: Plus one for every die that's there. 
MATT: Plus 16. 
LAURA: Plus 16. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: 40 plus 16. 
LIAM: 61? 
TRAVIS: 61. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
LAURA: 61 points of healing. 
MARISHA: Wow, wow, wow. 
LAURA: Wow, that's a big healing spell. 
LIAM: That's a... 
TALIESIN: That was a great heal. 
ROBBIE: That's the power of love. 
MATT: She (gasps) (coughs) comes to and coughs. Now you're in the air still. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm holding her. 
MATT: You brought her up to you. 
LAURA: I have her telekinetically up at me. 
MATT: You pulled her up and she goes "Imogen?" She just looks back at you. "How?" 
LAURA: You're okay now, you're okay. 
MATT: She puts her arms over your shoulders and you can barely feel the strength as they do, but she holds you there for a second and hangs in your grip. She gets close to your ear and whispers, "I don't deserve you, but I'm so glad you're here." Does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: I'm a little nervous about it for some reason. 
TALIESIN: Yee. 
LAURA: I feel weird about this. I feel like you're trying to trick me. (laughter) 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: You're going to trick me. 
TRAVIS: That's called trauma. 
LAURA: It's called trauma. 
SAM: Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: With my Essence of the Red Moon, can I feel a red tether to her? 
MATT: At the moment, no. 
SAM: Oof. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Dead. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Huh. 
TRAVIS: That's your mom, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, so if I tried to give her some of my essence. 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
ASHLEY: (nervous groan) 
LAURA: You guys feel weird about it? 
SAM: No. It's your mom. 
TALIESIN: That's your mom. 
ASHLEY: What do you mean you're going to give her some of your essence? Because we still are going to have to-- 
SAM: We've just been playing this game too long. 
LAURA: I know. I'm going to try to give her-- 
MARISHA: Don't trust anything. 
LAURA: -- three of my sorcery points. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Does it work? 
MATT: It does not work. 
LAURA: (sighs) Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: She holds you over and pulls you in as tight as she can. But that Exalted connection is gone. 
LAURA: He took that magic? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, and he had to complete it for it to become permanent, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: But he's still going to have a little lingering for a bit. 
TRAVIS: He's going to be nasty for a minute. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Not that he wasn't fucking already. 
ASHLEY: But was that taken from her forever or just for a duration? 
MATT: You prevented it from being forever and prevented it from destroying her. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: But if it's anywhere near the Quintessence Array that you have that you know of its abilities, 24 hours. 
LAURA: How long does Forcecage stay up? 
ROBBIE: One hour. 
LAURA: Too bad. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Pretty good. 
MARISHA: Yeah. How many times can you cast Forcecage? 
ROBBIE: One time. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: It's my seventh slot. It's gone. 
MARISHA: Yeah. So is my high-level one, too. 
MATT: Orym. 
LAURA: So is mine. 
MATT: It's your turn. 
LIAM: Yeah. Orym comes running out. I'll do the movement. 
MARISHA: Show my speed. 
LIAM: Five, 10, 15, he's going to vine up onto Coriolis. (splat) Oh, he's got the gooey on him. Oh gosh, I'm scared to do it. 
MATT: That's okay. 
LIAM: You can do it so I'm not responsible. 
MATT: I got it, that's good. 
TRAVIS: Mercer's got those doctor's hands. It's weird. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: There we are. 
TRAVIS: Surgeon's hands. 
LIAM: And I'm going to fly Coriolis up and hover directly in front of the Temults so that I am within striking range if any wizards or anything were to suddenly appear. I will attack anything that comes within either melee range or Seedling's air slicing range, which is 15 feet. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: If any threat comes that close, I will attack them and I think I know the answer to this already, but I'm going to check anyway. Staring at Ludinus, this is definitely not a snow cone, right? 
MATT: Make a perception check or make an insight check, sorry. 
LIAM: Insight? Wow, those are shitty rolls. 
TRAVIS: Whirlwind still up? 
LAURA: No, I had to drop it to get her. 
LIAM: You had to make it insight. It is just a 10. 
LAURA: No, you were already on the ground. 
MATT: 10. Best you can tell, there's no gem in the forehead. 
LIAM: Yeah, and he wouldn't be putting the power into a snowman. But since it was a free action, I'm poised ready to protect the Temults. 
MATT: You got it. Finishing your turn, Orym, it comes to Ludinus. He puts his right hand in front and plays with his fingers for a second while his black, withered hand with its golden tips clicks at his side and he goes, "Well, it seems for the time being, we have a moment to chat." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "I figure why not take a bit of time and pontificate amongst ourselves before the end, huh?" And that's where we'll pick it up next time. (clamoring) 
TRAVIS: You can't do that! You can't, no! (screams of protest) 
MATT: (chuckles) 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
MARISHA: (groans) 
ROBBIE: Oh. (laughter) 
LIAM: There's so many precious minis! 
ASHLEY: That was supposed to be a little lighter. 
MATT: That was-- 
LIAM: Are you-- 
ROBBIE: Terrifying. 
LIAM: -- out of your mind?! 
MATT: I peed a little. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Just respect the chaos. 
LIAM: What an ending that would've been. 
MATT: I may have dropped a nugget, it's good. 
TRAVIS: There's a slow-mo camera of that that's (slow bouncing). 
MATT: Ashley, careful. 
LIAM: Oh my god. 
ROBBIE: No. 
LAURA: That was terrifying. 
MATT: All right, so we'll pick up here from this-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ROBBIE: Woo! 
MATT: -- fascinating-- 
LAURA: You Forcecaged Ludinus. 
MATT: -- little breath. 
MARISHA: Forcecaged Ludinus. 
LIAM: Sick. 
TALIESIN: Forcecage, man. 
TRAVIS: In 2025. 
ROBBIE: Finally. 
MATT: In 2025. 
MARISHA: In 2025. 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Y'all got to wait for this chatty-chat. 
MARISHA: For this little kiki. 
ASHLEY: Yay, the new year. 
SAM: It's the year of Cage. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yes! (clapping) 
MARISHA: You said it was a-- 
MATT: Oh my goodness. 
MARISHA: -- Nicolas Force Cage. 
LAURA: Nicolas Force Cage. 
MARISHA: But of course, don't forget to watch the Daggerheart Critmas Show. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yay. 
MARISHA: That'll be soon, whenever I said at the beginning. 
MATT: Yeah, for those who haven't seen any of the materials for it, if you're familiar with our original intro to Campaign 2, it might be a little familiar in some ways. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: But yeah, thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much. Happy New Year, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)

Cooldown[]
LAURA: Holy shamoly.
LIAM: Next time, we put on an egg timer for an hour and just have an hour-long talk.
TRAVIS: (high-fiving Robbie) Dude. No, no. Two times.
LAURA: Just have an hour-long talk. What a fucking clutch move, Robbie Daymond!
MATT: (holding up one of his two pie charts, with two segments colored in red) Also, if one of the major challenges to coming down here was a failure, one of the group challenges--
LIAM: She's dead.
MATT: She'd have been gone at the end of the second round.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MATT: You guys fucking did that down to the wire because you only had three rounds to do it. That's crazy.
ASHLEY: We don't know what that one does yet, right?
MATT: Not yet.
LAURA: The blue one? We don't know what that was?
MATT: Not yet.
TRAVIS: That is fucking bonkers.
ASHLEY: So no magic can go in or out? 
LIAM: That's right. There's very few things--
ASHLEY: So we can't put on the funnel and try to (sucks)?
LAURA: No, we can't.
SAM: Disintegrate is for--
MATT: Disintegrate's for Wall of Force.
SAM: Nothing gets through Forcecage, right?
ROBBIE: Can't Dispel it--
MATT: "A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means."
SAM: But they could Teleport.
LIAM: You can Teleport, but you'd have to make a charisma saving throw.
ROBBIE: Rizz save.
LAURA: He's probably got some rizz.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: But he wants to talk, so he's probably not going to go anywhere.
LIAM: Yeah, he's all right.
TALIESIN: His plans are already moving forward, as far as he knows, perfectly well.
LIAM: He's the oldest mage in the world.
TALIESIN: There's no reason for him to-- as far as I can tell.
LIAM: Oldest mage in the world.
MATT: This'll be fun.
TALIESIN: This could be a lot of fun. We got the seed finally. I've been waiting for that shit forever.
LAURA: Yeah, the seed. Great work. And what a place to do it.
ASHLEY: The myceits!
LAURA: That's a fucking killer place.
TALIESIN: We smelled something weird and wet and moldy.
LAURA: That's the place.
SAM: It's been so long. What does it do?
LAURA: It was the All-Minds seed.
MATT: All-Minds-Burn.
SAM: But what does it do?
LAURA: We don't know. The All-Minds-Burn just asked if we would plant her on Ruidus.
MATT: It more or less when you met the core of the All-Minds-Burn, which is its own kind of odd sentient fungus entity that exists in Marquet, it connected with Imogen and saw her memories of being on Ruidus and all these-- or of seeing what this alien space looked like via her dreams and everything, and wanted to see what it was like to start a spawn elsewhere.
TALIESIN: When a hive mind asks a favor, you fucking do it.
TRAVIS: Yeah, you fucking take that mark, man.
LIAM: If Ruidus doesn't explode, that's going to be the--
LAURA: That is going to be the Big Bad.
LIAM: --new sentient species in five million years.
TALIESIN: No, they're great. Like Justi's great.
ROBBIE: If it weren't for space mushrooms, we'd all be nothing. Did you know the flowering part--
TALIESIN: That's what her dad does for a living. Her dad is one of the heads of the temple.
LIAM: I love the myceits. The Miyazaki vibes of the myceits this time was so strong.
ASHLEY: I was so nervous they were going to attack us. I was like, I don't want to--
TALIESIN: When they started getting evil I kept getting "The Adventures of Young Sherlock Holmes" like pastry. The vibes were like "Oh, this is getting weird."
LAURA: Turn bad at any moment.
ASHLEY: And the Slip 'N Slides. That was so fun.
LAURA: That was so cool.
ROBBIE: Does it ruin it for you, for the little guys, if I tell you that the flowering part of a mushroom is actually the fungus' sexual organ?
ASHLEY: Really? Makes it even better.
ROBBIE: So they're just little...
MARISHA: Little penises?
ROBBIE: Little walking penises.
MATT: Yeah! Yeah.
ROBBIE: Is that better or worse?
LAURA: No, that's better.
MATT: No, that's so much better.
TRAVIS: They're walking dick tips?
MATT: Oh yeah.
TRAVIS: And they just smeared fruit all over their dick tip.
ROBBIE: Well, whatever gets you up.
MATT: Yeah, smash that strawberry.
TRAVIS: ♪ Jelly on my dick tip ♪ I'm a dickhead.
TALIESIN: We created the strawberry-flavored-- nope, never mind.
LIAM: They were just lubing up.
MATT: Oh man. They got to smeaw a stwawbewwy.
TRAVIS: Evil cow.
TALIESIN: Wow! Really? Et tu.
LAURA: Can I ask a question about Liliana? Are her fingertips gone? Are the tips of her feet gone? Or when we pulled her away, did--
SAM: Oh yeah, do we have to restore her?
LAURA: Is she partially gone or is it just that she's very frail?
MATT: She's extremely frail. Like where her toes began to crumble, I would say it's equivalent to the beginnings of frostbite. So she may still recover. She's in a better place now that you pumped that fucking potion into her.
TRAVIS: A Greater Restoration would probably go a long way.
LAURA: Yeah, but I don't have that.
ROBBIE: Matt, that fight was so fun. It was so balanced.
LAURA: We don't have a cleric.
ROBBIE: Like to take it down to the wire.
MATT: It could have very well not gone that way. I was like--
ROBBIE: So fun.
MARISHA: Think of what we would have done differently if we only had two rounds.
TALIESIN: I don't think there's anything we could have done.
LAURA: There's nothing-- I think we would have failed.
LIAM: I think we would have lost her.
ROBBIE: It would have been all Hail Marys the whole time instead.
MARISHA: Yeah, it would have been big spells.
LAURA: Yeah, bigger spells.
MATT: That's true. With the third round you had a little more wiggle room of trying to conserve and be methodical. With two rounds, it would have been more like: Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
TALIESIN: I don't think you're going to tell me, bt if I'd tried to Teleport into that bubble, since it's not a magical teleport, would it have maybe worked?
MATT: No.
LIAM: Misty Step wouldn't have worked.
MATT: This psychic power, the psychic energy, it all stems and emanates from Predathos. It basically encases the inside, almost in its own little periphery dimension, except for a psychic power that can be pushed out.
LIAM: ♪ Isn't that psionic? ♪
LAURA: So now Ludinus is an Exaltant for 24 hours?
MATT: The next 24 hours.
ASHLEY: Oh my god. If we would have gone for the crystals, would that have done anything?
TRAVIS: A potential vessel.
LAURA: Yeah, he's going to want--
LIAM: He wants to be god.
LAURA: He wants to be the vessel, come on.
LIAM: He wants to god up.
ASHLEY: Were they using the crystals at all this go around?
MATT: No, they were just...
LAURA: They're just pretty there.
TRAVIS: Ludinus' blackened hand was from grabbing the beacon during the original Bloody Bridge?
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: You said the fingertips are gold.
MATT: He's decorated it now. He has gold tips on the edges and elements to try to make it look nice.
LAURA: He's so extra.
TRAVIS: Intentional and lovely.
MATT: Yeah, you can see it on his mini.
LAURA: Really?
TALIESIN: He does his little turn on the Bridge walk.
MATT: You can see his little golden tips on his fingers.
LAURA: Oh my god. Yeah, he's fabulous.
LIAM: On the Bloody Bridge.
TRAVIS: Dang, those are good minis!
MATT: Dude, that's all Tyler Walpole and Axolote Gaming.
TALIESIN: Oh god, the hair. The hair is so great.
MATT: And painted by Ian, Iron Tusk. I got a team of wonderful people that help me make all the things in my mind that I don't have the time to do anymore, and do a much better job than I ever could, so I love it.
LAURA: You're a really good painter too, Matt.
MATT: I'm getting better as it goes, but time is never of the essence. But I was not sure how this was going to go.
MARISHA: It was scary.
ROBBIE: It was so fun.
ASHLEY: It was fun.
LIAM: Down to the wire.
LAURA: Yeah, if he wouldn't have Forcecaged Ludinus, we would still be fighting right now, right?
MATT: Forcecage at that point probably would have ended it at whatever the next moment would have been. If he hadn't Forcecaged Ludinus, then it would have been two more-- it would have been your turn and Orym's turn to try to pull her free from the funnel's force, which would have been a contested ability check. You were too far away, probably.
LIAM: Well, I had the horse.
LAURA: I would have tried Telekinesis.
LIAM: I was getting ready to either try to yank the harness off with a Grasping Vine, or more likely just slash away at it as a Hail Mary. I could have gotten there with Coriolis.
MATT: With Coriolis, yeah, actually, you could have. That's true, yeah.
LAURA: I was going to try the funnel up and over him, and then trying to Telekinesis her, is what I would have done.
MATT: That would have been a good tactic, too. So you had options.
TRAVIS: Jumping on the tornado was great.
MATT: You had options, but the Forcecage just severed it instantly, and basically put him on timeout for the time being. He's like, "Well--" Literally, in his head, he was like, "We're so close, we're so fucking close I can taste it." And then, doof. "Well played." He can only respect it.
TRAVIS: Because when it drops, we're all like (scared noises) and then Teleport.
MARISHA: A hundred percent.
ROBBIE: It's scary, though, when you fuck something up twice. Literally, it was scary to cast. That's why I had to ask you. I had to get your permission.
SAM: When did you try it the other times?
ROBBIE: Oh my god. I tried--
LAURA: You did it to Fearne.
ROBBIE: Tried it on Fearne and then I tried it on someone we were trying to incarcerate, but I tried to do the cage version. Who was it?
SAM: And it didn't work?
LIAM: Well, you did do one at the Arch Heart's temple.
MATT: Yeah, that was on Fearne.
LIAM: That blocked up the passage a little bit.
ROBBIE: Before that I tried it once.
TALIESIN: We used it as like a plug.
LAURA: Yeah, we used it as a little plug.
ROBBIE: Yeah, scary. I've biffed it twice.
ASHLEY: But it did also help because the rocks didn't cave in.
ROBBIE: You're so kind.
ASHLEY: So it did help.
LIAM: It did help, and this was a fucking killer.
ROBBIE: It's one hour, do or die. So if he doesn't get out of there in one hour, we're going to be talking to him and it's going to dissipate and it's going to be like that fucking "Thanos is free"--
TRAVIS: Unless he has a Keen Mind.
LAURA: I'm sure he has Keen Mind. He's a thousand years old. He can just--
ASHLEY: Or we just leave him and go.
LAURA: Maybe we just go.
LIAM: Should we just start stacking boulders on top of it?
LAURA: Get Predathos out.
MATT: More weight! Just Giles Corey him.
ASHLEY: He wouldn't be there to see it.
LAURA: That would be so epic if we just ditched him and went and tried to free Predathos.
TRAVIS: "We should talk." "Nah."
TALIESIN: Why did we say that here?
TRAVIS: Peace out.
TALIESIN: Shut the fuck up.
MATT: (as Ludinus)" Where are you going? Stop, stop, wait!
ASHLEY: We're freeing Predathos. Bye!
LIAM: "Wait, but I have a whole monologue!"
TALIESIN: Summer vacation, bye!
LIAM: "It's evil, I promise!"
MATT: That would be incredible. I guess let's see what happens next time.
ASHLEY: He would be so mad.
SAM: He could Teleport out.
LAURA: He could try. But he has to--
ROBBIE: It's charisma, right?
MATT: Charisma saving throw.
ROBBIE: I feel this encounter took some of his aura away from him.
LAURA: He's really charismatic. Ludinus is charismatic.
MARISHA: There is that element of--
TALIESIN: He burned a reaction.
MARISHA: He's probably going to want to talk to us to waste time. So how much should we need to hear from him before we're like--
LAURA: We can use that orb while we're talking to him and get that short rest.
MARISHA: Yeah. How fast does that orb work? I need that shit. I burned through a decent--
SAM: Oh, it's a short rest? Is it a speed short rest?
MARISHA: And the casters get spell slots back.
TRAVIS: "The orb shatters instantly. Any creatures within 15 feet of it..."
LAURA: So we'd have to gather 'round.
TRAVIS: "You regain half of your expended hit dice rounded up. Spellcasters regain 1d4+4 spell slots and gain the benefits of a short rest."
MATT: "Benefits of a short rest" means you can spend hit dice in the moment to heal yourself. But you get half of your spent ones back.
SAM: That's really great.
TRAVIS: "Upon use, this item is destroyed."
MATT: Dunamancy, man. Does some weird shit.
ASHLEY: I definitely need it because I only got one rage left.
MARISHA: How many hit points, oout of curiosity, Matt, did this guy have? Was Disintegrate overkill?
MATT: Oh, deeply overkill.
MARISHA: Was it?
MATT: Nah. No, no, no. Sorry, sorry.
MARISHA: I'm like, should I just have Blighted him?
MATT: You technically-- No, no.
TRAVIS: Over 50, under 50. How many did he have?
MATT: He had over 50. Disintegrate was a great choice. Sorry, I meant to say you had killed him with the initial damage roll.
ASHLEY: The 72?
MATT: The 72. Then I was like, "Yeah, go ahead and spend the point."
MARISHA: Well, because you were like--
ASHLEY: You don't know.
LAURA: It's worth the sorcery point. 
MATT: Oh, it's definitely worth a sorcery point, just to make sure. You did exactly what you're supposed to do.
LIAM: It was also super cool, so...
TALIESIN: He was super super hard.
MARISHA: It was that or Blight, and I was trying to weight it, and then you were like, "He's kind of fine." And I was like, "All right." We're going to go ahead.
TRAVIS: We were also out of time.
TALIESIN: First round, I literally tried to Teleport him away from you and he laughed them off. It was getting really frustrating. That fucker.
MATT: Yeah, the Exaltant Knights are nasty, too. They're all fun variants to Exaltants.
LAURA: That's a good idea, though, to use the Telekinesis to--
TRAVIS: Matt, great job, man. 
LIAM: Rocks fall, every wizard dies.
ROBBIE: Yeah.
SAM: And this is the last fight of the campaign?
LAURA: And then just keep stacking them on top of the Forcecage?
MATT: Oh, yeah, we're done now. Yay.
SAM: We won!
ASHLEY: We'll never know what happened.
ROBBIE: Feels nice.
MATT: All right, we'll pick up on this next time, y'all.
TRAVIS: See you next year, Matt.
MATT: Yeah, we'll see you guys next year.
MARISHA: See you next year!
MATT: Love y'all!
MARISHA: Love you, Beacon Bits.
TRAVIS: Enjoy the break, everybody!
