Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: (laughs) Before we jump into our session tonight, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with our first announcement of the evening, our first sponsor, "One-Shot Wonders" by Roll & Play Press. Sam, if you don't want to--? 
SAM: "One-Shot Wonders" by Roll & Play Press is out now. It's a game-changing book of one-shots that massively cuts down the amount of prep needed for your next D&D night because everything you need to run a session is covered in two pages or less. 
MARISHA: Ah. 
SAM: "One-Shot Wonders" does all the hard work of session planning so you can focus on having fun with your friends. 
TRAVIS: Good looks. 
SAM: This book is a lifesaver for busy GMs, especially like me. Everyone at this table is busy, but I would argue that I am the most busy of all. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Say what? I'm like the CEO of the company. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I literally run this channel. 
SAM: I know, and yet I'm still busier than both of you combined. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Honestly, it's debatable. 
SAM: Here, let me read-- 
MARISHA: We could argue for it. 
SAM: I'm just going to read from you a sample day from my calendar. Name a day, any day. 
ASHLEY: June 9th. 
LIAM: Arbor Day. 
SAM: Six-nine, very nice. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
SAM: Okay. Here's the 9th of June. 
MATT: We are children. 
SAM: 6:00am: Alexander opens my sleeping pod and plays the viola to rouse me. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: 6:20am: Give Alexander a near- imperceptible nod of approval. 6:25am: Make breakfast. Croque monsieur, halloumi and zucchini frittata, and, of course, a crisp orange wine. (laughter) 6:45am: Don my silk cloak-- 
TALIESIN: Spoiled orange juice. 
SAM: -- and take my morning constitutional. 6:55am: Check Twitter, TikTok, Insta, Ria, Tumblr, AO3, Reddit threads, Bluesky, and Sugar Daddy for mentions of my name. 
LAURA: Wow. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: What is this? 
SAM: 7:30am: Scream at Alexander for not reminding me to wake up the kids for school. 7:40: Use burner accounts to post more mentions of my name. 8:00am-- (laughter) 
SAM: 8:00am to 9:00am: Selfies! (laughter) 
SAM: This is a busy day. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: 9:20am: Practicing my uwu face. 
ASHLEY: What's that? 
SAM: 10:00am: Mid-morning constitutional. 10:45: Text Marisha to ask what "uwu" means. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: I don't even know what that is. 
ASHLEY: I don't know what that is. 
TALIESIN: You lost me there. 
SAM: 12:00pm: Sensory overstimulation tank. 12:35 to 7:00pm: Gentle crying. 8:00pm: Evening constitutional. 11:30pm: Realize that Alexander was a figment of my imagination, question all reality, watch "The Golden Bachelor," and that's just a normal day. 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: That's busy. 
TRAVIS: Is "The Golden Bachelor" a real thing? 
MATT: Yes, it is. It very much so is. 
MARISHA: Seven hours of crying. 
LAURA: Yeah, what is a constitutional? 
LIAM: Are the constitutionals a walk or a dump? 
SAM: A constitutional is a dump. 
MATT: Dump, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's like a walking dump. 
LIAM: I thought so, I just wanted to verify. 
SAM: It's a shit. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: A walking dump? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: He's got to put a star helmet on. 
MATT: It's why they call them constitution saves. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh. 
SAM: The ad isn't done, people. 
ASHLEY: Oh. (laughter) 
SAM: So now you see why I need "One-Shot Wonders." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: There are over 100 one-shots in the book. So you're sure to find the perfect quest for your group, no matter their level, whether it's fighting vampires, a haunted land-- lighthouse. 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: Or plotting a bank heist. For your next session, don't spend hours planning. Instead, pick up "One-Shot Wonders" and be ready to play in no time at all. Oh god, there's more. Use code "Fresh Cut Grass." 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
MATT: What? 
SAM: Before November 20th to get 10% off at rollandplaypress.com/wonders and wonder your copy now. 
MARISHA: Ugh! 
SAM: Order your copy now. 
LIAM: Wow. 
TALIESIN: I want one. 
LAURA: Why are you much so much better at reading your own schedule than the ad copy? 
SAM: Because I write for myself very well. (laughter) 
SAM: But I write for other people badly. 
TALIESIN: Can you select your one-shot during your constitutional? Is that like a--? 
SAM: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I was wondering. 
SAM: A one-shot of a constitutional. (groaning) 
MATT: Nah. This episode is also sponsored by NordVPN.

LAURA: Brought to you by our friends at Everything Dice. They did the collab with us with the Air Ashari dice. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: And now they're doing these.

ASHLEY: Ooh. 
LAURA: You can't really see it when I hold it up now but they've got the little Ruidus moon in them. 
MATT: So can I have them and use them against you now? 
ASHLEY: Wait, but there's also this little rag in there to clean them. 
LAURA: I know, and you get a little cleany rag and you get a little baggy. 
ASHLEY: This is cute. 
LAURA: So yeah, these are in the US, the UK, and the EU. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LAURA: This is our second collab with them. 
ASHLEY: Those are cool.

LAURA: I hope you enjoy them. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Thank you, Laura. 
LAURA: I'm done talking.

MARISHA: It's me now. A brand new chapter of Candela Obscura previers-- Previers? 
LAURA: I think there's big one on the sweater. 
MATT: Paul Revere's on--

LIAM: Guys, we are on our show.

MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I want to see some Whitestone lore. This is so exciting. 
MARISHA: Yeah, some Whitestone stuff. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Stop giving spoilers away, Marisha. 
TRAVIS: Is there anything below that on the prompter? I can't tell. I think that's it. 
SAM: That might be it. 
LAURA: Is that it? 
MATT: Did you say order your copy at criticalrolebooks.com? 
LIAM: I did. 
MATT: Hell yeah. Then I think-- (laughter)

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So last we left off: Bells Hells, after their excursion to the Shattered Teeth, managed to flee by the skin of their teeth by avoiding what appeared to be, towards the end of the conflict, a homunculus, or sorry, a simulacrum. Different types of weird magical constructions of Ludinus Da'leth, who took a bit of information from that conflict and you fled with indeed your target, a remaining spark of one of the ancient Primordial Titans, particularly flame. As part of that experience, you also teleported back to Whitestone and after a little bit of a bumpy (chuckles) return because some people just can't seem to roll decent on these teleports, returned to Whitestone to find that many of the other allies that you've made through this ever-growing mounting danger in the middle of the Hellcatch Valley have come to Whitestone to discuss the next plan of events. In this time, you went into the war room and made some new friends as well as met some old ones, and altogether began to throw on the table what information you had acquired and what needed to happen next. It was decided as the large world of Exandria currently gathers itself, everyone who might be accessible and available and driven to take arms against this threat that Ludinus and the Ruby Vanguard has built in the center, the heart of Marquet, others still throughout the world continue to be drawn to his cause and that division grows ever stronger throughout the world. As they begin to reach out to those they can, the attention is high on them, their history before them and know that there is an expectation of their arrival without a knowledge of what lies beyond the bloody bridge above the Malleus Key and Ruidus proper on the other side. 
LAURA: Moon stuff. (laughter) 
MATT: I haven't even started the game. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
TALIESIN: It's just some moon stuff. 
MATT: You volunteered to be the recon team to go to Ruidus to see what awaits everyone there. In return, when in you felt the information you gathered was helpful or it was too dangerous, you asked for a couple of things. You met Lady Allura Vysoren, who is looking into acquiring what she can to help you on this journey. Some possible plotting for how you can sneak into the place you previously were witness to the development and release of the Malleus Key itself and found what wasn't Whitestone Andy, but-- 
LAURA: Ah, poor Andy. 
MATT: -- a fine churro salesman here in the middle of Whitestone. But upon taking an evening's rest, contemplating the events of the day and the days to come, the mounting anxiety of what lies before you, in the middle of the night, it appears that Laudna has woken up Imogen with interest for events as the evening progresses. So as we come into here, as everyone else is resting and you have shaken Imogen awake, let us jump back in. 
MARISHA: Hi. 
LAURA: Yeah? 
MARISHA: Did you still want to go on a little field trip? 
LAURA: Oh, 100%. 
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to wake up Fearne, too. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm already awake. 
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. (laughter) 
LAURA: Hi. 
ASHLEY: Sometimes, I like to sleep with my eyes open just to-- 
LAURA: She does, too, no, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding, I don't. 
MARISHA: Oh. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Now I feel like a freak. 
ASHLEY: I know that you do and I was just like-- No, no, no, no, no, no. It's an ability that I wish I really could do. 
LIAM: Wait, are we all sleeping in the same room, or did Fearne sleepwalk in here? 
TRAVIS: We're in Whitestone, right? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I got some fucking estate room. 
MARISHA: I thought we-- 
TRAVIS: Just in case. 
LAURA: We had told her that we wanted to, so she probably-- 
MARISHA: She knew. 
ASHLEY: I knew that there was going be an excursion. 
LAURA: I definitely remember exactly how we set this up. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Okay, well then, I would at least peek my head in. Psst. 
ASHLEY: It's time. 
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Let's go. Okay. What time is it exactly? 
MARISHA: I don't know. I don't know. What time is it? 
MATT: You're not certain. You're in the middle of a castle, but it's in the middle of the night or the early hours of the morning. It is still cold and quiet throughout the halls of Whitestone Castle. 
LAURA: Yeah. Let's go. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Are we sneaking in? 
LAURA: Do you have somewhere you wanted to go specifically, or? 
MARISHA: I don't know, just the way Gwendolyn reacted to me. 
LAURA: Yeah? 
MARISHA: If she won't give me answers, then maybe we'll find some. I'm wondering if maybe walking around will jog my memory a bit. 
LAURA: Sure. 
ASHLEY: I like this idea. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. Which direction should we go? 
LAURA: Do you want to go--? Oh, this is terrible. Do you want to go somewhere that was traumatic or do you want to go somewhere that was happy? 
MARISHA: There's not a lot of options for happy. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: It's mainly all going to be traumatic. But it's okay, I'm good. I've got you all, you know, I've healed a lot. 
ASHLEY: You have, yes, yes. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: It's about this time-- 
ASHLEY: I mean I've seen your journey so far. 
MATT: -- you begin to hear footsteps down the distant hallway as you're emerging from the room. You step back in and close the door carefully and you see a Pale Guard on his wandering towards just (soft clacking). 
LAURA: Are we allowed to walk around? 
MARISHA: Probably not. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: (giggles) Okay, all right. 
LAURA: What if we try the dining hall? That's a place. We could go to the Tree. 
MARISHA: Let's go down. 
LAURA: Straight? 
MARISHA: Let's go down. 
ASHLEY: Something down further? 
MARISHA: See, when I was still roaming the city, sometimes I would seek refuge in the tunnels and whatnot underneath the castle. 
LAURA: All right, yeah, let's do that. 
ASHLEY: Secret passageways and things? 
MARISHA: It's this whole castle, it's riddled with them. 
LAURA: Lead the way. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: As you contemplate, the specific details to your memory are still a bit fuzzy. It was many years ago and that time was a tough one. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: But you recall there was a scary yet safe place and the way to get there was a large room filled with dusty furniture without light, like an extravagant bed chamber of some kind. 
MARISHA: All right. We're looking, I feel like this is probably not going to be helpful because it's a castle, but looking for a big room with furniture. 
LAURA: Oh, I found it. (laughter) 
SAM: Yep. 
ASHLEY: There's one over here, too. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: They're everywhere. 
MARISHA: Shit. 
TRAVIS: Two for two. 
MARISHA: Shit, all right. 
LAURA: Wait. Hold on, let me. (sharp squeak) That was not a fart. 
TRAVIS: No, you farted, you farted on the internet! 
SAM: You farted! (laughter) 
LAURA: I didn't do it, I swear it was my shoe. 
ASHLEY: That sounded so good. 
TALIESIN: In the brunch solarium. 
TRAVIS: It's forever! 
TALIESIN: In my brunch solarium, which is now ruined for hours. 
TRAVIS: You ripped one. 
ASHLEY: It even went up at the end. 
TRAVIS: Your son will see this. 
LAURA: It was my shoe! 
LIAM: Girls fart. (laughter) 
LAURA: It was my shoe, though! 
LIAM: She has a very clean, spotless white sneaker under here. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: And it squeaked on the chair. 
LAURA: Oh my god, but it sounded-- 
LIAM: Right at the same time that she farted. 
LAURA: -- so much like it. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh no, I'm scared to move my feet now. Okay. What if-- 
TRAVIS: (fart noise) 
LAURA: No. (laughs) Pardon me. What if I go into your memories a little bit? 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: And just try to specifically detect that memory? 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: That's a good idea. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Yes. I meditate on what I remember. 
LAURA: Right, I'm going to cast Detect Thoughts. 
MATT: Okay, you cast Detect Thoughts. As you reach out with your mind and begin to pierce-- 
LAURA: I have no reason to touch the side of your face while doing this because I can do it without doing it, but I'm going to touch the side of your face anyways. 
MATT: All right, and holding her head in your hands and focusing your mind and presence into the dark, shadowed scape that is hers, you push through and focusing on your memory, you see this chamber again. Less of a going into the chamber but occasionally exiting it and then back in. You remember there being a staircase that led into this room from her perspective. But the room itself had cobwebs. It was untouched. You see a beautiful four-post bed, a canopy bed, and you see a portrait on the wall of a family. You see a beautiful master bedroom, just forgotten or in disuse. 
LAURA: Weird. It's a bedroom. You were right. It seems like the main bedroom of the estate, but nobody's in there. It's filled with dust and cobwebs. Was there somebody that-- Why would they not use a bedroom that it's probably the best room in the house? 
MARISHA: Perhaps it belonged to the late de Rolos and no one wanted to disturb it? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe somebody died or was murdered brutally in there. 
MARISHA: Haunted. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's where my mind goes. 
LAURA: Well, then we should find that. 
MARISHA: All right, let's try there, let's just, you know, the guards. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh, oh. Pass Without a Trace. 
MATT: Ah. 
MARISHA: That was good. 
MATT: All right. As you feel the comfort of the evening shadows grow stronger around you, you're going to begin to stealthily travel throughout the castle unseen? 
LAURA: Do you remember where their room might've been? There was a stairwell around it or leading? 
MARISHA: I feel that maybe if we go back and start at the dining chamber? I just remember, yeah, we'll go from there. I don't know, it's all going to come back to me. 
ASHLEY: It'll spark something. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: I'd like all three of you to make a stealth check for me, a group stealth check. 
LAURA: ♪ Group stealth ♪ 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Laudna? 
MARISHA: 24. 
MATT: 24, okay. 
LAURA: 28. 
MATT: 28. 
MARISHA: Oh wait, plus 10. 
LAURA: Ha ha. 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: 34. 
MARISHA: 34, yes. 
MATT: And 28? 
LAURA: 28. 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MATT: Plus 10? 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: (whistles) 
LAURA: Okay, that's still good. 
ASHLEY: It's fine. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: It's still really good. 
MATT: Here as you begin to tiptoe your way through the long, thin, stone cold hallways of Whitestone Castle, the occasional wall-mounted sconces with their low burning, magically-produced cinders that keep it in a warm interior visually, though the temperature itself leaves you a little shivery, you continue down towards the dining chambers you said you wanted to begin at. You pay attention to some of the wandering Pale Guard and you can see probably based on the type of clientele that are present within the castle overnight, the security is a little heightened. So there are a pair of guards wandering at each other section. You have to time your movement with them changing positions and moving through certain sections of the castle, but it doesn't take you too long to begin noticing the pattern and through the use of your magic, quickly abscond from corner to corner until eventually you return to the place where you last dined. The hall itself closed, but a good point of reference as to where the rest of the castle might be, which you haven't quite wandered fully about. The only person who has any real memory of this castle would be you. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Go ahead and I'll say roll a wisdom check for me. 
MARISHA: Okay. 13. 
MATT: 13, okay. Okay. You begin to recall memories of entering this chamber and when you entered this chamber at night, you would occasionally escape it throughout other halls, wandering through the castle to take things, to take little tools and little crafts and trinkets that you found loose to bring back to your subterranean safe space. Like a person living in the walls unknown, you would occasionally wander out and bring back in this fractured time and you recall when you would wander out, you would wander down into the castle when you did so. You don't directly recall the path but wherever you were coming from, the chamber was a higher floor. 
LAURA: Oh, we got to go upstairs? Sorry, not my memory. 
MARISHA: Yes, yes. (laughter) 
MARISHA: No, but it's like you can read my mind. 
LAURA: I can see it all in there. 
MARISHA: It's crazy how you're so in touch with exactly what I was thinking. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Unbelievable. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to-- 
LAURA: I'm definitely not still detecting your thoughts. I'm totally still detecting her thoughts. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Do I see any stairs heading up? 
MATT: There are a number of staircases. There are end of hallways that have tight stone spiral staircases that lead up into secondary floors. There's the main foyer area which has ascending staircases that lead to the upper floor, but that place is pretty well-watched since it has the main entryway to the castle itself as well as leading to the throne room. 
MARISHA: Do I remember when I was being led in after being captured if the dining room was on the left or the right? 
MATT: It was on the right-hand side when you entered the castle. So you are on the-- 
MARISHA: Right. So I think we need to go left and up. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That makes sense. 
LAURA: We'll do that. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: See what happens. 
MATT: So to the left would bring you back towards the main entryway because the dining area was to the right as you entered. So if you go left from where you are, it'll lead you towards the area which does have stairs leading upward. But you'd have to be-- 
LAURA: There's a lot of guards? 
MATT: There's four posted in there. So if you want to find a clever way to bypass them, you certainly can. 
LAURA: Are there stairs on the other side of the dining room? 
MARISHA: Maybe it all connects. 
MATT: You could wander, if you'd like to. 
LAURA: Yeah, let's walk through the dining hall and see if there's maybe servant stairs or something because you probably wouldn't have taken main stairs when you were-- 
MARISHA: No, no. Okay, yes. 
LAURA: Let's look for back stairways because that seems like something Laudna would've used before. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: All those old houses had, yeah, like servant-- 
LAURA: Yeah, servant. 
MARISHA: -- passageways and stuff, so. 
MATT: Okay, as you carefully enter the dining hall, closing the doors behind you, heading across, the low burn of the fireplace in the middle of the evening's previous dinner now barely holding on, little crackles and pops. The only remnants of life that sit in this empty chamber. The opposite side, the doors lead into the kitchen and as you step into the kitchen area, you can see the lingering smell of the evening's meal still hanging in the air. You can see a number of the cooking utensils and pots have been scrubbed and left out to dry. There's nobody in the kitchen and you see there are two doorways that leave this chamber. One that's across the kitchen and one that's to the right. It looks like a closet almost. 
MARISHA: I check both. 
LAURA: The one that's across, yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, let's try the one across. 
MATT: Okay, you go across the kitchen, the other door, you open it up (creak) and this leads into a small hallway that bends to the left and you can see there's another door right where the bend of this hallway is before it turns out of sight. 
LAURA: How do you find anything in this place? There's so many fucking hallways. 
ASHLEY: I don't even remember where we are. There was so many twists and turns. Should we look in here? 
MARISHA: Let's try to check the other one across the way first. 
LAURA: In case it's not a pantry. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay, you move across the way to the other door and as the hallway turns, you can see this hallway continues on before it goes into a T-intersection about 25 feet down and there are three small doors along this way alternating on the right, on the left, on the right before it hits the T-intersection. 
LAURA: Servants quarters or offices or-- 
MARISHA: Maybe. 
LAURA: -- something. I'm channeling my memory of "Downton Abbey." (laughter) 
LAURA: What about the other little door? That's the one that you were just talking about? 
MATT: There's the smaller one that's in the kitchen that you guys walked past. 
LAURA: Yeah, that one. Can we go look at that? 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. You pull it open. 
MARISHA: Look at this. This is a really nice wok. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Do you think FCG would like this? 
ASHLEY: We could take it. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: A wok? 
MARISHA: Do you have room? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: A wok, yeah. It's a wok. All right. 
ASHLEY: I have a space. 
MATT: You pull it from the smaller doorway in the kitchen, and as you do, (loud clattering) A bunch of pots and pans and cooking materials come pouring out of a storage thing. 
LAURA: Can I try to catch them with my Mage Hand before any more fall? 
LIAM: All 32? 
MATT: You catch a couple and keep them all from tumbling, but it definitely had three that hit the ground with a heavy ping, pong, ping. (clattering) 
LAURA: I'm going to slowly set them down and we make for the small hallway. Go, go, go, go, go. 
MARISHA: Okay, go, go, go, go. The small hallway. (pattering) 
MATT: Okay, I need you all to make another stealth check after that. 
LIAM: Will they find Percy's train sets? 
MARISHA: Maybe. 
LIAM: Giant basement full of track. 
MATT: What do you think happened to the ziggurat? (laughter) 
MATT: Choo choo. (chugging) 
TRAVIS: That would be, Walt Disney would love that. (laughs) 
MARISHA: 35. 
TALIESIN: The one from Addams Family. 
LIAM: Does he dress up like you when you go to travel town? 
ASHLEY: 37. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
LAURA: 17. 
MATT: 17. 
TALIESIN: With a little hat and pipe. 
MARISHA: With the 10? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Where are you guys hiding right now as this happens in the kitchen? 
LAURA: The little hallway. The one that was on the other side. 
MATT: Oh, the other one? As you go darting into the tiny hallway that was across the way, the first door that's across the way begins to open (creak) in your direction, what do you do? 
MARISHA: Double back, double back. 
LAURA: Yeah, double back. Y'all, just keep going. I'm just going to stay in the kitchen, go. Just go, I'll meet you. 
MATT: So you both dart back into the kitchen? 
MARISHA: We double back. 
MATT: Okay, and you find alcoves slinking into the corners and as you step into the edges where there's barely any light in here other than a lantern that's left out, you (soft swoosh) disappear into the darkness. While you, the door opens and you can see one of the older woman servants in her, I say old in comparison to you. She's in her late 40s, early 50s maybe, has a nightcap on and has this little throw-over robe. "Oh, I'm sorry, you're?" 
LAURA: I'm so sorry. I think I made a little bit of a ruckus. I was just looking for a little midnight snack. 
LIAM: (snorts) 
MARISHA: Sna-ack. 
TRAVIS: It got real strong. 
LIAM: Seven syllables. 
MATT: "All right, all right. Give me a moment, dear." 
LAURA: I'm sorry about that. 
MATT: "No, it's all right." 
LAURA: No, no, no, no, I don't want you to have to wake up. If you just tell me, do you have a piece of fruit or something I can nibble on? 
MATT: "I know on the four back-to-back cabinets that are across from the cooking fireplace you can see up top, on the far right one, there should be a number of pieces of fresh cut fruit that weren't used in the meal." 
LAURA: Thank you so much. 
MATT: "Just take your pick, dear." 
LAURA: Thank you, thank you. 
MATT: "Take your pick." 
LAURA: Is there a way, do you know, can I get back up to my room down this hallway? I got a little lost. 
MATT: "Oh yeah, if you go right down this way and take a right, there should be a staircase that leads to the second floor." 
LAURA: Thank you, ma'am, what was your name again? 
MATT: "Oh, Jeanine." 
LAURA: Jeanine, thank you. 
MATT: "Of course, of course." 
LAURA: Have a good night. I'm sorry about that. 
MATT: "That's all right." 
LAURA: I'll head over to the fruit. 
MATT: "I'm a light sleeper, but I'll make it work," and she gets back into her room and closes the door. 
TALIESIN: That Jeanine-- Sorry. (laughter) 
LAURA: I grab some fruit. 
MATT: No witnesses. 
LAURA: There's a stairway at the end. 
MARISHA: Let's do that. (clicks) 
LAURA: I'll walk normal. Y'all walk quiet. 
ASHLEY: We'll be quiet. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Clomp, clomp, clomp, clomp, clomp, clomp. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. From Pike in armor to Fearne's fucking hooves. 
MATT: Yep. 
LIAM and SAM: (loud clomps) 
TRAVIS: Why is there stone everywhere? We need more carpets in Whitestone. 
ASHLEY: I'm trying to step as lightly as I can. 
TALIESIN: She could get little socks. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Little socks? (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh my god, little booties? You slip everywhere. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, very small. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: We should've had Deanna crochet you little hoof covers. 
ASHLEY: Little hoof booties. 
TALIESIN: Good idea. 
ASHLEY: Little leg warmers. (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's so cute. 
MATT: Following the directions you were given, you head down the long hallway and indeed there is a tight spiral staircase that leads to the secondary floor. As you emerge there, you can see the hall splits into three different directions. Make another wisdom check for me. 
SAM: Guidance. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Switch up the dice. 
TRAVIS: (fart sound) 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
SAM: Oh yes. 
LAURA: Yay. 
MARISHA: On the Laudna die. 
TALIESIN: All I wanted. 
LAURA: Of course. 
ASHLEY: Yep. 
MATT: As you step up into the space, everything becomes familiar. You're like, "I know this hall, I've been through here," and you start instinctively-- 
MARISHA: I know this. 
MATT: -- walking down one of the paths. (chuckles) "Jurassic Park" reference? 
MARISHA: Linux. 
MATT: "I know this." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Like a bloodhound picking up a scent, you start walking around and looking, passing doors until you come to the very end of the far left hall and there, there is a set of beautiful double doors that finalize where this walkway comes to a close. 
MARISHA: From Laudna's perspective, it has that forced perspective. 
TRAVIS: Vertigo? 
MARISHA: Yeah, like parallax effect as she gets to the doors. 
LIAM: The Overlook Hotel? 
MARISHA: Yeah, full Overlook Hotel. This is it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
MARISHA: This is where they kept me. 
LAURA: I'm going to put my hand on the small of your back. Do you need to take a minute? 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean they kept you here? They kept you here? 
LAURA: In the chamber? 
MARISHA: They tortured me. 
LAURA: In their room? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: For how long? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
ASHLEY: I hate these people. Not the ones that are here, but who did this to you, of course. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry. 
LAURA: Are you sure you want to go in there? 
MARISHA: I still don't really understand what happened to me or who these people were or who's in my head. No one knows, no one will tell me. I need this. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Let's do it, let's do it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
MARISHA: I'm going to test the doorknob first. 
MATT: Okay, you touch it and turn and it's a handle and as you turn it, it (click) stops. It appears to be locked-- 
LAURA: Do you have-- 
MATT: -- and as you remove your hand, you can see the layer of dust that's settled on these handles and the dust that has pulled off as you finger is removed and you've cleared parts of the metal. 
TRAVIS: Ain't nobody been here. 
MARISHA: I do have thieves' tools. 
TALIESIN: Could be cursed. 
LAURA: Oh good. 
LAURA: That's good because I don't have nothing. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: You steal things, don't you? 
ASHLEY: I have thieves' tools as well. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to try and pick this lock. 
MATT: Go for it. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Nice. 
MATT: All right, roll. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Not to brag. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll with a dexterity check. Are you proficient with thieves' tools? 
MARISHA: I am not. 
MATT: Okay, so just roll a dexterity check. 
MARISHA: Plus my d4, right? 
MATT: Plus your d4. 
LIAM: Come on, Laudy-daudy. Get it. 
MARISHA: Oof, that's bad. That's very bad. 
LIAM: More Guidance. 
MARISHA: Five! (laughter) 
MATT: Five. 
LIAM: Oh! (laughs) Goddamn. 
LAURA: Oh. Okay. 
MATT: You spend a tense four to five minutes-- 
TRAVIS: Oof. 
MATT: -- working on this lock. 
LAURA: (whistles) 
MARISHA: I haven't had to do this in awhile. 
MATT: The door is beautifully carved and you can see there's almost a vineyard design on the outside of it where you can see these vines that climb and grapes that are carved into the dark wood with leaves that curl off. You can see that there is a symbol of a tree that is built where the doors come together that represents the Sun Tree in the center. It's beautiful and it's easy to take all that in while you wait for Laudna to quietly curse under her breath as she's having a hard time with this lock-- 
MARISHA: (frustrated mumbles) 
MATT: -- until eventually, you reach a point where you have no idea what to do anymore. The tumbler's not working for you or you're just out of your depth. 
LAURA: Can you see through the keyhole at all? 
MATT: You look down and look in the keyhole and it's just darkness. 
ASHLEY: Is there-- all right. 
LAURA: Can I? Oh. 
ASHLEY: No, you go ahead. 
LAURA: Can I cast my cantrip? Can I light up the inside through the keyhole? 
MATT: Yeah. As you cause these little sparkling orbs of energy to (sputters) appear in the other chamber, (sizzles) giving this shifting crackle of lavender light within, you can see, just as you saw in her memory, pretty much untouched since then, the bedchambers that lie here, the four massive poles that make this canopy bed and you can see a bookshelf and a trunk and that's all you can see from the perspective of this keyhole, but this is the bedchamber from her memory. 
LAURA: I could do something really stupid right now. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to look through the keyhole and I'm going to open a little split in space and a Reiloran's going to step through. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: You can do that? 
TRAVIS: The other side of the door? 
MARISHA: So they can open the door? 
ASHLEY: Oh cool. 
MARISHA: Brilliant. 
MATT: Which kind of Reiloran are you summoning? 
LIAM: Nifty. 
SAM: Unseen Alien Servant? 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He's like, "Look at the square footage." 
MATT: Quite Seen Alien Servant. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Very seen. 
MARISHA: "I have untold power granted by the moon. What do you need? You want me to open the door?" (laughter) 
LAURA: Pretty much. Pretty much, I don't know. 
LIAM: Moon stuff. 
TALIESIN: I left my keys at bar; it's in the coat check. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: I guess a Mind, what, a Hex Mind? 
LIAM: Make me a margy. 
MATT: Hex Mind, okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: "All right." 
MATT: As you focus on the other side, the two of you hear muffled beyond the doorway, (deep whirring). 
ASHLEY: Someone's in there. (laughter) 
MATT: This bassy crackle and then silence once more. You watch on the opposite end as that space tears open in bright red coloration and then two legs step out of this rift and touch the ground and you can see a Reiloran stands there, robed and belted across this travel garb and you can see around their face head jewelry that adorns their elongated head, their dark, void-like eyes and as they step down, it meets your gaze through the keyhole and you hear in your mind, "What do you require?" 
LAURA: Can you unlock the door? (laughter) 
MATT: "Sure." (laughter) 
MATT: You hear (click). "Is there anything else you require?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: How's it going up there? 
MATT: "What?" 
LAURA: Have you seen a guy with long white hair? 
MATT: "I have not, no." 
LAURA: What about a tall, creepy guy with long fingers? 
MATT: "We have a number of those up there." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
ASHLEY: But not red. 
LAURA: Yeah, but he's not red. Have you seen anyone that looks like me? 
MATT: "Yes." 
LAURA: (gasps) You have? 
MATT: "Briefly." 
LAURA: What was she doing? 
MATT: "Walking through the storm." 
LAURA: That could've been me. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
ASHLEY: Could've been you, yeah. 
MARISHA: That is true. How long can he hang around, just in case? 
LAURA: He can hang around for awhile. You want to chill with us for just a little bit? You want to just hang out? 
MATT: "Whatever you require." 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: I know, good knowledge. 
MATT: So the door's unlocked. It's not open yet. 
LAURA: Thanks, okay. 
TALIESIN: You wanted dinner with-- 
LAURA: We're going to go. 
TALIESIN: -- a well-known actor and it's just-- 
MATT: (creaks) So as you walk inside, indeed you can look around and you can see this, it's a beautiful chamber. There's a vanity and mirror to one side. You can see there's-- 
LAURA: An hour. 
MATT: -- a large beautifully carved armoire. The carpeting, these rugs that are placed beneath the bed and beneath the large pieces of furniture are beautiful. You see there's a large portrait indeed of a well-dressed family all sitting with five children amongst the two parents. You catch the second youngest within the portrait has a large bespectacled face and with a brief moment, you realize that you've met this fellow, though many years later in his life. 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: I wonder who all these other people are? 
LAURA: Oh, no wonder he's such a prick. 
ASHLEY: What, why? 
LAURA: Well, I mean, his entire family. 
ASHLEY: Where are they? 
MARISHA: I guess it always is weird to move into your parents' bedroom. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, they died. 
ASHLEY: That was the whole thing. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Brutally murdered. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. Do I? So okay, so it's all covered in dust. Any other thing that's sparking memory? 
MATT: Because you rolled a natural 20 earlier, yes. I will say stepping into this chamber, the memories flooding back, the muscle memories, it's odd because even just being in this room you watch as Laudna's posture, which already isn't great, becomes even more small. Like she instinctually wants not to be noticed within this space and you begin walking over towards the edge where the bed and the bookcase meet and you recall pulling a book or tugging on a book. There's something about this bookcase that's familiar to you. 
MARISHA: Absolutely. I go over, are there still books on there? 
MATT: Yeah, all the books are still there, all deeply-placed and all as dusty as you recall. 
MARISHA: Hmm. I'm going to try one on the third shelf down. I'm going to look for the one that's maybe a little taller than the rest. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Slightly out of place. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: Maybe one has a little less dust than the others if you touched it a few times. 
MARISHA: Let's see. 
SAM: "The Cat in the Hat." 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: 25. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: 25. 
SAM: Yo! 
TALIESIN: Damn. 
MATT: Glancing around, on the third shelf, which is the bottom shelf of the three major bookcase shelves that are up here before the lower cabinet opens, all the way to the far right, the second to last book is the only book that's spine has no title and you also notice upon the very top, indeed there is a little notch where it looks like it has less dust than every other book there. 
MARISHA: With my spindly finger. (clicks) 
MATT: As soon as you pull it back and it slightly tilts as opposed to remove, three of you immediately hear (rumbles) and to the immediate right, the stone wall which had a tapestry over it, you see it (rumble) shift and slide out of the way, revealing another wall made of bricks. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Put my hand. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, just in case. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Because there's a tapestry hanging in front of it still and you can see the bricks here don't match the color of the rest of the room's construction. They're not the same color. 
LAURA: A locked back room. 
TALIESIN: Phantom of the Paradise. "Seal it up, do it now." Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. So new bricks that don't-- 
MATT: These are newer. 
MARISHA: It's a patch job. 
MATT: It looks like it might be a more recent bit of construction and you do not recall this wall being there based on your memory. As you move the tapestry aside, there is painted on the bricks a phrase in Common in nice, large handwriting that reads "Clever as you are, there is nothing for you here. Now go find your mother and apologize." (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
ASHLEY: That is amazing. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: So good. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
TRAVIS: The attitude in this family. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Too real. 
TRAVIS: I love it. 
TALIESIN: Too fucking real. Shit. 
MARISHA: I have a feeling that might be for little Gwen. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Yes? 
MARISHA: Do you happen to have anything, you know? 
ASHLEY: Checking, I feel like-- 
SAM: The old exploding wall spell? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Any Stone Shapey-Shapes? 
ASHLEY: Let's see what I prepared. 
LAURA: I could try-- 
LIAM: Mirthful Leap your foot into the wall? 
LAURA: No, I don't want to make too much noise. 
MARISHA: I know. 
LAURA: I could try to use Telekinesis. 
MARISHA: To? 
LAURA: To loosen some of it maybe at the top, you know? So it won't make as much noise or something. 
MARISHA: I have my rock pick, but I don't want to "Shawshank Redemption" this. We'll be here for forever. 
MATT: Two weeks later, you finally get through the wall. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Okay, Stone Shape. 
LAURA: Hey. 
MATT: You got it. 
ASHLEY: That was it. 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: Oh, hey, that's great. That's exactly this spell. 
LAURA: ♪ Dun dun dun ♪ 
ASHLEY: Actually, there was one I did not choose. 
LIAM: A poster of Vex'ahlia. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say the hot poster of the Ruby of the Sea. 
MATT: So yeah. 
LIAM: The Ruby of the Sea? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Perfect. 
ASHLEY: Hopefully that's okay. 
TALIESIN: Just a pin up. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's better. 
ASHLEY: All right. Wait, where'd it go? (thinking noises) Sorry. 
LAURA: Can you make a five-foot hole or something? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I can make a small passage as long as the wall is less than five feet thick. 
TALIESIN: It doesn't even work. 
SAM: It works. It works. 
MATT: You can give it a shot. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Sublime. 
ASHLEY: I just touch it. 
MATT: You touch it, and what are you trying to do? 
ASHLEY: I am trying to make a hole. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: For us to go through. 
MATT: You reach out and you touch the brick stonework that currently closes this and immediately, you watch as it (swoosh) crumbles away like someone's rapidly carving clay out of the way and you leave an entryway to what immediately reveals no more than a foot and half past the wall, which is only about that thick a lightless staircase below. 
MARISHA: (sighs) 
LAURA: Light orbs. 
MATT: Okay, the orbs glow downward and the stairs descend 15, 20, 30, 40 feet before they reach another door. Do you descend the stairs and go to the door? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'll lead the way. 
MATT: This is all very familiar to you. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You head down to the door and open it, (click) (creak) into another wide chamber without a source of light. 
MARISHA: Imogen? 
LAURA: Huh? Okay. What was your name? 
MATT: You turn back to the Reiloran? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: "Sivaana." 
LAURA: Sivaana. 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Sivaana. 
LAURA: Sivaana. 
ASHLEY: That's a lovely name. 
LAURA: You want to come with us, or just stay here? 
MATT: "Whatever you wish." 
LAURA: What if we run into trouble down there? Was there ever any trouble down there? 
ASHLEY: I think we should bring Sivaana. 
LAURA: Sivaana, can you fit through this hole? 
MATT: (soft swoosh) They step over and step through the hole after the rest of you. You can see there's even an anxiousness and as they walk around, they're taking it all in. They're intense and very direct, but also you get a sense of confusion and marvel from this entity as it walks around in an unfamiliar space. 
LAURA: I'm going to say into your head: Think it's a bad idea to let them see all of this stuff? What if Ludinus finds out that this one particular Reiloran has come here and then, you know, tries to interrogate them and find out more about Whitestone? Is that possible? 
MARISHA: I guess anything is possible. But also, you know-- 
LAURA: We could use their help. 
MARISHA: It's still worth it. Yeah. I think so. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: In your head, I'm going to go: ♪ (upbeat humming) ♪ (laughter) 
MARISHA: Just dance a little. (laughter) 
MATT: So the Reiloran descends the stairs behind you. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: You send your orbs into the chamber. As they spread out into the area here, it's about maybe 10 to 12 feet at its apex and the chamber is about 30 or so feet across. It's almost a thick L-shape in the chamber. As you step in, it turns to the left and opens up wide before it seems to arc off again out of sight. But you see within this room, it is filled with furniture of all manner of strange shapes. There are tables and things, but everything's covered in sheets, pale sheets that hang over dozens of odd cases, and desks, and other contraptions as you see large spire and weird bulbous bits of equipment that are all covered. You can see occasionally a bit of glass that peeks out as the shine of your moving orb glistens across it. You can see the brief little bit of color that peeks from a wire that is exposed in the back of one of these layered blankets. It looks like it might be some sort of laboratory or work room. 
ASHLEY: They don't even use all this stuff down here? 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Was this-- Was this Delilah's? 
MARISHA: I think so. Nearest sheet. (swooshes) 
MATT: (swooshes) You pull it off and you see across here what looked like a table, but now revealing it, there are shackles on each end of the long table. 
LAURA: Is this where it happened? 
MATT: You can see stains on the wood and now that you look down, you can see a lot of the floor here also is covered in broken glass and bits of shards and splinters of wood and you get the sense that a lot of the materials here are either partially damaged or are in severe disuse. 
LAURA: Can you light up your hands? 
ASHLEY: (whooshes) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: To make light? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Because-- (laughter) 
LAURA: Because I just realized both my spells are concentration. 
MATT: Oh, they are. 
LAURA: But as long as she can use something to make light, then we can see. 
ASHLEY: I have Caleb's Produce Flame. 
LAURA: Oh, perfect. Yeah, so. 
MATT: Okay, so you maintain-- 
ASHLEY: Somebody named Caleb. 
MATT: -- your Reiloran connection. 
SAM: How did you learn that? 
ASHLEY: It's a cantrip. 
LIAM: (as Caleb) I taught the world fire. 
ASHLEY: Yes. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Prometheus over here. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes, yes. I start frantically ripping down the sheets. 
MATT: Okay. Understood. 
MARISHA: Almost manic. 
MATT: You watch Laudna, lost in the memories of this, pulling off sheet after sheet, revealing what looks to be a dark lectern where it looks like a book would be held, a tome would be held open. Beyond that, you can see an alchemical contraption, but the glass is shattered inward. It either was privy to a fight or intentionally destroyed, a number of its wired components removed and missing. Another section over here, you can see along the wall there is a rack of some kind that contains all manner of tools, but many of them are missing or scattered upon the ground around it. You can see there are blades and chains and a lot of signs of little, dusted remnants of residuum dust, but it looks like it's little left behind remnants of what was once there. You can see there was a glass jar that was large and contained what probably was refined residuum dust, but it has since been broken and is what would've poured out onto the ground. Looks like it's been taken and absconded with and there's just the faintest bit of a glitter sparkle as your flame light passes over and near it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: The temperature in this room also is quite cold and getting colder, as the flames in your hands also begin to grow dimmer. 
LAURA: Dimmer? 
ASHLEY: Um... What? 
MARISHA: Dimmer? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Laudna, do you think-- 
ASHLEY: Is there-- 
LAURA: -- it's dangerous down here? 
MATT: Behind Laudna, as you're looking at her, you see this ever so faint visage of a ghostly human rise out of one of the untouched sheets, its vacant, dark eye sockets and its hanging mouth drawing more and more open as it seems to reach for her. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: No, nope! 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh! 
MARISHA: I just back up. Wait, I try to talk to it real quick in Shadow Cant. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Hello, friend. Who are you? 
MATT: It just reaches for you, making this baneful sound. (deathly moans) 
MARISHA: I dodge out of the way. 
MATT: I need the three of you to roll initiative. (exclaiming) 
LAURA: Oh fuck, oh fuck. 
MARISHA: Shit! Ah! 
LAURA: Oh fuck. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
LAURA: Where did my-- 
SAM: Is this combat? Is there a map? What's happening? 
MATT: This is theater of mind in here. 
SAM: Do I read this or not? 
MATT: Sure. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Well, that's combat cam. We don't-- 
SAM: It's not combat cam. There's no cam! 
MARISHA: It's theater of the mind! 
SAM: You'll never get to know what this says. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Shit. 
SAM: This theater of the imagination is brought to you by-- 
MARISHA: Brought to you by. 
SAM: WizKids. (laughs) 
LIAM: Not if we attack Allura after the intermission. 
MARISHA: 17. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MATT: All right, so 25 to 20. 
LAURA: Oh shit, I didn't roll. I didn't roll, I didn't roll. Oh, it was terrible. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's pretty bad. 
MATT: 20 to 15? 17? 
MARISHA: 17. 
MATT: All right. Shit. 
TRAVIS: (snores) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MARISHA: You're still sleeping peacefully. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: We're going to role play our sleeping in real time, right? 
MATT: 15 to 10. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Every time you guys take a hit-- 
ASHLEY: 13. 
TRAVIS: -- I have to roll a d100. 
MATT: 13, okay. 
SAM: Oh, that's right, you have to roll. 
MARISHA: What if you-- What if this is it? 
SAM: What if you die? 
MARISHA: What if you die now? Jeez. 
ASHLEY: Don't! 
SAM: Oh, fuck you. 
MARISHA: You freaked me out, man. 
TALIESIN: That is not the face he'll make when it happens. 
MATT: 10 to five? 
TRAVIS: No, I'd be like-- 
LAURA: Five. 
MATT: Five. 
LAURA: Does my Reiloran get the same-- 
MATT: Does it say it in the spell that it goes on your initiative or after? Remind me. 
LAURA: It takes its turn immediately after mine. 
MATT: There you go. Okay. Laudna, you are up first as this one spectral entity (hollow gasp) goes for you rapidly. What do you do? 
MARISHA: I don't know if this is going to-- Shit, shit, shit. Is that what I want to do right now? 
LIAM: In this room? 
MARISHA: I will-- Yeah, I'll try it. I don't know if it will work. I'm going to actually pass my hand through it and try and grasp onto what is left of its soul-- 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: -- of this emptied entity, and do Hunger of the Shadow Shard and see if I can absorb its soul. 
MATT: Okay. All right, go ahead and roll for your attack. 
SAM: Jesus. 
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, it's a natural 19. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
MARISHA: So 28? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: Okay, 4d8. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I need more d8s. 
TALIESIN: Which of my ancestors are you murdering now? 
MARISHA: Two. I'll just do these twice. Five, six, seven. 
TALIESIN: Actually, them being down here, maybe not. 
MARISHA: 11, 16 damage. 
MATT: 16. What type of damage? 
MARISHA: Necrotic. 
MATT: Necrotic. Okay. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: As you reach out to-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know if it's going to work. 
MATT: -- the spectral entity, you embrace that darker side of your spirit. The rest of you here in the middle in this low light watch as this dark mist seems to drift around her shoulders and head. As the spectral entity steps through into your arm, you feel the cold shiver turn into an ice knife-like feeling through your forearm as its vacant face goes, (hollow, raspy) "It's you! (dry gasp)" It takes no damage. 
SAM: What? Because it has no soul, just like me. 
MARISHA: It's necrotic. It's immune to necrotic damage. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
MARISHA: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: ♪ It's me ♪ ♪ Hi ♪ 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: ♪ I'm the problem, it's me ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ At tea ♪ 
MARISHA: I, once again, just ask it: You know me? I'm going to use my bonus action to transform into my Form of Dread, which is-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, let's go. Quit fucking around! 
MARISHA: -- much more, even more reminiscent of the mourning veil and Delilah's form. Ew, icky. Okay. That's my turn. 
MATT: Okay. As you transform into your Form of Dread, the two of you notice that the veil drops, but the collar widens. You see across her neck where the skin seems to darken and burn into the shape of a choker. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: There is the shadow that drifts-- 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: -- off her seems to almost take the shape of another pair of shoulders that drifts just above hers. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: What the fuck? 
MARISHA: I don't know! I don't know! I didn't know what was going to happen. 
SAM: You know, you know! 
LAURA: You know! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Mascara! 
TALIESIN: I'm wet! Now I'm wet and possessed! (laughter) 
MATT: That finishes your turn? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Oh man! 
MATT: The ghost that is before you now, it stretches even more, terrified and furious. As you take your shape, it seems like it was grasping for recognition and has come into focus. and for a brief moment, that weird, stretched, aimless expression almost seems to return closer to the once-human form, and you see that anger towards you as it-- 
MARISHA: Do I recognize who it is at all? They think I'm Delilah, don't they? 
MATT: You do not recognize who it is. You see what looks to be a-- 
MARISHA: (sighs) 
MATT: It may have once been a young man in his twenties or so, handsome in his life, but now left stretched and forgotten. It is going to reach out to you with a Withering Touch. 21 to hit? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, you take-- 
SAM: I had so many of these toys. Could be me. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: That'll be 16 points of necrotic damage. 
MARISHA: Do I have something that doesn't work with necrotic? 
LIAM: Yeah, the mustache gives it away. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: You'll leave when Burt Reynolds tells you to leave. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: "When it is your turn--" 
SAM: What are you? 
MARISHA: I don't really know. That's why I'm here. 
LAURA: (groans) 
MARISHA: 16 points? 
SAM: What are you? 
MATT: 16 points of necrotic damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: All right, that finishes that specter's turn. It's now spinning around and the two of you are do-si-do-ing in the middle of this area. Its body is clipping through and merging with some of the surrounding laboratory furniture as it seems to, in this ethereal state. Fearne, it's your turn. 
ASHLEY: Okay. You're stuck in here. Maybe we can just let you out. Are you stuck in here? Can you understand what I'm saying? 
MATT: It is not even paying attention to you. It is locked on her. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Since I still have Produce Flame, I'm going to palm his face-- 
SAM: (laughs) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: -- with what I have left. Ooh! Natural 19 plus 10. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: 29. 
MATT: Definitely hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 3d8. That's not bad for a cantrip. That's a shit roll. Okay. Okay, 12 points of damage. Fire damage. 
MATT: Okay, 12 points of fire damage. The flames burn up the side of this ghost as it (groans). It takes the hit and recoils from you, but when normally any creature that you've fought hurts, it acknowledges the source of the pain, it seems to pull away and then refocus again on Laudna. 
MARISHA: I just start posturing towards it. Let's go! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
MATT: Let's fucking do this! 
MARISHA: (intimidating taunt) Fuck me bro! 
MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Fearne, anything else you want to do on your turn? 
ASHLEY: No, I'm going to stay. 
MATT: Okay. You finish your turn, flame in your hand, just as you, out the corner of your eye, see a secondary spectral figure emerge from one of the other pieces of furniture. (spectral groan) I need you to make a charisma saving throw for me, please. 
TALIESIN: Pretty sure it's going to murder us all. 
ASHLEY: Me? Okay. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Just saying it. 
LAURA: Shit, shit. 
TRAVIS: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. 
TALIESIN: I love this. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 22. 
MATT: 22? Charisma saving throw? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Fantastic. 
ASHLEY: Is this a spell or a magical effect? No? Okay. 
MATT: No. 22 is enough, though. As it seems to reach out, its fingers begin to freeze your shoulder-- 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: -- as it attempts to push into your body. 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: You just-- 
ASHLEY: I don't like it. 
MATT: -- will it away and spin around, flame in your hand, and it pulls away. The minute it sees the flame it turns and sees Laudna, and you watch as the vitality of this stretched spirit suddenly clicks, and then you see a young, late teens woman in a servant's outfit-- 
MARISHA: Oh jeez. 
MATT: -- just look back towards Laudna. 
MARISHA: Jeez. 
MATT: "You!" 
MARISHA: It's not me! 
TRAVIS: Maybe it is you. 
MATT: A third-- 
MARISHA: They think I'm Delilah! 
TRAVIS: This is whacked out. 
LAURA: A third?! A Third?! 
MATT: A third spectral light begins to emerge-- 
TRAVIS: This is whacked out. 
MATT: -- from what looks like-- 
LAURA: Another one. There's another one! 
MATT: -- a cabinet. This one begins to drift upward, and it looks like an older man with big, thick mutton chops, his jowls sunken, his sockets pulled deep within his skull, as he reaches out towards you, Imogen. I need you to make a charisma saving throw for me. 
ASHLEY: Is there a way we can get them out of here? 
SAM: Use that rizz. 
LAURA: 21. 
MATT: 21. You jettison it from your consciousness before it even gets too close to you. You double down and there's almost an invisible shock wave of your very will as it bounces off. (undead groans) All three are just pushing over towards where Laudna is. Imogen, it's your go. 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. 
LAURA: How big is this room? 
MATT: This room is maybe (sighs) 20 feet across to the other side, and about 10 to 15 feet wide in places. It's very cramped. 
SAM: A New York penthouse. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: It's filled with furniture. 
LAURA: They're just going to keep coming, I bet. She had a lot of victims. 
MARISHA: We should just try and get out of here. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I guess. 
LAURA: Is there a way I can position myself to where I'm within 10 feet of the entities without hitting any of my friends? Because I can't tell where I am right now. 
MATT: Right. No, you could position yourself. If you were to go up towards the teenage girl spirit, you could probably get the other two with a 50-50 shot of catching Laudna. 
MARISHA: It's okay. What are you trying to do? Before I agree to it. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: Can I do that and tell Laudna-- Oh, no, because they'll get an attack of opportunity on her. They're right next to her. 
MATT: They're right-- One of them-- 
SAM: She's fine. 
MATT: Two of them are. 
LAURA: All right. Okay. Oh, okay! I am going to use my bonus action to push Laudna back five feet. 
MARISHA: Mm! 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
MATT: Laudna, you get pushed back and you hit the edge of one of, what looks like a partially uncovered dissection table of some kind. 
MARISHA: (groans) My kidney! 
MATT: You stumble up onto it and catch yourself on the sides. But you are pushed five feet away from them, which does take her out of harm's way. 
LAURA: Great! Then, as soon as she's out of distance, I'm going to hit a Shock Flare and I'm going to light up, like one of those balls. 
MATT: The plasma balls? 
LAURA: Yeah, a plasma ball. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: (electricity flares) All around me. 
MATT: (electricity crackling) All of them caught into it. What save do they make? 
LAURA: That's a 4th-level, and it is instantaneous. Hold on. Strength saving throw. 
MATT: Strength save. (laughs) Nope. Five, four, (laughs) and a zero. They all rolled really bad and have penalties on strength because they're ghosts, so that's-- 
LAURA: Oh, great. 
MATT: That's real bad. 
LAURA: So that's 5d6-- 
MATT: Nice. 
LAURA: -- of lightning damage. I don't know if that does anything to ghosts. I hope it does. Why do I roll so poorly, you guys? Seven, 10, 13 points of lightning damage. 
MATT: 13. 
LAURA: Then, yeah, so that's it. 
MATT: All three of them (electrical charge). It impacts them heavily, and you watch as the spirits lose their human form for just a second and become these floating, ethereal mist spirits. As the plasma ball vanishes, they all return to their stretched forms and they've taken the hits. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: One of them looks like it's pretty hurt. 
LAURA: The one that looks pretty hurt, Siv behind me, I'm going to say: Hit it. And they're going to Mind Spike that one. 
MATT: Okay. They're all still focused on Laudna. 
LAURA: Right. 
MATT: So roll for that one. I think it's-- Or do they make a saving throw? 
LAURA: No, it's a attack. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: So that's a 22. 
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
LAURA: Okay, so, I suck. 10 points of psychic damage. 
MATT: 10 points of psychic damage. That ghost (impacts) seems to be impacted, you watch as its lower torso, which was mostly present, is now nearly invisible. It's not holding itself in this realm as strong as it once was. Does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: I mean, yeah. 
MATT: Laudna, you're up. All three of them are still focused on you, and they've encircled the area around you. You were pushed five feet away, but now you're up against the table and they're all closing the gap. What do you do? 
MARISHA: This is fucking with her head a little bit. She's going to twitch a little and say: Want to release decades of rage? Come at me! I'm going to release my Hound of Ill Omen, leaning even more into what I remember from Delilah, and then I'm going to cast Mirror Image on myself, so it looks like there's three Delilahs. 
TRAVIS: Ooh, slick. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: And then, once again, you see the collar flare and a little bit of that green, crackling necrotic energy. She says: I killed you once I can do it again! And I sic my hound at them. 
MATT: Okay. So your hound apparates and goes after which one? There's one that's barely holding on and two that have been struck with her plasma. 
MARISHA: Sure, we'll start with the one that's barely hanging on. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, now what I do? Rarr. (thinking noises) 
SAM: Rarr. 
MARISHA: Wait, doesn't he have a multi-attack situation? I don't know. It doesn't matter. He's going to do a bite attack. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Big Delilah energy. 
MARISHA: Ugh, oof! Bad! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Seven. 
SAM: Ugh. 
MATT: Seven's a miss. 
MARISHA: He misses. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MATT: Tries to strike out, but the spirits themselves dodge out of the way. 
TALIESIN: Why. 
MATT: The one that it went for turns around, it's still focusing on you, she goes, "Why? Why?" 
MARISHA: I don't know! 
MATT: That finishes your turn. The one that's been hurt the most, that's screaming "why" at you is going to reach for you again with its Withering Touch. Natural one. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: It goes to swing for you, and as it does, it looks like the hatred turns into absolute fear, and its jaw stretches, and drops about seven or eight inches as it stops, and begins to recoil. (gasps) That brings us to Fearne's turn. 
LAURA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: They're recoiling, but-- 
MARISHA: They're afraid of me. 
ASHLEY: Oh, well, maybe not you, but that's-- okay. I am going to-- I don't know if this is a good idea. I'm going to cast Daylight. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: In the room. So, I need to touch a point, so I'm going to touch the ground. (laughter) 
MATT: You touch a point in the ground. (whooshes) Suddenly, the chamber is extremely well lit. As the light on the floor shoots outward, the bits of broken glass that have been revealed almost refracted against the wall in odd patterns. 
LAURA: Ooh, cool. 
MATT: The specters, as the flash hits them, you can see them turn slightly, but no other effect. 
ASHLEY: Mm, okay. 
MATT: But the room is brightly lit. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: All right. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Does that your turn? 
ASHLEY: (sighs) I guess it feels so lame-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: They're probably weaker now. 
ASHLEY: They're probably weaker now. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Shit, I can't do it. 
TRAVIS: I hope so. (laughs) 
MARISHA: I know. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to bamf out Mister. 
MARISHA: I'm going to-- 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: And throw some flaming shit down here. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'll bamf out Mister. 
SAM: Burn the fucking palace down. 
TALIESIN: If that doesn't create a body-- 
MATT: So, the bamfing out Mister is usually an action, to bring him into space. 
ASHLEY: Uh-huh. 
MATT: But this, we'll say you probably brought him out in advance while you were writing down-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: As you were preparing for the area-- 
SAM: You do? 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: What does Laudna's appearance look like in the full light? 
MATT: In the full light that you can see, her form, very clearly, it's still Laudna, but there's this transformed shape of her clothing. Almost like the shadows, almost like a liquid oil that has formed out of her clothing that forms these pointed shoulders, and this collar that sits and glistens. You can see where it looks like the skin of her throat is burned in this strip around. Almost like behind her, the shadow of shimmering darkness frames her body in the upper torso shape of another pair of shoulders, and another head. 
TRAVIS: If you're getting more and more-- 
MATT: It just drifts-- 
TRAVIS: -- powerful-- 
MATT: -- just above her. 
TRAVIS: Are you feeding her right now, by making more of you? 
MARISHA: Probably. 
SAM: Maybe Delilah's just feeding you, and it's just a one-way thing. 
TRAVIS: Woo, woo! 
MATT: Another one of these specters reaches, and claws for you with a Withering Touch-- 
TRAVIS: Where's the burial site? 
MATT: -- with a natural 20-- 
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: A one to a natural 20, they're getting angry. 
MARISHA: Ah, well, I have my Mirror Image. 
MATT: Indeed, so, go ahead and see if they hit you, or the image. 
MARISHA: They do. 
SAM and LAURA: Hit you? 
MARISHA: Right? 
SAM: I don't know. 
MARISHA: What do I have to roll on for the Mirror Image? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
MARISHA: You have to roll over a certain, hang on, hang on. 
SAM: Certain-- 
MARISHA: What a-- 
LAURA: Certain. 
MARISHA: Certain. 
MATT: Mirror Image-- 
LAURA: I have-- 
MATT: You have to roll an eight or higher to get rid of them, what'd you roll? 
MARISHA: No, I rolled a six, so they hit me with this one. 
SAM: Six, six, six. 
MATT: Well, you have three duplicates. You have to roll a six or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate, with two duplicates, it's an eight or higher, sorry. 
MARISHA: Okay, right, so, no, they miss. 
MATT: All right, so the one that goes-- 
MARISHA: There's one more-- 
MATT: The one that goes towards you-- 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: -- reaches out, (gasps) and one of the duplicates of you ends up being consumed by this spirit as it vanishes out of sight. The other one is going to come for you, now even more infuriated. That is going to be a 20 to hit. 
SAM: Jesus, these guys are good. 
MARISHA: Let's roll again. Miss, goes for my second Mirror Image. 
MATT: Both of your images. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Or two of them are gone now, you have a third one left, right? 
TALIESIN: One left. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
MATT: It says three. Okay, there is a growing ferocity in their frustration as they lash out at you, and are unable to hurt you as much as they want. That finishes their go, Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: Me? 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, you, Imogen. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh god. Is this, what this-- (groans) I'm out of spells because we didn't rest! 
SAM: How? Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: We didn't take a rest. 
SAM: It's the end of the day. 
LAURA: Mm! 
SAM: Use your melee combat. 
LAURA: Hell yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh so hard. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Let me throw a barrel at it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Unarmed strike. 
LAURA: Okay, if I do, oh, I don't want to drop my Reiloran! 
MATT: Flurry of Flicks. 
LIAM: Flurry of Nos. 
SAM: Can't the Reiloran attack? 
LAURA: Well, with the fucking Mind Spike! Okay. Are they close to Laudna now, or are they still back five feet? 
MATT: No, they've closed the gap. 
LAURA: They've closed in again? 
MATT: So, they're all, Laudna's up against the wall on the table right now, and sitting on the edge, and they've fully swarmed her around the sides. 
TALIESIN: I miss nightclubs. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: I am going to come up-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Hold on, let me see what I can do. I've never done this. 
TALIESIN: I love this so much. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Save her! 
MARISHA: I've never done this? 
TRAVIS: Nuke it. 
SAM: If you need some time-- 
TRAVIS: Nuke Castle Whitestone. I was supposed to read that this combat-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: -- is brought to you by WizKids Minis. Join forces with the Mighty Nein to take on the terrifying Uk'otoa. 
TALIESIN, MARISHA, TRAVIS: Uk'otoa. 
SAM: Order this behemoth today. Expand your collection of Critical Role miniatures at WizKids.io/CRMinis and your local game store. How about now, Laura? 
LAURA: Okay. (laughter) 
LIAM: Eight more of those sponsors. 
LAURA: I'm going to step up, so I'm within five feet of the ghosts. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to reach out my hands, and I'm going to say: Leave her alone. My entire body is going to start to crackle, and from under my dress, you're going to see light start to light up and flare all up my face-- 
SAM: Whoa. 
LAURA: -- down my arms and my legs. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
LIAM: Lightning titties. 
MARISHA: Hot. 
LAURA: Lightning titties! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (claps hands) 
MARISHA: Lightning titties! 
SAM: Is that an official spell? 
MATT: It's 5th-level. 
LAURA: That's the spell, It's Lightning Titties is the name of it. 
TRAVIS: Pew, pew-pew! (laughter) 
LAURA: Okay-- 
TRAVIS: Caleb's Produce Flame-- 
LAURA: -- I'm going to-- anything-- 
MATT: -- and Imogen's Lightning Titties. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: -- anything that moves within five feet of me-- 
SAM: Temult's Titties. 
LAURA: -- for the first time on a turn, or ends a turn, is going to take damage. But I'm going to use my action to create a line of lightning that comes out of me, that's 15 feet long-- 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
LAURA: -- so I can get two of them, I imagine. 
MATT: You can get two of them, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay, there's one that's still on death's door, or is he gone? 
MATT: There's one still on death's door, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to aim for that one, and the middle one. 
LIAM: Died 50 years ago. 
MATT: Okay, you've got it. 
LAURA: Okay, and they have to make a dexterity saving throw. 
MATT: Dexterity save. Four and 11. 
LAURA: Then they both take 4d8 lightning damage. 
MATT: They do. 
TRAVIS: Roll high! 
LAURA: Roll high! 
TRAVIS: 32! 
SAM: Oh god! 
LAURA: Okay, goodbye, bye. 
SAM: That one's gone forever. 
TRAVIS: This is our chance, run! (laughter) 
LIAM: Here, here you go. 
LAURA: Be free! (laughs) 
LIAM: It's going to be-- 
LAURA: La la la! Why? Okay, okay, 10. 
LIAM: Yes, it's a mix. 
LAURA: 15, 15 points of lightning damage to each of them. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: It's like it's exactly-- 
MATT: So, one of them (crackles) gets shocked, and drifts halfway into the ground for a second, while the other one, Laudna, the one that's been hounding you since the beginning, the first one that appeared, as it's barely holding on, it's going, "Murderer, why? Why," as it reaches for you, this energy burns its spirit away as it, "(gasps) Why-hy-hy," and it's gone. 
TRAVIS: Cool, cool. 
LAURA: As it disappears, I'm going to look across, and see your face. It's okay. 
MARISHA: (sighs) (groans) And I unleash my attacks. 
MATT: Indeed, it's your turn. 
LAURA: Siv is gone. 
TRAVIS: But you're killing him-- 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Bye, Siv. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Ah! 
SAM: Sivaana. 
TALIESIN: Thank god you only killed three people-- 
LAURA: Sivaana. 
SAM: Sivaana. 
TALIESIN: So this is really-- 
MARISHA: I'm going to unleash some Eldritch Blasts! 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MARISHA: All three, let's go! Okay, the first one is going to be 29. 
MATT: 29 hits. 
MARISHA: 22. 
MATT: Hits, are these all at the same one, or--? 
MARISHA: We'll do two on the one that looks-- 
MATT: The one that she hit with lightning already? 
MARISHA: No, two on the one that looks the most untouched-- 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Then this last one, 18 on the one that she already hit. 
MATT: They all hit. 
MARISHA: Okay. That's going to be a d10 plus five on each of those, so for the one that I'm hitting two with, ooh. 15, 23 damage. 
MATT: 23 damage on the first two hits? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Then-- 
MATT: It's looking real rough. 
MARISHA: On the last one, eight damage, on the one that she already hit. 
MATT: Eight damage. Yep, that one's also looking real rough. Both of them are. (ghastly gasps) 
MARISHA: Quicken Spell. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: Doing it again. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Eldritch Blast. 
SAM: El-- 
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast. 
ALL: ("southern" drawls) Eldritch Blast! 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: Is it a natural 20? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Two natural 20s. 
LAURA: No way! 
MATT: Jesus! 
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Dang! Boof, boof! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: And a 10. 
TRAVIS: (robotic inhale) (explosion) 
MARISHA: So, that's 31, 31, 21. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LIAM: Probably you're incinerated. 
LAURA: I think-- 
MATT: I think those all hit, go ahead and roll damage. 
MARISHA: Okay, so for the two nat 20s-- 
ASHLEY: Let's go. 
MARISHA: Just enraged and confused, okay, so that's a 10 for the first one, so that's 25-- 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: -- damage. 
SAM: Damn. 
MARISHA: Then for the second one, not as good, rolled a two, four, plus another five. So, that's nine. 
MATT: It's a nine. All right, and the damage to the third one? 
MARISHA: That's two nat 20s, and then on the third one is going to be another 10 for 15 damage. 
SAM: Damn. 
ASHLEY: Whoo! 
MATT: How do you want to do this? 
ALL: Yes! 
MATT: On both of them. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Excise the demons. 
MARISHA: I mean, she's just confused and angry, but you see her lean in a little bit to be exactly who these ghosts think that she is, and it's almost like a piece of Delilah comes out as she says: You wouldn't dare! As she annihilates them. 
MATT: Okay, both the spirits (whooshes). And vanish. The bright central sunlight that lights this chamber seems to reach everywhere but around Laudna, as the shape of shadow that frames her seems to stand stalwart against the light. In that quiet, the absence of those aggressive spirits, you hear, "Alexander, Tethany, Vincent. All kind servants of the castle, all very useful subjects." And all of you hear this. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
LAURA: Where is she? 
MATT: A voice that has not been heard since you once traveled in the Shadow Realm to save your friend. 
TALIESIN: Define all. 
MATT: I mean, all three in the chamber. 
TALIESIN: Okay, but I was just double checking. 
LAURA: Where is she? 
MATT: You see the shadow shape of-- 
LAURA: It's just coming from-- 
MATT: It just seems to be coming from Laudna. 
MARISHA: I don't know what to do. 
MATT: "It's interesting, you found part of my old additions to the castle grounds." 
MARISHA: You hear her? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: You hear her, too? 
MATT: "A place to keep Sylas to rest." 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
MATT: "A place to experiment in the name of the Whispered One. Ah, so many memories here. It's nice to see it again." 
MARISHA: What am I to you? 
MATT: "(scoffs)" 
MARISHA: Are there more like me? 
MATT: "There are none like you." 
MARISHA: So I'm your last material thread to this world. 
MATT: "As I am yours." 
MARISHA: What do you mean? 
MATT: "Dear, you've been dead for quite some time. I'm all that keeps you here." 
MARISHA: (shouts) You're lying! 
MATT: "Am I? We are bound, you and I. So let us put aside these strange and unnecessary quabbles, and instead, maybe do some great things together. I'm sure you have many questions. Well, what is it you wish to know?" 
SAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: What are you after? 
MATT: "Hmm. I wish nothing more than to see history come to its natural close. I want to outlive this world. I want to uncover its mysteries, and keep them to myself, and my love. What's so wrong with that?" 
MARISHA: (sighs) You may live to see the day then, unless you help us defeat Predathos. 
MATT: "(laughs) I do not push against your goals. Truth be told, our interests are quite aligned. I lent you my gifts because you need them, and I need you. I should hope that offers you some solace. Hmm. Truth be told, the one I-- The one I received my gifts from has little to gain from the destruction of the gods. I gave up everything to create one." 
LAURA: Did it work? 
MATT: "It did, in a way." 
MARISHA: Created one what? 
LAURA: A god. 
MARISHA: A god? 
MATT: "His power's through you as well." 
MARISHA: The Whispered One. 
MATT: "His shadows run deep, and while he may be biding his time, his tendrils lie in every shadow of this realm. He, I do not wish to see that taken by the enemy of ancient insolence, so, we are aligned." 
MARISHA: And if he goes away, the Whispered One? 
MATT: "So do we." 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: I knew it. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MARISHA: It seems you have a lot more at stake. So, help me. 
MATT: "I am." 
MARISHA: More, you've barely spoken to me in months! 
MATT: "I need you to give me more." You feel that hunger, that (pulses) inside. You recall the stone you shattered on the ship. You recall the soul you took from Bor'Dor. You recall that need to devour. "I can help you, but you need to give me more." 
ASHLEY: More what? 
MATT: "Life. Power." 
MARISHA: To what end? What if I grant you all he power you need? Then what? 
MATT: "Then I endure." 
MARISHA: Can you leave me? Become your own form again, your own soul separate from mine? 
MATT: "Perhaps. But we have a long road ahead to get there, don't we?" 
MARISHA: What would you do if that wish was granted? 
MATT: "Find a way to bring him back." The shadow looks beyond, and you can see on the far end on the opposite end of this laboratory, there's another door, previously hidden in shadow, now lit by the bending light that glistens from the center of the chamber. 
MARISHA: What do you know of Ludinus? 
MATT: "I know very little beyond what you do. We had passing formalities in my youth in Wildemount, but at the time I had little interest in the politics of snooty high mages. I wish I had paid more attention, had I known what was ahead. But what I do know is everyone was aware of how dangerous he could be, conniving. No one wields a smile like him, and all the nobles knew it." 
MARISHA: Now what? 
MATT: "Well--" 
MARISHA: You've tortured so many. So many souls obviously still here. People hate me because of you. 
MATT: "People--" 
MARISHA: I'm a victim. 
MATT: "-- hate that which they cannot be. The weak-willed and fateless accept death. But we endure." 
MARISHA: I didn't choose this! 
MATT: "No, but fate's a fickle mistress, isn't she? 
LAURA: You're a lying bitch. 
MATT: She's just silent. 
ASHLEY: For the record, I don't think fate is that fickle. 
MATT: The shadow seems to lean in towards you and you feel yourself being pulled in with the lean a bit. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. 
MATT: "You bear a brimming darkness paired with impulse that intrigues me, Fearne. Old shadows linger in your blood with the essence of the red moon. In time, I sense you could become something terrible and gorgeous, a malevolent marriage between multiple realms. I can see in your eyes that you have glimpsed it, too." You have flash memories of looking through a mirror, looking through time and possible futures at a dark reflection of yourself. "Embrace it, Fearne. It might be the only way to succeed at this." 
ASHLEY: I don't have to listen to you. 
MATT: "No. But those who didn't are dead." 
ASHLEY: Well, I killed you once. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: I can do it again and again and again. 
MATT: "It hasn't stopped me yet. For she'd have to die to truly destroy me. And you wouldn't do that, would you?" 
MARISHA: Don't listen to her. Don't let her get in your head. 
MATT: "And you, you are something beyond terrestrial power. A child of the god eater. Faith itself fears you, and rightly so. No one can know the limits to what you are capable of. What will happen to you should you find out? How exciting." 
LAURA: It is exciting. 
MATT: "Well, one like you would normally draw the eyes of the gods. You are anathema to them. You might be the one to choose the future of our world if your mother doesn't make that choice for you." 
MARISHA: Shut up. 
MATT: "Before you." 
LAURA: It's all right, Laudna. I don't trust her. She can't affect me. 
MATT: "Things are strange. Strange times call for strange bedfellows. I understand your malice. Believe me, I'm used to it. I've spent a lifetime thriving on it, an afterlife enduring and holding onto it. But we need each other. So, think about it. I'm always here." (wispy dissipating) The shadows vanish. 
LAURA: Always. There's got to be a way. There's got to be a way to break it. You can't-- You can't be stuck with her forever. You can't-- We'll find a way. She's not more powerful than the gods. 
MARISHA: I'm not so sure. 
LAURA: She's not! She's not a god. 
MARISHA: She created one. 
LAURA: Barely. You heard her say it. He's not even a real one. He slithers around, hides in the shadows. 
ASHLEY: He's got to whisper and stuff. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Can't even be loud. 
LAURA: You think if we don't save the gods from Predathos that they'll want to pay us back in some way? Somebody's got to be able to do something. There's got to be a god that's more powerful than her, that can put things right. 
ASHLEY: We killed her already and you were fine. So, I think she's lying. 
MARISHA: I'm not so sure if she was ever gone. 
LAURA: She wasn't gone. 
MARISHA: Diminished maybe. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: She's always here. 
MARISHA: But there. 
LAURA: I mean she's listening to us right now. 
MARISHA: She is. She's always listening. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: But I've already said, I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary. 
LAURA: I don't accept it, Laudna. Not from you. 
MARISHA: She said so herself. I've been dead. Imogen, listen to me. I need you to make me a promise right now, with Fearne as our witness. If anything happens to me, the biggest honor that you can serve to me is to move on and to be happy. To live. To live! I am quite literally a dead end. Just promise me. And if anything happens and I become her little puppet, I trust you to make the right choice. This is nothing we need to worry about right now. We have bigger fish to fry, and a wok to deliver to FCG to fry those fish. 
LAURA: (laughs) I'm going to take your hands. I promise. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: But I also promise I'm going to do everything in my power to make that not happen. You understand that, right? Fearne said: Fate, we're not sealed one way or another. There's got to be a way. 
MARISHA: I can accept that. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: This is a thing now, right? Because I think I just realized you guys maybe-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Is this an official thing? Because you said: Move on, be happy. So I just am making an assumption here. 
MARISHA: Oh yes. 
LAURA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: I'm really excited. 
MARISHA: Oh, thank you. 
ASHLEY: That's really something I've really wanted for you. 
MARISHA: She makes me so happy. 
ASHLEY: I can tell. 
MARISHA: It's so ironic that I've had literally nothing to live for until two years ago, and now this bitch is like-- Blah! (mocking babbles) 
LAURA: It's really kind of fucked now to realize that she's just here all the time and just hanging out with us. 
ASHLEY: Listen, we can fix this. We can fix this, okay? 
MARISHA: It's all right. 
ASHLEY: We can fix fate and time and it's going to be fine. 
MARISHA: We have the power right now. She knows that. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (louder) I know you know that. So. I don't see any harm in playing by her rules because it's my game. 
LAURA: Well, I've never been so sure about saving the gods until now. 
MARISHA: (sighs) It's ironic. I'm not even a religious person and yet somehow I'm entangled in some whispery fuck's destiny. It's strange knowing that a bunch of buffoons such as us, the thin veil keeping the gods alive. 
LAURA: (exhales) (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It is pretty hilarious. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah, they're fucked. We should go to bed. 
MARISHA: I got my answers. Also, just for good measure, I turn around and I flip this table. 
MATT: (laughs) (table clattering) 
MARISHA: Pick up a beaker and throw it across the room. 
MATT: (glass shatters) 
MARISHA: (sighs) Do I see anything, any journals, notebooks, anything that looks like it might be of use? 
MATT: A cursory glance gives you the impression that anything that was found here has already been taken by the de Rolo family and either locked away or destroyed. Anything of use anyway. 
MARISHA: You said there was a door on the other side? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Does it go out to the sewers? Tunnels? 
LAURA: Or was that their bed chamber? Like Sylas? She said something about Sylas anyway. 
MATT: You do know in this room that there are-- 
LIAM: It's a sex room. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: -- other entryways that you took to the tunnels, and you go and check and they're bricked up as well. You get the sense that everything that related to this space was eventually closed off so nobody could just sneak into any entry tunnels once they were discovered by the de Rolo family. The back room, you've been in before. You hadn't thought about it 'til now. But you remember in there, warm decor, nice furniture, beautiful bedspread, and upon it, a singular coffin. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Coffin? 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Is there a body in the coffin? No? 
MARISHA: I don't know, actually. I don't think so, right? 
ASHLEY: We could try to get in there. 
MARISHA: We open the coffin. 
MATT: You go into the chamber? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, you go in. You go in-- (laughter) 
LIAM: (hinges squeaking) 
MARISHA: Yeah, a poltergeist. 
MATT: You go in and all the furniture has been destroyed. 
LIAM: Taliesin? 
MATT: The bed is ruined. The coffin has been torn apart. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah yeah yeah. 
SAM: Oh, that was your memory. 
LAURA: That makes sense 
MATT: That was your memory. 
LAURA: De Rolos would've done that shit. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we never did find it. In Campaign 1. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Nuh-huh. 
ASHLEY: Wait, find the-- 
LAURA: Find the coffin. Find his-- 
TRAVIS: Sylas. 
MARISHA: I'll take, is there even a splinter or a fragment of wood from his coffin? 
MATT: Oh yeah, there's a few of those tattered about and gathered dust and cobwebs. 
LIAM: Cool. 
MARISHA: I pick up a splinter. Give it a good once over, just so Delilah knows. Slip it away, I'll pocket. 
LIAM: (tearing) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: Into my skin. 
SAM: Ugh. 
MARISHA: Well, thank you, my fellow witches for joining me on quite the eventful evening. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Should we burn the table? (chuckling) 
MARISHA: Sure. 
ASHLEY: (fire sizzling) (laughter) 
MATT: Now this chamber is stone, so you very quickly realize that anything of importance here would burn safely. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: So as you wish, as you exit throughout the chamber towards the staircase that led you in, Fearne, you mingle through and ignite each piece-- 
ASHLEY: Burn it to the ground. 
MATT: -- of furniture and cloth around as you all begin to ascend to the stairs. Fearne, like a fire starter just framed from the flames behind. 
MARISHA: That's so hot. The image in my head. That's so cool. 
TALIESIN: ♪ Fire starter ♪ 
MATT: As you follow behind, taking a final moment to step up the stairs, her voice creeps into your mind one last time. "We will work together. I need you to flourish so that I might as well. Bound as we are, I do care for you." 
MARISHA: Let's do terrible and beautiful things. 
MATT: And that's where we'll go to break. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
SAM: Wow. 
TRAVIS: What did that mean? 
SAM: Juicy! 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MARISHA: It's what she says. Delilah said to Fearne. 
TRAVIS: Couture! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Thank you guys for being so patient. That went a whole rabbit hole. 
SAM: We got front row seats. 
TALIESIN: That was gold! Augh! 
LIAM: Great first half. 
SAM: We got front row seats. 
TALIESIN: I am dying. 
LIAM: Best seats on the planet. 
TRAVIS: Those subterranean quarters were (chef's kiss)! 
ASHLEY: Woo wee. 
TALIESIN: Holy shit. 
MATT: All right, We'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up for the rest of the evening or the following day and where it takes us from there. So see you all shortly. (clicks)
LIAM: This bish.

LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. You need this? You probably need this. Ooo so comfy cozy. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. It's the little things in life. This is a lot of stuff you guys. We have so many cool things right now. I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. It's too powerful. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. (adventurous music) 
TALIESIN: Rummaging through the ruins of the Hallowharbor chapter house, the charred remains we've managed to retrieve have been identified as none other than Lightkeeper Draven Kingsley. His bleed-soaked body suggests an abundance of corruption, and evidence suggests containment was the motivation of our unknown arsonist. Perhaps our investigators successfully vanquished the magical phenomena they pursued. Perhaps they fell victim to the terrible forces beyond the Flare. Regardless, we pay our respects to the Circle of Needle & Thread, wherever they may be. Restricted File #1593. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (eerie suspenseful music) 
AABRIA: "You might as well come in. I know you're there. You reek of my favorite flavors." 
GINA: The gods of the sea are fair. Who am I to question a god? (eerie suspenseful music) 
NOSHIR: All right, Professor, let's see it done. This circle is not broken, but it is most certainly bent. 
SAM: I know you want this to be more than just one of your regular missions, but I've stopped trying. 
ASHLY: Not again. You don't get to do this to me again, not without me being here, too. So you can come out, but you're going to play nice. 
LIAM: It is just not an easy burden that Candela bears. We've carried it for centuries. Tide & Bone, keepers of the light. (eerie suspenseful music (ominous music)  
NARRATOR 1: It's actually a really terrible means of escape. NARRATOR 2: For anyone else, sure, but not for Lark! Lark's, you know- NARRATOR 3: She's cool. She's a hunter. NARRATOR 2: She's good at stuff. NARRATOR 3: She's a sorceress, which we mentioned previously. NARRATOR 2: She'll be okay, as long as nothing comes along to disrupt her brilliantly-concocted plan. NARRATOR 3: Nobody, like this burly Adsecla. NARRATOR 2: Like this stupid action-hero guy who has just dropped through the hatch and landed all three-point style on the floor of the mail car, and... Aw, fuck. NARRATOR 3: As he looks up, his hair tosses majestically in the glowy blue light. NARRATOR 1: From Lark's perspective, it's not very majestic. It's hateful. We don't want to see that hair. We don't want to see this guy. NARRATOR 2: What, does this guy use conditioner? NARRATOR 3: She needs to put a stop to this right now and she's got a gun to do it. (epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music)

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So as the witches had their unique sub-castle excursion and return to an evening's rest, is there any other business before you sleep for the evening and finally bring a long rest to you? 
TALIESIN: So we're all getting together and we're going to go rob the basement, right? 
SAM: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: I don't have anything for the night, but I have a morning scenelet, if we go to sleep. 
MATT: Sure, sure. 
MARISHA and LAURA: A scenelet? 
TALIESIN: No pooping on Percy's desk. 
MATT: Scenelet, I like it. 
LIAM: Well, not a full act. 
MARISHA: Is this a new thing? 
TRAVIS: Scene-let? 
MARISHA: Just a scenelet? 
LAURA: A scenelet? 
LIAM: Just a scenelet. 
MATT: It's more of a sketch. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. Well, if anybody has anything? To a point of discomfort, possibly, sleep does eventually come. 
LIAM: Long rest. 
ASHLEY: Oh god. 
MATT: Eventually, the morning does welcome you. 
LIAM: Get those spells, Imogen. 
MATT: Sore but rested, necessarily. 
TRAVIS: I got it. 
MATT: You complete a long rest. 
TRAVIS: No problem. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: The ticker is strong. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You're my hero. 
TRAVIS: Start rolling with disadvantage to spice it up. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Another century down. 
TRAVIS: It's fine. 
LAURA: (laughs) Jesus. 
TRAVIS: Two is not the-- 
MATT: Why are you like this? 
TALIESIN: Actually, if you have a point of exhaustion, I mean-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. 
LIAM: Me and that weasel, we just won't die. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm just saying. Two and two makes-- Fuck it. (laughs) 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: All right. Orym, the morning is yours. 
LIAM: I would say, in the room that Fearne and Orym are in, Fearne, as you wake up, Orym is doing handstand pushups-- 
ASHLEY: (yawns) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yes! Good. 
LIAM: -- but he's not doing it against a wall. He's just doing it in the center of the room with nothing to prop him up. 
TRAVIS: Excellent. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Good morning. 
LIAM: Oh, good morning. 
SAM: Naked. 
LIAM: Hey. (laughter) 
LIAM: He is in his chonies. (laughter) 
LIAM: He's in his undies. 
TRAVIS: Elephant trunk. (laughter) 
LIAM: He is in his Ren Faire undies. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Good morning. 
ASHLEY: Good morning. How are you doing? 
LIAM: I'm all right. How was your adventure last night? 
ASHLEY: Oh boy. There is so much to tell you all. A lot happened. We met some ghosts and possibly-- Well, I don't feel like this is my story to tell, so I'll let Laudna tell it later. But it was a really interesting, fun evening. 
LIAM: Let's actually-- 
ASHLEY: What did you get up to? 
SAM: Insight check. 
LIAM: Hold on. Oh, it's so low. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
LIAM: Forget it. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: I feel like a drunk girl. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: You ready for the day? Probably got to figure out our next moves. Big moves. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm ready. I-I-I'm ready, as ready as I'll ever be. Are you? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Are you okay? 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm okay. I'm glad you're here. 
ASHLEY: You are? 
LIAM: I've known you longer than the rest. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
LIAM: Yeah. I feel so lucky to have you with me through all of this. It's like you fell out of a hole in the air and into my lap and it's one of the things that I feel most grateful for. 
ASHLEY: Orym! 
LIAM: You know what else I love? I love how much you love all of them. 
ASHLEY: I do. 
LIAM: It's been great watching you blossom into this world. It was just us for a little while, and then with our first group of friends and now the Bells. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: And I just love seeing the family grow. You know what else, Fearne? You know, I look at you and I see love and laughter and magic and mayhem, and I see so much love in you. Watching you embrace them, I don't know, gives me more hope than just about anything does. 
ASHLEY: Orym, that's such a wonderful thing to say. 
LIAM: I got you something. 
ASHLEY: What? 
LIAM: I mean, I stole it. 
ASHLEY: What?! 
LIAM: Well. 
TRAVIS: Wha? 
LIAM: I know that you really-- (sighs) Yeah, you really liked that spyglass you stole from Xandis. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: But I really like Xandis. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know, I know. I felt a little weird about that, too, once we get to know him, and I was like, maybe I shouldn't have done that. But I lost it anyway. 
LIAM: Oh wow. Well, I gave it back to Xandis, but I still feel bad for taking it from you. Anyway-- 
ASHLEY: That's okay. 
LIAM: Anyway, I robbed the dead people on the boat. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LIAM: And I stole you a spyglass. 
ASHLEY: Orym! 
LIAM: (theatrical reveal) 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
SAM: Or-ym! 
LIAM: I mean, Xandis' was nice, but this is a dead person's spyglass. I feel like this has got a little more juice to it. 
ASHLEY: I think this is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. Thank you. 
LIAM: Well, I have really good eyes, so I'll-- 
ASHLEY: I don't, really. 
LIAM: Yeah, well-- 
ASHLEY: At least from far away. 
LIAM: I'll keep an eye on you, and now you can keep an eye on me. 
ASHLEY: Oh. I love you, friend. 
LIAM: I love you, Fearnie. 
ASHLEY: You have so many hands. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's so strange. 
LIAM: Yeah, it's best not to question it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Thank you so much. That means a lot. 
LIAM: Anyway-- 
ASHLEY: I have to confess something to you. There was one time when I said I helped you. I was going to give you some Guidance for something and I lied. I didn't do it 'cause I just was being petty. Which, you know, there's worse things in the world, but I just-- 
LIAM: Yeah, I'll weigh that against all the times that you've saved all of our asses from imminent destruction. It's cool. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: It's cool. Anyway, we're onto the next. 
ASHLEY: Oh, this is a good one. 
LIAM: Here, look at me. Do I look bigger or smaller? 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to keep this on my belt. Thank you. 
LIAM: I don't know if that means that they're going to come after us, but where we're going-- 
ASHLEY: Well, if it does, I'll take care of it. 
LIAM: I figure it doesn't really matter anyway with the train ride we're on. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think there are worse things that we're having to deal with right now. And, you know, if it comes down to it, I can just talk to Captain-- I just totally spaced on his name. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: But I can talk to him and I can work it out. I'm sure he wouldn't mind that I have his spyglass. 
LIAM: I grab her by the pinky. Come on, I want to hear this story from the ladies. 
ASHLEY: Yes, let's-- 
LIAM: And then we got to go figure out-- 
ASHLEY: Wait 'til you hear. 
LIAM: Figure out what we're doing. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. 
MATT: Okay? 
TRAVIS: The crimson waterfall. 
LIAM: That's it. Scenelet done. 
SAM: That's how we end scenes now? 
LIAM: Yeah, scenelet done. 
SAM: That's it. Scene over. 
MATT: That's it. Done. 
MARISHA: And scene. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: As you awaken-- 
TRAVIS: Fin. 
SAM: Do you need a cigarette? 
ASHLEY: No. (chuckles) 
MATT: The cold temperature of the evening-- 
MARISHA: It's snowing? 
LIAM: It's snowing in Whitestone? 
MATT: It is. 
TALIESIN: As it should be. 
MATT: A fresh snow is falling in the morning hours of Whitestone. 
TRAVIS: (Santa/Gurge ho-ho-hos) What? (laughter) 
SAM: Ho, ho, ho. 
MARISHA: Now, time for Chetney's trauma. 
MATT: But you all wake up and gather and find each other. What would you like to do? 
LAURA: And that's how we fought some ghosts. 
ASHLEY: It was wild. 
SAM: Wow, that is a crazy story. Oh, Chetney just got here. Start from the beginning again. 
TRAVIS: What happened? 
ASHLEY: No, I lost my voice telling it. I can't tell it again. 
TRAVIS: I don't believe any of it, not a word. It was just the three of you? 
MARISHA: That's toxic behavior. 
TRAVIS: Likely story. 
MARISHA: All right, well, I don't need to convince you, I guess. 
TRAVIS: I had crazy dreams last night as well. 
SAM: Oh yeah? What were yours? 
MARISHA: Maybe it was the ghosts. 
TRAVIS: It was amazing. I imagined that me and Lady de Rolo, we had an affair. 
SAM: What? 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: It was spicy. She came down and she was like, "I can't resist. I can't help myself around you. All this wood, it's just a far superior crafting material." 
SAM: Lower your voice. What if they overhear? They could banish us from the kingdom. 
TRAVIS: I understand-- 
TALIESIN: You have to find the thing would actually poison a person, someone during a dinner. Just putting that out there. 
TRAVIS: I'm immune to poison. 
LIAM: Chet, I don't know. (laughs) Lady de Rolo seems-- 
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's true. 
LIAM: -- way out of your league. Maybe in another time or place it would work out. 
TRAVIS: Out of my league? 
SAM: She also seems a little bit cold. And you're a very sexual dynamo, aren't you? 
TRAVIS: Thank you, FCG. That's true. 
SAM: She's stoic and rigid. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I guess. (sighs) I am good at getting rigid materials to bend to my will, though. I've got plenty of, yeah. 
MARISHA: (uncertain noises) Sounds like a dream. 
TRAVIS: Damn, those ghosts changed you a lot. (laughter) 
LIAM: I have a question. So you melted bricks, stonework, to go through? 
ASHLEY: Um. Yeah, I don't really know how it worked. I just kind of just pushed and then it just kind of melted away. 
LAURA: It was really-- 
LIAM: Right, right, right, right. But when you left, did you melt it together like fudge swirl ice cream, or--? 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LIAM: Or did you just leave it open? 
LAURA: That is a really good point. 
TALIESIN: Or just move the piece to cover it? 
TRAVIS: Wait, wait. You didn't reseal the wall? 
MARISHA: We also-- 
LAURA: No. 
MARISHA: -- broke a lot of glass and then set the room on fire, so. 
LAURA: Yeah, I think they're going to know somebody was in there. 
TRAVIS: Why are we worried about me and the Lady de Rolo affair? Y'all are getting us kicked out, stat. 
TALIESIN: You did put the bookcase back, though, right? 
MARISHA: Yes, of course. 
LAURA: If they question it, we can say, they know that you had a history with her. If anything happens, we just say, you know, you were wanting some closure. 
LIAM: They're not going to figure it out today. They're going to figure it out in eight months. 
TALIESIN: When was the last time anybody was in that room? You said it was dust. Like a layer of dust. 
TRAVIS: So you left tracks and stuff? 
LAURA: Yeah. Well, y-y-yeah. 
MARISHA: Look, it was-- 
TRAVIS: Holy shit, you guys. 
MARISHA: It was dark. We were distracted. 
LAURA: Traumatized, I think, is the word. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. We put the bookcase back. 
LAURA: Yeah, we did that and shut the door. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Sounds fine. 
ASHLEY: We shut the door. 
TALIESIN: I'm sure there's no scrape on the ground for where the bookcase moved. You know what? I applaud your plan. I think it was a great thing to do. I would have done it. 
MARISHA: Look at all these kids running around. 
LAURA: It could have been any of them. 
MARISHA: They'll clearly blame it on Gwendolyn, so she'll take the fall. It'll be fine. 
TALIESIN: So untrustworthy. 
TRAVIS: You're going to let the kids be the scapegoat? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Oh yes. There's no consequences for them. They're children. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's the way that works. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: They don't have money. There's no consequences. It'll be fine. 
MARISHA: No real consequences. 
TRAVIS: Totally, yeah. Open holes in walls. Broken glass everywhere. 
MARISHA: Yes, but she'll get grounded for an evening. 
TRAVIS: Old necrotic laboratories. It'll be fine. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LIAM: Is the de Rolo family like "Succession" eventually? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: God, I hope so. 
ASHLEY: Wow. I hope so. 
MATT: That's the spinoff series I want to make. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Well, now what? It's cold outside. Are we going sledding? 
TALIESIN: What's sledding? 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: You've never been sledding? Oh my god, I need to make you a toboggan. Holy shit. I'll be back. 
TALIESIN: Sledding? That's not a thing that would've-- 
SAM: You're just going to go make a toboggan. 
MATT: Not in your area of Marquet. 
TRAVIS: Yep, I'm gone. 
TALIESIN: No. 
SAM: Okay, great. 
TRAVIS: You hear in the distance a (wooden impacts). 
LIAM: But we've got a wok-- Oh. 
TRAVIS: (wooden impacts) I'm just cutting up some nice piece of wood furniture. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: In the mountainous peaks of the Taloned Highlands on the south side of Marquet, there are snow-capped mountains and a place where sledding does happen, but you've never been there. 
TALIESIN: I don't think I would've been, yeah. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
SAM: Today's the day, huh? We're going to go to the moon? 
MARISHA: We need to check in with Lady Allura. 
LIAM: We're going to talk with the elders again. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: They seem like-- 
MARISHA: Percy was going to make a distraction of some sort. 
TRAVIS: (sawing) 
MARISHA: My armoire. (laughter) 
SAM: Who was that? 
MARISHA: Clearly, Vex'ahlia. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Okay, okay. (laughter) 
LIAM: Clearly. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I love the notion that you're making sleds out of something very-- (laughter) 
SAM: (exaggerated posh) My armoire. 
ASHLEY, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: (similarly) My armoire. 
LIAM: Oh! 
SAM: It's me, Vex. 
TRAVIS: How dare! 
LAURA: Imogen and Laudna are done. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: Darling. 
SAM: (Mrs. Doubtfire) Hellooo! 
TRAVIS: Intra-campaign breakup. 
TALIESIN: This is the last chill day. This is the last that we're going to have before everything goes some sort of well, some sort of bad. Let's just have a moment to be. Just a moment, not all day, just to be, I don't know, normal. 
LAURA: I don't see how we can be normal, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Hm, I do. 
LIAM: I think Ashton's right. I think we should go sledding before we go in. 
TRAVIS: Speak of the devil and he shall appear! I come out with the side of an armoire. It's got two holes drilled in. I pulled off a piece of tapestry and ran it through so you could hold onto that bitch like reins. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You sit on this and you go for a ride. 
TALIESIN: How dangerous is that? 
LIAM: I mean, I know-- 
ASHLEY: Very. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, yes. 
TRAVIS: It depends on gravity. 
LIAM: I know what you mean, but this is going to pick up speed and probably not slow down again, so. 
TRAVIS: It usually goes pretty fast until it evens out. Oh, this. 
TALIESIN: The metaphor stands, though. It's good. Before a big job, back when the Nobodies were running, we would always get a little trashed, have a good time, remind ourselves that we all like each other, or at least love each other if we don't like each other. Because, you know, it's going to be rough and people are going to do stupid shit and you're going to have to remember not to murder them. 
TRAVIS: It's also good to have a little fun before the darkness, right, so you remember what you're fighting for. 
LIAM: That's what we're saying, yeah. 
TALIESIN: (aggressive exhale of agreement) 
SAM: What are you fighting for, Chet? Just out of curiosity. 
TRAVIS: Well, I feel like I'm setting records over here. I've never made this much of a difference before, which is great. Plus, I keep meeting really, really powerful people. So on the other side of this, I feel like my commission works are going to be through the roof. 
SAM: You're just trying to get more-- 
TRAVIS: Clientele placement, essentially, yes. 
SAM: Is that true? 
TRAVIS: Well, that, and I want to go to the fucking moon. 
SAM: Well, I know that, but, like, why? I was thinking about this earlier. Like you said, Ashton, we're about to go do this crazy thing and we don't even really-- Some of us, it doesn't feel like we know why. I know why I'm going, and I think I know why a couple of you are going, but I don't know why you're doing this. No offense intended, I just-- We're going to have to rely on each other up there a lot, and I just want to make sure that we're all open with each other before we go. 
TRAVIS: That's fair. I do have one thing. I'm pretty old. 
SAM: We knew that. 
TRAVIS: Well, you wouldn't know it by looking at me, but I'm pretty old. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: It's been on my mind before that, you know, sometimes after you're gone, you're not really sure what people are going to remember you by. And the toys are great. It's what I love. And I love leaving things in people's homes that they might admire and that will last far longer than I will. But this is an opportunity to make a difference, to have people remember my name, where I came from, and who I was a part of. That feels like legacy. So for me, it's a little bit of a dipping my toes in the pool of immortality, so to speak. 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: That and the moon of it all. 
LIAM: Moon stuff. 
TALIESIN: Moon stuff. 
TRAVIS: Moon stuff. 
SAM: That's actually pretty noble. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
SAM: I mean, it's a little selfish, but in a good way. You want to be remembered for doing something good to the world. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I think a little selfish is good, personally. I'll say I treasured every fucking toy I had growing up. I'm positive you didn't make any of them. They were not wood. 
TRAVIS: Quality? 
TALIESIN: There was really no wood involved. 
TRAVIS: It's okay. 
TALIESIN: But people have been impressed. I mean, you know, that changes people. That's cool. That's fucking cool. 
TRAVIS: It is selfish. You're right. 
SAM: No, no. In a good way. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think it's because I've done so much selfish. This one feels like, you know, I'm doing it for me and other people. 
SAM: That's-- 
TRAVIS: Growth. 
SAM: That's growth. That's an evolution, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: If you-- You know, some of us might not come back from up there. Would you feel like, even if we didn't succeed or if you don't come back, it was worth it? 
TRAVIS: No. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (grunt of agreement) 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can't fucking lose. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: If we do, I'll hate all of you. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: I mean, if everybody else dies but me and I'm left on the moon, we haven't discussed this, but what the fuck am I going to do up there? There's no wood on the moon. Right? 
ASHLEY: You could make a home-- 
TALIESIN: That you know of. 
ASHLEY: -- for yourself up there. 
LAURA: I mean, there might be wood on the moon. 
TRAVIS: Do you see trees when you look up at the moon at night? 
SAM: She sees a whole city, doesn't she? 
TALIESIN: She can see it. 
LAURA: I saw grass and-- 
SAM: Have you seen wood? 
MATT: You saw forms of flora. 
LAURA: Animals. I saw forms of flora. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What kind of flora? 
LAURA: Moon flora. 
TALIESIN: Great band name. 
TRAVIS: Wait, moon wood? 
MARISHA: Moon wood. 
LIAM: Maybe. 
LAURA: Wood that you've never-- 
TRAVIS: I'm going to need more than a maybe. 
LAURA: -- even dreamed of. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. Dip into your dreams, sister. Right now. 
LAURA: Wood like you've never seen before. 
TRAVIS: Now I feel like you're just fucking with me. 
LAURA: Rich... thick wood. (laughter) 
SAM: Yeah. 
SAM: I've seen her dreams, too. 
LAURA: Hard wood. 
SAM: It was long, thick, knotty. 
LIAM: Turgid. 
TALIESIN: Turgid. So turgid. 
ASHLEY: So turgid, so knotty. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Veiny. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: A veiny, triumphant bastard. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Veins of wood. 
TALIESIN: Redwood, for a red moon. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: There's nothing like-- 
ASHLEY: Tough like a cypress. 
TRAVIS: Well then, that just adds to it then. 
MARISHA: Sometimes I hear you get the best wood once you go across the Bloody Bridge. 
SAM and LAURA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh no! 
LAURA: No! 
LIAM: You immediately shamed yourself! 
TALIESIN: That's two! That's two in like a week. Wow! 
TRAVIS: Drink up, Matt. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's all you! 
ASHLEY: I'm clapping for that one. 
MATT: It's nowhere near alcoholic enough. 
TRAVIS: Drink up! (laughter) 
SAM: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: I mean, I think it's a big upside for you. It's just one small step for a gnome, but one giant leap for toy makers. 
TALIESIN: Or the children of the moon. They might have kids up there. 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Great Alan Parsons song, by the way. 
TALIESIN: Hmm? 
MATT: Nothing. 
TALIESIN: No, right. Well, that's fair. 
LIAM: There's really just two responses to what's going on. You either step up and deal with it or shove your head in the sand, kiss your ass goodbye. It seems pretty clear to me. 
SAM: Yeah? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Well, why are you going? I mean, I know that you want to protect your Voice of the Tempest and stuff, but-- 
LIAM: It's beyond that, Letters. 
SAM: Well? 
LIAM: We don't know what's going to happen to any inch of this world if Predathos is unleashed. Yeah, this started with my husband and my father. It's so much bigger than that. If my life can secure the lives of everyone who comes after us, well spent. 
SAM: Yeah? What about you, yourself? What's the happy ending for you? 
LIAM: Tomorrow. That there be a tomorrow, and spending time with you. All of you. I'm so grateful to have you in my life now, in this moment, when everything's going to shit. Do I wish I had my husband back? Yeah, every day. Every day. But he'd want me to live and he'd want me to fight. Not for my city, for all cities. 
SAM: He sounds like a really great guy. 
LIAM: So are you! 
SAM: Oh. Thanks. 
LAURA: Did you just-- 
LIAM: Yeah. I let one rip. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's like two feet lower, though. We don't-- 
LIAM: -- anything, Imogen. 
TRAVIS: It's the nerves. 
TALIESIN: It's just ankle. We don't-- 
SAM: We're just riffing it today. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Hot air rises, Ashton. 
TRAVIS: Who knew Whitestone was at altitude. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes, it is an altitude thing. 
TALIESIN: Cold air. Well-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Altitude. 
TALIESIN: Someone complimented you and said they love you and you said: Thanks. 
SAM: It's easier than deflecting, I've found, if you just say: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Holy shit. 
SAM: Was that progress? Is that good? 
TALIESIN: Oh, I mean honestly, I'm kind of shocked. 
MARISHA: Wait, it's easier than deflecting, but do you believe it? Do you accept it? 
SAM: Oh, I don't know about that. 
MARISHA: There's two different things we're talking about here. 
SAM: (unconvincingly) I guess. I mean, I'm starting to feel like I'm part of the team, you know, and part of a weird little family here. 
TALIESIN: You never weren't. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: You're looking at six people who want you here. 
LAURA: If we didn't want you here, would we have gotten you... Laudna. Would we have gotten you-- 
MARISHA: (gasps) Oh, yes. 
SAM: What? 
MARISHA: When we were on our excursions last night-- 
SAM: Oh god. 
MARISHA: -- we got you-- 
SAM: You didn't. 
MARISHA: -- a little gift. Now, you can't flash this around because we stole it from this building that we're currently in. But. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Give it a little twirl. This copper wok. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: A copper wok? 
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah. It matches your color scheme. 
SAM: Wow! A wok! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Like a-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's a wok. These are really nice. And look-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: The char on the bottom? 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: That's where the flavor comes from. 
SAM: It's already pre-seasoned. 
ASHLEY: Already pre-seasoned. 
LAURA: Because now you don't have to bake fish inside of you. 
TALIESIN: That was the look my dad gave my Christmas present in 1984. 
LAURA: You can cook it in a wok. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Then you don't have to smell all the food. 
MARISHA: You don't have to-- 
SAM: I was just going to eat this. But you're saying I can use this. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: No, no, no! Use it to cook. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: Don't put fish inside of you anymore. Put it in the wok. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: This can't fit in me, though. 
ASHLEY: You don't need to. You can do it on the outside of your body. 
MARISHA: Yes. You put it over flame. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: It's a whole new kind of cooking. 
MARISHA: Look how well oiled this thing is. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: You can do it at the same time, you know? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we hate to shut down your fishy hot hole, but you know. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Maybe just another option. 
ASHLEY: It's just that when we follow you, it's a very strong smell. 
TALIESIN: That's true. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: You know, and when you wheel around, it follows. 
LIAM: It's acquired. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I wish I could smell, but I can't. 
LAURA: I might just-- Hold on. Can you just open it up? 
SAM: (panel whirs open) 
LAURA: Prestidigitation. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. Good, good. 
LAURA: Did it clear it out? 
MARISHA: Your name is Fresh Cut Grass. 
TRAVIS: Jet spray. 
SAM: Yes. 
TRAVIS: (water spraying) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Don't try to be anyone else. 
SAM: Oh, I see, I see. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: What a walk around there. 
ASHLEY: Maybe just bake in there and then you'll smell like-- 
TALIESIN: Not yet. 
ASHLEY: -- baking. 
TALIESIN: But bake after a couple cleanings. We've got to degrease. We have to do a whole thing to make it ready for baking so it doesn't smell. 
SAM: Okay. Okay. This is really thoughtful of you. Thank you for stealing me a wok. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: You know what else you can do with that thing? 
SAM: What? 
LIAM: Go sledding. 
LAURA and SAM: (gasp) 
TALIESIN: What? 
SAM: Let's go do it! I know it's metal, but maybe we can have a race. 
TRAVIS: So are you. 
SAM: Wood versus metal. 
TRAVIS: There are some exceptions to the rule. 
SAM: Aw, that's very sweet. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Chet, do you have any kind of grease or liniment or anything that we can lube it up with? It'll make it go faster. 
TRAVIS: Let's say no. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: A little Old English. 
LIAM: You've got eight tubes of Bengay. 
TRAVIS: I know! It's Tiger Balm, okay? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I live or die by this shit. 
TALIESIN: I have a hooded lantern, which means that there is oil. It's flammable, but there's oil in that lantern. 
LIAM: Should be okay on snow. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: (laughs) All right, so as you exit the castle grounds, it's not a thick layer, but a soft enough powder along the various hills that run down from the sides of the castle that you could either find a handful of functional spaces within the city or ride down-- 
TRAVIS: Stairs. 
MATT: (laughs) There are some stairs that lead out of the castle. 
LIAM: (clunky bumping) 
MATT: Then there is the cobblestone path that curves as it heads down from the big hill the castle's on. 
LIAM: Because the castle's up high, right? 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: So it is not the safest path, but there are some very sleddable declines along that curved downturn. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Nothing like some fresh pow'. 
ASHLEY: Fresh pow'! 
MATT and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY and LIAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: You'd know. 
MATT: So as you walk out in the morning, as the city itself is coming to life, you can see the various chimneys letting off their trails of black smoke, the Sun Tree itself carrying now this gentle layer of white that's starting to build atop its massive canopy. You can see-- 
TRAVIS: Canope. (laughs) 
MATT: Canopah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Can-oh-pah. 
LIAM: Can-oo-pee. 
MATT: (muffled) Canopy. (light laughter) 
MATT: You can see the people of Whitestone scattering about and the various Pale Guards that are stationed on the outside of the castle that acknowledge you as you pass and then turn curiously as they notice you carrying a sled and a wok. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Official Whitestone business. (laughs) (laughter) 
MATT: Shortly thereafter, watching all of you begin to sled down the side of this hill. Who's going first? 
SAM: I'll go. I'll go in the wok. Who's going in the toboggan? 
TRAVIS: I'll ride the wood. I need a second. 
TALIESIN: I need to see how this works. 
TRAVIS: Orym? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Let's do this. 
LIAM: Oh! Oh, I thought you meant you needed a second of time. 
TRAVIS: No, I need a copilot! 
SAM: Oh, I thought so, too. 
LIAM: I'm your man. 
ASHLEY: Copilot. 
TRAVIS: Sometimes you need a rudder for this shit. So if it starts going tits up-- 
TALIESIN: Letters, do you need a copilot? 
TRAVIS: -- throw your foot out the back and steer, okay? 
SAM: I think I do. I need somebody to steer us. Maybe with your hammer, you could be our rudder or something. 
TALIESIN: That's insane. I'm into it. 
TRAVIS: That's an enormous wok. 
MATT: So this wok, This wok is-- 
MARISHA: Look, he's immediately questioning it. 
MATT: It's about that big. 
SAM: He can sit in the wok and maybe I'll go on the front with my wheel. I'll hold on the front. 
TRAVIS: This so doesn't have a chance. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: "Christmas Vacation." 
TALIESIN: I was just going to-- Okay, either that or I was going to hang on and use my-- 
SAM: You go on the wok. You need it, because I can just be on a wheel. 
LIAM: We can do what we did in that race where you're the front. 
SAM: Yeah, exactly. I'll be the front. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I don't want to make it unsafe, but you know, we do have really slippery shit. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, the oil. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Slickshimmer oil. (laughs) 
SAM: Wow, we should use a few drops of that. 
LIAM: It is "Christmas Vacation." 
SAM: (sled crashes) 
TRAVIS: We only have one bottle of it. Maybe we'll save it. 
LAURA: No, let's save it. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We'll save that for a special occasion. 
MATT: Well here, the two first sledding crew, for a number of sledding excursions you make upon this setup on the outside of the Castle Whitestone, I would like to have who is within the sleds make either an athletics or acrobatics check. 
LIAM: I got this. 
MATT: If they fail, their second can attempt one with disadvantage to see if they can pick it up. 
TRAVIS: Imogen. Can you go down and make surprise mogul bumps down there? 
ASHLEY: Oh yes. Give them some jumps? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, just pat-- 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Jumps? 
LAURA: I'll walk weirdly down the hill and-- 
TALIESIN: What the fuck does jumps mean? 
TRAVIS: I was thinking she could fly down, but okay. 
LAURA: -- use Telekinesis to pat some. 
MATT: Easy enough to do. 
LAURA: I don't want to touch the snow, it's too cold. 
TALIESIN: This is new. I hate new. Okay. 
LIAM: My athletics is insane! What are you doing? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LIAM: Let's go, Team Chorym. 
TALIESIN: You ready? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
SAM: Oh, that's you, buddy. Guidance. 
TALIESIN: Oh, Guidance? 
SAM: Guidance. 
LAURA: I'm going to take my bandana off and hold it up in the air. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. "Grease." 
SAM: It's a drag race. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Are you guys ready? 
TALIESIN: Yep. I just rolled, so. 
LAURA: Ready? 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: 16. 
MATT: 16. Okay. 
LIAM: We're doing acrobatics? 
MATT: Or athletics, you're choice. 
LIAM: Or? I'll do acrobatics. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's 27. 
SAM and ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to need a push here. 
SAM: A second? 
TALIESIN: I need a second. 
SAM: The second can go? 
TALIESIN: Disadvantage. 
MATT: You can have disadvantage and try and beat what he rolled. 
SAM: Oh boy. In acrobatics or athletics? There's no way I can do that even if I rolled a 20. 
MATT: So roll for it, if you want to. 
LIAM: I'm also going to-- 
MATT: It can only go downhill from here. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
LIAM: -- keep tooting out Gust behind us as we go. 
TRAVIS: I chiseled in "Buck Fucket" into the toboggan. (laughter) 
SAM: I got a five. (laughs) 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: With disadvantage? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Wipeout, I assume. 
MARISHA: Holy shit. 
MATT: All right, so you cruise down rapidly, turning the side, sending a spray off and you come upon the jump that you had created, the Prestidigitation. Just as you're finishing it, you hear this (sharp sliding) it comes faster than you expect. You barely back out of the way as you careen into it off into this wide, beautiful high arc-- 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
MATT: -- going over the exterior wall of Whitestone. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: End up slamming into the cobblestone, It's now snow covered floors and start skidding into the city street proper. 
ASHLEY: 10 out of 10! 
MATT: People who are out doing their business are (screams) ducking out of the way. You're trying to control this rapidly. You acquired a little too much speed and did this too well. 
LIAM: (zooming) Hey, Imogen! (laughter) 
MATT: But eventually you come to a stop as a cart that is right in your path, you have to put out your hands and legs. 
LIAM: I'm starting to Gust in the opposite direction now. 
MATT: Slow in time and catch the top of it before you end up skidding underneath into the axle and catch yourself, spraining your arms a little bit, but come to a stop. You can't help yourself just laughing as everyone around you is like, "What the fuck?!" 
LIAM: Sorry! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Is it just us? 
TRAVIS: I'm frozen on your back like Lloyd in "Dumb and Dumber." 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That was epic. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. (laughter) 
LIAM: We ran out of snow. Where are the other two? 
MATT: You turn around and see two pairs of legs sticking out of the pile of snow. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
SAM: (muffled) Will someone help? 
TRAVIS: Wood prevails. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: So your wooden legs were out? 
SAM: Yes. We'll say that my wooden legs were out. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I crawl out and I pull and flip. 
MATT: That's true, it is a set of wheels, yeah. 
TALIESIN: That was amazing. 
SAM: Well, maybe it cooks better than it sleds. 
TALIESIN: Again! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Grabbing it. 
MATT: All right. You spend a portion of the morning sledding a bit and enjoying. You can see, it gives a burst of inspiration to some of the local kids who start gathering their sleds and cookware. (laughs) 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: Which rapidly the parents pull away, "That is extremely dangerous. Do not do that." Do not do that. But rest of the morning is yours. Is there anything else you'd like to do? 
LIAM: Just as we leave, I called some of the kids and say: You're never too old for fun and games. Make time for it! 
MATT: They both look at each other. "Okay, old man!" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: They smoke their cigarette. 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Old man?! 
SAM: Wow. 
TALIESIN: What the fuck is that about? I find a rock and start packing it in a snowball. 
SAM: No! Don't-- Ashton! 
LAURA: Ashton! 
TRAVIS: Oh, are you packing it? 
TALIESIN: We're fucking-- 
TRAVIS: You're loading it up? Oh man! 
ASHLEY: Let's go, let's go! 
SAM: They're innocent kids! 
MATT: The kids go running immediately. "(scared yell)" Scatter off into the streets. 
TALIESIN: Respect your fucking elders. 
TRAVIS: That's a street snowball right there. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: That's some serious stuff. 
LIAM: It's cool. I'm six inches shorter and I have a boy band face, so I'm fine. (laughter) 
SAM: All right. Should we go up and see if-- We made some requests for some items and stuff, right? We should go check? 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: All right. 
MATT: Returning to the castle, approaching the Pale Guard, there isn't yet some sort of a gathering of folks, but someone does note that Allura was looking to arrive midday to early afternoon to catch you and help set you on your way to whatever end that might be. You also know that, or it was noted, likely there would be a small war room gathering when Cassandra de Rolo is to arrive today as well from Westruun. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: But you have time. Anything in the city you want to do? Or we can just skip ahead. 
LAURA: When everybody else goes out, can I hang back in the town a little bit? 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: Is there anywhere around that seems like a temple to the Dawnfather? He's the guy in this city, right? 
MATT: Oh yeah. There is a temple to the Dawnfather over near the east side graveyard. 
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to wander over to that. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Is there a Matron temple over there, too? 
LIAM: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that's right. 
MATT: But they're both on opposing sides of that region. 
LIAM: We crawled into a coffin. 
TALIESIN: That's right. 
MATT: As you wander off, the forest path that leads you there is even more beautiful in the snowfall. This late morning time, you can see some of the birds are still out singing, though the colder weather has thinned out some of the more vibrant wildlife. Then as you approach the exterior of the graves you can see the bits of snow that's gathered on them. The whole area just feels a little more serene. Indeed, on the far northern end of it, you can see the structure that represents the temple of the Dawnfather here within Whitestone. The stained glass windows, the closed double front doors the high roof that the emblazoned symbol of the sun sits at its precipice. 
LAURA: I'll walk up to the doors and put my hand on it. I don't know what to do here. I go to open the door. Does it open? 
MATT: It opens. 
LAURA: I peek in. 
MATT: You step inside and it's both nice and humble. It's not a massive temple by any means, but it definitely can seat among the pews a solid hundred or so people, compacted but functionally. You can see there's eight sets of long pew benches. Throughout the entry walkway, there's small chairs on the side. You can see the light that's coming through the stained glass, though muted due to the current weather, it still gives a nice multicolored glow on the edges of the chamber. The carpet that leads up to the pulpit and the risen dais, where there looks to be an altar with a closed book on it. There are two robed figures that are currently in conversation, sitting in chairs towards the front. As you open the door and the creak echoes in the quiet, you can hear them whisper-talking. They both stop and look over in your direction. 
LAURA: Hi. 
MATT: They look at each other. One of them gets up and begins continuing to gather. It looks like they're essentially cleaning up or organizing the space while the other, in these bright white robes that carry all manner of gold and red and silver adornments begins to approach. You see this is an older woman, probably in her 70s or so, hair is thinning a bit, and it's gray and silver, but bearing this gentle smile. The wrinkles on her forehead have fallen to close her eyes, almost to the point where she has these little perpetually smiled curves where you assume the pupils are lost somewhere in the shadow. But there's this perpetual welcoming smile that she wears as she steps towards you. "Hello, my dear." 
LAURA: Hi. 
MATT: "What brings you to the light of the Dawnfather this morning?" 
LAURA: How do I talk to a god? 
MATT: "Well, right here. You sit and commune your emotions and give yourself into the light of the Dawnfather. His lordship will look over you and--" 
LAURA: Yeah, but no. How, really? Does he really listen? I mean, because we both know things are a little weird right now, right? 
MATT: "He's always listening." 
LAURA: How do you know? 
MATT: "Have you ever prayed before?" 
LAURA: Officially? No. I did try to talk to some moon goddess or something once, but I don't think-- she didn't respond or nothing. 
MATT: "The miracle of faith demands a sort of trust. In time, with piety, with intent, perhaps you might be granted a vision. It is rare, but the gods work in all sorts of strange ways. In the little miracles. In the gifts that come unexpected. In the warmth that keeps you in the coldest of night. In the luck that feeds your family when you've lost the ability to keep them. In the communities that rally around you. All these are the small miracles. If you stay around, sometimes the real miracles present themselves as well." 
LAURA: That's what I need. Real ones. 
MATT: "Then you're on the right path. You've begun your journey." 
LAURA: Do I just speak his name and try talking, or what? Do I have to give him something? 
MATT: "You don't have to, but alms for the temple to help maintain a place of worship, and gifts upon the altar to his majesty also help establish a connection of faith." 
LAURA: What does he like? 
MATT: "That depends on what's important to you, really. Coin is good for the temple, but to him? Things that represent importance, of bright color. Crafts made with passion. Things that represent maintenance in creation. A snip from a garden you keep. A sweater that has grown too small for your children. There are many things. But it's the meaning more than it is the specific object, really." 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: "That's what faith is." 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MATT: "Of course. You're welcome to look upon the altar for inspiration if you'd like." 
LAURA: Yeah. I'll do that. 
MATT: "Well. Dawnfather watch over you, and if you require anything, just let me know." 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, you as well. 
MATT: "Thank you. What is your name, my dear, by the way?" 
LAURA: Imogen. 
MATT: "Imogen. I am Mother Brazilda. It is a pleasure. If you need anything, I'll be right over here." 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: She scoots back up and sits down and brings a bowl of strawberries over and starts eating quietly with a happy face. 
LAURA: I don't have a lot of shit that's important to me. (laughs) I'm going to look in my bags and see if I've got anything. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: My "Whitestone is for lovers" T-shirt. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
LAURA: I set it on the temple. I know that seems stupid, but, I mean, it's one of the only things I have. Um... I don't know how to talk to you. I'm sure you know that-- I mean, I assume you know. I don't know, maybe you can't see anything right now. I hope you know that we're trying to fix things for y'all. And I don't know. If everything goes right, then hopefully you'll have the power to help us in return. I'm not looking to make any deals. I know that's not something you're supposed to do with gods. But, I could really use your help with her, because I know that you're more powerful. I know you are. I guess I could call that faith. I don't have anything that's important to me, really. So anyway, I'm going to try real hard to help you. I don't know. Thanks. I'm going to get up and walk out. 
MATT: Okay. You leave the door slightly ajar as you exit back out into the graveyard. As you glance up across the way, you immediately see the cold, stone, snow-dappled statue of the Matron of Ravens looming over what looks to be some feather-clad stone figure. A cold, visual image of death, whatever that means to you. You hear the call of a raven as it takes off from the top of the statue and the gentle snowfall. 
LAURA: I don't accept it. I head back. 
MATT: Okay. Anybody else? 
LIAM: Minor business. 
MATT: Yeah? 
LIAM: Is there a Glorious Goods branch here or any kind of shop that has any kind of magical gear or anything? 
MATT: There is an expansion of the Gilmore's Glorious Goods shop, yes. 
TALIESIN: In the gallery. The mall. 
LIAM: In the gallery mall? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you know. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: They're galleries. 
SAM: There's a galleria here? 
TALIESIN: There's a galleria. 
LAURA: A galleria. 
LIAM: I just want a-- I just want a healing potion so I can help people in a pinch-- 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: -- if that's possible. 
MATT: Yeah. The person who's currently-- Let's see. Sorry, I'm bringing up my notes here. Yes, all right. So there is, I guess, a sort of familiar face, a half-elf gentleman in his mid 30s, previously introduced himself as Jerry, who is the purveyor of the shop, at least at these hours, in the stead of Gilmore who is not present at this particular expansion branch. But the man, as you walk up, is in the process of opening the shop in the late afternoon. You caught him as he was stepping up to the front. With a scarf over his shoulders, he turns over to you. 
LIAM: Oh, hey, morning. 
MATT: "Good morning." 
LIAM: Are you closing, opening? I'm sorry. 
MATT: "We're opening at the moment, yeah." 
LIAM: Oh, great. Well, I'll follow you in, if that's all right. 
MATT: "Okay. Sure. It's a little sparse at the moment. We've been picked a little clean by the Lordship and everything." 
LIAM: I'm just looking for a little triage med help sort of thing. 
MATT: "Sure, sure, yeah." 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "Good luck." He opens the door and you come inside. Indeed, the walls are kind of bare. You do know that in times of conflict it's not uncommon for powers to conscript what's available to the front lines, to soldiers who are undergoing dangerous scenarios, and to help those who have already been hurt, and veterans of this conflict in the early days. But as you glance in, you can see there were things that had probably been on the walls for a long time that left a mark there that are now missing. Jerry steps to the back and takes his scarf off and turns it and wraps it up. "As far as healing potions go, we're a little light, but we've got three basic ones that I can probably get to you." 
LIAM: Sure, sure, yeah. We're doing a bit of business for the Lord and Lady up top, and more, really, but-- 
MATT: "They might be a better source than we are at the moment." 
LIAM: Well, I'm happy to kick in myself, if you have it, if you could spare it. 
MATT: "Well, I'll pull out a price." He starts rummaging through some supply cabinets and such, and you can see all manner of small component pouches and gathered herbs and odd flecks of metal dust that are falling out of small pouches. He shakes them out and listens in. Eventually, he pulls from different sources three different shaped, different sized vials. It looks like they're leftovers from other larger sets of healing potions and these were the dregs that got left behind or didn't have a matching set when they were sold. But he presents them and slides to the front. 
LIAM: Ah. What will each of those run me? 
MATT: "150 gold for the lot." 
LIAM: 150 for the lot? Oh, I'll take all three. Sure, thank you. You know, I've met the man whose name is on the shop. I hope he's well. 
MATT: "He's well. He's just busy working at the main branch, trying to keep things going for the Tal'Dorei Council in the middle of all this, so." 
LIAM: I bet. 
MATT: He slides these forward there. Oh god. 
LIAM: Oh, spilled all over me. 
MARISHA: Spilling. 
MATT: "Oh god, you know--" 
MARISHA: Literal gold. 
TALIESIN: Lick it up. 
MATT: "100 for the two, I guess. Ah jeez." 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: "Don't tell him." No. 
LIAM: Appreciate it. My friends will, too, I think. 
MATT: He goes and puts on his work purple robe and the gold trim at this point. His goatee is now kind of grown out into a tuft at the bottom of his chin. 
TRAVIS: You're missing your pieces of a flair. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: Puts his pins in. 
LAURA: Are they all supposed to look like Gilmore when they work there? That would be amazing. 
MATT: Look, what's the point of franchising if you're not going to have a continuous theme? 
LIAM: Out of just the briefest curiosity, is there anything on the walls in here left or is it empty-empty? 
MATT: You can make a perception check. 
LIAM: I will make a perception check with advantage. 
LAURA: I'm hungry. 
LIAM: That is a natural 20. So that gets me to 31. Yeah, 31. 
MATT: You glance around. While there's nothing on the shelves, you have a slight feeling. Because sometimes, especially when things are being pushed around, things fall through the cracks. You glance behind one of the cabinets and you see one long, thin crystal vial of some kind that has this unique glass texture on the outside of it that seems to have tumbled off of the display platform and has fallen behind it against the wall, and is lost in the shadow. You can see spiderwebs have grown off of it and it's just been lost. 
LIAM: Ooh. Little things sometimes get overlooked. Do you know what this is? 
MATT: "W-w-what are you talking about? What is that?" 
LIAM: I found it. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I found it between, over here. It got dropped. 
MATT: "Uh." He goes and pulls up a book and starts going through the pages. "Yeah, yeah, it did. We're just not going to talk about that or tell anyone that you found that." 
LIAM: Oh, is this big trouble? 
MATT: "It's not trouble. I've just already accounted for it as lost. Stolen, specifically, and--" 
LIAM: What are we talking about here? 
MATT: "We're talking about, I'm just trying to make sure that I don't get in trouble for mislabeling where that went. So you want to buy it?" 
LIAM: If I have the coin. What is it and how much does it cost? 
MATT: "It's a potion of heroism." 
LAURA: What is he doing? 
MARISHA: So he labeled it as a lost product. 
SAM: He's an honest boy. 
MARISHA: It's LP. Let it go. Works for retail businesses. 
TRAVIS: Give in to your dark side, you motherfucker. 
SAM: I don't know what LP is. 
MARISHA: Lost product. 
SAM: I've never had a job. 
MATT: "So it will enable you a little bit of extra luck and a little bit of extra verve for about an hour or so. I'll tell you what. We don't mention this up the chain at all, and I'll give it to you for solid 200 gold. How about that?" 
LIAM: Well, I'll tell you what. I have 199. Is that enough? 
MATT: Make a persuasion roll. (laughs) 
MARISHA: What a Boy Scout! 
TRAVIS: Got to roll a two or higher. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
LIAM: All right, what am I doing, persuasion? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: 23. 
MATT: Yeah. "Deal." 
LIAM: Okay, would you say hi to the boss for me? 
MATT: "I will say hi and that--" 
LIAM: My name's Orym. 
MATT: "-- Orym, right, I should know your name, yeah. Okay, yeah, I'll pass it on." (laughter) 
MATT: "No worries." 
TRAVIS: I should know your name. (laughs) 
MATT: "Thanks for coming. I'm going to go make some tea." 
TALIESIN: Kid's going to pocket every quarter of that. 
MARISHA: Huh? 
TALIESIN: The kid's pocketing every quarter of that, and-- 
MARISHA: 100%! 
TALIESIN: -- getting himself a Rexxentrove Switch or something, I don't know, but. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: I appreciate it. So, I have just a little bit of coin left. Can you point me towards the Slayer's Cake? 
MATT: "Slayer's Cake--" 
LIAM: I saw it once the last time I was here, but I can't, I get turned around on the streets. 
MATT: "Yeah, two blocks down that way." 
LAURA: I like that he says he has coin left after he said-- 
MATT: "If you want to see the large latticed windows out front--" 
LAURA: "This is all I have." 
MATT: "So you can see there's a sign." 
LIAM: That was the end of my gold. Cool, so, I don't know what you said, Matt, because Laura was like the devil in my ear. 
LAURA: Sorry, I was giving him shit. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: He gave you directions. 
LIAM: Great, off I go. (laughter) 
LIAM: To buy, and we don't have to, I just want some pastry for the meeting. 
MATT: Oh yeah, easy enough to do. The Slayer's Cake is open. There is two young Whitestone locals that are running the morning shift here. 
LAURA: Two young, white locals. 
MATT: You can see one of them is in the back, and the smell immediately hits you as you enter, that beautiful smell of fresh baked goods, the sweets and spices of it all hits you. It's a warm interior. You can see there's an older man who's hunched over this open wooden box that carries the morning batch that's been partially sold. He's slowly going over each one, and smelling it, and putting it back. You can see the open oven in the back. The young man's in the process of putting in a new batch, and the girl at the front is patiently sighing, as the old man looks through before looking over her shoulder over towards you, and you can see this young human girl, couldn't be that much past 20, mousey brown hair, it's pulled back in a bow that goes past her shoulders, and she wears the apron, and a simple blouse, and looks up. "Morning, can I help you?" 
LIAM: Morning, yeah, I need 50 pastries for a small gathering. 
MATT: "50 pastries, how soon?" 
LIAM: Yeah, well-- 
MATT: "Tomorrow, week from?" 
LIAM: Would-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: Oh. Right now. Do you have anything on hand? Muffins? 
MATT: "Simon?" 
LIAM: Scones? 
MARISHA: Simon. 
MATT: "We're going to have to double team!" 
SAM: Simon? 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
LAURA: Oh, Simon, was he the old guy, Simon? 
MARISHA: (squeaky mumbles) 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to a gathering, and I wanted to bring something for the people, and I wanted one apple pie. 
MARISHA: It was a different Simon. 
LIAM: And that's for me. 
MATT: "Well, you, okay, how soon?" 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: As soon as you can-- as soon as possible. 
MATT: "50, give us a couple hours." 
TALIESIN: You don't have a watch. 
MATT: "We have one order we're finishing up, and then we should have that ready, boy, about, say, hour past noon?" 
LIAM: Okay, all right, I'll be back. 
MATT: "All right, all right, you, pay first." 
SAM: Just have them delivered. 
LIAM: For sure, for sure. 
MARISHA: Have it delivered! For sure, you can bring it up to the-- Go away! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: (coos) 
LAURA: Just five pigeons landed. 
LIAM: Go away. (laughter) 
LIAM: Yeah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! (hand thumping) Yeah, you can bring it up, (laughter) 
LIAM: I leave, this should cover it, I leave my last coin, which is an Electrum piece, and say, if you could bring all of that up to the castle, and say that they're for Orym, and for the-- say they're for Allura Vysoren. 
MATT: You drop that Electrum piece, and she goes, and then looks up at you, having to blink, like she just missed the last few words you said, and goes, "Oh..." 
LIAM: It was an apple pie-- 
MATT: "For the, for the castle?" 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: "Right, right, oh, yes, we'll get right on it." 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: "Thank you, I appreciate your patronage. We'll give you quite a batch. And Roger, you got to leave. Off the pot or pick your meal." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) The old guy's, "I'm almost there. Is this earl gray tea flavor?" She kind of, "I am so sorry," turns him around, and pushes him out, and just lets him have it. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Let's take it. 
MATT: "All right, afternoon, we'll have it for you, thank you." 
LIAM: Oh, I got to get out of here, the smells are too good, and it's driving me crazy. I'll see you up top. 
MATT: "All right, all right." 
LIAM: Okay. Thank you. 
TALIESIN: Probably he hasn't had his morning constitution yet. 
LAURA: (coos) Grab one for the road. (coos) 
ASHLEY: ♪ Morning constitutional ♪ 
LAURA: (laughs) (coos) 
LIAM: (brr) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: What's everyone else doing? 
TALIESIN: Do you want to join for a walk? 
ASHLEY: Oh sure. 
TALIESIN: All right. Figured I'd take a look around. I actually, I have two places I want to see, and I haven't decided. I'm trying to figure out which one we should look at. They're both interesting. There's apparently some old abandoned ruins to the east. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: Which, I love a good ruin. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Then there's apparently a crazy-ass clock tower, which I saw in passing, but-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: -- it's, yeah, it's called the Heart of Whitestone, and I don't know, we could do one, we could do the other, we could try and, they're not too far away from each other. 
ASHLEY: Well, my vote would be the clock tower, because that sounds a little interesting. 
TALIESIN: Let's do the clock tower. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. You have walked past this each time you've come through, but you haven't taken a period of time to really take in the details of this clock tower that looms over the north side of the city. It climbs up intricately. You can see the merger of wood and metalwork, and sculptures, beautiful little statues, and reliefs all throughout as it rises up. Mostly stationary, but occasionally you can hear the whirring of all manner of gears, and clockwork within. Occasionally, you can notice that elements are slowly shifting different layers, like a massive display. All these intricate little dioramas that are built into it of people, and things, and moments in time. A lot of love went into this, ostentatious as it might be in places. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: This is really cool. 
TALIESIN: Do you (sighs) can you imagine being so passionate about your life that you decided to do something this fucking ridiculous? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I would've said no until pretty recently. 
ASHLEY: Well, yeah. I feel like we all could make a pretty interesting clock tower with lots of these little dioramas. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. I've been thinking about it. 
ASHLEY: What have you been thinking about? 
TALIESIN: If everything goes terrible, your Nana's going to miss you so much. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'll miss her, too. Wherever I would go. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: If everything goes terrible, no one's going to miss me. 
ASHLEY: Well, that's not true. 
TALIESIN: It really is. 
ASHLEY: No, it's not. 
TALIESIN: Everybody who would care is going to be right there with me. I mean, that terrible. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you're saying if we all go. 
TALIESIN: If we all go. 
ASHLEY: Well, I think we're going to be okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying not to think too hard about it, but yeah. 
ASHLEY: So, how are you feeling about, oh, you know, the shard that was pulled out of the lava? What do-- 
TALIESIN: You're, sometimes I think you're crazy on a level that I might be crazy on, too. 
ASHLEY: Oh, kind of like a, what did you say? Like you've always wanted a sister. (laughs) Like-- 
TALIESIN: I have always wanted family, and the few times I've tried, it's gone poorly. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: But, and when I mean sister, I mean, clearly, you know, no, you're still hot and otherwise, and definitely, wow-- 
ASHLEY: Oh. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You got it going on, please. 
ASHLEY: I wasn't even talking about that, but-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You were thinking it, you were thinking it loud enough that it was practically vibrating this bench. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TALIESIN: But. 
ASHLEY: My heavens. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I don't know, I trust you. Things are going to happen, and I trust you to help me make the right decision, and I hope you trust me to help make the right decision. 
ASHLEY: I do. I think, if I have any say in it, I do think it should go to you. I don't know if I want it. Also, I don't know, I feel like you're supposed to have those two pieces. I don't know, am I wrong? 
TALIESIN: I'm not supposed to have anything. This is all nuts. This is all fucking stupid. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I was never supposed to have anything, but man, if one of us survives, someone's going to miss me. It's... fuck, you know? 
ASHLEY: Well, I would miss you. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. It's nice to feel love for people. Oh, I love having you here. I love all of them. Oh, we're so fucked, but I'm-- 
ASHLEY: I know, it's a pretty funny group. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: They won't let... they're not going to let me do what needs to be done with that thing. I need you to promise me that we're going to figure out a way to make it happen if we're going to do it. Let's just be... 
ASHLEY: Discreet? 
TALIESIN: I'd like it to be just us, and if it goes bad, try and save my life, please. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Please fucking try. I'm not looking to die, but I trust you to do what needs to be done more than I trust the others. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You're... are you okay with that? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm okay with that. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I don't fully know what that's going to mean, but I will be by your side if you need me there. 
TALIESIN: I think it's going to be only you by my side when we do this. I think it, I just want it to be you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Because-- 
LAURA: Shit. 
TALIESIN: They'll try and stop me, and I don't think you will, from doing something this stupid. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Sorry to put it on you. 
ASHLEY: No, no, I-- That means a lot. But I also want to make sure you're going to be okay. 
TALIESIN: Well, do what you can, and if I'm not okay, it's not your fault. This is, everything has just been better than I ever thought I was going to have. I should-- This time has been, I don't know. I'm still not okay about it, but it's nice having something to lose again. So, hopefully I won't fucking lose it again. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: If something does go wrong, steal all my shit before they know. I don't want them to have a damn thing. 
ASHLEY: I will. 
TALIESIN: It should all be yours. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: And never tell. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Good. Well. (clicks tongue) Okay. Well, I mean, I think you're pretty hot, too, and I'm going to run away. (laughter) (laughter) 
MATT: (claps) 
TALIESIN: Yeah? 
TRAVIS: (cantering) 
ASHLEY: Clop, clop, clop! 
TALIESIN: Still fucking got it, still fucking got it. (laughter) 
SAM: Clip clop, clip clop. 
TALIESIN: I will sit for a minute-- 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: -- and watch as much more of the overblown life of de Rolo and company as possible. 
MATT: Indeed, and you glance up, you can see there's various spheres that shift, and move like the various planes that warp around Exandria that slowly shift and move. Eventually, a bong, bong, bong goes off, and you watch as these shelves begin to emerge. You see a troop of clockwork heroes. You see a massive man with a weird pointy helmet with an axe just doing this. (laughter) 
MATT: You see all manner of other oddly shaped figures. One tiny man on a crudely painted hand that the color has withered with time, or the snow has robbed it a bit of its, you know, purple prestige. But he's doing this, has a tiny little spring voice goes-- (high-pitched scraping) (laughter) 
MATT: It's a wonderful display that then is met on the other side by this other cycle of these different colored dragons. As they collide you're like, oh, it's this shit again, remembering the Taste of Tal'Dorei, and how they've just completely squeezed this moment in time for all its worth. (laughter) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We should do a puppet show. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'll talk to Chetney. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: This is just too fucking much. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Mm, get up and head back. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Unless anyone else has any more business, eventually you gather back at the castle, shortly after an hour or two into noon. There's a bit of a hustle and bustle going as the Pale Guard have gathered, and there's been a bit of a conversation with a new figure you haven't noticed before. A woman in her late 40s, early 50s, darkish brown hair, but a good half or more of it has turned gray across the top like this wide stripe, and on the sides as well, as it pulls past her ears. Human, you immediately can see the resemblance to Lord Percival. As she turns to the rest of you, "Oh, hello. Oh, I've been notified that we have guests in the castle. I assume you're those guests, given the descriptions I was given." 
SAM: We sure are. 
LIAM: Bells Hells, yes-- 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: You have a great castle here, one of the best we've ever stayed in. 
MATT: "Well, wonderful, thank you, I'm Lady Cassandra de Rolo. Were you the ones that sent the baked items?" 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: What baked-- 
LIAM: Ah, yes, I thought we'd think better on a full stomach. 
SAM: Yeah, you bought baked goods? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Is that what you did? 
LIAM: Really? After the talk we had this morning? 
SAM: I'm just saying, that's my only job. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: You do have a few more jobs than that. 
LIAM: You have a few more jobs. 
SAM: (sighs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you have to have a lower baseline before we can really-- 
LIAM: Maybe I want to supply baked goods for the group, for once. 
SAM: I just take, I take a bunch of stuff out of my stomach, and I throw it in the trash. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh no, you shouldn't. (sniffs) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, you're still a little bit-- 
TALIESIN: We're going to get you some baking soda, and you know, a little, you know. 
LIAM: Vinegar. 
MATT: "Well--" 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: "-- nonetheless, I have some things to get to here shortly, but we can go over, we can retrieve everyone else if you're ready to get you on your way." 
LAURA: Oh, yeah. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, this is it. 
MATT: "Very well. If you could retrieve my brother, and who else is nearby? I believe Lady Allura arrived not too long ago. I believe you know the way." She scurries off with some of the Pale Guard. You all are have an escort up to the war room, where as you enter, you can see the baked goods have been set out in the middle of the table. What once was just a very tense round table is now a beautiful display of multicolored, multi-flavored fruit and icing covered muffins, and little croissants, and it's a beautiful series of rapidly put together, but colorful and delicious Slayer's Cake baked goods. There are small, little round cakes, and odd sweet pieces, so, they are at the ready as you need. 
LIAM: Did they remember my requested whole apple pie? 
MATT: Oh, yes. 
LIAM: Okay, I go pick it up and hold it in my lap for the whole meeting. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh god, is that a potato ball? Fuck, I love those. 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: I'm so hungry. 
LIAM: Me too. 
LAURA: That sounds so good. 
ASHLEY: I know, really a potato ball-- 
TALIESIN: Why did you do that? 
ASHLEY: -- sounds really good. 
LIAM: I wish I was holding a whole apple pie in my lap right now. 
TALIESIN: Oh god. Strawberry rhubarb. 
ASHLEY: I want a rhubarb pie. 
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: (gasp) 
TALIESIN: I know! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, it was meant to be. 
MATT: A short time later-- (laughter) 
SAM: As they're talking-- 
TALIESIN: We will fucking talk. 
SAM: -- about the baked goods and stuff, it reminds me, I just refresh someone's memory that I had requested a very elaborate bejeweled baking pan at some point. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right, you had. 
SAM: So, if that's around and ready-- 
MARISHA: It was a chalice. 
SAM: -- that would be great. 
LAURA: Oh, I'm sorry. 
MATT: Indeed. 
LAURA: I was scratching it. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) There's nothing around yet. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: But a short time later, you hear a number of voices from down the hall, and loudly approaching, you recognize three of the voices at least. You see entering the chamber, Cassandra, Lord Percival de Rolo, and indeed Allura Vysoren as well, having a conversation amongst them as they notice. Allura smiles immediately at the arrival. (Allura) "Hello, everyone. Oh, good to see you. I'm glad all is well. (sighs) Are we ready to begin plotting things out then?" 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yes, we are refreshed. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: We had some time outdoors. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TRAVIS: Our bellies are full. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm! Half the pie's gone. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Yeah. I think we're ready to start pitching ideas. 
TALIESIN: How does it go? 
MATT: "Wonderful." She gives a notion to have the Pale Guard bring over a small dark wood chest that's laid on one end of the table. 
LIAM: Constant cardio. 
TALIESIN: Damn! 
MATT: Lord Percival comes over with these two scrolls under his arm and walks with his cane to the other side of the table, and Cassandra takes the third side as you all close in, the doors shut behind you. They move the remaining baked goods off to one side of the table, but each of them take one and begin absentmindedly chewing as they begin laying out some of these papers that Percival had set. 
TALIESIN: So "Twin Peaks." 
MATT: Percival begins. (Percy) "Well, I said that we had quite an, quite a conversation of your intent of breaking into this site and making your way to the moon as--" 
SAM and LAURA: ♪ Makin' my way ♪ 
MATT: "-- strange events are abound. But I have put some mind to a few possible ways to distract and help you get in successfully. One of the big advantages that we have against them is Whitestone's source of residuum, and it seems to be mostly unaffected by the current magical disruption that most of Exandria has been suffering. The second of which is the rarity of those who understand complex machines as well as I do. Thus, there can be a two-pronged approach here." He lays out one sheet of paper that has all these odd schematics and points to a couple. "It was noted that locally, I'll say, the local port here, it was noted by Keyleth that some manner of machines and automaton guardians were present throughout the site. Is this correct?" 
ALL: (mutter agreement) 
MATT: "If one of your team can get close enough to any major mechanical devices on site along the perimeter of this, or manage to scramble one or more of the automatons to cause a ruckus, that would definitely draw attention for those around. And I happen to have, with the aid of Allura here, a couple of things that could come to such a, a ruckus-causing positive outcome," and opens the chest on the side. You can see this really ornery old man suddenly has this Christmas morning sparkle in his eyes. Open up the chest and he pulls out these two small, they look cobbled, haphazard springs and wires and odd little gems and you can see there's levers on the sides. It looks like the inside of a clock, but like someone tried really hard to make it more confusing. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: As he sets them both down. "Now, don't be scared. These were designed to be used by any layman with proper instruction, which is what this is for." He lays on the other sheet of paper, a smaller scroll, and rolls it out and begins to go through a point-by-point description of how these devices can be placed near or within other large bits of mechanical energy-drawing pieces of equipment and/or arcanically-driven machines or automatons and it will temporarily scramble or possibly even destroy some of the internal mechanics of them. There's two of them and only two within the timeframe that was given, but they're passed over to your side of the table as Lord Percival smiles smugly. "They're not perfect, but they'll do in what time we have. Given time, I can refine these, of course. But are any of you at all mechanically inclined?" 
LIAM and TALIESIN: (groan uncertainly) 
SAM: I know a little bit about automatons, yeah. 
MATT: "Perfect. These will both go to you for the time being." 
SAM: All right. 
MATT: "For safe keeping." 
SAM: I'll try not to set them off near me. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (stammers) This is a good question, though. 
LAURA: (stammers mockingly) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I love it so much. 
SAM: Vex, is that you? (laughter) 
SAM: Ooh! 
MARISHA: (stammering) He-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's two. 
TALIESIN: Kept going. 
MARISHA: I just want to add-- I'm just trying to point out-- 
SAM: You have to trigger them. You have to trigger them. 
MARISHA: -- that there's a time element because if he's nearby and they go poof, then that's bad. 
MATT: "If you'd been paying attention to my instructions--" 
MARISHA: I was! 
MATT: "-- indeed there is a timed bit upon which-- You can do it immediately if need be--" 
MARISHA: I'm sorry you-- 
MATT: "-- by this lever here on the right-hand side." 
MARISHA: -- just talk so much. All right, yes. 
MATT: "It's all right, I don't expect everyone to understand." (offended groaning) 
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry. 
SAM: I like him. 
TRAVIS: I have to make a-- Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: "Nevertheless--" 
MARISHA: I have to roll for heart failure. 
MATT: "-- the side with the blue lever--" 
LAURA: Blue lever. 
MATT: "-- for those I believe colors can at least be remembered, is a-- 
MARISHA: What the fuck did I do? 
TRAVIS: (explosion booming) 
MARISHA: What-- what, why? (laughs) 
MATT: "A timed detonation of the device on the blue side." 
LAURA: How long of a timer? 
MATT: "One minute, 60 seconds." 
LIAM: One minute, 60. 
MATT: "For a--" 
MARISHA: One minute and 60-- 
SAM: One minute! 
MARISHA: Two minute? 
MATT: "One minute. 60 seconds." 
ASHLEY: Ah, okay. 
TRAVIS: Two minutes. (laughter) 
MARISHA: So I'm not the only-- that's confusing. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, one minute, 60 seconds. 
SAM: It's very clear to me. I'm picking up what you're laying down. 
MARISHA: Two minutes. 
MATT: "Indeed. On the other side is the silver lever." 
LAURA: Silver lever. 
MATT: "That, when pushed, will immediately detonate it, should there be some sort of an untoward emergency." 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: "Blue, timed, silver, instant." 
SAM: Makes perfect sense. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: "Good." 
SAM: That's the distraction. 
LIAM: And it's for arcane devices. 
SAM: Or mechanical devices. 
LIAM: But also just standard mechanical? 
MATT: "It might destroy mechanical devices. It will scramble arcane devices." 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: "This is for the local usage. For something more broad, and perhaps as you wish to see fit, they can be utilized in tandem, should you know what we're doing, which I believe you might. I discussed this with Lady Allura. We feel a magical onslaught of illusion would be a sound distraction. If their most keen of eye of arcana is indeed away on the moon, the precious moments bought by a false magical attack on a scale that harnesses the weirded nature of the solstice, along with some residuum amplification, could create something to draw their attention en masse for a short period of time, and for that, I believe Allura will be present on the outskirts of this endeavor." 
LIAM: Oh, got it. 
LAURA: So she'll be doing the illusory. 
MATT: She leans in. (Allura) "I have volunteered. I've been in many dangerous situations before, and once again, this is an illusion, I will, if all goes well, not to be near any thick of it." 
TALIESIN: So, if this, so you're going to be able to do, or at least make it seem like you can do shit that you shouldn't be able to do right now. 
MATT: "There have been some places at the various nexus points here in the solstice where some magic is amplified to an astronomical degree." 
TALIESIN: Why the fuck not? 
MATT: "Now, here's the unique thing. There are some things about illusions that are easy to see past, but we've devised here, also at Percival's behest, are preparing a few wagons, carts, constructs we can piece together with what perhaps some of the outskirt outposted armies might be able to provide and fill them with meat." 
SAM: With what? Wheat? 
MATT, TALIESIN, and LIAM: Meat. 
LIAM: Meat. 
LAURA: Meat? 
MATT: "And use the illusion to wrap around some of these devices. Should any of these creatures be assaulted, attacked, or wounded from any of their defensive positions, the illusion could give the appearance of one such creature falling and leave a very real mess behind." (oohing) 
MATT: "Which would, if done properly, at least buy a little more time before the illusion gives up its reality." 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: I like that. That's crazy. 
LAURA: Meat. 
LIAM: So the illusion of a creature with a dead creature within? 
MATT: "Pieces of a dead creatures." 
LIAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: "Bit of tactile just sell the rest if need be." 
LAURA: While that meat illusion is happening, we take the Bloody Bridge? 
MATT: "I believe that's what is the route we discussed, yes." 
LAURA: Okay, all right. 
MARISHA: You also mentioned that you could make sure we're not able to be peeped in on for-- 
MATT: "Oh! Yes, yes." 
MARISHA: -- eight hours or so. 
MATT: "A few things." She reaches into the side of, you can see on the edge of her rope she has this long pouch that has a strap over the shoulder that has a y-strap that goes over the other side and she opens it and she pulls out a number of small vials of different colors and sizes and some scrolls that are wrapped up and says, "All right. First, I have two of these." She hands this out to you. "There are two scrolls of Mass Nondetection. They will provide for a period of time a number of subjects upon it being read, or an object or area of a certain size, and within for eight hours they will be non-detectable by divination of any real kind. So two of those give you windows when you feel they're proper. Consider that. It's the best I could muster in the time that was available to us." 
SAM: Great, fantastic. 
MATT: "Also, you mentioned that you were looking for Ryn, perhaps." 
LIAM: Yes. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: It feels very bonus, extra credit, but yes, we will be on look. 
SAM: Even if-- Yeah, we want to make sure that she's alive or resurrectable. 
MATT: "Well, just in case, here is, you mentioned she was made of stone or turned at the time, so this is a scroll of Greater Restoration--" 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "-- to, in a pinch, should you not have the capability." 
LIAM: This is also for you. 
MATT: "This would be of aid." 
SAM: I do have the capability. 
TRAVIS: Are we being watched right now? 
MATT: You see Allura glances around with a quick watch and her eyes give this deep, blue cerulean color. She looks about, "No, we're all right." 
LAURA: Whoa, she's cool. Do you want to take the healing-- 
SAM: No, I can just do that. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
SAM: I guess that-- 
LAURA: No, I mean, why would you-- 
SAM: Waste the spell if I could just use that? 
LAURA: Yeah, but if it's separated, if we get separated then one person can do it. 
SAM: Someone else can do it. 
MATT: "Depending on the distance that's required to get to the Bloody Bridge from within the site, or if any of you get separated as part of your discussed plan upon entry, who's capable, here is a scroll of Dimension Door that should give somebody who can read it a quick jaunt into--" 
LIAM: Boy, I can't read any of these. 
TALIESIN: Read it sideways. 
TRAVIS: Dimension Door scroll, awesome. 
MATT: "Also--" 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
TRAVIS: A lot of stuff. 
SAM: This is a lot of good stuff. 
MATT: "Well, you're going on quite the journey here and we don't know what to expect, so I wish we had more to our disposal, but much of our supplies were sent to the front lines or were lent to others who were more immediately involved in this conflict, or were lost in the initial one, so, I wish we had more support at our disposal, but we also have to make sure we protect ourselves at home. We also have two more--" [jars sliding] 
MATT: "-- greater healing potions to distribute--" 
SAM: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: (whistling) 
MATT: " -- as well as one superior." 
SAM: Holy bajoli. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Shots. ♪ Shots shots shots shot ♪ 
MATT: "We also have--" 
LAURA: That's a greater. 
MATT: "-- these potions to aid you." She passes over one potion that has a mercurial liquid on the inside. It looks like metal, but it shifts in the interior of it. A potion of speed, should somebody require a quick boost in mobility and avoidance." 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: "And these two." She hands over these two potions of matching, long and thin with a little bulb in the center of the glass it looks like swirling smoke seems to gather, but as you turn it over, you can see it almost congeals into a liquid and it turns into a smoke again, like it's cycling through. "These are two potions of gaseous form." 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: "Could be a good necessary escape in a pinch, or a means for two to infiltrate that which is nigh impossible to infiltrate. So two of those your disposal as well. There was something else." Looks over at Percival and goes, "Yes, right, you required a jeweled--" 
SAM: Muffin pan. 
MATT: "-- muffin pan." 
SAM: Or baking sheet. 
MATT: Snaps his fingers and the Pale Guard come up with this small case and open it up and inside you can see there's a very, very nice solid gold-- 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: -- baking tin. "We've had the finest jewelers of Whitestone up throughout the evening, ensuring that your baking tin would meet your standards. I have some experience with the particular intent of this, with some past history of the incantation of what's required and have made sure that it meets the specifications. Your baking tin." Passes it over to you. 
SAM: Thank you so much. Wow. 
LIAM: Is it the right dimensions for your tum-tum? 
SAM: Let me make sure it fits. Like a glove. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: You have to turn it a little bit to one side. It's a little bit too wide for the opening, but if you angle it, it goes in okay. 
SAM: Amazing. 
LIAM: Laudna, why don't you take this. 
MARISHA: Hmm! Hmm, yes. Okay. 
TALIESIN: I feel like-- 
MARISHA: Then once we're up there, okay, so your distraction happens. It's a success. People are going crazy and then we run through and we go up the Bloody Bridge. 
TRAVIS: Somehow. 
MARISHA: Somehow, by... figuring it out as we go. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We go up the Bloody Bridge and then we scout for whatever information is useful. 
SAM: Are you asking or telling? 
MARISHA: I'm just trying to lay out the plan and making sure we're not missing anything. 
SAM: Yeah, this is a recon mission. We're not supposed to blow anything up. We're not supposed to assassinate anyone-- 
MARISHA: No assassinations. 
SAM: We're just seeing what's there. 
MATT: "Information is extremely, extremely important this time. We don't know what's on the other side." 
MARISHA: If we have an opportunity to assassinate, we shouldn't? 
MATT: Percival goes, "Well, please run with your inspiration, if the moment presides itself, just don't be stupid about it." 
MARISHA: Right. 
LAURA: How long do these scrolls of Mass Nondetection work? 
MATT: Hmm? 
LAURA: How long do the Mass Nondetection, how long does it last? 
MATT: "Eight hours." 
LAURA: That's great. 
LIAM: Where are we touching down? Lady Vysoren, are you our ride? 
MATT: "Oh, you mean to the place?" 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "I believe I must be, if you-- if I'm required as part of this distraction." 
SAM: I mean, we still do have Teleport. We could Teleport there. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: The less we have to spend ourselves, the better, though. 
MATT: "Also--" 
SAM: True. 
MATT: "If that staff is only one use for at a time, in case you arrive at Ruidus and things go wrong quickly, that would be your only means of escaping once you've returned." 
SAM: What would be? The teleporting? 
LAURA: The teleporting. 
SAM: Oh, you think we can teleport from there to here? 
LAURA: I don't see why not. 
MATT: "I imagine you'd have to probably return to the bridge and ride it back to the site." 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: Then from the site out-- 
MATT: "From the site out." 
LIAM: -- is what she was referring to. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can't teleport from the moon here, though? 
TALIESIN: God, I hope not. 
MATT: "I don't think so. We've been unable to teleport there, so. 
LIAM: But we would ride and get out. Okay. 
MARISHA: And you said-- We know the Malleus Key is making magic all jumbly, but then also you said the Reilorans are blocking divine magic? 
MATT: "As far as what we've been told, they seem to have a natural knack for diminishing some of the divine magic's capabilities. It may not be tied to their Ruidian nature." 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
MATT: "But from what we've heard on the front lines, the initial conflicts that have happened on the outskirts of it have led to a number of the support healers in combat unable to keep up with the injuries they're used to dealing with. So be warned." 
MARISHA: Did you hear that, Letters? 
SAM: No, I didn't. 
TRAVIS: It's grim. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Divine magic. 
MARISHA: Your healing might be a little lackluster. 
TRAVIS: A little negated around the Reilorans. 
SAM: Is that a dig against me? Or you mean just more so than normal? 
MARISHA: I'm just stating. I did not say this. You are saying these words-- 
SAM: No, no, no. 
MARISHA: -- that no one said. 
SAM: Well we got lots of potions, though. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: We do. 
TRAVIS: They were just saying around the key, and maybe even on the moon, the nature of the Reilorans, since it's blocked off from divine magics, you might be a little dampered. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: When it comes to healing. 
SAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: Do you have any-- Pardon me. (hums thoughtfully) Do you have any robes-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: -- or anything that we might be able to use from your earlier incursions? We found that disguising ourselves helped a bit. 
TALIESIN: We might also have some old ones, if I recall, but just-- 
MATT: "We have recovered Vanguard robes, though I assume, based on failed attempts to infiltrate, they're likely looking very closely for those who are sneaking their way in these days. So be very careful and particular." 
TALIESIN: Not to be complicated on this, but does everybody have goggles? Does everybody have something to protect their eyes, something to protect their mouth, and maybe a cloak? Especially a red-- Doesn't have to be nice, just-- 
MATT: Cassandra leans in, "Whatever else you require, we can provide here in Whitestone." 
TRAVIS: Awesome. 
TALIESIN: A professional. 
LIAM: Goggles, goggles. 
LAURA: Yeah. Great. 
SAM: All right. 
LAURA: Let's do it. 
SAM: Yeah. Do you all want to do any prep here first? I could make us a thing that we consume and it will protect us some while we're there for 24 hours. 
LAURA: That sounds great. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: Yeah, should we do that first? 
TALIESIN: Or do we do it right after we teleport and sit down and have a minute? 
MATT: "No, we're not teleporting directly into it, I don't think." 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: "We're going to want to assess what the situation is there." 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: Right, and this beef-llusion-- 
LAURA: So you can bake it up while we walk. 
LIAM: -- plan that you have, are we staging that with you, or are we separating from you once we're there? 
MATT: "You're welcome to help." 
SAM: Wok, and bake, and wok. 
MATT: "But based on what we assess there, the time may not be there. If we have time, you're welcome." 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: "But we have some friends who are currently scouting and keeping tabs on the outside of the site, and I believe they will have the supplies necessary based on--" 
LIAM: The meat. Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's a good plan. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Okay. Today then? 
MARISHA: Shall we? 
MATT: "Whenever you're ready." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: I think so. 
TRAVIS: We don't want to funnel vest anything into us before we go? 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, what are y'all doing with that thing? 
TALIESIN: We should take care of that. 
LAURA: I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. 
TRAVIS: Lady Cassandra-- 
SAM: Why do you sound weird? 
MATT: (Cassandra) "Yes?" 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What are you talking about? 
TRAVIS: I couldn't help but notice as we were shredding your pow, that you have lots of woods on the outskirts of Whitestone. Is it pretty tame or are there some crazy beasties out there that you have to keep at bay? 
MATT: "Oh, these woods are extremely cursed." 
TRAVIS: Oh, cursed? 
MATT: "Have been since before our family arrived here, yes." 
TRAVIS: Well, I'm just tossing it out there, a more maligned individual might think to, I don't know, find one of those cursed dangerous creatures and, I don't know, test out the abilities of the harness.
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MARISHA: We have to capture it and then suck out its essence for an hour, right? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, for an hour. 
LIAM: Hour kills it. A minute borrows. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
SAM: I mean, that's a cool idea, but we'd have to go hunting for a day and maybe get something, maybe? 
TALIESIN: It just seems a lot. 
TRAVIS: Trying it for the first time on the moon ain't a fucking bright idea either. 
SAM: No, no, I agree. 
TALIESIN: We've got a workshop here. We've got a place to test and-- 
MARISHA: Are you going to do the sucky-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I think we are. 
MARISHA: -- the shardy thingy? 
TRAVIS: Then again though, to FCG's point-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- we are burning a day, and there is a clock running here. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We're pretty resourceful. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So let's just do this. We've got a lab downstairs, and I don't want to move with that thing. 
TRAVIS: What? What thing? 
LIAM: The nugget. 
LAURA: Do we need to go to a lab for it, or? 
LIAM: The shard. 
TALIESIN: Somewhere where there's-- I don't know, we can do it-- 
LAURA: Can we do it here surrounded by a bunch of magic users that can protect you if something goes bad? 
MATT: "Oh, we can be present if you prefer. In fact, I think--" She looks, and Percival goes, (Percy) "If you're going to use my workshop, then I would like to be present to ensure you don't destroy it." 
TALIESIN: I would-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I completely agree. If there's a place where we could-- I've never had legacy before, and it's new. I'm not getting used to it yet. I'd like just a tiny bit of privacy when we do this. Not so far away that nothing can't be handled, but I just kind of-- I would like to feel safe just for a minute when we do this. 
MATT: "Do you think this will require some space?" 
TALIESIN: I don't think so. 
TRAVIS: Really? 
TALIESIN: I think it's just-- 
ASHLEY: I mean, when you did it with the spoon, I mean, it was a spoon, but-- 
TRAVIS: It was a spoon. This is also a shard of fucking ♪ Hishari power ♪ I feel like a little space might be a good idea. 
TALIESIN: As long as I can think. If that's okay. 
LIAM: Maybe a courtyard? 
ASHLEY: Woods. 
LIAM: A wide open space? 
MATT: (Allura) "Percival--" 
TRAVIS: ♪ Free to make the big mistakes ♪ 
MATT: "-- what do you think is best?" He goes, (Percy) "We don't really understand the nature of this primordial power much. Perhaps not a public place. And I'd like to keep my workshop intact. What do you think, Cassandra?" She crosses her arms. (Cassandra) "Well, if you're one for a place of importance, brother..." She gives him a nudge and he goes, (Percy) "(sighs) Always so dramatic. Come on." 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Are we going (coy mumbles) 
SAM: Oh! Oh! 
ASHLEY: (coy mumbles) 
MATT: Slowly, they lead you to these well-made staircase that descends into these well-carved tunnels that lead beneath the castle. 
MARISHA: Aha! 
TRAVIS: I wasn't even planning on that! 
MARISHA: No, no, that's a twist. 
MATT: That wind and turn for what feels like a mile at least. But everything's well lit and well guarded. Until eventually it opens up into a subterranean chamber that is beautiful. You can see there are all these structures and tables, and you can see there are researchers down here. This is an important chamber that currently sits beneath a cluster of far-reaching roots that twist and grasp at the edges of this massive open area. There beneath it, a pale green glowing structure, like a pyramid, that shines with numerous sources of glowing arcane light. All of you are caught in awe. Except for you, Laudna, who feels a chill run down your spine and you don't know why. 
MARISHA: I'll stay towards the back of the pack. 
ASHLEY: What's that? 
MATT: "That is part of Whitestone history. It's very dangerous. I would be careful upon approach. Be respectful. Don't get it dirty." He begins to walk up the steps, these extensive series of steps. Dozens, 100 steps or more, it's hard to say, but you climb up into the echo space and you can see the researchers off to the side who are stopping and watching as you all ascend. You can see the arrival of not just important people, but let alone a strange gathering of folks to ascend the ziggurat is an odd occurrence. But as you all step up to the top, you can see there are signs of a structure that once sat in the center that has been leveled. In its place instead, there looks like an odd memorial plaque, almost, and just this open platform. 
TRAVIS: I really want to touch the ground-- 
LAURA: Well, this is open. 
TALIESIN: What do you think they used to do up here? 
MARISHA: Dude! 
ASHLEY: Do it. 
MARISHA: You should do it. 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: You know what you would see! 
LAURA: Oh god, yeah. An epic battle. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I might see before the epic battle scene. 
TALIESIN: A very frustrated scientist. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm! 
SAM: So you want privacy? 
TALIESIN: I'd like that. 
SAM: Should we all just turn around or just go to the bottom of the steps? 
TALIESIN: If that'd be okay. 
LIAM: Keeping it to us or keeping it to you? Keeping it to-- 
TALIESIN: Just to us. 
LIAM: Oh. 
LAURA: How do you know that it's going to be safe? I mean-- 
TALIESIN: Well, you'll know if it isn't because you'll hear something terrible. You guys will be close enough, I just-- 
TRAVIS: That's true. Here you go. 
MATT: Percival corrects his glasses, "Just throw another in the historical charts of terrible things that have happened here." 
TRAVIS: Here you go. Harness. 
TALIESIN: I remember how this works. And we have the crystal? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to get you in. I'm not taking it. 
MARISHA: No, you have to take it. 
TALIESIN: No, she's taking it. It's going to be okay. She's just fucking with everybody. It's going to be okay. We talked about this. 
ASHLEY: Okay. It's going to be okay. 
TALIESIN: It is. It's going to be okay. 
MATT: So who's putting the harness on? 
TALIESIN: Can we have some room? I want to talk first. 
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah. We'll just be over here. I'll be keeping Lady Cassandra safe. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: Okay? 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Thank you, Mr. de Rolo. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: I'll be also keeping Lady Cassandra safe. 
TALIESIN: Lord. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I like your town. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "We take much pride in it. And thank you for arriving this time with a sense of manners." 
TALIESIN: It feels old. I like that. 
MATT: "So do I." 
TALIESIN: God, I don't want to like him. 
MATT: (laughs) They all begin to slowly descend the stairs a bit, Allura looking nervously. (Allura) "(sighs)" You see, she casts a spell, and as the glowing runes spin in a circle, you can see it creates this boundary barrier around the central, halfway up the ziggurat. They kind of shimmer. It's almost like a protective bubble. She just stays there halfway down the steps. 
LIAM: The rest of us are descending as well, right? 
LAURA: Are we outside of that bubble? 
MATT: You all just walked out of the bubble as she creates it. 
LAURA: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: They were going to argue. I don't want this to take some time-- 
ASHLEY: No, no, I understand. I understand. 
TALIESIN: I put the machine on the floor. If it starts to get weird, feel free to scream bloody hell. It's okay. Thanks. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you got it. All right, well let's get you in this thing. 
MARISHA: What's happening? 
LAURA: He's taking it. 
TALIESIN: Wait for it. 
LAURA: Both of the shards. 
SAM: He's going to do it himself. 
TALIESIN: Let's go, quick. I start wrapping the thing on me as quick as possible. 
MARISHA: You're going to die. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Only one way to find out. 
TALIESIN: Let's do it. 
LIAM: It's a good place for it. 
ASHLEY: I know, I'm getting nervous. 
TALIESIN: They're noticing. 
ASHLEY: What if you die? What if you explode? 
TALIESIN: Well, that'll be a story, won't it? Fuck it. 
SAM: Lots of people-- 
TALIESIN: Do it. 
ASHLEY: I don't know. I don't know. 
SAM: Lots of people are super powerful. Very close. 
MARISHA: (scoffs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but if something happens? 
SAM: It'll be okay. 
TALIESIN: Well, you know, shit happens. I'm looking to see if anyone is freaking out about this at this point. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LAURA: (laughs) You have a lot of hands up in the air like, "What the fuck?" 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm showing everybody the cookie tin. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh wow, this is nice, right? 
MATT: Further down the ziggurat, you cannot see the top of the leveled top. So you don't have eyes on Fearne and Ashton. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MARISHA: This is-- 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: You put the dough-- 
LAURA: Whatever. 
SAM: -- in here and it cooks. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: I know some of your whatever is bullshit. I know that you're worried about your friends. This is what I need. I need to save everybody. We all need to save everybody. 
MARISHA: Fucking no one loves a martyr. 
TALIESIN: Right? 
ASHLEY: I know, but what if this is not how we do it? 
TALIESIN: Well, we're going to be fucked anyway. 
SAM: (tickling) Tickity-tickity. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: (ticking) Ting-a-ling-a. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: What if giving it to you is not how we save everybody? 
ASHLEY: Well, I was already thinking that. All right, all right. 
LIAM: This is why I ate a whole apple pie. 
LAURA: Mm. 
ASHLEY: Okay, what do I-- 
LAURA: I wish you had saved just a little bit. 
ASHLEY: I just put the shard in there? What do I do? 
LAURA: Not that that'd comfort-- 
TALIESIN: We did it last time. It goes in, we turn it on, if I recall. 
TRAVIS: You just hold it near it, pretty much. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MARISHA: No one listened to what the ancient druid said. 
TALIESIN: Let's do it. 
TRAVIS: Should we look it up now? 
SAM: Fucking chain smoker. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What would Fearne do, man? 
LIAM: Is that hood going save you? 
LAURA: How's it going up there? 
TALIESIN: Let's go. You promised. 
ASHLEY: It's good. Shit! Now you had to go say something like that. All right. 
TALIESIN: Ready? 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: (uncertainly) Yeah. 
TALIESIN: One more for the road. I just run over, grab you, hug you, give you a big fucking kiss. 
SAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Well, now I don't know if I want to put this in there. 
TALIESIN: Fucking do it. It's never happening again anyway! 
TALIESIN: That's the one you get. 
MATT: Touching the shard, you take five points of fire damage. 
MARISHA: Oh jeez. 
TRAVIS: Oh right. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to rage the second I feel a single thing. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: It's like putting C4 into a wood chipper. 
TALIESIN: If it gets weird, just yell. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: You better live through this. 
MATT: You take another four points of fire damage. 
SAM: It's going to be great. 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
SAM: It's going to be great. 
MATT: It's burning your hands as you clutch it. 
ASHLEY: I don't know. 
SAM: It's going to be great. 
TALIESIN: Actually, don't you-- Do you take full fire damage? 
TRAVIS: It's pretty cool, though. 
TALIESIN: Or do you take half damage? 
SAM: He said maybe. 
MARISHA: Two titans ripping your soul apart. 
ASHLEY: I think I take full. 
SAM: Or. 
ASHLEY: But it's okay. It's okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. It's okay. 
ASHLEY: It's not a lot. 
TALIESIN: Let's find out. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: -- into your soul. 
MATT: You take it and hold it to the funnel that sits in the back of the harness. 
TALIESIN: I'll call uncle if I have to. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Take another five points of fire damage. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: The runes, the numerous interwoven runes throughout this harness begin to alight and glow and pulse. The funnel itself at the back of this harness begins to glow and the magical energy begins to alleviate the gravity that you feel on the shard, on the spark itself, to the point where you feel like you might be able to let go. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to let go. 
MATT: Okay. It hovers there. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to let go and let god, okay? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: As it does, you watch the vibrant flame that flickers deeply within this jagged-looking crystal that you together pulled forth from the center of this lava pool, just slowly rotates. As the runes glow brightly, Ashton-- 
ASHLEY: You better not die! 
LAURA: Wait, what? 
MATT: Yeah, you do hear that. (laughs) 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: You feel this warmth in your chest, like you just drank an extremely hot tea on a very cold day-- 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
MATT: -- that begins to blossom inside you. 
TALIESIN: The rainbow sparks begin. 
MATT: As the heat begins to get warm to hot, to hot to burning, all of the gold lines that you see throughout the fractures that keep Ashton together begin to glow orange. Ashton, I need you to make a constitution saving throw for me. 
TALIESIN: Do I get to use my probability? The ability that I just turned on for-- 
MATT: Not for this one, though. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: Just straight constitution? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Fucking burn. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Ah? 
MARISHA: Literally. 
TALIESIN: 23. 
MATT: 23. The heat within your chest, it feels like something is trying to awaken, like a second heartbeat, like a dormant organ within you is starting to shift. It flexes, like a child punching from inside the womb, and when it does, you feel part of your shoulder lurch and the heat extends from your chest to your shoulder. Fearne, you watch as a large chunk of Ashton's shoulder cracks and falls-- (clattering) 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: -- shattering on the ground. 
TALIESIN: Fuck pain. 
ASHLEY: No. 
TALIESIN: Fuck pain. 
ASHLEY: No. 
TALIESIN: Don't you dare. Don't you fucking dare. (grunts) 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MATT: The heat spreads and there's an odd moment where through his grin, you see a part of his ear-- (cracking loose) (clattering) onto the ground. The gold marks throughout his body are now a bright, bright orange-yellow, almost white coloration and the rock of his skin is beginning to smolder. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MATT: Ashton, you feel like something within you is pushing and pushing, and it hurts, and it hurts. You take-- 
TALIESIN: Raging isn't going to help, is it? 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's all right. 
MATT: -- 15 points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I don't know if I should try and take if off him or not. 
MARISHA: Huh? 
ASHLEY: I don't know if I should try to take it off of him or not. 
SAM: I don't know either. You're in no man's land. 
MARISHA: We're not there. 
MATT: The crystal-- 
LAURA: ♪ We're not there ♪ 
MATT: -- begins to lose its color. 
LIAM: (pigeon coos) 
TRAVIS: Oh? 
MATT: You watch as it crumples and breaks and shatters. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Now Ashton's chest-- 
MARISHA: Oh, that's it. 
MATT: -- is glowing like a furnace. You can see there's an expansion. His body is expanding slightly and with each lurching motion, like an earthquake that changes the tectonic plates, other parts begin to break and crumble away. 
LAURA: In your head-- No, you wouldn't-- I would try to talk to Ashton because I would think Fearne is getting-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: So in Ashton's head: How's it going? Is she okay? 
TALIESIN: In my head? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All you hear over and over is: From the earth, of the earth, to the earth. From the earth, of the earth, to the earth. From the earth to the-- From-- Of the earth, to the earth. 
MATT: You take 24 points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: (grunts) 
LAURA: Can I try to lift Orym up? 
MATT: I need you to make another constitution saving throw for me. 
LAURA: So he can see above the-- 
TALIESIN: (pained grunt) 
LIAM: I mean, how far down are we? 
LAURA: Can we see? 
LIAM: We're halfway down the ziggurat. 
LAURA: How high would we have to get to see? 
MATT: You'd have to run up the ziggurat. 
TALIESIN: It's probably pretty-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to start going up the stairs. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: Something's weird. 
MATT: You run up the stairs and you come to the sphere that Allura is maintaining and she glances past you. You pass through it. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: You get the sense this isn't a physical barrier yet. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: We're not keeping things from the outside in. Maybe something from the inside out. 
LAURA: Oh, right. 
MARISHA: 100%. 
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: You begin charging up. What'd you roll? 
TALIESIN: 11. 
SAM: Oof. 
TRAVIS: (implosion) 
MARISHA: Oh my god, look at Matt's face. 
TALIESIN: I can't use my fucking luck anymore. 
ASHLEY: Why is he doing that face? 
SAM: I don't like that face. 
LAURA: Because he's going to die. 
ASHLEY: I-- 
MARISHA: Yo, Ashton's going to die. 
MATT: Ashton, you close your eyes as you're muttering this and you look up towards Fearne, and where his eyes were, you just see these two bright burning coals that just emit this beam of orange heat light out in your direction. You see his body shaking. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: There's another shift (forceful shifting) as his chest expands and you hear a crack and his right arm falls off the torso. 
SAM: Oh boy! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
SAM: Oh boy. Oh boy. 
MATT: Shatters onto the ground. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LIAM: I think Orym would trail after Imogen. 
TRAVIS: (stress laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
SAM: I think I might start walking up there as well. 
TALIESIN: Roll it, roll it. 
MARISHA: Wait, you were still telling me about your baking sheet. 
TALIESIN: Full speed. 
TRAVIS: Lady Cassandra, how often do you visit Whitestone? 
MARISHA: What? Who's going to protect-- (laughter) 
MATT: (Percy) "What-- What's going on up there?" 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to start taking the harness off. 
LAURA: Can I see anything yet? 
MATT: You rush up to the top and you see Fearne rushing towards now this volcanic-- 
ASHLEY: I don't want to do this. 
MATT: -- shaking, swelling, partially cracking Ashton. 
LAURA: No. No, no, no, no, no! Help! 
ASHLEY: I'm trying to take the harness off. 
MATT: You're trying to take the harness off? 
SAM: Mid-spell? 
ASHLEY: I don't know. 
SAM: (squeakily) Oh my god! 
MARISHA: What?! 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll-- 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: I don't know. 
MARISHA: We're in uncharted waters! 
MATT: They're rushing towards you, Ashton. Are you doing anything? 
TALIESIN: I am-- 
MARISHA: Why are you looking at me? 
TALIESIN: Because I had to look somewhere. The eyes have to go somewhere! (laughter) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep trying to-- 
TRAVIS: That bone is out there. 
TALIESIN: -- turn on the rage again. I'm going to be-- I'm just in prayer. I'm thinking about my past, I'm thinking about my future. I'm thinking about the people I want to protect. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I don't care where. Just I don't care what I'm going to become, but I have to become something that is, (sighs) I am not going to lose anybody and I am definitely at this point, can I sense that they're heading towards me? 
MATT: I would say yes because you are very familiar with pain and focusing through the pain that you more than anybody can maintain just enough focus through this white-hot sensation to see them rush towards you. You take 36 points of fire damage. 
LAURA: Is he getting brighter? 
TALIESIN: (groans) Ow. 
MATT: He is getting brighter and hotter. 
TALIESIN: I'm just going to say "Anything you got, I'll take it." 
LAURA: Anything? What did you do? 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to stumble towards FCG at least. 
MARISHA: All right Chet, I feel like we should at least-- 
SAM: Okay, I'm up there. 
MARISHA: -- stroll up. 
LAURA: This is dumb, I'm going to cast Telekinesis. 
MARISHA: Stop flirting. (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm just going to use everything that I have to hold his body together. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: As I see pieces breaking off, I'm just going to use every force I have to try to compress everything and hold it together as he's walking. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Unless... 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to just, if I've got anything, I'm just going to try and take my one good arm and down another healing potion and just try and keep myself going and I assume that, whenever the next rage would be-- 
MATT: You uncork the healing potion and as you lift it to your lips, the liquid inside immediately evaporates before it touches your mouth. (shocked laughter) 
TALIESIN: I am laughing my ass off at that. 
SAM: Have I gotten up there? Am I close enough to get in range? 
MATT: The rest of you have begun? 
MARISHA: We're all trailing up. 
MATT: You're all starting to follow up after Imogen. 
SAM: I'm going to race over to him-- 
LIAM: We're all staring, shellshocked. 
SAM: -- and try to touch him if I can. 
TRAVIS: Oh, what? 
SAM: It might burn. 
LAURA: Try to what? 
SAM: I'm going to try to touch him. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: And just to throw on a Death Ward. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (whistles) 
ASHLEY: I am going to cast Aura of Life. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, Matt's face. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TRAVIS: Choices were made here, guys. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
SAM: What's Aura of Life do? 
TALIESIN: I know I was going for something heavy. 
SAM: What's Aura of Life? Is that-- 
TALIESIN: I was going for something heavy. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: "Its hit point maximum can't be reduced." 
TRAVIS: I love it, I love it. 
ASHLEY: "In addition, a living creature regains one hit point--" 
TALIESIN: I did this to myself, I did, I did. 
ASHLEY: "-- when it gets to zero hit points." 
MATT: All right, so you're trying to touch him. 
SAM: I'm going to try to touch him, maybe on a part that's still rock and not just molten. Like yeah, try to slap a Death Ward on him. 
TRAVIS: It's all hot rocks at this point. 
MATT: Yeah. So you place a Death Ward on him. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit! 
MATT: You and him, well actually, no, you would take 14 points of fire damage upon touching him. You take 28 points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: I actually had a question. I have a ring that lowers fire damage. Could I have been using this? 
SAM: The fire is within you. 
MATT: You do not have the concentration at the moment to utilize anything on you. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: It's taking you everything to not explode right now. 
TRAVIS: Your arm fell off. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LIAM: Yeah, it's on the ground. 
LAURA: Was it the hand on--? 
LIAM: It's right there. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah, it was. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: I was just going to do something. Fuck, I lost my concentration. 
MATT: Yes, you did. 
TALIESIN: Hold on. Again, I'm still getting the probability roll. I got it again. Just going for it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, buddy. 
MATT: As the rest of you rush up there and you put the Death Ward on him-- 
TALIESIN: Oh wait, how many points of damage did I get? 
MARISHA: 28. 
MATT: -- you can see now, parts of his chest-- 
TALIESIN: I took 28? 
MATT: -- and his shoulders are expanding. 
TALIESIN: I'm way low. 
MATT: You can see it's cracking, like small volcanoes are bursting out of his surface. 
TRAVIS: I don't understand. What happened? I thought-- 
LAURA: He's at low, low hit points. 
TRAVIS: I thought Fearne was going to take it. 
SAM: I can try to-- 
TRAVIS: What happened? 
LAURA: You can fill him up with hit points. 
ASHLEY: I don't know. 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: What? 
SAM: Is it the next round yet? Can I cast another spell? 
MATT: You're all trying to hold it together. 
TALIESIN: Mm hmm. 
LAURA: I have a feeling... 
MATT: You take 48 points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm out. (gasping) 
SAM: Wait, can I take half of that as a reaction? 
MATT: Is that an attack or an ability What does it say-- 
TALIESIN: I'm down. 
MATT: -- for your ability? 
SAM: It says, oh boy. 
LAURA: But you had Death Ward on you and Aura of Life. 
SAM: "Whenever another creature of your choice takes damage from an attack." 
TRAVIS: Yes sir. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I mean, there's nothing any of us can do. 
TRAVIS: No. 
LAURA: Mm-mm. 
MARISHA: This is so beyond us. 
SAM: But I will certainly heal him the second I can. 
LAURA: Okay, wait, I've got-- This is not going to help. I'm going to try it. 
TALIESIN: I'm amused. 
LAURA: I am going to cast-- 
SAM: You're not out by the way, because you had Death Ward. 
LAURA: Yeah, you have Death Ward. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: The minute the consciousness slips from you, you pretty much rush up, put the Death Ward on him and as the rune of protection emanates, it immediately shatters as he crumples to another knee and you can see as he's shaking, parts of the body are breaking and falling on the ground. There's just this trail around him, this growing pile of shale. 
TALIESIN: I'm at one point right now, is that correct? 
LAURA: How much of his body is left right now? 
MATT: How much of his body is-- It's still, I'd put it at 70%. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Watery Sphere around him and try to cool his body down, to solidify the rock as it's cooling. 
MATT: Steaming Sphere as a spell. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Because as you begin, and you notice in the proximity, even just standing near him, you take another 18 points of fire damage. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
SAM: He's hot. 
TRAVIS: Wow, that's a lot just from getting near him. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to start with what I've got left-- 
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw for me. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Because just with this, I'm going to start just-- 
MARISHA: This is it. 
TALIESIN: Feeling the stone beneath me, I'm going to just start trying to concentrate on the stone. 
SAM: Guidance! 
TALIESIN: Don't be a dick, please don't be a dick. I have-- 
ASHLEY: I can't, right? 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. It was a constitution save? 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: 21. 
SAM: Okay? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 18, 21. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: You are barely holding on right now. You are slipping in and out of consciousness and you feel this battling duality inside you. You are a man currently holding two bombs inside on the verge of detonation. 
LAURA: (whispers) It's going to kill us all when it explodes. 
SAM: (whispers) Grab the shard? 
LAURA: (whispers) Let's go. 
SAM: Is there time-- 
TRAVIS: We're not out of it, though. 
SAM: -- to cast curing on him right now? 
MATT: Sure, what do you cast on him? Between the Death Ward vanishing and the next round, yeah. 
SAM: I will... I'll just do a 6th-level Cure Wounds. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Am I at one hit point right now? One hit point, hold on. 
LIAM: Does Ashton look like they are dead, dying, dead to us? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LAURA: Yeah. Does it look like they're crumbling right before our eyes? 
ASHLEY: Ugh! 
LIAM: Not a great roll for me. 
MATT: The process takes a minute, by the way. 
TRAVIS: What does? 
MARISHA: One minute. 
MATT: The harness. 
TALIESIN: How far are we-- 
MATT: You are four rounds into a minute. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
LIAM: 24 seconds. I got a 19. 
MATT: You got a 19? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: He's not doing good. 
SAM: I just pumped-- 
MARISHA: Four rounds away. 
SAM: -- 27 hit points into him. 
MATT: Fantastic, and he just took 60 fire damage. 
TALIESIN: I'm out again. 
SAM: I did? 
MATT: He did. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: So I'm out again. 
LIAM: This isn't going to work. 
MATT: Aura of Life is the only thing that's keeping you up right now as you jump back to one hit point and then another surge puts you down. You are holding it together and then losing it and then holding it together and then losing it. 
LAURA: I try to use the Mage Hand, Telekinetic Mage Hand to take the harness off of him. I'm going to try to unbuckle the harness with the hand. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: So I stay back. 
LIAM: I mean, I'll go faster than that. I will use Seedling and Grasping Vine to yank the nugget off of the harness. 
LAURA: The nugget is crumbled. 
MARISHA: It's gone. 
LIAM: It's just crumbled? 
LAURA: The harness is on him. 
LIAM: Then let's go together. 
LAURA: That's what I'm trying. 
MATT: The power has moved into him. 
LIAM: Let's go together. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the harness is not-- 
LIAM: Because Mage Hand is very weak. 
LAURA: The Mage Hand is trying to unbuckle it, but you can yank it off as soon as I get it unbuckled. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Is Allura heading up here, too, but-- no? 
LAURA: She's holding it. 
MATT: Allura's holding this. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: Otherwise we all explode. 
MATT: As much as she cares about you all, Whitestone is more important to her. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. Keep it together, guys. 
MATT: All right. I will need you to go ahead and just make a charisma check to utilize your arcana to rapidly try and work through these buckles. 
LAURA: A charisma check? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: 20. 
MATT: 20, okay. You (whoosh) begin to maneuver these buckles rapidly. You use Seedling and yank. Make a strength check for me. 
LIAM: Okay. It's not the spell's shit? 
MATT: Seedling attaches and pulls or pulls from. This is about you trying to, actually you unbuckled it, so it's not a very high DC. Just roll a straight strength check. 
LIAM: So what am I adding, my strength? 
LAURA: Just your strength modifier. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: There is no strength modifier. It is a straight roll. It's a five. 
MATT: It's a five. You pull it off of him, but it skitters to the ground. It doesn't come to you before it snaps off him. 
LIAM: But it's off of Ashton? 
MATT: It's off of Ashton. 
LIAM: Okay, then I will use Gust and blow it further away from Ashton. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: The transference is inside of him, though. 
LAURA: Yeah, sure, but... I don't know. 
SAM: Got to try something. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: The harness is now-- 
TRAVIS: Inert. 
MATT: -- seemingly inert as the process of transference has begun. 
LIAM: Oh god. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to pump Cure Wounds into him, too. 
LAURA: Can I Mage Hand the harness out of the bubble where Ashton is, outside of the thing that Allura is creating? 
MATT: If you want to begin moving it over there, you can. 
LAURA: Yeah, just like pull it away. 
TRAVIS: We could use all the healing spells and potions. 
SAM: Whenever I'm allowed to cast a spell, I'm going to cast Aura of Vitality and just every round keep pumping in-- 
TALIESIN: I have a feeling it hasn't happened yet, either. 
SAM: 2d6. 
MATT: Okay. Ashton, make another constitution saving throw. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll also say I do have a thing that should have kicked in earlier, but I'll-- 
MATT: What is that? 
TALIESIN: It's the Ring of Temporal Salvation. 
MATT: Oh, valid. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. Next time it's necessary. 
ASHLEY: I did a Cure Wounds for 33 points of healing. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: As soon as that happens, after I make the constitution check, where's my constitution? Let's not be a dick. I could really use a good role. 
LIAM: I don't mind doing potion after potion, but you've got-- 
SAM: I've got a thing that's going. 
MARISHA: Potions don't work. 
LAURA: Potions don't work and we're using them all. 
LIAM: Oh, they evaporated. 
TALIESIN: 17. 
SAM: My thing can last for a whole minute and it's just healing every round. 
MATT: 17? 
TALIESIN: 17. 
LIAM: As long as it keeps it. 
MATT: (sighs) You're holding it together. 
TRAVIS: He's taking 60 fire damage. 
MATT: You take 34 points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: I'm only at one, wait, did someone heal me before this or-- 
SAM: She just did. 
ASHLEY: For 33. 
SAM: So you're out again. 
TALIESIN: I'm out again. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Then I will cast Aura of Vitality, giving him hey, eight points. 
TALIESIN: So I'm back up to eight before anything happens. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (emphatic exhale) 
MATT: Make another constitution save. 
LIAM: Jesus. 
MARISHA: Stupid. 
SAM: Come on, he can do this, he can power through. He's a rock man. 
TALIESIN: Ooh, terrible. 
SAM: ♪ Rocket man ♪ 
LIAM: Rocks. 
TALIESIN: 10. 
LAURA: Hey, you guys remember when Ashton broke that green lens? 
LIAM: Yes. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: This is where the ring, I assume, is going to be the thing that fucking-- 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, he just said 10. 
TALIESIN: I had a bad constitution roll. 
MATT: Matt just took a dump in his chair. 
LAURA: He rolled a 10 constitution? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: It was a 10? Great. 
TALIESIN: It was a bad constitution role. 
MATT: You all watch as all of the gold parts in Ashton's body glow white hot. His eyes close and his face tenses as he looks up and the beams of sheer, bright light that pour from his eyes up into the Sun Tree's roots above, he screams before he shatters-- 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: -- into 1,000 pieces and they stop in the air. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: And (swooshes) form back as your ring breaks and that brief little bit of inherent dunamis brings you back into that final moment before you shatter. You all watched your friend die and come back and that ring is gone. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: And you have five more rounds. 
LIAM: Holy. 
TALIESIN: Are we only at five? Really, we're now only that far? I thought we'd gotten further. 
LIAM: Oh shit. 
TRAVIS: Takes a whole minute. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: Six seconds. This is it. 
TALIESIN: Six, seven, eight, nine, 10. 
LIAM: Shit! 
TRAVIS: Just real clear. We were... 
MATT: I was real clear, y'all. 
MARISHA: It was so clear. 
LAURA: So clear. 
SAM: It's all good. 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going for it. 
SAM: What's next? More constitution? More healing? What are we doing? 
TRAVIS: Whatever we got. 
TALIESIN: Keep healing. 
MATT: So if you want to keep healing-- 
SAM: Another 10 points-- 
LAURA: I'm going to grab Orym-- 
SAM: -- of healing. 
MATT: 10 points of healing to you. 
LAURA: -- and say we should get out of this bubble. 
MARISHA: I agree. I agree. 
LAURA: We need to get out. 
LIAM: No, no, no. 
TALIESIN: No, I did it the wrong way. So sorry. That was-- 
LAURA: If that happens-- 
TALIESIN: I did it the wrong way. 
LAURA: If that happens to you-- 
TALIESIN: So I should get-- 
LAURA: We're all dead. 
SAM: Can you inspire him? Can you give him-- 
ASHLEY: I want to do more healing. 
MARISHA: Imogen. 
LIAM: Why did he-- 
MARISHA: We should get out of the bubble. 
TALIESIN: I'm a crazy fuck. Here we go. 
SAM: It's his destiny. 
MARISHA: I back up. I grab Imogen out of like protective nature and start backing her up. I grab Chetney as well. 
MATT: Okay, so you're dragging them all back down to where the harness is? 
MARISHA: I still want to see, but we're just going to start backing away from this. 
ASHLEY: I pumped in another Cure Wounds for 21. 
MARISHA: I ain't got healing spells. 
MATT: Okay. So Cure Wounds again? Each time you Cure Wounds, you do take fire damage, just so you're aware. 
TALIESIN: I was also going to-- 
ASHLEY: So you've doing that twice? 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, a lot of these just burn through in one round, which is the plan 
MATT: 11 points of fire damage-- 
TALIESIN: A thing, like, holding them-- 
MATT: And eight points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: Keeping me together after every time I take damage would be-- so that's-- 
LAURA: Is the watery sphere helping at all? 
TALIESIN: Did I take 21? 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: 21, so I'm at 43. 
MATT: This is primordial-- 
TALIESIN: Why do I keep doing that? 
MATT: -- titan and elemental power. 
TALIESIN: I do it wrong. 
LAURA: Yeah. I can't do anything. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm a crazy person, well aware. 
SAM: He's just got to roll good. He's just got to roll exceptionally good. 
MARISHA and SAM: For five more rounds. 
TALIESIN: Well, four now, I think. 
MATT: That was the fifth. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Five more rounds. 
TALIESIN: Five more rounds? Shit. 
LIAM: I start backing up. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I knew this was going to be dumb. 
LIAM: Probably not fast enough. 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. Do it! 
MATT: 32 points of fire damage. 
SAM: Wait, hold on, hold on. 32, well, what did you just heal him for? 
TALIESIN: I'm at 43. 
SAM: Okay, and 32, so he's not out this round. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: This round. 
MARISHA: But I mean, you guys are running out of high-level spells. You've got to be, right? 
SAM: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: The only thing that's keeping him up is your aura. 
SAM: Is the healing doing anything? 
MATT: Which, by the way, I need you to roll a constitution save twice because you took fire damage twice from healing him. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
SAM: Is healing doing anything? 
LAURA: Yeah, it's healing him. 
MATT: If he was at zero hit points, the fire damage would've wiped him out two rounds ago. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, keep pumping it in. 
ASHLEY: Is this a magical effect? 
SAM: (laughs) Nope. 
MATT: No. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Okay. 
TALIESIN: You also have a healing potion. 
ASHLEY: Constitution save. 
MATT: This is pure elemental power. 
LIAM: Healing potions were evaporated. 
LAURA: Healing potions won't work on you. 
TALIESIN: On her, fuck. 
ASHLEY: What was it? 
SAM: I didn't see it. 
MARISHA: Oh no. No! 
SAM: Do you get luck or something? 
MATT: Can you cast it again? 
SAM: Wait. 
ASHLEY: Let me see. 
SAM: Wait. 
ASHLEY: Oh yes I can! I can cast it again. I can cast it again. It's 4th-level. 
LIAM: Where are you at, HP? 
ASHLEY: I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm going to cast another Cure Wounds. 
TRAVIS: It's triage. Leave it all on the table. 
TALIESIN: Yep. I don't know why I'm looking at you. 
MATT: Take another nine points of fire damage. 
MARISHA: How much? 
MATT: Nine points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LIAM: Didn't-- give me that big potion. 
MATT: Roll another constitution saving throw. 
MARISHA: Nope! 
LIAM: I'm going to give it to her. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, I'm okay, okay. 
MATT: Fearne, so you cast the spell again. 
MARISHA: No! 
ASHLEY: I did. 
MATT: Right, so now hold off on the healing right there, so hold onto that for now. 
MARISHA: I can give it to her. 
MATT: Roll another constitution save for me. 
TALIESIN: Fucking duck. I was really hoping that my rage would actually like help this, I will admit. 
MATT: I know. 
TALIESIN: Ah, that's, I'll take-- 16? 
MATT: 16, okay. 
TALIESIN: It's like, oh yeah, fuck it. 
MATT: Barely holding yourself together. 
TALIESIN: That's... story of my life. 
MATT: You do take-- 
TALIESIN: I'm out again. 
ASHLEY: I'm okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm definitely out again. 
MATT: 27 points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: I'm out again. 
SAM: And he heals seven points. 
TALIESIN: I'm not out again. 
ASHLEY: Heals 31 points. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm up to what? 
ASHLEY: I know I have to take fire damage. 
MATT: Then make another-- 
SAM: That's 38. 
TALIESIN: 38, I'm at 38. 
MATT: You took nine more points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: I'm at 38. 
MATT: Then roll a constitution saving throw. 
SAM: Currently, yes. 
ASHLEY: Come on, piece of shit. 
TALIESIN: Here, I'll just do it this way. 
SAM: What's that? 
ASHLEY: 16? 
MATT: 16, you maintain concentration. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Do you have, you got advantage on those rolls or no? Aha, fancy. 
ASHLEY: I do not. I do not. 
SAM: A miracle. 
TRAVIS: I would love to have anything. 
MARISHA: If he makes it, it'll be nice. 
SAM: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: I can make him invisible. 
SAM: Maybe I can ask for a miracle. 
MARISHA: You got to roll for Divine Intervention, baby. 
SAM: I don't have that. I don't think I have Divine Intervention yet. 
MATT: Roll another constitution saving throw for me. 
LAURA: What level... What level was it? 11? 
TALIESIN: I love that you know that I was going to do this. 
MATT: I didn't. 
TALIESIN: Really? God, you just put a big red button in front of me. 
MATT: Yeah, and a lot of warnings. 
LAURA: Yeah, and so many warnings. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: A whole bunch of warnings. 
MATT: Hey, man. 
LAURA: Leave the ones instead. 
MATT: If you pull this off, fucking power to ya. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, look at that. 
SAM: What's that? 
TALIESIN: Another 16. 
MATT: Okay, okay. That's seven. 
MARISHA: So many dice. 
MATT: That is going to be 21 points of fire damage. That's a really shitty roll. 
TALIESIN: I'm up. Thank you. 
SAM: He's still up. 
TALIESIN: Still up. 
SAM: And he's healed another six points. 
LIAM: Divine Intervention comes in at 10th-- 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Cool. 
LIAM: -- level. 
LAURA: So we're going to go to the moon and nobody will have any abilities except for Ashton. 
SAM: Divine Intervention comes in at 10. 
TALIESIN: Go tomorrow. 
MARISHA: We're going to get to sleep. 
SAM: I don't see it in my spell list. 
TALIESIN: Which one? It's not a spell. 
SAM: It's a feature? 
LIAM: It's a feature. 
TALIESIN: It's a feature. 
SAM: Okay, well, then-- 
LIAM: 10th-level, you can call in your deity. 
SAM: Instead of healing him, I will use Divine Intervention. 
TALIESIN: So I'm losing those six points. 
SAM: Yes. 
TALIESIN: That's okay. I don't mind. 
TRAVIS: Now we're in big swings, right? 
TALIESIN: So I just-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: If I knock-- 
LAURA: He's taking a gamble, Ashton. 
LIAM: Take it all out. 
LAURA: Some people do that too at this table. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Have you not realized that I'm a hypocrite? 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Percentile dice, so this is a d100? 
LAURA: Yeah, you have to roll lower than your level. 
LIAM: You got to roll low. 
MARISHA: Under your level. 
SAM: Okay, Changebringer. 
LIAM: Better us than Chetney. 
SAM: I asked you to show Ashton a sign. This would be the time to show him a sign and make him faithful. 
MATT: 10% or below, man. 
LIAM: Come on, it's possible. 
SAM: If you do this-- 
LIAM: It's possible. 
SAM: 31. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
TRAVIS: Oh, saw the one. 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: Too far below the surface and vision and sight and attention of the gods who are so distracted, you feel nothing in return from the Changebringer in this moment of panic. 
SAM: Oh fuck. 
MATT: Another constitution saving throw for me, Ashton. The DC at this point right now in these final two rounds is up to 15. 
LIAM: Holy shit. 
TALIESIN: Don't be a dick, don't be a dick. 
SAM: I can't use mine. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 21. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (deeply sighs) 
MATT: That is-- Marking these right, that's eight rounds we've gone through. 
TALIESIN: I feel like it was more, but that also could be because my brain is fried. 
SAM: Like 13, 14 rounds of healing. 
MATT: No, did I miss a mark? I don't think I did, fuck. 
TRAVIS: Six, seven, eight? 
MARISHA: This might be eight? 
MATT: I think I marked it as eight. 
LIAM: It's been 84 years. 
MATT: I know. 
LIAM: ♪ It's been ♪ 
TRAVIS: That's his third constitution roll since the halfway point, you said. 
LAURA: So it'd be eight. 
MATT: Yes, so it'd be eight. 
TRAVIS: Eight, yeah. 
LAURA: So two more rolls. 
TALIESIN: Fuck me. 
MATT: Okay. That'll be 32 points of fire image. 
TALIESIN: I'm down. 
SAM: I will heal him for nine points of healing. 
MATT: Are you healing him with-- what each turn? 
SAM: Aura of whatever it's called. 
MATT: Oh, aura of healing, right. 
SAM: It's called Aura of Vitality. 
MATT: Got it. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
SAM: Every round I can do 2d6. 
MATT: That's true. 
TALIESIN: That's so cool. Okay, so nine points? One second. Let's see, two, sorry, I'm doing a weird way. 
LIAM: This guy's going to-- 
SAM: Do it. 
TRAVIS: I think so. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm at nine points. 
MARISHA: If he does it, it's just because of you two. 
SAM: No. No, it's because the Changebringer's power. 
MARISHA: No! Nothing. 
MATT: I'm shaking. 
TALIESIN: I'm a fucking moron. 
SAM: Two more roll, right? 
MARISHA: It's because Imogen decided to run up there after he was like, "I want privacy." 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LAURA: "I want privacy. I want nobody with me while I like--" 
SAM: Kill myself. 
MARISHA: Fucking kill myself. 
TRAVIS: While I destroy everybody. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: 27. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: This is this last one. That's what I'm freaked out about. 
LIAM: Taliesin, do not Molly yourself again. 
TRAVIS: This was a bit more intentional, though. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Take 34 points of fire damage. 
TALIESIN: I'm out. 
SAM: I will heal you. 
LIAM: Fuck around. 
TALIESIN: Anybody want to heal now? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Now would be the point. 
SAM: 10 points. 
LAURA: Anybody want to use up anymore? 
SAM: 10 points. 
TRAVIS: I'll go do it. 
TALIESIN: Because I think perhaps, if I don't hit zero, maybe. 
ASHLEY: 22 points, Cure Wounds, 22 points of healing. 
TALIESIN: So that makes me, it puts me up to 32. 
MATT: You take 12 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I appreciate that. Give me 22. 
SAM: What is that, ice? What are you doing? Oh, those are dice. 
TRAVIS: If you rub dice on your temple. 
MATT: Make constitution saving throw for me, please. 
SAM: This is the last one or second to last one? 
MARISHA: I think this is last one. 
LAURA, TALIESIN, MATT, LIAM: Last one. 
SAM: Ha ha! I thought they missed one in there, but I'm okay with that. 
LIAM: I'm scared to look at it. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to fucking kill him if he survives. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm going to kill him if he dies. 
MARISHA: Going to beat the shit out of him. 
SAM: Either way, he dies. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm aware. 
MATT: Why don't you roll it here in the middle of the table? 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put it in the middle. 
ASHLEY: I cannot even look at this, I can't look at this. I have to walk away. 
LIAM: Yeah, get it on the CR logo, you maniac. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it the old fashioned way. 
SAM: What does that mean? 
MATT: Not looking? 
MARISHA: He's not going to look at it. 
LIAM: It's good. 
LAURA: It's good. 
SAM: Pretty good. 
LIAM: It's high. 
TALIESIN: Plus eight. 
LAURA: 16. 
LIAM: 16 plus. 
TALIESIN: Plus eight. Never look if you want to win. Never fucking look when you want to win. 
LIAM: You shut your mouth! 
ALL (except Taliesin): (angry screaming) 
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? 
LIAM: I'll kick you in your boots. 
LAURA: I know. 
LIAM: Ball sack, goddamn. 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. 
MATT: The heat begins to subside as Ashton falls unconscious onto his side of where the arm is no longer present. There's a moment where you think he's gone, and then he erupts in steam, (explosive hissing) filling the entirety of the apex of the ziggurat with mist. All of you pull back, the heat of it, burning your eyes, filling your throat with hot moisture and you can't help but cough in a moment. As it passes, you look over and see him there and cooling, unmoving. And you come to. 
TALIESIN: How much body do I have left? 
MATT: You sit up and you glance over and where your arm was, there is a heavy, muscular, molten rock arm replacing what you've lost, that just glows. Where gold veins once were, there's now just twisting spiral cracks of orange. 
TALIESIN: Thank you for trusting me. Thank you for saving me. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go up and I'm going to kick you in your face with my hoof. 
TALIESIN: (grunts) 
ASHLEY: I am never listening to you again! 
TALIESIN: That's probably a really good idea. 
MATT: As you lie there, taking in this moment of survival and what that means, uncertain of what has transpired here, the rest of you begin to step up and process how close you were to losing Ashton, here under the roots of the Sun Tree. On top of place of much loss, it seems at least something was saved this time. As you boil in whatever emotions sit within you, we're going to call the episode there. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
TALIESIN: Love you all. 
SAM: (screams) Do you? Do you? 
MARISHA: You're a douche bag! 
TALIESIN: Percy's right there, what did you expect me to do? He knew. He had no illusions. Well. Big risk, big reward. 
SAM: It's not wrong. 
MATT: The fucking ring of temporal salvation, y'all. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: That was it. 
SAM: Where did you get that ring? What was that? 
MATT: Thank Deanna. That was it. 
SAM: Oh, that's Deanna. 
MATT: That was the moment. 
LIAM: And that was on a failed save? 
LAURA: Yeah, that's what it would have been. 
MATT: The DC partway through was 11. It was 11 or higher, essentially. It was a success and he rolled a 10. That was a loss and that was just complete eradication. Then as it progresses, it steps up, steps up until it gets to 15 and that was-- 
LAURA: So he never rolled under except for that one time? 
MATT: Except for that one time. 
LAURA: Wow, that's lucky. 
MATT: He rolled an 11 at one point. 
LIAM: It's a big, a great modifier for-- 
TALIESIN: A good modifier for constitution saves. 
LIAM: But 10 rolls, man. 
MATT: Well, a body is not meant to carry two of these powers together. 
LAURA: Yeah, we heard that from a tree! 
MARISHA: Yeah, multiple times! 
LAURA: Lot of things-- 
LIAM: Multiple times. 
LAURA: -- said that already. 
MARISHA: A tree older than life itself. 
MATT: That means Ashton is an unprecedented creature at the moment. 
TALIESIN: Again. 
LAURA: Jesus Christ. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Who knows-- 
TALIESIN: Again. 
MATT: -- what that means. But we'll pick that up next time. I'm going to-- Oh, I'm going to have a drink and sleep tonight. 
TALIESIN: We're out! 
MATT: Good night, we love you so much. Thank you for watching. Is it Thursday yet? (laughter)
