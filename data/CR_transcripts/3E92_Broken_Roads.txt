Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (gibberish) 
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: Yeah. Missing our Sam boy. But we are starting tonight with a word from our sponsor for the evening, Thorum. Marisha, wherever-- (laughs) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What? Oh no. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Thank you, Sam. 
TRAVIS: Do you need help? 
MARISHA: Yes, please. 
LAURA: Thank you. Sam. 
TRAVIS: I so want to chair pull you in that. 
ASHLEY: Get your drink. 
TRAVIS: I just want you to eat shit in this fucking bun. 
MATT: (laughs) Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Mobility is real low. 
LIAM: Eat something. 
TRAVIS: There's definitely a chair behind you. 
LAURA: Has that hot dog costume ever been washed? 
TRAVIS: There's definitely a chair behind you. 
MARISHA: It smells weird. 
MATT: Of all hot dog costumes, it's a pretty high quality one. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It is. 
LIAM: Definitely looks like a hot dog. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking it looks like. 
MARISHA: This is a hot dog. Hi. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Hi. So, Sam's not here. 
TRAVIS: You got to pull the folds back. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's generally how it works, Travis. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Hot dog. 
ASHLEY: There's so many things I want to do to this right now. 
LAURA: I know! 
ASHLEY: I'm not going to do it. 
MARISHA: I just want to say it looked different on the website, so. (laughter) 
LIAM: This ad is never going to start or finish. 
MARISHA: Nope! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: I like how it's winning. 
TRAVIS: You can do it. (laughter) 
LIAM: Somebody rub her forehead, please. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Now, that's getting a little weird. 
MARISHA: So Sam's-- (growls) (laughter) This hot dog bites back. So Sam's not here. So he's making me do the ad read, which I found out about about five minutes ago. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) Stop. She's struggling. 
MARISHA: I haven't read the script, but, okay, here we go. (fortifying sigh) 
TRAVIS: (mouth fart) 
LAURA: Just pull the hot dog apart. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh, does this help, Laura? Does this help? (laughter) Is this making a difference? My head is stuck. (laughter) 
LIAM: Are you cold? You're shivering. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughing) Oh my god! 
MARISHA: Old shiver and quiff. So, for over a decade, Thorum has been handcrafting unique wedding bands out of everything from meteorite-- (uncontrolled snickering) -- whiskey barrels. They ship every ring within one business day. [text chime and vibration] (giggling) Sorry, it's-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm in your way, 
MARISHA: It's Sam. 
LAURA: Oh, what is it? 
MARISHA: "Sit up straight. You look like you're going to a Kentucky Junior Prom." Thank you, Sam. Thank you for the critique. (sighs) I knew we shouldn't have let him watch the live feed. Thorum is also making minimalist watches out of meteorite, Hawaiian koa-- (laughter) -- and California redwood, plus their line of chic minimalist pendants. They're new, that's what these are. And-- (snickering) Since we know a thing or two about minimalism here at Critical Role-- 
LIAM: Do we? 
TALIESIN: Really? 
MARISHA: We do. I'm going to list off some of the cool materials-- 
LAURA: Those are necklaces? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Those are really pretty! 
MARISHA: -- Thorum uses in their rings, while-- You're interrupting my serious ad read. 
LAURA: I'm sorry. 
MARISHA: Cool materials that Thorum uses in their rings, while eating an entire dump cake without my hands. 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: Oh, no, no, no. 
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh! 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: No! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
TALIESIN: No! 
KYLE: I'm sorry. 
MARISHA: I have to eat all that? 
KYLE: It's Sam's artistic vision. 
LAURA: (gasps) No. 
KYLE: I'm sorry. 
MARISHA: I'm not-- Okay. I'm not-- You know what, I'll just sing a jaunty little tune, okay? 
LAURA: Is it good? 
MARISHA: That'll be good. 
TRAVIS: That's Play-Doh. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Mm. 
MARISHA: ♪ Meteorite, whiskey barrels ♪ ♪ Iron, wood ♪ [cell phone ringing] [cell phone ringing continues] 
MARISHA: It's Sam. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: It's Sam, hang on. Yeah, Sam. [high-pitched gibberish] No, (laughs weakly) I know I'm not a singer. 
LAURA: Are we allowed to keep these? [high-pitched gibberish] 
MARISHA: No, no, no, I'm not doing that. It's incredibly gross. (laughter) [high-pitched gibberish] What does Thorum have to do with eating dump cakes anyway? [high-pitched gibberish] Uh-huh. [high-pitched gibberish] Oh, it's called caterpilling. [high-pitched gibberish] 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: It's popular on TikTok. 
ASHLEY: What? 
TRAVIS: Caterpilling. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: What is that? 
MARISHA: Why am I dressed like a hot dog then? It just makes no sense. [high-pitched gibberish] 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (offended huff) Excuse me? [high-pitched gibberish] I don't understand comedy? Okay, you know what? You know what? I can do this by myself. All right? I went to improv school too. Okay? Yeah. It might have been LA Connection. Don't look it up, but you know what? (laughter) I didn't have fucking money for your fancy UCB bullshit. (laughter) Okay? 
TALIESIN: Look that up. 
MARISHA: So. Yeah, and you know what? I may not have won two Emmys-- 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: -- but I won the technology award in the eighth grade-- 
ASHLEY: Let's go! 
MARISHA: -- because my fucking HTML skills were lit. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Good job! 
MARISHA: My MySpace page was the shit. Take that, Sam! 
TRAVIS: MySpace page. 
MARISHA: That's a true story. I won the technology award! 
TRAVIS: In eighth grade. 
TALIESIN: She's told me. 
MARISHA: (composed) So whether you need a wedding ring, anniversary ring, or you just want a ring that looks awesome, head over to-- It smells bad. 
LIAM: I thought it was just me. 
MARISHA: Head over to Thorum-- This is a hot dog. To Horum-- To Thorum. 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Horum? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Head over to thorum.com-- 
LIAM: I like the smell. 
ASHLEY: That's a different-- 
MARISHA: -- and use code CRITICALROLE. Matt, zip zap zop back to you. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: Thank you, Marisha. 
LIAM: This is Orym's Form of Dread. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: I hate everything about this. 
TRAVIS: We grieve with laughter. 
TALIESIN: That's so awful. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: That looks so good! 
LAURA: Make it stop. But can we eat that cake? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you got to eat that. 
MATT: I do not recommend that. 
TALIESIN: I don't want to touch that cake. 
TRAVIS: Ugh. 
TALIESIN: Oh god. 
LAURA: I kind of want to eat the cake. 
MATT: You want this cake? 
TALIESIN: No! 
MARISHA: I want it. 
MATT: You want this cake? 
TRAVIS: It's like dried out avocado. 
MATT: All right. Thank you so much, Marisha. How dare you, Sam. Laura, you have some announcements. 
LAURA: I do! 
TALIESIN: Do you have a costume? Like a baked good? 
LAURA: I don't. I just have normal clothes, you guys. We have-- Hey! We have a Mighty Nein hoodie. (cheering) 
MATT: Oh, that's rad! 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LAURA: You might know our Bells Hells hoodie. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful! 
LAURA: This is a Mighty Nein hoodie in the same style. We got two versions. 
LIAM: Sick! 
LAURA: So we got this, ooh, fabulous, dark navy. Get ready for a big change, because-- This is US and Canada. In the UK and EU, you get a light navy version. 
TRAVIS: Oh! (laughs) (exclaiming) 
LAURA: Can you see how different it is? It's a little bit thicker, too. 
TRAVIS: Zippers are different, too. 
LAURA: Yes, yes. So yes, this is fabulous art by Nina Matsumoto, and the Mighty Nein crest is by Crystal Sharp. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful. 
LAURA: Thank you to our fabulous artists. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
LAURA: Also, you guys, I have something else to talk about that's not just merch. We are doing, next Thursday, we're participating in Creators in Fashion. 
TRAVIS: Hey! (cheering) 
LAURA: It's a livestream fashion show featuring content creators and their merch lines, which is pretty awesome, and I'm excited about it. 
MATT: Marisha will be showing off the same outfit, I think? 
LAURA: Yeah, we're going to have Marisha walk in the hotdog. 
TRAVIS: Louis Hot Dog. 
ASHLEY: Tight. 
TALIESIN: Adding some sauerkraut, some relish. 
LAURA: We did not design this hot dog. We will not be showing this hot dog. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: You can tune in starting at 3:00pm Pacific on the Style Theory YouTube channel and bring your questions to be answered live in chat, because we're going to do that! I know that. (laughter) 
LAURA: Anyway, I'm done talking. I'm very excited about it. You should tune in. 
MATT: Hell yeah. Thank you, Laura. (applause) 
TRAVIS: Well done. 
ASHLEY: Woo-hoo! (laughter) 
MATT: Marisha, go ahead. (laughter) 
LIAM: That hot dog costume is the exact opposite of a hot dog. 
LAURA: Yeah, no, seriously. 
MARISHA: I know. I know. 
LAURA: If you stand, does it look more like a hot dog? 
MARISHA: Not really. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's like a Central Park hot dog. 
LAURA: No. 
TALIESIN: No, it's worse. Somehow it's worse. 
ASHLEY: They forgot-- 
MATT: It looks-- 
ASHLEY: The dog. 
LAURA: You're the dog. She's the dog. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: She's just a little pearl up at the top. 
MATT: It's more like lazy falafel. 
TRAVIS: You got it, you got it. Go. 
LAURA: Keep going. 
MARISHA: The finale of Candela Obscura-- 
TALIESIN: Speaking of cosmic horror. 
MATT: Yep. (laughter) 
MARISHA: -- Circle of the Crimson Mirror is coming next Thursday. 
TRAVIS: Next Thursday! 
ASHLEY: Woo hoo! 
MARISHA: We love what this cast has brought to Newfaire, and you will not want to miss what their final investigations bring to Oldfaire. 
TRAVIS: Oldfaire. 
MARISHA: (mystical burbles) Remember that you can tune in any time, as each episode is standalone, but if you want to catch up, you got plenty of time. You can do something like YouTube or podcasts or Twitch or whatever. Liam O'Brien is killing it! 
MATT: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Yay! 
MARISHA: You're doing great! 
LIAM: Yeah, anyway, thanks for spoiling the ending. (laughter) 
MATT: She is the crimson mirror. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Are we not delving-- Well. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: We've released a brand new update to the Daggerheart playtest material. 
TRAVIS: Daggerheart! (cheering) 
MATT: If you haven't yet, you can download and play version 1.3 now, at daggerheart.com/play. Be sure to watch the update livestream from last week with Spenser Starke and myself diving into the details. Or you can check out our changelog on daggerheart.com to understand what updates have been made to this system so far and why, and how you can easily incorporate them into your game. If you've already downloaded them all, there's an easy download that just includes all the changed cards and things that you can really quickly swap in. But if you haven't had the chance to check it out yet, now is indeed the perfect time. You can run games with a group. You can build characters solo. Or even try it virtually with Daggerheart Nexus on Demiplane. 
TRAVIS: Demiplane. 
MATT: So thank you for all of your continued feedback on the game. Such an important part of the game development process. You've already helped us tremendously in making it even better than it was when we started, and that will continue forward as we're eager to see what you think about the latest changes. So thank you so much. 
TALIESIN: Open beta. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Open beta. 
MATT: Open beta. I believe that concludes our announcements. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: I want to eat cake. 
MATT: So let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of--

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off, Bells Hells, after making contact with the Volition, agree to aid them in a number of their current simultaneous goals against the dark leaders of Kreviris in hopes of gaining information and aiding the revolution against the Ruidian tyrants. Upon these missions, much information was gained, some dangerous circumstances occurred, and yet you survived and endured and began to flee the city as chaos began to erupt from within. During this time, after calling towards your mother and sending her into a personal crisis about what's right and who to align with, she scattered off into the dark shadows of the caverns. As you fled towards the surface through some of these winding rock tunnels, you were hunted by Otohan Thull, the Legend of the Peaks. During this fight in which your terrifying foe unleashed her true capabilities, many of you fell and barely scraped back from the edge, but one of you did not. Fresh Cut Grass, the friend and ally who had recently come to truly realize his worth sacrificed himself to save the rest of you and to fell for good the foe that had long hunted you. In that fugue numbness of realization, you grabbed what you could, what remained of him, and what you could from what remained of Otohan Thull, continued to flee to the surface where you emerged. There amongst the red Ruidian landscape, the distant storms roiling, Liliana descended from above, and seeing the hurt in your face and all of your faces, realized what had likely transpired. It was here, still not truly grasping or processing what has happened and what is next, you stare upon the alien landscape and partially obscured horizon. 
LIAM: Exhausted, but immediately trying to figure out where we are, if I recognize it, if anyone besides her mother is present, coming, are we in danger? Lay of the land. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LIAM: Rerolling the one. That's 28. 
MATT: 28. Glancing around best you can, and it's fairly clear in the area you are now, the dust storms currently sit at least a number of miles off, though you're uncertain how fast they're moving at a quick glance, you do not see any other figures immediately present. 
LIAM: Are we amongst the towers that were used for lookouts-- 
LAURA: Yeah, the guard houses. 
LIAM: -- and security, is that where we are, where we've resurfaced or are we in a place that we don't, that Orym doesn't recognize? 
MATT: So where you've pushed out from here, one of these side caverns, you took a look behind you and you can see the base of the mountain range that encircles Kreviris and continues past it. So you are just outside the city itself. You do not see any immediate outposts, but you figure if you were to leave a little further out, you would be essentially out in the open, visible from many of the outposts that encircle the crown-like mountainscape that surrounds the valley at the top of the city. 
LIAM: Directly-- Last clarification question. Is it obvious yet the direction from where we came from to get here, to get to the city? 
MATT: You can very easily see the Bloody Bridge, the single beam of red energy that sits in a direction which helps you orient yourself and your location right now from where you came. 
LAURA: How do we stay out of their sight? Are there any crevices in the ground? I know there had been cracks and whatnot on the way here. Anything to hide in? 
MATT: I mean, if you get really close to the base of the mountain, there's probably some little alcoves you can pull in to stay out of any immediate sight. Any larger dips or cracks in the ground where you could hide from sight are a good 500 or more feet out and would probably put you out in the open before you reach them. 
LIAM: Where are you at? Are you able to take us underneath? 
TALIESIN: If there's something to get down there. I don't know what's down there. I'm going to see what's below us. Take a deep breath, and I'm going to-- 
MATT: (burrowing) You grind through the ground and vanish below. While you're currently looking, Liliana is still gliding about a foot off the ground, her hair drifting.			 You can feel, almost taste the energy that sparks in the air around her. She's still just locked in on you, her face still sad. You can see the streaks of, not sure if they're tears of sadness or anger that have since dried and smeared what dirt was along her face as she looks towards you for guidance before she looks away. "I don't know what's going on, Imogen. I don't know what to do." 
LAURA: I take her hand. I don't either. 
MATT: "Well, y'all can't stay here. Going to have to-- We can't stay here." 
LAURA: Are you staying? 
MATT: "If I go, they'll know. What's more useful? If I leave, they'll-- I mean, the rest of them already have been tough enough to get them to trust me. Am I more useful here to what you're doing, or am I more useful leaving it behind? I don't--" 
LIAM: I mean, we'd sure love to know what's in your head. 
LAURA: We don't know enough. You said-- You said you're the vessel? 
MATT: "As far as I understand, in order to reawaken and get to this god eater, this Predathos, there are boundaries, shells, things that imprison it within itself, set up by the gods. I don't know the specifics. Maybe you know better," as she gestures over to Evoroa, who is still processing and clutching with all four of her arms towards her chest right now, taking in in shock all that's transpired. (Liliana) "What I do know is that the Ruidusborn-- We're part of pushing through that. We're supposed to be what can break the final boundary. We have something within us, something that the gods can't stop, and only we can truly reach him. From what he said, in order to get it beyond and back into our realm, it needs a vessel, something to carry it past that threshold." 
LAURA: Then you can't stay. 
MATT: "I'm not the only possible vessel here. I'm afraid of what'll happen if I'm not here to try and do what I've been doing." 
LAURA: Which is what? Control it? Try to control Ludinus? 
MATT: "At least-- At least slow and focus what's happening." 
LIAM: If you're used as a vessel, no guarantee you'll be in control of yourself. If you're not the vessel, what are you going to do against a god eater? With us, we're armed with information. 
MATT: "I ask you this in earnest. What is it you fear about this god eater? Let's remove Ludinus from the equation. Let's absolve ourselves of that. What-- What are you afraid of?" 
LIAM: Unknown consequences. You cannot guarantee me or anyone. You do not know what will happen if that thing is unleashed. 
MATT: "I have had quite a few communions with him." 
ASHLEY: Huh? 
TRAVIS: You've had quite a few? 
MATT: "I know. I know you've been resistant, and rightly so. I've told you to, but I have, and many of us, especially since coming here, we've-- We can feel and we can-- I don't think it wants us. I don't think it cares." 
LIAM: Ma'am, Ms. Temult, I cannot take your word for it. 
MATT: "I understand." 
ASHLEY: What do you think it wants? 
MATT: "It wants to be awake, free of its endless dream. It wants to be free." 
MARISHA: You say it doesn't care about us. What makes you think apathy is any better than disdain to a god eater? 
MATT: "It's hard to explain, but there's something. Something just feels right about the path of what it wants. I'd say I could show you, but I think things are a little intense right now and--" 
TRAVIS: We don't have the time. We might've been getting one side of the story. You saying it wants something besides god eating? 
MATT: "It's real tired of being here and it's real angry at those who put it there and it's real hungry." 
ASHLEY: For what? 
MATT: "For what it naturally hunts." 
TRAVIS: Gods. G-O-D... S. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: We got to get out of here. We got to get away from the cities. I know there's so much to say, but-- 
MATT: Make a perception or survival check for me. 
TALIESIN: Pfft. Nine. 
MATT: You cruise around for a bit and you're starting to get a little close to not being certain how long you have left on this, but I'd say after a good chunk of time, you don't sense any other helpful caverns or such. 
TALIESIN: I would've rolled up and been listening. Just shoulder up and-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: The ridge line then, the base of the mountain. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's the best call. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MARISHA: The secret. Secret one? Yeah. We certainly can't go to the Bloody Bridge, unless you can guarantee us safe passage. 
MATT: "How else would you get out of here?" 
LAURA: We'll go to the Bloody Bridge. It's the only way out. We have to. 
ASHLEY: Well. We could also... 
LAURA: Go to the Bloody Bridge. 
TALIESIN: Go to the Bloody-- 
ASHLEY: Go to the Bloody Bridge because-- 
LIAM: Are you coming with or are you staying? 
ASHLEY: -- that's the only way to get home. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "How am I more useful to you, Imogen? If I come with you, I can't continue to tell you what's happening here. You won't know what change has happened should you come back, how they're changing things or preparing for if not you, whoever else is behind you. I assume a lot of Exandria is ready to come up here to unload a hellish payload of the gods' smite. I cannot even begin to imagine." 
LAURA: I hug her. What if they pull you away again, though? 
MATT: "Then you know what to do." 
LAURA: How will we talk to you? I feel like if I try to talk to you in a dream, then they'll hear everything. 
MATT: "I think if you're not here, we can find each other safely. I think we can do that safely." 
LAURA: Then stay. You stay. 
MATT: It's odd. You see a combination of heartbreak and relief wash over her. There's that glimmer in her face where you see part of her, part of her really did want to go with you. 
TRAVIS: I don't mean to interject, just a question. I would love to, like Orym said, believe everything that you're saying, but if you've really been trying to slow this down and we seem to know your heart of things, this whole mind stuff, they just jump in and out of people's domes. Are they going to be able to tell your true colors now? 
MATT: "They haven't fully trusted me because I don't think they can. In fact, I think the Weave Mind, the Weave Mind and Ludinus have a unique dynamic and Ludinus was the first Exandrian to make contact with the Weave Mind, about three centuries ago, from what they told me. It was through them he was able to talk, too, about The One Who Sleeps. But they both use each other for their own ends. I think they do so knowingly, thinking that they'll be able to pull the final piece. I think it's that dynamic that's helped me play the mother hen to a certain degree. But the Weave Minds don't trust us Exalts." 
TRAVIS: We saw them. They saw us. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Briefly. 
LAURA: Right before you showed up. 
MARISHA: And what of Otohan? Was she just a rabid dog? 
LAURA: Right after you showed up. Sorry. 
MATT: "Otohan was one of the possible vessels, one that I don't think we have to worry about anymore." 
LAURA: How many more possibilities are there? 
MARISHA: You certainly had no control over her. 
TALIESIN: Gosh, I hope that's true. 
MATT: "Awakened... maybe four. But I know they're trying to instill some of the other dormant powers to reach their true potential." 
LAURA: How do they do that? 
MATT: "Through turmoil. Through training. Ludinus often needs those, but he's not even here right now." 
LAURA: Where's Ludinus now? 
MATT: "I know he's on Exandria." 
LAURA: Insight check. 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
TRAVIS: I'll aid you while staring at you while you stare at her. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: 23. 
MATT: 23. She's being pretty straightforward. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: Evoroa peeks up, breaks from her shaken staring and, "I think I, I think I know where he is." 
LAURA: Great. 
ASHLEY: How? 
MATT: "I think I know. Part of what I was working on with him was put on hold because-- I've been tangential to his work. Me and a small other team, we've been assembling this, these devices he'd been bringing from Exandria, the Vanguard and other-- What's he called them? The Assembly defectors. Gathering this tech from underneath some of the nearby factions back home for you folk and... There'd been some problem. Something had been taking up home in the source of these pieces, and I know he mentioned something about having to deal with this, this thing." 
LIAM: Ms. Temult, it sounds like you know that Ludinus is a son of a bitch, and you know that Otohan has murdered many. 
LAURA: Yeah, we got to go. 
LIAM: You know they're not altruists, so it's hard for me to fathom why you think that whatever comes next is not bad. Ludinus isn't doing anything if it doesn't bring him power. 
MATT: "Ludinus is following a plan that was set out for him by The One Who Sleeps and The One Who Sleeps just sees him as a part of its plan. It's so hard to convey if you haven't seen or felt what I have, but--" 
TALIESIN: It's not hard to understand at all. I know self-delusion when I see it. I know it myself. You're in. Clearly, you're in, and you're going to think you're going to be careful, but I think your worst fear is probably my worst fear. And we've just got a fucking sample of it. I want you to think about that and think very carefully when things start to go wrong, and they will for you. Will you hear the mental cries of your daughter when Ludinus finally decides it's time to murder her on Exandria? Do you think that'll break through, or do you think you're going to be surprised? 
MATT: "Do you think, should we stop all this from happening and re-seal or maintain Predathos' endless slumber, that those of us who know this, those of us who are designed to be part of its freedom are just going to be allowed to walk free? What, do you think the great temples of your world aren't going to hunt us down one-by-one 'til there's no possibility of this plan ever coming to fruition? You don't think every great politician of our world that isn't tied into this truth isn't going to try and bury each and every one of us for what we're part of?" 
LIAM: Cold comfort for my family in the ground. 
MATT: "I'm sorry." 
LIAM: Are you? 
MATT: "I am." 
LAURA: Can I say in Orym's head: I don't trust her either, but we keep her on our side so we learn the truth. Don't push her away. 
MATT: "I don't fully know the depths of what the Vanguard has done to get where we are. I've only come to realize the barbarism that has been explained as necessity and I'm well aware of the horrors that they are and I wrestle with that guilt in any part that I have aided unaware." 
LIAM: Keep wrestling. 
MATT: "I'm too deep in this to just walk away." 
ASHLEY: I have a question. When did you become a follower of all this? What happened enough to where you decided to leave your daughter? 
MATT: "I went to the-- Went to the Conservatory in Jrusar when I was having these dreams, these visions. I was afraid that it meant I was just going to bring something awful upon my family. So I asked for some sort of guidance. Through these studies and this research, eventually I was visited by Ludinus, who had a personal interest." 
ASHLEY: Sure. That makes sense. 
MATT: "Then, if I'm going to be honest, he was a teacher. He was a guide. I was scared, I didn't know what was happening. For a number of years, he helped me learn to control, to ground myself, to feel like maybe there was something, something important, something I was meant to do that could free myself of this burden and free you of it, too. I just didn't realize what, what was being done until I was already unknowingly complicit. Now, I'm just trying to figure out what's right and what, what can be done." 
ASHLEY: It's never too late to leave, if you're uncomfortable. Just putting that out there. 
MARISHA: With all due respect, Miss Temult, we've all been through quite a lot. Forgive any of our rash comments. But I do fear every moment that we are here diminishes the chances of us getting out of here. 
LAURA: We should go. 
MARISHA: Do we have your word that you will lead us on this side? 
MATT: "There's nothing in this world more important to me than you. You're the reason I chose to even go on this path. Not of your fault, but my own." 
LAURA: Is that the truth? Because obviously, there's something more important to you. You say you want to go home, you say you miss it. I see you. I see you. This is home. 
MATT: "You spend enough time in a dark place, you forget what home looks like, and that doesn't mean the yearning is gone. Especially when it finds you again. 
LAURA: Don't put that choice on me, then. You want to find your place, you come back. If you've found it, then you can stay. But please, help us, wherever you are. 
MATT: "I will." 
MARISHA: This is your chance to prove it, then. Looks like we all have a lot to prove, make good on. 
LAURA: How can we get away from the city safely? 
MATT: "Give me your hands." 
TRAVIS: (clutches) I'm in. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Evoroa reaches out and grabs in. (forceful whoosh) There's this immediate rushing of air and sound. (forceful whoosh) You feel this immediate impact, like someone had punched your gut, but without pain, just the air forcefully leaves your chest for a second. Your lungs-- (gasps for breath) As you inhale, you feel the red landscape bend inward and then, (forceful expansion) as it reflexes back out, you're standing at the base of the Bloody Bridge-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- carving upward, up towards Exandria above. You are still in the middle. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: You can see yourself standing there in the moment. There are other soldiers. There's quite a large military presence surrounding you, but none of them seem to be reacting to your presence. 
LIAM: But at the center, within stone's throw? 
MATT: Within a 10-foot walk-- 
TALIESIN: What? 
MATT: -- from the Bloody Bridge. You are right in the middle of the military encampment you landed at when you arrived at Ruidus. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
TALIESIN: What the actual fuck did you do? 
ASHLEY: What are we going to do when we get to the other side? 
TRAVIS: Act as if-- Act as if, act as if. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
LAURA: What do we do when we get to the other side? 
MATT: "Find those who you can trust, and find me when you need my guidance. I'll see you in your dreams. Now go, quickly. I can't hold this long." 
LAURA: Oh, shit. I got one health point. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: There's no choice. We've got an army around us, so when we go-- 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: I hate this. 
MARISHA: This is not what we were-- (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I hate this. 
MATT: You see this faint trickle of blood curling down her nose as she's concentrating. 
MARISHA: Does it look like she's time stopped or something? Are people-- 
MATT: It looks like their surrounding space is-- You can see guards there, but as they shift, it's super slow. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh fuck! 
TRAVIS: Oh, her flex on them! 
LAURA: Amazing. 
TRAVIS: I mean, fuck her. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: She's so cool. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Can you learn that? 
LAURA: I want all of her power! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Maybe we just harness-- 
TRAVIS: (questioning potion gulp) 
MATT: You have a harness for that. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I think that's how you get it, right? 
ASHLEY: Just suck up her powers. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Just grab her by the back of the neck. 
TRAVIS: Okay, let's go. 
LAURA: All right. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
MARISHA and LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: (running start and leap) 
MATT: (rapid suction) You're all leaping, one after another, into the Bloody Bridge. As you're stepping through, you hear in your head-- 
TRAVIS: That was clutch. 
MATT: -- "I'm sorry." (launches) Take off into the sky. The rushing of the energy pulling you up through the scattering sense of power itself. You see other things going (rapid travel) coasting by from the opposite direction, as from the outskirts of the rushing red energy, like the push of a massive fire hose of magical power pushing you back towards your home world of Exandria. It emerges and all of you (whooshes) end up now standing at the base of the Malleus Key's top 
LIAM: At the top, the little stairs? 
MATT: The little stairs. You all emerge here. As you glance around, it is evening, you're not sure where. With some clouds in the sky. 
LAURA: What's going on around us? 
LIAM: Yeah, look around. 
LAURA: I'm going to take a health potion. 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
MARISHA: Wait, what do you mean we're not sure where? We're not back at the Malleus Key? 
TRAVIS: No, no, no. 
MATT: No no, you-- 
TRAVIS: He was asking. 
LAURA: Unless you have a healing spell. 
TRAVIS: Because when we left it was all fucking-- 
LAURA: Do you have any healing spells? 
MARISHA: Fucking crazy. 
TRAVIS: -- getting shot at. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I do. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to-- 
LIAM: 28 perception for people that could kill us. 
ASHLEY: Let me see, let me see. 
MATT: Yes. Immediately, you see-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, save that. 
MATT: The entirety of the interior of this place is the same encampment that you saw, but there are regiments of Ruidian soldiers at the ready. You can see there are weapons set up on the sides of this space. This is, essentially, an evening military encampment at rest, not dislike where you left, it's just in a less chaotic space. Nobody's looking up, nobody's noticing you at the moment. You're not sure how long you have. 
MARISHA: But they are patrols? 
MATT: There are patrols. There are probably, even at first glance for you Orym and even those around, you can see somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 to 100 different individuals that are scattered throughout. Only a handful are walking while others are sitting and resting, and others are preparing weapons, others are just settling. 
TRAVIS: We could try and ask to be taken to Otohan's quarters to drop off her stuff, if they haven't realized that she's dead yet. Or we could try and walk out of here. 
LIAM: We could also just behave like drones and walk out of here. 
TALIESIN: Let's just drone and walk. 
LAURA: We are still in the red gear, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: We are. We got stopped plenty on the way down. 
MARISHA: Does anyone have any Pass Without a Trace situation? 
ASHLEY: I do, I do. 
MARISHA: You do? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Let's do that. 
LAURA: All right, so we'll try to act like we belong here and head on up and-- 
LIAM: But I can't remember, does Pass Without A Trace help us with the act casual? 
TRAVIS: No. 
LIAM: No, right? 
LAURA: Yes, it does. 
LIAM: Does it? 
MATT: It helps with the stealthiness of it, of physically stealthing around. As far as passing yourselves off-- 
TRAVIS: Just blending in in plain view. 
MATT: Yeah. Into crowds, I would say that is more of, in this instance, which you're moving through here-- 
TRAVIS: Deception checks? 
LIAM: I mean, it's helpful and you can do it when no one's looking, but the first 200 feet, it's just us passing-- 
MATT: Yeah, Pass Without a Trace is to not be seen. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: If you are noticed, then that's where more deception would come into play. 
MARISHA: I mean, we could try and stack it, I guess. 
LAURA: Yeah, try to be-- 
MARISHA: Might as well. Unseen, but in a-- 
LAURA: Nonchalantly until we are noticed. 
MARISHA: We're supposed to be here. 
MATT: A group deception check would mean you could pass your way through here without issue. If you do a stealth check and it fails, then you've caught attention and then the DC for deception gets higher-- 
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
MATT: -- because now you've drawn attention. 
ASHLEY: So we just try to be nonchalant. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: So it's up to your call. 
TRAVIS: I think that's a-- 
MATT: Pass Without a Trace-- 
LAURA: There's too many people. 
MATT: -- does give you a plus 10 to stealth. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: What do you want to do? 
LAURA: There's too many people. 
ASHLEY: I think we just-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace? 
ASHLEY: We just go? 
MARISHA: Just deception? 
LAURA: No, I think we just deception to see if we can-- 
ASHLEY: Use deception? 
LAURA: -- try to be nonchalant. 
LIAM: Yeah, deception, deception. 
ASHLEY: I could try to disguise myself as a-- 
TRAVIS: I think, just to say it, I think, statistically, we have more of a chance of failing a deception check without any buffs as a group than with Pass Without a Trace plus 10. 
TALIESIN: That's true, because I'm a negative two deception. I'm also a giant fucking monster. 
TRAVIS: Just to be that fucking goober. 
ASHLEY: You're not wrong. 
MARISHA: We can always try it and then go to plan B, which is deception. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: Energy wise, I feel like we would try and blend in, but the mechanics are different. 
MATT: It's up to you all. 
ASHLEY: Yup. Pass Without a Trace? 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: You are also descending from the top of the Malleus Key first. 
LAURA: Which is really in the middle of everything. 
MARISHA: Does it do a-- (spectacular entrance) 
LAURA: Super visible. 
MARISHA: -- when we bamf people in? 
MATT: Yeah, there's a flash. 
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think we can just stealth. 
TRAVIS: You want to go for it? 
LAURA: Yeah, we have to look-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- like we belong here. 
LIAM: It makes the most sense if we walk. 
MARISHA: Then let's all do the thing where we surround Imogen like she could be Liliana. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MARISHA: Bodyguards. 
ASHLEY: Should I Disguise Self as a Reiloran? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Disguise Self as a magnificent Reiloran. 
LAURA: I'm going to tie my hair over to the side so it looks like a braid. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Like her. 
MATT: All righty. So as you all, the few of you prepare yourselves visually and now as a group, begin to descend, I'd like a group deception check. 
TRAVIS: (anticipatory laugh) 
LIAM: Deception. 
TALIESIN: This is where I really hope you all roll well-- 
TRAVIS: Why can't it be better? 
TALIESIN: -- because it ain't going to be me. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Not bad. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: 23. 
MATT: 23. 
TRAVIS: Natural 18. 
MARISHA: 22, natural 17. 
LAURA: Do we have advantage at all on this? 
MATT: No, the DC's adjusted based on the fact that you are wearing-- 
TRAVIS: Remember that statistical thing I was talking about? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: But advantage, like you could roll again? Is there anything like that? 
MATT: What you got? 
ASHLEY: 11. 
MATT: 11. Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, boy. No! 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
TRAVIS: Who? Who? 
ASHLEY: No. 
LAURA: Me. 
MARISHA: No! 
ASHLEY: No, no. 
LAURA: I rolled a one. 
TRAVIS: That's so fitting. 
MARISHA: No! 
TRAVIS: That's so fitting. 
ASHLEY: We fucking just-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) I just said it. 
MARISHA: Somehow Chetney and I-- 
LAURA: I rolled a one! 
MARISHA: -- are the most convincing? 
LAURA: I rolled a one on my Imogen dice. 
MARISHA: How? 
LAURA: I should not have rolled my Imogen dice because I'm not Imogen right now. 
MARISHA: Oy vey. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, So, as you all emerge and begin to descend the staircase that leads down from the top of the Malleus Key. 
LAURA: I'm sorry. 
MATT: You coasted down amongst the various ruins and the large military tents and gathered bits of materials. You can also see other war beasts from Ruidus have begun to make the transition to Exandria. The military defense of the Malleus Key is growing larger. You can see the edges of the actual Tishtan site. There are signs of massive battle. While you were gone, it looks like either a major scuffle happened and a section of one of the inner walls of it is blown open and there's a massive cave-in landslide that happened there. So it looks like the escalation of might and assaults on this space, or at least defense as well, shows violence is increasing. But as you're taking these in and you begin to maneuver, you, Orym, notice that two Reilorans are gliding by. Not walking, gliding. What you see are two Mystics that-- 
LAURA: God, of course they recognize us. 
MATT: -- take attention as you come down-- 
MARISHA: Mystics. 
MATT: -- the steps and begin to pursue. 
LAURA: Just two. 
ASHLEY: Just two. 
LIAM: We got a tail, I think to Imogen. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: As they begin to get closer, you also watch as they pass through groups of people. 
LIAM: Are we all brain linked? 
LAURA: We're not brain linked anymore because FCG is dead. 
TRAVIS: (stress laugh) 
LIAM: Yeah, that's true. 
LAURA: In your head, I can say: I can fly two of us. 
MARISHA: How close are they? 
MATT: Right now? Maybe about 120 or so feet away. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But they're starting to gain speed a bit, and you watch as they pass through or nearby other soldiers and Vanguard members. They all-- 
ASHLEY: Oh fuck. 
MATT: They're all being-- 
MARISHA: Alerted in their heads? 
MATT: -- alerted that something's off. 
LIAM: This is going bad. 
TRAVIS: Going to have to give them a story. 
LAURA: What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? 
TRAVIS: Are we repairing Otohan's equipment? 
MARISHA: Let's keep going until they get within 60 feet. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Just keep walking. 
LIAM: Plan was to flip to-- 
ASHLEY: Just keep walking. 
LIAM: -- deception. Oh. 
LAURA: I don't have-- 
ASHLEY: To stealth? But yeah, that doesn't-- 
LAURA: There's no way to flip to stealth. 
ASHLEY: I know. I should've done that first. I know, I was with you. 
LAURA: I get it, Travis! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: We fucked up! I rolled a one! 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MARISHA: We got this! 
MATT: That's how it works. 
LAURA: I could've rolled a 20! But I rolled a one. 
MATT: It's all good. That's how it works. 
MARISHA: Guys, luck is on our side. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Let's just keep walking. Let's just keep walking. 
MARISHA: Keep walking. 
ASHLEY: Keep it going. We're good, we're going to get out. 
LIAM: This is what's known as a lucky streak. 
MARISHA: I feel like I still smell like that hot dog costume. Goddamn it, just keep going. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: "Still." 
TALIESIN: My head can't-- 
ASHLEY: Actually, you smell pretty good. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (grossed out noise) Keep going. 
MATT: You watch as Vanguard members begin to-- After they're essentially pinged in proximity to these Mystics, begin to reach for their weapons and begin to stand up and all begin to follow behind them. There is a slow, growing makeshift battalion that is beginning to close in behind these two Mystics as they begin to gain on your somewhat quickened pace. But still walking. 
MARISHA: I tell Imogen-- When it's time, turn around and tell them they're dismissed. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: We have no need-- 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Of their support. 
LAURA: When they're closer? 
MARISHA: Yep. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: 80 feet. 70 feet. 60 feet. 
LAURA: I stop walking. 
MARISHA: I cast-- I Twinned Spell. Oh my god, I hope this works. Twinned Spell, Phantasmal Force. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's my last 2nd-level spell. And what they see is Liliana Temult. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: All right. Spell DC on this? This is intelligence saving throw? 
MARISHA: 18. 
LAURA: Oof. Intelligence. 
MATT: 18. Ah, natural six. 
LAURA: Ah! 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: What's the second one? 
MARISHA: I don't know. I don't know. I just want this spell to work once this campaign! 
LIAM: Smart idea. 
MATT: So you turn around, mutter a bit beneath your breath and release the invisible bonds of the spell against their minds to ensnare their perception. What do you do, Imogen? 
LAURA: I turn around and I look at them. No need for an escort. You're dismissed. 
MATT: Both of them stop. And drift around the opposite direction. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: You watch as the-- 
TRAVIS: Body shot, body shot, body shot! 
MATT: The rest of the gathering crew slowly-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: -- dissipate, shake their heads a bit, shake free of the brief influence calling their attention. 
LIAM: That was super smart. 
MATT: They all begin to scatter back to whatever they were doing. 
MARISHA: I'm out of sorcery points. 
LAURA: And we-- 
MATT: You out of sorcery points now? 
ASHLEY: Keep going, keep going, keep going. 
MARISHA: That's it, that's it. 
LAURA: ♪ And get up and out of ♪ 
MARISHA: Still got some spells, but-- 
LAURA: ♪ Here please ♪ 
MATT: All right, you begin to trek up-- 
ASHLEY: Keep walking, keep walking. Keep walking. 
MATT: -- the nearest incline that guides up the side of the tall Tishtan Excavation walls. Heading up that way, you see one of the large warders, like (stomping sound). Heading down, you have to move to the side as it gets near. 
LIAM: That's a tall drink of warder. 
MATT: (stomping) 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: It walks by and takes in your troop. It continues walking. (stomping) 
LAURA: If we look around, do we see Planerider Ryn? (laughter) 
LAURA: Do we see a statue? Do we see an armless statue anywhere? 
TRAVIS: Moved to a place of convenience on the way out. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Just as a hat rack. 
LIAM: A potted plant. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Just decor outside a tent. 
LAURA: Anywhere? Just anywhere. 
MATT: Roll a perception check. 
LIAM: My eyes are so good. My eyes are so good! 
MATT: Yeah, both of you roll perception. 
LIAM: I'm always looking. 
LAURA: We're just rolling. 
TRAVIS: Just don't roll a one. 
LIAM: 30. 
MATT: 30? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Pretty good. 
LAURA: Oh, that's better than my 15, but I still rolled 15. 
MATT: Still pretty decent, yeah. 
TALIESIN: I ain't looking. 
MATT: You actually feel pretty confident that she's nowhere-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: -- around the Malleus Key. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You also are pretty confident you don't see any pieces of her, you don't see any signs of a shattered statue. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) What about a toe? 
LAURA: Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: A stony toe? 
MATT: But, while this is where she was turned to stone, you get the immediate sense that she's been relocated. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Why is that woman dressed like a hotdog? 
LAURA, MARISHA, and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Who knows why mad people-- 
TRAVIS: It's so uncomfortable. 
TALIESIN: -- do what they do. (laughter) 
MATT: Orym rolls high enough to see into the real dimension. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) "Why do they have dice? What does that mean?" (laughter) (lingering laughter) 
LAURA: Atreyu, call my name! (laughter) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: (sighs pleasantly) 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: What an existential crisis everyone would have. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, it's Bastian. My bad. 
MATT: Yep, Bastian. 
LIAM: (sighs pleasantly) 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: How dare you? 
LAURA: How dare! 
MATT: "Moonchild!" Which you can't even hear in the movie. 
LAURA: I know, yeah. 
MATT: Anyway. Eventually you push past and get up to the edge. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Moonchild ♪ 
MATT: Looking up, you can still see the beam of the bridge coasting up to the red Ruidus moon. You can see some of the heavy clouds that looks like a storm just passed over maybe a few hours before, and is now moving away. The open night sky, the welcome sense of familiar air, and being outside of the immediate space of tension is very, very welcome. You, looking around the perimeter, can see multitudes of defensive weapons that have been set up. Some look like there of a Ruidian make, some of them have been moved from other parts of Exandria. There are multitudes of designs, different cultures pulled together, as well as some unique cobbled weaponry that you're not entirely familiar of how they would function defensively or aggressively, offensively even. But you recall the basic direction of where you were brought here from the west-side encampment where you were carried via Keyleth. Looking at the vicinity of where things are set, Orym, especially with that 30 perception, you'd know which direction is west from here and what would get you probably closest to that encampment. 
LIAM: Okay. All right, so I'll point that out. Are there still skyship wrecks all around as we move through that? I remember that. 
MATT: Oh yeah. There's a unique graveyard around the exterior of the excavation site that includes numerous destroyed skyships, numerous destroyed military siege weapons and wagons. As you continue to walk through, not being bothered by any of the exterior watchers who don't immediately take any sort of interest in the robed figures, slowly doing a perimeter around the southern edge. The only time that they would probably draw any attention is when you just start walking out into darkness as a troop. But as you pass through here, you can see all matter of large craters that have slammed into the surrounding ground. Signs of mass detonations, the land itself scarred by recent battles. You see bits of armor. You recall before seeing this. You can see along the outside there are pikes that are adorned with trophies. You see different temple-themed armor sets, pauldrons and chestplates that are adorned with the symbol of the Moonweaver. You can see holy symbols that are hung on the edge of iron spikes that are jammed into the ground that hang and dangle, where at the end of the chain, you see swinging a medallion of the Duskmaven. You can see all manner of captured holy imagery that now is set upon the outskirts of this site as a warning and as a sign of pride that any who steps beyond-- 
MARISHA: Do we see-- 
LIAM: Changebringer? 
MATT: -- stops here. 
MARISHA: Do we see any symbols of the Changebringer? 
MATT: With your perception, it takes a little bit of a walk and you have to get a little close to the edge to really pick it up with as little light as there is. But you see along one of the torches that matches the perimeter there, one of these ever-burning magical torches flickers, you see the familiar sight of what looks to be a cloak that, as it hangs tattered and torn as it flows with the occasional breeze, you can see the familiar symbol of the Changebringer, her face still standing there from the side, looking off to some unknown horizon. 
LIAM: I'll grab it. Can we find a place to lay low for a little bit? 
TALIESIN: We're not there yet. 
LAURA: Yeah. I am going to-- I still have 3rd-level left and I don't know if it'll work here, but I'm going to try Sending. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: See if I can send a message to Keyleth. We're back. We're at the surface of the Malleus Key. Just trying to find a way to get back to you. 
MATT: Doesn't take too long for her to respond. "(sigh of relief) That is wonderful news. I'll be at the encampment as soon as I can. Can you get there safe? Oh, that's not how this works. (stammers) I'll--" (laughter) 
LAURA: I love it! 
MARISHA: 40 years using this spell and still don't fucking got it. 
ASHLEY: Shit, yeah. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: "Aw, fuck. That's right. Ah, fuck." (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Wait, does that count-- 
LAURA: The encampment, the encampment, the encampment, the one we were at before? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah, it was one of a number of encampments that had been built on the outer perimeter of the Hellcatch surrounding the space where a lot of the-- 
TRAVIS: Staging grounds? 
MATT: Yeah. Where what military might is being spared at the moment from different nations and city states and such are being sent in preparation to both keep an eye on the site and, previously, help give you the smokescreen to make your infiltration. 
LAURA: Is it evening, did you say? 
MATT: It's evening, it's dark. 
LAURA: Okay, so it is getting dark. So we can stealthily maybe make our way out. 
TALIESIN: At some point, we're going to hit it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: From where you're standing now, this would be a great time for-- 
TRAVIS: Are you sure you don't want to use a deception check to try and get around? 
LAURA: Hey, fuck off. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: "Hey." (laughter) 
MARISHA: I love that. "Hey." 
TRAVIS: "Hey." 
TALIESIN: "Hey." 
ASHLEY: "Hey, fuck off." 
TRAVIS: Yeah? 
LIAM: They were such a cute couple. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) (laughter) 
MARISHA: #goals. 
LAURA: Hey. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (slow-mo knockout) K-O. (laughter) 
LAURA: But you still have a Pass Without a Trace. 
ASHLEY: I do. 
LAURA: So we could use that as we wander away. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I do, I do. 
TRAVIS: Just like you planned it. (laughs) 
LAURA: Just like I planned it. 
ASHLEY: Just like we had talked about, and we're going to do it now. 
LAURA: It doesn't matter, Marisha saved the day, and it's fine. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: We could've done it before, we're going to do it now. It's no big deal. I'm going to do it right now, Pass Without a Trace. 
MATT: Okay, so you cast Without a Trace, the shadows cling to your robes. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Can I get a group stealth check from you all, plus 10 to your final rolls. 
LAURA: (laughs) Okay. ♪ (waggles tongue) ♪ 
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's what I get. That's a one. 
LAURA: Did you roll a one? Did you roll a fucking one? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: No way. (laughter) 
MARISHA: No way! (laughter) 
LAURA: That is karma! 
TRAVIS: That's so appropriate. 
LIAM: (chanting) That's just right. 
ALL: (chanting) That's just right. 
MATT: All right, so we got a one over here. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: Wonderful. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MARISHA: 29. 
TRAVIS: You dick! 
MATT: 29, okay. 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
ASHLEY: 16. 
MATT: 16, okay. 
LIAM: You're a shadow. 
LAURA: 28. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: 22. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 24. 
ASHLEY: Great, great, great. 
MATT: 24, okay. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend some time-- 
ASHLEY: Hey. Fuck off. 
TALIESIN: -- jumping in the pool. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. I'd say about now it's starting to wear off, because you guys have taken the time both slowly coasting around the outside of this. So you start diving in for a bit and you feel like the ground's getting more resistant and it makes you feel a little nervous to continue. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take what I've basically been using as some nice quiet scream therapy. 
TRAVIS: Aw. 
LAURA: Aw. 
ASHLEY: Aw. 
TALIESIN: Jump back up and turn into crystal. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You forgot Vowels. 
MATT: (sadly) Oh. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: No Letters. 
ASHLEY: I probably have dropped mine as well, because I'm sure I wasn't walking around all like-- (aflame) 
MATT: Correct, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's actually pretty valid. Thank you for reminding me. I assumed you might've wanted it. So you both do take your two points of exhaustion. 
LAURA: Woof. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Which it does wind you and your speed is reduced because of the exhaustion. 
ASHLEY: I am so fucking tired. 
MATT: So you're traveling-- The rest of the group is traveling at the speed of your slowest members. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Which would be Fearne at half speed right now. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's right. 
ASHLEY: Half speed. 
LAURA: So we're limping away-- 
TALIESIN: 15. 
LAURA: -- from this horrific experience. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: I mean, that's about right. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Except Chetney. (galloping footsteps) 
ASHLEY: 35 feet. Yeah. 
LAURA: Skipping. 
LIAM: Oh, he's gone. 
TRAVIS: (runs into distance) 
MATT: As the shadows do enswirl your troop and you peel off from what was the feigned perimeter walk of your group from the site, you begin to make a western beeline in the direction where you hope you'll be able to see the encampment. The tension begins to fade after about five or so minutes when you do not see any of the other perimeter guards following suit or taking note of your divergence from the site. Now, as you all quietly walk under the stars of the Exandrian sky in silence, looking across the distant rocky barren horizons of the Hellcatch, really the first moment hits in where you get to begin to process what you've lost. 
LAURA: I'm going to turn around and look up at the moon. (sighs) That was awful. 
LIAM: We're still just wandering the desert en route to this encampment? That's where we're at? 
MARISHA: He didn't have to do that. Letters. 
TALIESIN: He had been itching to do that since the day I met him. 
MARISHA: It's funny, it's the first thing I thought about, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I knew he was just going to pull that shit. God fucking damn it. 
MARISHA: I remember your warnings to him. 
LIAM: I've seen enough fights go south. If Letters hadn't done that, we'd all be dead. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
MARISHA: I just felt like we were so close, we could've had her. We don't know that, you don't know that. 
LAURA: She was too strong. He saved us. 
TRAVIS: He made it count. We've got to do the same. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I can be angry at the same time. Those are really easy to hold together. (sighs) That little fucking... (angry grunt) 
ASHLEY: Where are we going? 
LAURA: Back to Keyleth. We have to tell them everything we learned. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We need more help. 
LAURA: I hope we made the right call with Liliana. 
TALIESIN: You were never going to get her to-- 
LAURA: She would've come, I think she would've come, but I didn't trust her. 
MARISHA: I think it's smart to give her this opportunity to prove herself. You've been without your mother for so long, what's a few more months if it gives us the advantage? 
TALIESIN: It wouldn't have worked. 
LAURA: I know. 
TALIESIN: She would've come because you said so, that just is a fucking disaster. 
LAURA: I feel like-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
LAURA: I feel like that shit with Ludinus, I think she-- I think she doesn't support him, I do believe that now. 
LIAM: Mostly. 
LAURA: I felt that hold, though, that Predathos has, I felt that welcoming warmth that she spoke of. And she's been there so long. 
LIAM: Yeah, she clearly has her criticisms of Ludinus, although that sounded pretty tangled, too, her history with him. But she definitely seems like a believer in Predathos. 
LAURA: I think it's more than that, I think-- I think he's part of us. We're his children, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah, that bit she said at the very end, that this is what you were designed for. 
TALIESIN: That hit you, too, didn't it? 
MARISHA: Yes. It made me think of FCG, and it also, I feel like I owe you an apology. I feel like I understood your mom on a deeper level in that moment. I think it's just reminiscent of something that sounds like we all struggle with, not being able to supersede that feeling of being designed, controlled, manipulated. (sighs) But it also just made my heart break for her. Feels like we've been very privileged to go on a journey guided by FCG to learn more, that we're more than just what our creators intended for us. And I don't think she's had that. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Made me sad and grateful at the same time. 
ASHLEY: Mm. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It made me angry. I don't like being angry. You're too fucking good for her. She doesn't deserve this fucking world. I hope she's right. Really do. I hope her ends are fucking great because these means are just not forgivable. 
LIAM: Chetney. Where's Otohan's shit? 
TRAVIS: Here. 
LIAM: Lay it out. 
TRAVIS: (bangs) 
LIAM: Lay it out. I walk over and I pick up the sword, one of them, I jam it in the soil. That is the blade that killed my father and my husband. She is not right. I'm going to walk away from this group for a little bit. 
TRAVIS: (sighs) 
MARISHA: Imogen? 
LAURA: Yeah? 
MARISHA: I love you. 
LAURA: I love you, too. 
MARISHA: I love all of you. Just perhaps we should say it more. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: FCG was so unique. I mean, every time someone saw him, they reacted like they'd never seen such a thing before. But your mom left us with such an interesting tidbit of info, that Ludinus was on Exandria overseeing the pieces of machinery that were being brought up. 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, I turn to-- Aw, fuck, what's her name? 
MATT: Evoroa. 
LAURA: Evoroa, sorry. 
ASHLEY: Oh shit, I forgot she was here. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah, Evoroa just like, "Eee." 
ASHLEY: Welcome. 
MATT: (laughs) She's like, "It happens a lot, actually." (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
MATT: "It's fine." 
LAURA: Chetney's going to fuck you, I have a feeling later. I don't really say that out loud. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Is this the first-- Above table, I know that there are the floaty beings, but one of the Bormodos? 
LAURA: Yeah, the first-- 
LIAM: We've never seen a Bormodo on Exandria? 
LAURA: Uh-uh. 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, this would be a big deal. 
MATT: You can see her, while you guys have been having this conversation, she's a little bit behind you and is just taking it all in. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit, right, fuck. 
LAURA: Aw, shit. 
ASHLEY: Welcome to Exandria. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Welcome to the Blue Dream. 
MARISHA: Promise. 
LAURA: The Blue Promise. 
TRAVIS: Promise? 
LAURA: Yeah. It's not blue right now. 
MATT: "No, it's not at all." 
LAURA: But there is some, I swear. 
TRAVIS: What do you think of the sky? 
MARISHA: It's not normally like that. 
ASHLEY: That's where you lived. 
MATT: "It's so much smaller from here." 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's had some work done. Things are weird out here right now. 
ASHLEY: There's some prettier, better spots here. 
TRAVIS: We're going to find friends, people that you can trust. But until then, just keep a low profile. 
MATT: "Of course, no--" 
TRAVIS: Take your time. 
MATT: "I will. Thank you all so much for helping get me out of there." 
LAURA: Of course. Thank you. 
MATT: "I haven't done anything yet." 
LAURA: I have a feeling you will. 
MARISHA: I'm assuming those machines that Ludinus was dragging up to the moon have something to do with what we found in that crate. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: With the Cerberus Assembly marking. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to get all this stuff to Imahara Joe and-- 
LAURA: Mm. 
TRAVIS: I feel like there's more there. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's-- This feels like morning problems. 
LAURA: He said you knew where Ludinus was. Do you have a city name? A location? 
MATT: "Yeah. I don't know where it is, but he's referred to it a few times." 
LAURA: What did he say? 
MATT: "It's called Aeor. It's where he's getting all these things and where we--" 
ASHLEY: (exhales) 
MARISHA: Is that where he is now? 
MATT: "I don't know where else he'd be." 
MARISHA: You mentioned he ran into problems? 
TRAVIS: Motherfucking-- 
LAURA: Fucker! 
TRAVIS: -- Matt Mercer. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I'm sorry, what was your question?" 
MARISHA: The Cerberus Assembly's been obsessed with that Aeor shit. 
TRAVIS: MFMM! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: MFMM? 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
LAURA: That's a T-shirt. 
TALIESIN: #NewTattoo. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wait, what? I don't get it. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Motherfucking Matt Mercer. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (babbling) 
TRAVIS: (sighs) 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You see her start-- Her awe shrinks in as she starts getting technical and you can see why she was chosen for this in the moment. There is a curiosity and a passion for this element of her intellect, though as unfocused as she might be at the moment. She goes, "Well, so a lot of this tech was being brought in there. We were able to combine it with some of our initial designs of shifting and changing up our developments for various war implements here on Ruidus. They had developed a lot of things based around this thing, this Malleus Key he was talking about, and it was-- So part of my thing was to help originally to design tools that were used to burrow through the outer layers of the glass pillar where Kreviris was." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "It's an impossibly thick layer of glass, but the Exaltants, when they came in here and began to consult with us alongside Ludinus, they began to speak as they communed with the being of the planet, moon, I guess, to you. (laughs) There are multiple layers to this glass. The outer layers were simple enough to get through with some of this tech, if we designed it, but the secondary layer that we got through was like adamantine. It seemed like it had some sort of a divine magical origin in its construction. You know, our standard designs were too slow in trying to get through there, given the rapid timeline of what was going on and mounting opposition from Exandria. As you said, across the bridge was starting to grow tension, so Ludinus was going to go back to seek out what tech was available. It was supposed to be--" 
LAURA: In Aeor? 
TRAVIS: Metal. 
MATT: "From Aeor. There's supposed to be a continued source of it being excavated from his troop, his Vanguard, his allies, but there was a problem there. Something called, he called it the Dominox. It--" 
LAURA: Dominox? 
MATT: "It had begun to take up root there, was causing struggles with their excavation, and so he was going to take care of it himself." 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: "That was just a few days ago." 
MARISHA: The Dominox is what took up root-- 
TRAVIS: In Aeor. 
MARISHA and LAURA: In Aeor? 
TRAVIS: It's messing up the-- 
LAURA: So wait. So he went to go fight some big, powerful thing, right? 
TRAVIS: Some bad bitch called the Dominox. 
MARISHA: Who's-- 
LAURA: What if it weakens him enough that we pop in? 
MARISHA: (hyperventilates excitedly) 
LAURA: And then-- 
MARISHA: We're like, bam, bitch! 
ASHLEY: (hyperventilates excitedly) 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MARISHA: Wait. 
TALIESIN: Slowly, you're going to hurt yourself and fall unconscious. 
MARISHA: Did Ludinus mention if Dominox is a big beasty? Or is it like a group of things? 
TRAVIS: Let them s-- 
MATT: "I barely caught just the tail end of that conversation." 
LAURA: Maybe, maybe-- 
TRAVIS: Evoroa, keep going. Ignore us. We're just, we're stopping-- 
LAURA: Maybe Keyleth knows something about Dominox. 
MARISHA: (hyperventilates excitedly) 
LAURA: Have we ever heard of Dominox? 
MATT: You've never heard of Dominox. 
MARISHA: Keep going! 
LAURA: It's just icing now. 
MARISHA: This is all gold! 
TRAVIS: Story time. 
TALIESIN: I cannot follow any of this. 
LAURA: I know. 
MATT: "Anyway, from what we were understanding, there were certain implementations of magical synergies and the technology that was being presented as part of our study group, that the tech had a unique understanding of the weave of godly magics, divine-type magics, and how to unravel them on a very base core point." 
MARISHA: Oh. Okay. 
MATT: "So this was the basis of our project, a means to penetrate the secondary glass shell that contains Predathos within. So taking inspiration from the, what's it called? The Malleus Factorum--" 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: "-- and the other trickles of nearby tech and essentially develop it in a smaller scale that we'd be able to go through these additional layers of the--" 
MARISHA: The god adamantine stuff? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "So, apparently the glass veins that run through the planet are the remnants of Predathos' last form when it was locked--" 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: "-- within its prison--" 
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait. Can I pull out the-- 
TRAVIS: (shouts) We need to stop interrupting the story! 
LAURA: I'm sorry. I just wanted to-- Okay, cool. Go, go. 
TALIESIN: They're never going to stop there. 
MATT: "So, yeah. That's the theory." 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: I'm sorry! 
TRAVIS: Jesus! 
LAURA: Well, can I pull out the little globe-y thing that we got? The little globe-y. Oh, that's in the bag of holding. 
MATT: It's in the bag of holding. 
LAURA: Okay, never mind. 
MARISHA: (grunts in suggestion) 
LAURA: Look, oh, these look like-- Wait, how is this-- 
MATT: "No, right. That right there. So, we've been unable to map deeply without the help of the Exaltants, and when they are able to connect with the aid of the Weave Mind to deeply bind with the essence of Predathos, they were able to feel out the extent of the vein network. We were uncertain of the source. Just we knew they were resonant with The One Who Sleeps, but from what we're gathering, that was likely a reflection of its form when it was sealed away, so the glass is what its body once was then turned to be its own prison. So whatever it is sleeping within is within its own glass prison and the layers between, and that's where the tech and the Exaltants, that's where all of this is supposed to come together is to break past these boundaries and then free it from its prison shell of what it once was. Yeah!" 
MARISHA: Would you know about this whole vessel business? Is it basically going to possess one of the Exaltants so that it could walk across? 
MATT: "That I don't know." 
MARISHA: Yeah, okay. 
MATT: "They keep us all siloed. I only know what I can because I was having to keep ears open for the Volition and getting back what I could when I could." 
TRAVIS: Could also be more than one. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that and maybe the vessel is not for Predathos. It's for Ludinus? 
LAURA: Hm, I don't know. 
TRAVIS: I mean, it might not just be one person that's a vessel. 
LAURA: It might be multiple vessels. 
MARISHA: Multiple, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Multiple vessels. 
LAURA: His Horcrux or soul. 
TRAVIS: Could be a sacrifice, could be a host, could be a, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Could be a ton of stuff. Dominox, the Malleus Factorum. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: Ludinus wanting to be like an Exaltant Ruidusborn. That was interesting too. 
LAURA: Ooh, look at your nails. They're so cute. 
MARISHA: Thanks! 
TRAVIS: I mean, been playing so long, I can't remember which character knows what. (laughter) 
LAURA: I know! 
ASHLEY: I know. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I know. 
LAURA: We don't know about Aeor? We don't know about Aeor? 
LIAM: I don't know what that means. 
MATT: No. All you know is-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, what do we know about Aeor? 
MATT: Aeormaton, you know that's-- 
MARISHA: Right, we've heard it. 
MATT: Yeah, you've heard about it. You know it was an ancient society where FCG and FRIDA were both constructed. 
ASHLEY: I remember some of that vision. 
MATT: This kind of-- 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA and LAURA: FRIDA! 
ASHLEY: Oh, fucking FRIDA. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Oh, you're just now thinking that? 
TRAVIS: You're just thinking about it now? 
MARISHA: I thought about it, but it's been a week and I forgot! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: And now I'm remembering again. 
TALIESIN: It's been nonstop in my head. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, we have to tell FRIDA. 
MARISHA: Oh, he's going to freak! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's not going to-- One awful moment at a time. 
TRAVIS: By the way, we haven't had a moment to stop since we've been running. Are you hungry, thirsty? Are you okay? 
MATT: "Oh." 
TRAVIS: It's been a sprint since we got you out of that-- 
MATT: "Yeah, I'm-- I don't know how long its been since I've eaten or had a drink. I'm feeling real rough." 
TRAVIS: I got some basic rations. 
MATT: "If you got something for me I'm--" 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Orym can make blueberries. 
LIAM: He's 40 feet over there. 
TALIESIN: Orym is far away. 
LAURA: I thought maybe you came back just a little bit to hear everything down there. 
LIAM: I listen. I have a passive perception of 33. I've heard it all. 
LAURA: Okay. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He's clocking it. 
LAURA: Okay, just making sure you knew what was going on. 
MATT: She immediately begins to devour whatever you hand her. 
MARISHA: Just tell them all of it again. 
MATT: And scarfing in a messily way. The large hands grabbing and handing them to the smaller hands which are pushing them up into the face, and it's a four-armed feeding frenzy. 
LAURA: We still have your-- 
MARISHA: Cytaa. 
LAURA: Your cytaa. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Aw. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to start putting everything back in the bag of holding. Can I take, with reverence, can I take the sword out of the sand and just look at it? 
MATT: Yeah. It is a sleek saber-like weapon. It has a very faint curve, the thickened blade itself having nearly no hilt, and where the hand wraps are you can see a tight leather cross wrap across it. Where it fits the bottom of the pommel, there is a long set of leather wraps that swing as it goes and it moves. There's a bit of a hook towards the back of it, and the blade itself has a very-- You don't even notice it at a distance, and you now realize the pain that it has. There is a faint serration along the edge of the blade about halfway down that goes to the base of where the base of the hilt would be. It is extremely light, and even just holding it there's a faint vibration to it with each swing. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: This is Ishta, the Summit Blade. 
LAURA: Ishta. 
MARISHA: The Summit-- 
LAURA: Well, maybe we can absorb that shit. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's going to be permission. 
TRAVIS: That is going to be. 
TALIESIN: That's not our sword. I am lying down on my back because everything fucking hurts and waiting for everyone to decide what the fuck we're going to do. 
LAURA: Well, we have to get to the encampment. Keyleth is waiting for us there. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
TRAVIS: Do we want a short rest where we are? Should we push on? 
LIAM: Let's push on. 
TALIESIN: Short rest ain't going to fix anything. 
LAURA: Yeah, let's push on to the encampment and then we'll be safe in Keyleth's bubble. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: Evoroa walks over to you as you're lying on the ground and extends an arm to help you up. 
TALIESIN: (grunts painfully) Thanks. 
MARISHA: Ashton, you all right? 
TALIESIN: Say that again? 
MARISHA: I know you're not all right. 
TALIESIN: No. Are any of us? 
MARISHA: Will you be? 
TALIESIN: Will any of us? I think the answer to that is, yes and no. There are particular moments, I have discovered, in a person's life where they have to decide what they're going to do next. They often start this way, although at a smaller scale. I think I need to sleep. I think I need this headache to go away. I think I need to break something, and then, you know, I think in the morning start having some thoughts about who we're going to be next. (groans) You seem very lovely. I hope that you do great work. You were very expensive. I start slogging very slowly towards the direction we're going. 
LAURA: I'm going to head towards Orym. Oh, sorry. 
MATT: I was saying, yeah, as you walk away, she brightens up at the first thing you said and then darkens with a sad expression, taking in the connotation of it and "(sighs)" and continues to follow in pace with the rest of you. 
LAURA: I'm going to heard towards Orym who's at a distance and approach slowly. 
LIAM: Hey. 
LAURA: Hi. I'm going to put my hand on your shoulder. 
LIAM: Sorry, I know how hard all that is for you. 
LAURA: Don't apologize. I can't begin to understand how hard it is for you. 
LIAM: You know, every one of us makes our decisions with the lenses or prisms we see life through. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: I can't take mine down. (sobs softly) It's not even about revenge for me. (sniffles) I just try and honor what they signed up to do. 
LAURA: I didn't know them, but I can't imagine they wouldn't look at you and not be proud. 
LIAM: (sighs sadly) 
LAURA: I think you've gone farther than anyone could ever expect you to, and you're still going. 
LIAM: (sighs softly) (sniffles) So far. I'm going to miss him. 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm going to miss Letters. (sniffles) 
LAURA: They were-- They were alive. 
LIAM: Out of any of us, he just wanted to help. 
LAURA: I want you to know that for a while it may have felt that you and I were not seeing eye to eye or maybe you felt that I, I didn't have the same goal in mind that you did. But don't worry about that anymore, all right? 
LIAM: I understand family. 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
LIAM: I want for all the world for you to have your family. 
LAURA: I wanted that, too, and (chuckles) god, that back and forth is a pretty funny thing, but choices were made. If nothing else, then at least we've got a little bit of knowledge on the inside now. 
LIAM: Yeah. As much we'd like to, you can't turn back the clock. 
LAURA: That's right. But you've got us. 
LIAM: Going to squeeze your hand a little. You mind if I take a minute? 
LAURA: Take all the time you need. We're heading to the encampment. 
LIAM: I'll catch up. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Just stare out into the dark for a half a minute or so and I pull out the stone and reach out to Dorian. We're home. Can you hear me? I'm northeast of Bassuras. Can you get there? I'm (voice cracking) struggling. Sorry. Can you get here? Fuck, I miss you. 
MATT: As the words leave your lips and the spell sends them aloft, I'm going to ask you all to leave the table, please. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (exhales softly) (sniffles) 
MATT: If you don't mind. 
TRAVIS: To leave? 
MATT: Yeah. To leave leave. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Leave. Get out of the table. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: (gasps) Okay, fine! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: If you don't mind. 
MARISHA: Oh, whiplash! 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
LIAM: Let's go find that hot dog costume. (laughter) 
LAURA: I want a hot dog real bad. 
MARISHA: Real bad. Oh shit! 
LIAM: Fucking Aeor. 
ASHLEY: Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. 
MATT: (chuckles) (rubs hands) (inhales and exhales portentously) 
AABRIA: You know what? I think I'll take it from here. I think it's time to see the other half of the story, and we'll do that after the break. See you soon.

NARRATOR 2: Suddenly, the mirror pitches to the side as it swings open on a hinge, "Angel of Music" style. Lark's arm reaches out of the dark doorway behind it and pulls Phineas through. Leaving the eternal light of the Un behind, the disguised duo descends a claustrophobic, cave-like staircase into windowless darkness, tunneling down, down, down into the mica of the city's bedrock NARRATOR 1: The natural crystal of the walls has been polished and thickly coated in an opaque black paint to block out its luminance and to seal in its sharp, hazardous mica texture. NARRATOR 1: Except for small, bare, gently luminous patches here and there, giving just enough light to see by. NARRATOR 3: Darkness doesn't just happen in the highest light - it has to be meticulously manufactured, engineered.

ANNOUNCER: We now go live to a special address from the President. GALE: Hey, dweebs. Now as your president, I've been kind of killing it lately. I gave global warming an atomic wedgie. I balanced the budget by selling my Pog collection, and I saved the Queen of England from that octopus! But my kick-assery is far from done. According to this chart that I made, an estimated 35% of you are still a bunch of nasty goobers, but don't worry, I have a plan. Operation: Gag Me With A Spoon. It's easy sleazy. According to this study that I wrote, if every citizen subscribed to Critical Role on Twitch, we could reduce maximum goobage by a metric buttload. Twitch is the only place where you'll get a live and moderated chat. And! If you subscribe to Critical Role, you instantly get access to all their shows as soon as the live broadcast ends. So while you're oogling those Critical Role dorks with their sick goof-'em-ups and their nutty voices, think of me, Gale, the current president of (blows raspberry) whatever. Now, I got to go make a fresh batch of spitballs, but I guess I have some time for your boring questions. You. REPORTER 1: Gale, is it true that if you subscribe to Critical Role through Prime Gaming, you have to resubscribe every month? GALE: Uh, yeah. I do it right after my monthly prank call to Pee-on O'Brien. Next question. REPORTER 2: Does Critical Role have exclusive emotes for their subscribers? GALE: Uh, doy. Of course they do. I like the "Hello, bees!" one because bees are cool. I replaced my whole security detail with a bunch of bees that think I'm their queen. Last question! REPORTER 3: Yeah, with all due respect, is Operation: Gag Me With a Spoon a real policy, or are you mad goofin'? (record scratch) GALE: (scoffs) Am I mad goofin'? What, do you see me scarfing Milk Duds while doodling ding-dongs in the SkyMall catalog? Listen, I know I'm new to this. And I admit that when I made the wish to be the boss of everything, I did not know the witch that works at Woolworth's was listening. Well, Faustian bargain or not, I am the president now, and I have an obligation to lead this country. So to answer your question: No, I am not mad goofin'. Security, take him out! (bees buzzing) REPORTER 3: (panicked yells) GALE: (cackles) (blows raspberry) Later, chudruckers! (large explosion) (fireworks exploding) 

Part II[]
AABRIA: Vibes. We're here, we're back in a different time slot. This is nice. So, my lovely Crown Keepers. Kymal. After the events of our interlude those long, long weeks ago, you all moved north past the Silvercut Crossroads to lay low in the Wildwood Valley. The settlements you dared stay at for more than a few days are more village than town, but the narrow edge of your escape from Poska and the Nameless Ones has you cagey. What's the true distance of her reach? How far would your sister go to find you? And what do you think, Fy'ra Rai, she would do if she found you again? It's been almost a month of low living. The six of you, Cyrus included, have a small cache of brumestone that you all harvested from your slow moving getaway platform. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Yeah, honestly, the first three weeks was you just slowly drifting. (laughter) 
ANJALI: Can I use my staff to move this thing faster? Can I row? Can I row? 
ERICA: Paddle with our hands. 
AABRIA: Cyrus has been doggy paddling for weeks. 
MATT: Yeah, we've both been back there. 
MATT and AIMEE: (blowing air) 
MATT: That checks out. 
AIMEE: Two little bimbos (blows air). 
AABRIA: Two little bimbos just blowing in the breeze. Yeah, you guys were able to harvest the brumestone from your platform. You have it secreted across the six of you, so in the event that you have to scatter, you all have access to an incredible amount of money, were you able to find a place to fence it. You are not too far from Kraghammer, Westruun is a little farther away, but those are big hubs. Poska's reach might get there. The Myriad, the Clasp, the people that were pushed out in Kymal. You are some of the few survivors of whatever went down there, and a big city isn't safe. But two weeks ago, something new began. Whispers reached even your remote ears. A solstice, the Moon of Ill Omen, the Blightstar lost from the skies of Tal'Dorei trapped over Marquet. Disenchantment of old and powerful magics. No sending, no teleportation, no resurrection. Those of you with connections to the gods of this world, the Wildmother, the Spider Queen, the Matron of Ravens, and even the Observer. You have felt a pressing on the threads of your connections with them, from the Prime and Betrayer Gods, your first inkling of fear, and even from the Observer a new bit of interest, curiosity about the goings on in this world. And then, a message from Orym, desperate, so sad. Halfway around the world, he bade you find the Tempest in a tone that pushed your group from hiding to haste. So you find yourselves on the road once more headed south, then east towards the Summit Peaks and Zephrah. You walk. This time has been dark and difficult for you all not just because you have had to settle for living and hiding no longer around the glitz and glamour of Kymal, the standard of living that you were all accompanied to. Even Cyrus has been showing signs of getting a little antsy, a curiosity, a need to move in a new direction. Then, again, Opal's been getting pretty dark lately. As you travel, I want to know just from the group, what's on your mind? What are you doing? What is your plan? Is it just to find your way to the Tempest to assist Dorian once more in his quest, or are you looking for something different, something new, somewhere new to go, or a sign to maybe splinter off and head in your own direction for new adventures? 
MATT: See, Dariax has no drive or goal outside of the people that he's attached himself to. A sense of kinship with those that he's traveled with and have been kind in his ramblings and stumblings, but also a renewed sense of protectiveness over Opal in these recent weeks. A concern means he's liable to stay at Dorian's side, to follow in his footsteps even further, but also not far from Opal to make sure he shows where to put her footsteps. 
AABRIA: Protector. 
ERICA: I think Morrighan could best be described as a dog, a dog on a leash or a horse chomping at the bit. She has been given so much new purpose in giving herself to the Matron of Ravens as her champion. She doesn't feel that she deserves it, but she loves this new sense of purpose that she has because that's all she ever wanted. The second that she left Kymal with these new comrades, I think she thought that everything was going to align for her and then she found herself more lost than ever, and sometimes changing location doesn't solve all of your problems. And she feels distant because the people that she's with have a bond that is different than what she has and she has a new allegiance to the Matron. The second that she says bite, she'll bite; it doesn't matter who it is. 
AABRIA: Lying in wait. 
ANJALI: I think after the discovery of the situation and change of heart, or so Fy'ra thinks a change of heart from her sister, she too has been, not lost and not fully demoralized, but just confused as to where she is most needed now. She does remember once telling Dorian that, "Not all family is blood, much family is chosen," and so she's doing her best to divert her protective nature even more to these people who she was sent, pulled by the Wildmother to protect. She's still feeling that loss of that one person that she was so connected to who now apparently doesn't just hate her, but wants to kill her. 
AABRIA: Conflicted. 
ROBBIE: I think over the past few weeks, this should be the scenario for Dorian that he thought he wanted: freedom, adventure. It's not so much the situation that's dragging his mood down these days because he's glad to be surrounded by his friends and he's glad to have friends truly for the first time ever. But as he's had more time alone and as he feels the group start to drift, he's starting to come to a realization that's unsettling for him and that he's missing something in this equation that he thought would lead him to the right answer and its purpose; and I think it's something he ran from months ago, something he felt like he didn't have and wanted and wanted to just forget about. As he looks around at these people that he's grown to love and growing to love and being with, he's starting to wonder why he's here for the first time ever. Yeah. 
AABRIA: From drifting to searching. 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
AIMEE: I think Opal is in a strange, almost dreamlike existence where I think she's losing the thread a little bit. I think there are moments of clarity, and when there are those moments, she works overtime to be more herself around her family because she feels like if she can keep it together in that way then she has some sort of control over it. But I think, much like when you're in that space, that space between falling asleep and being awake, it's all very confusing. In the moments where it feels a little more dreamlike, I think you may catch her with a far away look on her face or maybe murmuring to herself. It's very concerning to her, but she's not wanting to alarm anyone yet. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: What was that? (laughter) 
AABRIA: Opal, I like that you said dreams because I think your dreams were the thing that went first. It is not that you go to sleep and have nightmares, but I think in your youth you would go to sleep and dream or have a nightmare and have some memory of it upon waking, even if it slips away across the day. But every night now, for two weeks, you go to sleep and you wake up exhausted as though your body has been tense, moving. Recovery is difficult and whatever happens from when you close your eyes and give yourself over to sleep and waking is a void and lost. Anytime you reach within yourself towards Ted, towards whatever that connection is for clarity or understanding, the first thing you notice is that every dawn, if you reach for Ted, she is exhausted. If you ask her, if you press, she tells you little and less. She doesn't want to worry you. It's not your fight. And that's the important thing. You know there is a fight happening and you have no recollection of it. Two weeks, and now you're on the road again, traveling long days down the road, exhausted. It is at some point, just a few days into your journey towards Zephrah, towards purpose or adventure or whatever comes next after your last big quest, you feel it. Something inside you breaks. Too tired. Too much holding it together. Your mind is yours and Ted's and hers, and she has been whispering to you. You feel that fear, that concern oppressing, a hastening, and it all becomes too much. You all walk down the road, and Opal stops. Frozen, she's looking a thousand yards away in a direction as if she's listening, trying to hear, trying to understand, but she is stock still. What do you all do? 
MATT: Hey, Opal, you feeling all right there? 
AIMEE: Can I hear him? 
AABRIA: Give me a wisdom save. 
AIMEE: Save? 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm, with the difficulty 16. 
AIMEE: Oh! 16. 
AIMEE and AABRIA: (laugh) 
AABRIA: It is like someone is shouting at you while running backwards. You hear him closely at first, but it seems to be drifting off and away. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: You can respond. 
AIMEE: Did you say something? 
MATT: Yeah, yeah, you're just, you know, look how you're getting one of those distant moments again. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
MATT: Last time. Just want to make sure you're all right. 
AIMEE: Yeah, I think I'm-- yeah. Did you guys hear anything? 
ERICA: Huh? I grab my rapier and I look around and see what I can possibly perceive. 
AABRIA: (laughs) Make a perception check. That was the strongest ask for a perception check I've ever had. Please take inspiration because that was incredible. 
ERICA: Perhaps what I perceive-- 
AIMEE: The plosives! 
AABRIA: Make an investigation check! 
ERICA: Thank you. Oh, I wish it was perception-- 
AABRIA: No, it's perception. It's 100% perception. 
ERICA: Ah, bless you. Thank you. Oh my gosh. Oh, oh, 15, oh. 20. Unnatural 20. 
AIMEE: A very strange 20. 
ERICA: A strange. 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
AIMEE and MATT: A spooky 20! 
ANJALI: Bizarre 20! 
ERICA: Weird 20! 
AABRIA: The spookiest 20! 
ERICA and ANJALI: (tongue waggling) 
ANJALI: (laughs) 
AABRIA: We got to get these chuckles out now. I'm so excited. 
ROBBIE: What? 
ANJALI: (concerned noise) 
AABRIA: What do you think, what's the first thing that Morrighan would look for? 
ERICA: Well, I'm still keeping Poska and the Nameless Ones in the back of my head, so I'm trying to figure out if maybe someone's around or afoot, like a person in the trees. Where are we? Are we on just a dirt country road? 
AABRIA: Yeah, you guys are actually a little bit off of the main road. You're walking through the wooded area just off to the side-- 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: -- just in case, being extra cautious, extra safe. 
ERICA: Yeah, I'm afraid for many reasons, and also because the balance of magic is so thrown off that I'm like anything could happen at any time. I really-- Poska. I don't know, a goblin. I don't know. Name your names. (laughter) 
ANJALI: Joe. 
AABRIA: That felt mean to me, specifically. 
ERICA: Maybe your name isn't real. (laughter) 
AABRIA: I will not give you my true name! 
ROBBIE: Your choices are Poska and Goblin. 
AABRIA: Poska, Goblin, end of list. 
ANJALI: Could be it. 
AABRIA: You do not hear the steps of people anywhere around you, but the second half of my question is what is the thing you are most afraid of hearing or noticing? 
ERICA: I feel like I should know the answer to this. 
AABRIA: That's okay. If it's a vague dread. 
AIMEE: An ennui, if you will. 
AIMEE and AABRIA: (laugh) 
ERICA: I don't know, something coming towards me that's too big for me to take on. 
AABRIA: That's just enough wiggle room that I'm going to get right in there. 
ERICA: Oh, sick. 
AABRIA: Thanks so much. 
ERICA: No problem, girlie. (laughter) 
ERICA: No problem, bestie. 
AABRIA: It would be so easy if the thing that you felt on the wind and around you was a monster. A very big goblin. A bunch of guys. 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: But what you feel is the pressure of-- I want to ask you: What did it feel like to Morrighan when she made her deal with the Matron of Ravens, when she committed herself to becoming a paladin? 
ERICA: Oh. 
AABRIA: Of her cause. 
ERICA: I mean, it's ineffable. I mean, finally, for once, I have a direction. 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ERICA: I have a home, and I've never really had one, a purpose. It felt like pure light, even though the Matron of Ravens is most associated with death. I don't even think the idea of something that-- Like, something coming at her that's too big for her to take on. She wants to prove herself so badly, especially because she has all of this new kit, so to speak, whatever in gamespeak like. She has so much to do and she spends all of her days training, trying to figure out how to get a grasp of what she's got. There's an excitement and a fear there for her. I think that's probably the combination of things that she felt when she made her pact. 
AABRIA: Excitement and fear and a desire to prove yourself. 
ERICA: Yes. 
AABRIA: Against something. 
ERICA: That-- 
AABRIA: Against a world, against whatever the spiritual presence you feel and you felt when the Matron of Ravens went from a being of crow and corvid omens to something overwhelming, massive in front of you that chose you, that gave you direction and purpose. You feel that overwhelming feeling again, but it is tinged with something deep in the pit of your stomach. Something that you know that your mistress, it curdles her stomach, so it curdles yours. 
ERICA: And whatever curdles the stomach of death incarnate, that's pretty scary. 
AABRIA: You turn towards that feeling of gravity and you look at Opal, trying so hard to shake off whatever this is. You see it in a flash, in a caw, a bird song before it hits, and Opal, it's not that she raises or levitates off the ground, but she seems to grow massive and then she explodes out in every direction. I'm going to need my map now. We're going to get started. 
ROBBIE: What? (exclamations) 
AABRIA: Bring my map! 
AABRIA: Oh my god! 
ROBBIE: Okay, sure! 
AABRIA: Yeah! I'm sorry. 
AIMEE: Am I dead? 
AABRIA: Yeah, you can go home now. 
AIMEE: Okay, bye. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Actually, that's pretty funny. I think what I want to happen now-- Hey, Matt? 
MATT: Oh. Yeah? 
AABRIA: Can you do me a favor? 
MATT: Sure. 
AABRIA: I think I'm going to need you to slide on over there for me. 
ANJALI: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Over? 
AIMEE: Naur! 
AABRIA: Yeah, over there. 
ERICA and ANJALI: Oh naur! 
AIMEE: Oh naur! 
ROBBIE: Which way? In between who? 
ERICA: This way. 
ROBBIE: This way? 
AABRIA: Scooch! 
ERICA: Actually, you go. 
AIMEE: Heartbreak feels good in a place like this. 
AABRIA: Let's do something a little fun. 
ANJALI: Yep. 
MATT: It was fun while it lasted, Aimee!

ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ANJALI: Absolutely. I can take this out of your way. 
MATT: Oh, it's all good. 
ERICA: It's going to be great. 
ROBBIE: Oh boy. 
AABRIA: There we go. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
ANJALI: (nervous vocalizing) 
AABRIA: Oh, Opal. 
AIMEE: Oh, no. Yes? 
AABRIA: You feel yourself splinter out and the parts of you, inside of you, shoot forth webs, tendrils, held together with points of iridescent, opalescent gemstones. You've been getting pretty dark for a while now, and you hear her voice in your ear, "(laughs) So sorry. I think I wanted us to have a little more time to do this organically, but your sister keeps getting in my way." 
AIMEE: This isn't going to be good for your image. We've been working so hard to rehabilitate. 
AABRIA: "I don't care about my image. I care about my life. What I need more than a rehabilitation in public perception is a champion, a true champion." 
AIMEE: What does that mean? 
AABRIA: "It means, I need you to come with me and I need to sever the ties that keep you with them." 
AIMEE: Why? What did they do? 
AABRIA: "They tie you to this place. They hold you back. What I need is someone who works for me, who serves me. You accepted my crown, and now the bill is due. Opal, twice crowned, You will become my champion." 
AIMEE: Wait, where's Ted? 
AABRIA: "She's here, too." 
AIMEE: Is she hurt? 
AABRIA: "No. I wouldn't hurt you." Opal, you feel inside yourself this conversation happening. But on the outside, all of you see her raise into the air. She lands on a platform, a set of ruins in a bit of forest that, suddenly in that burst of energy, all of the leaves are burned away and scattered. You see bits of webbing, opalescent gemstones embedded across the ground. Opal turns to you all. Aimee, I need you, before anything else happens, to tell me, who's the biggest threat in the Crown Keepers? 
AIMEE: Oh shit. Probably-- What do you mean, threat? What do you mean? Like who can do the most damage? 
AABRIA: What do you think I mean? 
AIMEE: Aimee thinks this is not a question I want to answer. 
MATT: (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Opal is probably the most scared of Fy'ra Rai. 
AABRIA: I need you to make a series of attacks against Fy'ra Rai. 
AIMEE: No. No! (laughter) 
AIMEE: Oh no! (laughter) 
AIMEE: Wait, before I do that, can I cast a ritual? Can I Telepathic Bond? 
AABRIA: I will say, for the sake of your guys' walking through the woods, you would have ritually cast Rary's Telepathic Bond at the beginning of the day. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: So you are all connected in a telepathic group chat. 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MATT: Gotcha. 
ANJALI: Oh, cool. Dope. 
ERICA and ROBBIE: Okay. 
AABRIA: But Opal isn't picking up. True Opal isn't picking up just yet. So what comes now simply comes. 
AIMEE: Okay, so not of my own volition? 
AABRIA: Nope! 
AIMEE: Okay. (sighs) Okay, I'm going to have to Hexblade's Curse her first. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: I'm sorry. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
ANJALI: I love you, baby. I love you, baby. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ANJALI: I know it ain't you. 
ROBBIE: Pull no punches! 
AABRIA: None. 
ANJALI: I know it ain't you. It's okay. 
AIMEE: I'm so sorry. 
AABRIA: Let me be so clear. 
ANJALI: It's okay. 
AABRIA: Aimee Carrero, love of my life. If you pull a punch-- 
AIMEE: I'm not. 
AABRIA: -- I will know. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: And I'll make it worse. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughing) Oh! 
AIMEE: So you don't want me to Charm her? 
ANJALI: Woo! (laughter) 
ANJALI: Okay! 
AABRIA: So I need you to swing. 
MATT: I love it. 
AIMEE: Okay. All right, cool. I'm going to be a big girl about this, and I'm going to-- 
AABRIA: Let's go. 
AIMEE: -- throw three beams of Eldritch Blast. 
AABRIA: So first off, before you attack-- 
ANJALI: Wait, wait. 
AABRIA: What does it feel like when you Hexblade Curse Fy'ra Rai? What does she feel? What does she see? What is the group suddenly made aware of? 
AIMEE: Well, I think to Opal, it feels like when you need to throw up, but you really don't want to, in this case. 
ANJALI: Aw! 
AIMEE: It's that feeling of-- 
MATT: Relatable. 
AABRIA: -- dread, like: Oh no! That: Please help me, someone hold my hair back! 
ANJALI: (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: It doesn't usually feel that way to her, but in this case, because she's a friend, it does. But I think what she sees is whatever Mask of Many Faces, pretty Opal is dropped. 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: It's a very quick look, dart of the eye, and her eyes are just black. 
ANJALI: (exhales) 
AIMEE: It probably feels like a hand around the throat, but it's pink. (laughter) 
ANJALI: Pink hands feel so different. 
AABRIA: Fy'ra Rai-- 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) You feel that grab around your throat, and you look to your friend, and you see Opal, a crown, and then a pink crown below it, eyes dripping black, a set of arms reaching out, a second set of arms reaching down. Make your attacks. 
ANJALI: Real quick, what does Hexblade's Curse do? 
AIMEE: "Once per short rest, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet. Curse for one minute, plus five to damage rolls. Critical hit on 19 or 20 and I regain 18 hit points if you die." Which you won't. 
MATT: (laughs) 
AABRIA: "Which you won't." 
ANJALI: The night is young. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Okay. ♪ (thinking tune) ♪ I add a 10 to each. So, does 21 hit? 
ANJALI: It does. 
AIMEE: Does 22 hit? 
ANJALI: It does. 
AIMEE: Does 13 hit? 
ANJALI: It does not. 
AIMEE: Okay, thank god. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Okay. All right, so now I roll-- 
AABRIA: This is already the most fun I've ever had. 
ROBBIE: Reluctant PvP. 
ANJALI: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: She'll get into it. Don't you worry. 
AIMEE: All right, this isn't so bad. Oh, sorry. 1d4. I rolled d10s. My bad. 
AABRIA: Yeah, two d10s. What are you doing? 
AIMEE: I don't know. d4. I got them. This is my bad ones, too. So this is my bad d4s. 
AABRIA: Why are you rolling d4s? 
AIMEE: Because it's d4! 1d10. You're right. 
MATT: Yeah. It's all good. You got this. 
AIMEE: I'm looking at the wrong thing! 
AABRIA: Hey, Aimee, look at me. 
AIMEE: I'm looking at my vicious whip! 
AABRIA: Here's what's going to happen. You're going to roll 2d10s. 
AIMEE: I got it. 
AABRIA: For the two that hit, and you're going to add plus 10 to both of them. 
AIMEE: Okay. So, 20-- No, 11, and 20. 
MATT and ANJALI: So 31. 
AIMEE: 31. 
MATT: Oof. 
ANJALI: Okay. 
ROBBIE: 31 damage. 
ANJALI: Fantastic. 
AABRIA: 31 damage. 
ANJALI: It's all right. 
AIMEE: (nervous moan) 
AABRIA: With that, you see your friend, you feel a hand around your throat, holding you in place. You are a monk. You move through the world, you bend around nature and keep yourself lithe and agile. You are held in place by your friend, as two dark bolts of energy land center mass in your stomach and there is nothing but to take it. You feel that sense of nausea get chased quickly by two gut punches. Force damage, yes, but betrayal. And I need all of you to roll initiative. 
MATT: Okay. 
ANJALI: Quick question. 
AABRIA: Yeah, of course! 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
ANJALI: This was a surprise, so I wouldn't have a reaction. 
AABRIA: No. No. 
ANJALI: Okay. 
AABRIA: This was my mean little-- 
AIMEE: I think once you feel it, you hear the telepathic, "No, I'm so sorry!" 
ERICA: That means it doesn't count, right? 
AIMEE: It doesn't count. 
MATT: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Yeah, that's what that is. 
AIMEE: God, I'm sweating. 
ERICA: I rolled a natural 20, but I don't think that helps. 
AIMEE: My ass is sweating. 
AABRIA: Yeah, it does. 
ERICA: Oh, it does? 
AABRIA: Yeah, add your dex. 
ANJALI: So 27. Fuck yeah. 
ERICA: 27, baby. Natty 20. 
MATT: Nice. 
AABRIA: Let's go. Anyone above 25? 
ERICA: I went 27, yeah. 
AABRIA: 27 for Morrighan. 
MATT: Woo-hoo. 
AABRIA: All right. 25 to 20? 
ANJALI: 23. 
ROBBIE: 24. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
ERICA: Wow. Okay, gamers. 
AABRIA: (laughs) And Fy'ra Rai, 23. 19 to 15? 
ROBBIE: Oh no! 
AIMEE: Oh! 
ANJALI: Buddy. 
ROBBIE: That's right. 
AABRIA: We're back, baby. 
AIMEE: The Dariax curse of battle roll. 
AABRIA: 14 to 10? 
AIMEE: No! 
AABRIA: No! Hey, I'm just going to ask-- 
MATT: It's nine, baby. 
AABRIA: Nine! 
ANJALI: Okay. 
AABRIA: Dariax with a nine. Opal, how'd you do? 
MATT: Boys are back in town, y'all. 
AIMEE: What do you mean, how'd I do? 
AABRIA: You have to roll an initiative, too. 
AIMEE: Oh, I have to roll, too. Okay. 
MATT: You're in the fight. 
AABRIA: Oh, you're-- 
MATT: You are the fight. 
AABRIA: You're the fight. 
AIMEE: Can I? I think she wants to just walk away at this point. Two! Wait, no. Plus two is four. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: Roll for Ted. 
AIMEE: Oh, Teddy. 
MATT: Oh. 
AIMEE: Sweet love. 10. 
AABRIA: 10. Good to know. Is your familiar out? 
AIMEE: Yeah, that little bitch. Hey, little spider. 
AABRIA: Go ahead and give me initiative for your spider. 
AIMEE: Nine. No, sorry, seven. Seven. 
AABRIA: Copy that. All right, go off, Cyrus. Sweet. Morrighan? 
ERICA: Yeah? 
AABRIA: You are up first. 
ERICA: Sick. 
AABRIA: What you see around you is Opal. You hear in your head after she attacks Fy'ra Rai, "No, I'm sorry." You see this strange battlefield, spiderwebs, glowing. The ground seems to churn and you can hear with your big lagomore ears, skittering, far off and away in the woods. What do you want to do? 
ERICA: I'd like to attack, move and attack. 
AABRIA: Attack what? 
ERICA: Oh my god, I don't know. Do I recognize anything as a-- Is it all one big thing, or is it all these different things? Can I point out one thing that I could actually (pop)? 
AABRIA: Right now-- 
AIMEE: Off the body? 
AABRIA: Yeah. Right now, the only combatant you see is Opal. 
AIMEE: (nervous laugh) 
ERICA: All right. 
AABRIA: Why don't you give me-- Just looking at the lay of the land, the strange new thing that has happened is this webbing and these weird gemstones on the field. Why don't you give me perception or investigation, your call. 
ERICA: Okay. Damn, I rolled a 19. 24 for perception. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
ANJALI: Mm-hmm. 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Perception. You see those shining bits, they are deeply magical. They don't seem-- You're looking for something to hit, and these are not necessarily that. They are something of Opal-- 
ERICA: Yes. 
AABRIA: -- thrown everywhere around you. 
ERICA: So, they're something of her. 
AABRIA: Yes. 
ERICA: So it's all one thing. 
AABRIA: Yes. 
ERICA: Great. I am going to-- Is she 30 feet away from me, or do I need to move closer? 
AABRIA: You are-- 
ERICA: I love that I'm all the way in the back. 
AABRIA: Yeah. Would you have wanted to be closer? 
ERICA: I would like to be within 30 feet of her, if that's cool and chill. 
AABRIA: Sweet. We can say that you started over here. 
ERICA: Okay, cool. 
AABRIA: That's fine. You guys are going to be clustered up. That's not bad for me. 
ERICA: Amazing. 
ANJALI: (nervous noise) 
ERICA: I would like to cast Haste on Opal. 
AABRIA: On Opal? 
ROBBIE: On Opal? 
ERICA: Wait, what? Oh, a willing creature. On myself. (laughter) 
MATT: I was like-- 
ROBBIE: What are you doing? 
ERICA: I don't know why I said that. 
AABRIA: Let me be so clear-- 
ANJALI: Don't give her Haste! 
ERICA: I'm newly a paladin 
AABRIA: Hey, look me in the eye. 
ANJALI: Do you want her to kill me immediately? 
ERICA: I am a child. I am a child. 
AABRIA: Erica, I will Venmo you $20 if you Haste Opal. 
ERICA: I will not-- 
ANJALI: It's going to have to be more than that. 
AABRIA: Right now, I will do it. 
MATT: Respect. 
AABRIA: $30. 
ERICA: I made a little bit-- 
AIMEE: Give her a Celsius. 
ERICA: -- of a mistake, run it back. 
MATT: That's okay. 
AABRIA: Boo! Yeah, of course. 
ERICA: I actually don't to be within 30 feet of Opal. 
AABRIA: You don't. 
ERICA: I need to be within 30 feet of myself. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: Which, one could say you always are. 
ERICA: So I'm going to cast Haste on myself. 
MATT: Awesome. 
AABRIA: Incredible. 
ERICA: Yeah. I'm really good at the mechanics of all of this. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: Hey, sweetie, you're doing great. 
ERICA: Yeah, I'm going to cast Haste on myself. That's what I'm going to use my action for. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
ERICA: Then, as far as movement, oh wait, actually, one second. I had a whole plan here, but-- 
AABRIA: No, it's okay. 
ERICA: You know? 
AABRIA: You went before stuff happened. (laughs) 
ERICA: Yeah. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ERICA: Is there-- 
AABRIA: That's what you get for rolling, honestly, far too high. 
ANJALI: Yes. 
ERICA: Far too high. 
MATT and AABRIA: (laugh) 
ANJALI: I need to fix something. 
ERICA: Oh, actually-- Ooh, okay, actually, this is what I would love to do. Could I actually move within 10 feet of her? Is that an option? 
AABRIA: Yeah, you get in close and you can-- 
ERICA: Or is that my move action? 
AABRIA: I'll have you make an acrobatics or athletics check, your call, to come up on to, to scramble up the platform to get within 10 feet. 
ERICA: Great. 
AABRIA: Totally good and easy to do. 
ERICA: Okay, cool. So I'll make an athletics check. Oh my god, my acrobatics is ass now. It was so good. 
ANJALI: Aw. 
AABRIA: It's okay, it could be athletics. 
AIMEE: But she's a bunny. 
ERICA: Oh my god, I rolled another 19. What the heck? 
ANJALI: Yeah, baby-- 
AABRIA: Let's go! 
ANJALI: Let's go! 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ERICA: Honestly, this is vindication-- 
AABRIA: Yeah! 
ERICA: -- for last time. 
AABRIA: Oh my god! 
ERICA: I feel vindicated. 
ANJALI: Fair. 
AABRIA: Also, don't forget, you do have Bunny Hop, so-- 
ERICA: Oh yeah, wait. 
AABRIA: In instances where you are-- 
AIMEE: Is that a special feat? 
ANJALI: Bunny Hop? 
ERICA: Rabbit Hop, yeah, I have Rabbit Hop. 
AIMEE: Stop. 
ERICA: A number of-- 
AABRIA: Sorry, it's Rabbit Hop. I could've said it the cool way. 
ERICA: I mean, I don't really need it right now, right? I got a 28. 
AABRIA: No, just if you're like: Oh, I don't want to roll like ass. 
ERICA: 25. 
AABRIA: You could also just big, big bounce. 
ERICA: Sick. 
MATT: That's the cool thing about being a bunny. 
ERICA: 26. 
AABRIA: 26. 
ERICA: Yeah, to get up there. Then I would like, for my bonus action, to-- 
AABRIA: I've missed minis. 
ANJALI: (laughs) 
ERICA: They are actually so cute. 
AABRIA: This is nice-- 
ANJALI: Ah, shit. 
AABRIA: Put that here. 
ERICA: Oh wait, I-- 
AABRIA: Look at these ladies. 
ERICA: I lost what I was going to do, okay. 
AABRIA: You stand by a weird dick of gemstones. 
ERICA: I'm going to use my Vow of Enmity. 
AABRIA and MATT: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Oh, whoa. 
ERICA: I'm going to utter a vow of enmity against this creature that I can see, using my-- 
AABRIA: What creature, Opal? 
ERICA: Opal, yeah. Using my Channel Divinity. It's all the same. 
MATT: Why not? 
ERICA: I mean, I could just yell at a jewel, but this is cooler, right? Right? Yeah. 
AABRIA: Okay, this feels really aggressive, and I like it. 
AIMEE: Yeah! (laughs) 
AABRIA: I'm learning new and magical things about myself. 
AIMEE: I'm going to Google it. Vow of what? 
ERICA: A Vow of Enmity, so I gain, I just gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for one minute, or until it drops to zero hit points, or falls unconscious. 
AABRIA: Amazing. 
AIMEE: Someone-- 
MATT: Hexblade's Curse retorted with a Vow of Enmity. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
AABRIA: I love it. 
AIMEE: Wait, can you repeat that one more time. What do I do? 
ERICA: All I do is gain advantage on attack rolls-- 
AIMEE: Okay, okay. Got it. 
ERICA: -- against you for one minute. 
AIMEE: Got it. 
ERICA: But I whisper to you, I say: Listen, we're going to get you out of this, okay? I don't know if you can hear me, but we're going to get you out of this. 
AIMEE: Okay, I can hear you. Just try not to kill me in the process. 
ERICA: No, no, no, I'm just going to knock you out a little. 
AIMEE: Okay, great. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: I want to be so clear that that is a telepathic bond. 
AIMEE: Yeah, yeah. 
ERICA: Sick. 
AABRIA: What you are looking at is a stone cold Opal with no visible sclera-- 
ERICA: Mm-hmm, yeah. 
AABRIA: -- iris, pupil. Just turns to you-- 
AIMEE: None. 
AABRIA: -- the moment that vow hits. "(joyless smirk)" 
AIMEE: Eek! 
AABRIA: That's all you get. 
ROBBIE: (buzzes lips) 
AABRIA: All right. Anything else? 
ERICA: I don't think I can-- 
AABRIA: You're hasted, so you have 47 things you can do, I think. 
ERICA: Oh my god, okay. 
AABRIA: It's the scariest spell ever. 
MATT: You have one more action right? 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ERICA: Do I get to do it on-- 
AABRIA: You have 37 actions. 
ERICA: -- when I cast Haste? 
MATT: Yeah. 
AIMEE: That's cool. 
AABRIA: 96 bonus actions, and 400 feet of movement, delightful. 
ERICA: Oh my god, wait, where does it explain what my hasted action is? I don't think I ever actually saw-- 
MATT: A hasted action is generally an attack-- 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- or anything else that's an action. You can't cast another spell, necessarily, but you can be a dodge, or it can be-- 
ERICA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: -- other standard actions. 
AIMEE: Warlocks need that. 
ERICA: Oh my gosh, okay. 
AIMEE: Why don't I have Haste? 
AABRIA: She almost cast it on you. I tried to give her money about it. (laughter) 
ERICA: That was a massive mistake on my part, honestly. 
AABRIA: Look-- 
ROBBIE: No take-back-sies! 
AABRIA: You throw in 30, that's $60. 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Yeah! (laughs) 
AABRIA: If you cast Haste on her. 
ERICA: Listen, fully a skill issue on my part. I don't admit that lightly. 
AABRIA: No, no, no, no, you're good. 
MATT: No, it's all good, it's all good. 
AABRIA: No, no, no. You're perfect. 
ERICA: But I guess for my hasted action, which again, I don't know where that is here, but thank you for letting me know, I tried to find it. 
MATT: It's all good. 
AABRIA: It's all good. 
ERICA: I'm going to take my crystal rapier, and I'm going to go for an attack. 
MATT: Yeah! 
AABRIA: Great. 
ERICA: Yeah. I'm going to roll to hit. Oh, and I have advantage, huh? 
MATT: Yeah, you do. 
AABRIA: Yep. 
ANJALI: You sure do. 
AABRIA: (whimpers) 
ERICA: Okay. 
AIMEE: I'm squishy. 
ERICA: That's a 17. (laughs) Okay. 
ANJALI: Plus your stuff. 
ERICA: 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. 
MATT: Roll again to see if it's a crit. 
ERICA: 24. 
AABRIA: Yeah. No. 
MATT: Okay. 
ERICA: So, 24 to hit. 
AIMEE: (sighs) Matthew Mercer. 
MATT: I'm just saying. You have advantage! (laughter) 
ANJALI: We need you on this. Thank you. (laughs) 
ERICA: Does that hit? 
AABRIA: It hits. 
ERICA: Okay, sweet. 
MATT: I'm on everyone's side. 
ERICA: All right. 
ANJALI: Fair. 
AABRIA: You're good. 
MATT: I'm Dariax, I don't know what's going on. 
ANJALI: You are Dariax, you're like like, eh-- 
ERICA: What a nice guy, what a nice guy. 1d8 plus two, that's a three. Then I get Improved Divine Smite, so I'm going to roll another d8. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
ERICA: Passively, I get another, and so, it's a four. Then I am going to-- 
ANJALI: Four's enough? 
ERICA: I'm going to use Divine Smite at 4th-level. Is she a fiend? 
MATT: Going out big. 
AABRIA: She is not. 
ERICA: No? Whoa. 
AABRIA: That's your friend, Opal. 
ERICA: Well-- 
AABRIA: She's just a little guy. 
ERICA: She's just a little-- Oh, she's just a little guy? Okay, all right. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ERICA: Whatever you say-- 
AABRIA: All she did was go, "I'm going to choke my friend a little bit and make jewels on the ground," and then you decided to murder her. 
MATT: I've been at that party. 
ERICA: I don't know, I'm just feeling bad feelings about all this, so I would-- 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ERICA: -- much prefer to have her unconscious so we could deal with this in a more-- 
AABRIA: For sure. 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Civilized manner. 
AABRIA: You can certainly try. 
ERICA: Yeah. In a more civilized manner. So I'm casting it at 4th, so I think that gives me 5d8. 
AIMEE: (shudders) 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
ERICA: So, I'm going to do 5d8 more damage. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
AIMEE: What are we at? 
ERICA: That's a one. 
ANJALI: That was nine originally. 
AABRIA: We'll find out at the end. 
ERICA: That's an eight. 
AABRIA: Yep. 
ERICA: That's a one. 
ANJALI: 10. 
ERICA: That's a three. 
ANJALI: Three, 13, and nine-- 
ERICA: Wait. Five, right? One more? 
AABRIA: Five, eight, yeah. 
ERICA: Yeah, one more. 
AABRIA: One more. 
AIMEE: Eh, one more. 
ERICA: That's a five. 
AABRIA: Total of-- 
ANJALI: 18 plus the nine from before. 
AABRIA: Yep, so we're at 27. 
ROBBIE: (exhales) 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: 27 points of damage-- 
ROBBIE: (taken aback) 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: -- that you put into your friend. 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: (whimpers) 
AABRIA: What does it look like as you attack her with your crystal rapier? 
AIMEE: Murder, it's murder, that's what it is. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ERICA: I don't think that I do it with pleasure. I think it's a very, I walk up to her, and I sink that rapier into, I can't even do her stomach, I have to do her thigh. I just rip it down her thigh. 
AIMEE: Ouchies. 
ANJALI: (sharp inhale) 
ERICA: I'm going: I'm sorry, I think this is what I need to do. I'm sorry. 
AABRIA: Opal. 
AIMEE: Mm-hmm. 
AABRIA: You take none of that damage. 
ANJALI: Oh. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: You feel the dagger sink into her thigh, and that second set of arms grabs the blade at the bottom and pushes forward, and pushes out. What walks in front of Opal-- Where are my little minis? Where's my little guy? I don't think you've had the pleasure of meeting Ted. 
AIMEE: (gasps) 
ALL: Oh! 
AABRIA: Your blade is sunk into the dark shadow of something that looks like Opal, but where Opal is all thin, smooth lines, and litheness, this is like if Opal did CrossFit for three years-- 
ERICA: Oh my god, no! 
ANJALI: (laughs) 
AABRIA: -- and was pure raw red meat diet. 
AIMEE: Oh my gosh! 
AABRIA: This is meat beast Bandersnatch Opal that is holding the blade-- 
ANJALI and MATT: (laugh) 
AABRIA: -- in her thigh, and walks forward. 
ERICA: Ted took no damage? 
AABRIA: Ted is going to take all of that damage. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: Opal takes none. 
AIMEE: I mean, she-- 
AABRIA: But you have effectively separated Opal and the other half of her soul. 
ANJALI: (sighs) 
ERICA: (shocked) 
AABRIA: She looks at you, eyes as blank as Opal's are now, and pushes your sword back and out of her thigh, and reaches behind her, and pulls out a massive sword of her own. 
MATT: Oh! 
ERICA: I get another attack, right? Or do I not? 
AABRIA: Yeah, you have two. Did you do both of your attacks in your-- 
ERICA: No, I did just did one. 
MATT: No, just one. 
AABRIA: Okay, yeah, attack again. 
ERICA: All right. In this moment, Morrighan's almost a little bit relieved, because there's something else to fight other than Opal, and I'm like: Okay, maybe she's got this proxy. Do I have any blood on my hand, or was there no Opal blood on my hands? When I sunk that dagger in. 
AABRIA: When you sunk that dagger in, Opal began to bleed, and then this shadow walked forward, and the shadow does not bleed. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: So what you have on you is a little bit of Opal's blood. 
ERICA: Okay, got you. 
ANJALI: Hmm. 
ERICA: Okay, cool. Well, I'm going to go at Ted again, now I know it's Ted. Fuck you, Ted. I'm going to go at Ted with my crystal rapier again. I have advantage, right? 
AABRIA: You have advantage on Opal. 
ERICA: Oh my-- Oh, just on-- Wait, I thought it was all-- Oh, that's so-- Oh. 
ROBBIE: Dirty. 
AABRIA: Hey, bud. 
ERICA: Dirty. Dirty, dirty. That's a 15. 
AIMEE: She's not even a real person. 
AABRIA: As you go-- 
ERICA: 22. 
ANJALI: It's okay, baby. 
AABRIA: Ted is going to scream across the bond. "No, no, no! Stop!" That's going to be her verbal component for casting Shield, which is going to turn Ted's AC to 23. 
ROBBIE: Whoa. 
ANJALI: Oof. 
ERICA: All right. 
AABRIA: You hesitate for just long enough that her blade goes and deflects. She stands, interposing in between the two of you. Her mouth doesn't move, but you can hear Ted in your head across the bond. "What are you doing? Why are you attacking her? (panting)" 
ERICA: Do you think I'm an idiot? I know something bad is about to happen here. 
AABRIA: "What? You could-- You could help the-- Why is the first thing you do drawing blood?" 
ERICA: I don't know. 
AABRIA: "I will protect her at any cost. And if that means--" At this point, you all hear Ted's voice getting quiet. Not you, as she stays in your head. "If that means I have to slaughter you, you can be the first body to drop." 
AIMEE: (gasps) 
AABRIA: You hear the skittering of spiders. 
AIMEE: Whoa! 
AABRIA: Anything else you want to do? You still have 400 feet of movement. 
ERICA: Oh. I'd like to-- 
AIMEE: For real? 
ERICA: -- move away, please. (laughter) 
AABRIA: You can go do anything else in the world. You could go to a different campaign with the rest of your movement. 
ERICA: I'd like to go to a Denny's. (laughter) 
AIMEE: An Arby's, maybe. 
ANJALI: Get a Grand Slam! 
AABRIA: You find an Arby's. You get a giant hot dog that looks like a pussy. 
ERICA: Yeah. Yeah. 
AABRIA: We haven't forgotten that. We haven't forgotten. 
ANJALI: (laughs) 
ERICA: I get a giant hot dog, I look at it, it's actually Marisha. 
AIMEE: "Hot dog." 
AABRIA: It's Marisha. 
ANJALI: Yes. 
ERICA: I get in my car. 
AABRIA: "Hot dog." 
ERICA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: I'll never forget it. 
ANJALI: No, no. 
AABRIA: I'm so sorry. (laughter) 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Scarred for life. 
ERICA: I'd like to move away, please. 
AABRIA: Sure. 
ERICA: Where do I find this information about my hasted movement, or hasted action? 
MATT: So, Haste--- 
AABRIA: You go. 
MATT: It's just double movement. So whatever your movement speed is-- 
ERICA: Oh, okay. Got you, got you. 
MATT: -- you take double that. 
ERICA: Okay, got you. 
AABRIA: Don't forget, you've got a plus two to your AC while Haste is up. 
ERICA: Oh, sick. Okay, cool. 
AABRIA: Yeah. You're incredibly hard to hit. Oh, and when you use, don't forget, when you use your hasted attack, you only get one attack, even if your paladin abilities would give you a second attack. 
ERICA: Oh, okay. 
AABRIA: So. 
ERICA: Wait. Okay, okay. 
MATT: You can attack twice, and then you can use your hasted attack to do a third. 
AABRIA: There you go. So, you're good. 
ERICA: Okay, cool. 
AABRIA: You did it right. 
ERICA: Cool. That's great. 
AABRIA: You're perfect and above reproach. 
ERICA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: Just so you know, you're at the edge of this platform. If you move away more than five feet, Ted will get an attack of opportunity on you. But you can just skirt around both of these problems. 
ERICA: (trilling) Skirt! 
AABRIA and ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Where do you want to be? Do you want to try to get behind? What are you trying to do? 
ERICA: Probably back there maybe, back near that rock. 
AABRIA: Back here? 
ERICA: Or back there, no, farther back, please. 
AABRIA: Right here? If you leave that threatened range, she's going to get an attack on you if you go. 
ERICA: Oh, okay. Let me just, as far back as I can get without doing that thing you said. 
AABRIA: (laughs) You move over here-- 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: -- to turn around. It also gives your friends a clear view on what's going on. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: You realize you are standing-- (laughs) Under your feet, you see an arrangement of those opalescent gems. 
ANJALI: Yeah. 
ERICA: Mm-hmm. 
AABRIA: It's a little pattern of four. No perception check, it just sort of kind of looks like a dick-- 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
ERICA: Cool, Cool, cool, cool. 
AABRIA: -- under your feet. 
ERICA: Wow, it's so big. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Stop it! (laughter) 
ANJALI: There it is! 
ROBBIE: I knew it. 
ANJALI: There it is. 
ROBBIE: I knew it. 
AABRIA: Inspiration! 
ANJALI: Everybody drink! 
AABRIA: Perfect. 
ERICA: I'm so distracted. 
AABRIA: Perfect. (laughter) 
AIMEE: There's an ash hole right next to it. 
AABRIA: No! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
AABRIA: No! 
ANJALI: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Full circle. 
MATT: Bring it back. 
AABRIA: As it gives under your foot, your feet are cracking across this, and you're, "Oh, there's something to it," you feel, you feel something magical as your feet skirt across it, like if you put more pressure on it, you can break them. But they are something to be interacted with, and are magical. You're just a pure paladin, you just get that for free. 
ERICA: Yeah, I'm pretty cool, I guess. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Hey, welcome back. You rolling well is terrifying. 
ROBBIE: Well. 
AABRIA: I love that. 
ERICA: (clicking) 
AABRIA: I love that for me, I love that for all of us. Next up is Dorian, Fy'ra Rai, you're on deck. 
ROBBIE: Oh snap. 
ANJALI: You're on deck. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I got, so, I got to take this back in time a second, right? 
AABRIA: Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
ROBBIE: 24 seconds ago, we were strolling through the forest, right? 
AABRIA: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Okay, cool, and so-- 
AABRIA: It was so gooshy. 
ROBBIE: Dorian was up front, tooting a little tune on his flute, okay in his own zone. Then, in that amount of time, Opal levitated, burst forth spiderwebs and gems, shot a bolt, and nearly killed one of our friends. 
AABRIA: Several. 
ROBBIE: But Morrighan immediately stabbed her in the leg, a demon person burst forth in the last half a minute or so. 
AABRIA: Not even half a minute. 
ROBBIE: Not even. 
AABRIA: Not even. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, so-- 
AABRIA: It really popped off. 
ROBBIE: So-- (laughs) (laughter) 
ANJALI: Ah! 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
AABRIA: Yeah, yeah, 
ROBBIE: Processing, Dorian just is ♪ (flute note) ♪ this last little toot, and all of a sudden-- 
AABRIA: No! 
ANJALI: Double toot? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
ANJALI: You were tooting the toot? 
ROBBIE: You see his winged boots engage. 
AABRIA: Yeah? 
ROBBIE: He starts to look up at everything that just transpired. As he flutters past Fy'ra Rai, and still got his flute, then he goes: Better get your head in the game, Bossy Genasi. Tootley-toot! And gives a bardic inspiration. 
ALL: Oh! 
ROBBIE: He's been working-- 
ANJALI: Is that a d10? Fuck yeah. 
ROBBIE: He's been working on his nicknames. 
ANJALI: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: He's going to use his movement to fly underneath that ridge, trying to stay out of sight a little bit. 
AABRIA: Okay. This way? 
ROBBIE: Doo-doo-doo-doo. Yeah, sneak past the ooey gooey. 
AABRIA: Ooey gooey, yeah. 
ROBBIE: He has thoughts of, for a moment, of trying to engage, and goes: Eh. 
AABRIA: Eh. 
ROBBIE: I would like to try to get up to Opal, and grapple her. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: I think you got some movement for that. 
ROBBIE: Just strength, I got 40 feet now. 
AABRIA: Yeah, you're good. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: All right. Grapple check. 
ROBBIE: (sighs) 
AABRIA: Go ahead and give me an athletics check. Strength save. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
AIMEE: Oof. 
ROBBIE: Okay, athletics. 
AIMEE: Oh, that's a natural 20. (gasping) 
AIMEE: However, I have a minus one in strength. That is a 19. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: This is a--! Uh-oh. That is a four. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Plus 13, so, it's-- 
AABRIA: Is it really plus 13? 
ROBBIE: My athletics is plus 13. 
ERICA: Whoa. 
AABRIA: Scary. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: That almost did it, and that's hilarious. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: But it didn't. 
ROBBIE: So I'm going to fly up to her, and he's like: Are you okay? And-- 
AIMEE: No! 
ROBBIE: -- try to give her a big hug. 
AABRIA: What do you do? 
AIMEE: What can I do? 
AABRIA: Well, you rolled higher, so you can tell me how you avoid being grappled. 
AIMEE: I, okay, so in the telepathic, what? 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Telepathic bond, I say: Oh, that's a nice hug, you've never hugged me before, But in person-- 
AABRIA: Pff! (laughter) 
AIMEE: In person-- 
AABRIA: Ah! 
AIMEE: You literally, I guess one of my arms goes-- 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
ANJALI: Oof. 
AABRIA: Ooh! 
AIMEE: Just dead face, just picks him up. I'm assuming that arm is strong, I don't fucking know, and it goes like that. 
AABRIA: I like it. 
AIMEE: If it's not strong enough-- 
AABRIA: The fact that you're levitating means you're very light, you're just, mm, okay. 
AIMEE: (laughs) Okay, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Doink, okay. (laughter) 
AIMEE: I'm going to lose a nail. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Ah! 
AIMEE: (groans) 
ROBBIE: Dorian has completely (laughs) disappointed himself that that didn't work. He's just in that bush behind where I got dropped off, and just goes: Oh. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: That's it, that's all I can do. 
AABRIA: That's it? 
ROBBIE: That's bonus action, action, movement, so-- 
AABRIA: Incredible. 
ROBBIE: -- that completes my turn. 
AABRIA: While you're here, give me, I love the idea of failing forward, so you don't manage to grapple her, but you get in close and you're like incredibly tight with whatever magic fuckery is happening with Opal right now. You can hear in your mind the difference between what she is thinking and saying to you versus her actions. So I want you to tell me a roll you think Dorian would make to try to figure out what's going on. 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. 
AABRIA: Give you a little intel. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, not his top tier. 
AABRIA: Are you not curious? If you're not fundamentally curious, we can move on. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I am very curious about what's happening right now-- 
AABRIA: Yeah? 
ROBBIE: -- but (sighs) I got nothing good. 
AABRIA: Arcana, investigation, perception, insight. 
AIMEE: It's for you. 
ROBBIE: All doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo. 
AIMEE: It's for you. 
ROBBIE: I mean, what I would do is try to convince her to tell me something, persuasion, maybe. But is that too active? 
AABRIA: Go ahead, no, no, I like that. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
AABRIA: Make a persuasion check to try to keep Opal, not the thing acting, but the person inside, talking. 
ROBBIE: We can talk mentally? 
AABRIA: Yes, you can. 
ROBBIE: Hey, buddy. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: You want to tell me what's going on? Oh my fucking god. Nat one, plus 13, 14. (groaning) 
ROBBIE: You want to tell me what's-- 
AIMEE: It's not nothing. 
ROBBIE: It's still 14, it's high. 
MATT: It's still a nat one. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: You want to tell me what's going on? 
AABRIA: Here's the thing, that's still a nat one. 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: So Aimee-- 
AIMEE: Yeah? 
AABRIA: -- love of my life-- 
AIMEE: Mm-hmm? 
AABRIA: I would love if you would respond less as Opal who is confused-- 
AIMEE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
AABRIA: -- and more as the Opal that is acting right now, as that part of you leans in a little bit and addresses Dorian. 
AIMEE: I think she says, "She doesn't know." 
ROBBIE: Who's she? You're she. 
AIMEE: Am I? 
ROBBIE: Are you? (laughs) 
AIMEE: Are you? (laughter) 
AABRIA: (claps) 
ERICA: I love it. 
MATT: Dariax's nose bleeds just a little bit. 
AABRIA: Yeah! (laughter) 
AABRIA: So does the Spider Queen, who's like, "What is happening?" (laughter) 
ERICA: His one brain cell is working so hard. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Incredible. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Ah, boy. 
AABRIA: Fy'ra Rai, you are up. 
ROBBIE: That's rough. 
ANJALI: Okay, question, this choking business, am I grappled, or that was just damage? 
AABRIA: No, no, no. It's just the feeling of whatever Opal's magic is feels like a hand around your throat. It's for vibes. 
ANJALI: Word. Okay, cool. 
AABRIA: It does not mechanically affect you. 
AABRIA and ERICA: (laugh) 
ANJALI: (sighs) Lots of stuff going through my brain. 
AABRIA: Yeah, how you doing? (buzzes) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ANJALI: Okay, so I just had one sister--- 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Aw! 
AABRIA: (claps) 
ANJALI: -- who decided that she wanted to try to kill me, somewhere between the time when I thought she was dead and discovered she was alive. But I've seen this happening with Opal over time, and I think I can shake off the-- So much of me is feeling, again, double betrayed, but I know it's not her, I just know. Over the last few weeks, I think I've been asking the Wildmother, I've been asking for the sight to give me some kind of insight as to what is going on and what is going on specifically with Opal. So before I do anything, can I go back to those two weeks and do a little check in? 
AIMEE: Ooh. 
AABRIA: Absolutely. 
AIMEE: Cool. 
AABRIA: Go ahead and give me, what do I want to call that? Let's make it either religion or insight. 
ANJALI: (laughs) Yeah, we'll do insight. 
AABRIA: Okay, no one wants a religion check. 
ANJALI: That was cocked. 
AABRIA: Well, you're going to go talk to the gods, but you don't want to use int? 
ANJALI: 25. 
AABRIA: Well, shit. (laughter) 
ANJALI: It's always been insight for the Wildmother. 
AABRIA: Of course. 
ANJALI: I'll take it. 
AABRIA: Insight is a slightly different understanding of this. You are looking at the heart of your friend and not necessarily the interaction between the god whose purview she has committed to. 
ANJALI: Mm, okay. [phone notification ding] 
AABRIA: Shush. (laughter) 
ANJALI: Apparently, that was the Wildmother telling you to give me a message. What did she say? (laughter) 
AIMEE: What did she say? 
AABRIA: She said, "Google password required." (laughter) 
ANJALI: Aw. It's 1234. 
AIMEE: Fy'ra Rai would have "1234." 
AABRIA: We'll do this as a series of questions. I can either offer you generic knowledge, that's a very high roll. You can be specific and I'll give you specific answers. Oh, it's so fun talking GM to GM now. 
ANJALI: Is there-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Yeah! 
AIMEE: Hey-oh! 
ANJALI: Oh, no, oh. (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ANJALI: I thought you were talking to him. 
MATT: No, you. 
ANJALI: It's me! 
AABRIA: It's you! 
AIMEE: Hey! 
AABRIA: It's you, girl. 
ANJALI: I did a thing. 
AABRIA: Let's go. 
AIMEE: (claps) 
ANJALI: Is there anything that I can do to peel her away from whatever is happening? Is there anything you can help me do to peel her away from what is happening? You, Wildmother? 
AABRIA: Those are two very specific questions. The Wildmother, who strangely enough, at first, you got signs from her, and then in your time traveling with the Crown Keepers, you had full verbal communication. But it seems as though she has stepped back again, and speaks in sign and feeling. Your first question, what can you do to peel away? You feel a little bit of hesitation. Remove the crown. You have a sense of stinging and burning briars or nettles in your scalp at your hairline ripped away. The second question, what could she, the Wildmother, do, is met like a sudden gust of wind blocking your path. Why would she? Why would she stop what's happening? 
ANJALI: Well, that's unexpected. 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: I'll give you one more question, if you want to follow either of those leads. You can find out more about the Wildmother's resistance or you can find out more about the nature of Opal's interaction with the Spider Queen. 
ANJALI: I know this isn't Opal. What do you need from me to help her? 
AABRIA: "What do you need from me to help her?" A specific set of questions, you feel the nature of the Wildmother's answer, like if you stood in a field of kudzu as it rapidly grows around your ankles, binding you. A twist of words, "What could I do to help you help her?" Again, you get that sense of briars and prickling stinging things across those vines. "Why would I stop this from happening?" Not out of fury, but again out of fear. Then, once more, you feel at your temple the crown, and a flash of blinding pain, to let you know the cost of separating Opal from the crown she donned willingly. You flash back to here and now. Fy'ra Rai, what do you do? 
ANJALI: All right. 
AIMEE: (nervous noise) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ANJALI: I look at Opal, and I say with a telepathic bond, "I'm sorry." I say out loud, "You can't have her." I use my ki points to pull my hand back, and in my hand, you see appear a whip, but it's made of thick lava. I swing it around to her actual body and not to Ted. So around her. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
ANJALI: I attempt to lava whip her back to me. 
AABRIA: Okay. Go ahead and make an attack roll, knowing that Ted is providing partial cover, so her-- 
ANJALI: Right, but it's a whip. 
AIMEE: It's a whip. 
AABRIA: It can go around, right? 
MATT: It's a dex save on her part. 
ANJALI: It's a dex save on her part. Actually, you know what? I can move so that I have a straight line of sight of her. 
AABRIA: Oh, sure, sure, sure. Do I come this way? 
ANJALI: Maybe not that far. Can I get closer to? 
AABRIA: Where you trying be? 
ANJALI: Halfway through, halfway between the two. 
AABRIA: Here? 
ANJALI: Yeah, but back closer to the, yeah, let me get there. 
MATT: Ah. 
AIMEE: Do I roll a dex save? 
ANJALI: Dex save. 
AABRIA: Yeah, there you go. 
AIMEE: That is a 16. 
ANJALI: Meets it, beats it. Yeah, okay, so you take-- 
AIMEE: As a reaction-- 
AABRIA: There it is. 
AIMEE: I'm going to use Armor of Hexes-- 
ANJALI: Okay. 
AIMEE: -- which is if a target of your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, this reaction-- 
AABRIA: She didn't hit. 
AIMEE: Huh? 
AABRIA: She didn't hit you. 
AIMEE: She did hit me. You said it hits me. 
ANJALI: You made the save. So it just says half damage. 
AIMEE: But I made the save. Oh. 
AABRIA: Oh, is it going to be half damage? 
ANJALI: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Oh, then yes, this all goes through, continue. 
AIMEE: Okay, I can use my reaction to roll a d6. On a four or higher, the attack misses. It's a two. 
MATT: Mm. 
ANJALI: Okay, so it's 3d10 bludgeoning, but halved. 
AIMEE: Oh, whew. 
ANJALI: I have 94 dice and I can't think straight right now. I can't think about which one is which. Which one is which? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) That's a lot of dice. 
ANJALI: Seven. Eight. Eight and six, 14, so seven. 
MATT: You have a stadium of dice that get to watch-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. (laughs) 
AABRIA: It's crazy. 
MATT: -- and shame the other dice. 
ANJALI: No, but I'm so confused. 
ROBBIE: "I would've done it better." 
ANJALI: They would. 
MATT: It's a full jury. 
ANJALI: You didn't do very well, so you're going in the penalty box. 
AIMEE: That one's going. The hefty ones do-- 
ANJALI and ERICA: Penalty box. 
AIMEE: They cannot go in. 
ANJALI: Penalty box. 
AIMEE: Yes. Heavy ones go into the penalty box. 
ANJALI: Okay, so it's seven damage, that's it. 
AIMEE: Yep. 
ANJALI: But. So that is my action. 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
ANJALI: I am going to use my-- 
AIMEE: Heh. Boop. 
ROBBIE: Sorry. (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I've been dying to do it for an hour. 
AABRIA: He's not even sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ANJALI: I'm going to use my movement, the rest of my movement. Fuck, you guys, everything I thought I knew about the world is untrue. I don't want to be grouped up like that. 
AABRIA: No, it's probably fine. 
AIMEE: (laughs) It's probably fine. 
AABRIA: It's probably fine. I'm so sorry, I rolled a little low. 
ANJALI: Hang on. 
AABRIA: We're about to beat their ass in a second, don't you worry. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: No. 
AIMEE: No, no, no. 
AABRIA: We're coming. How you doing? How you holding up? 
AIMEE: I'm cold. (laughter) 
ANJALI: Cool, I-- 
AABRIA: You seem a little cold and lonely. I'm going to get you a friend. Continue. 
ANJALI: I'm-- Aw. I am going to use the-- 
MATT: What does that mean? 
ANJALI: Sorry? 
MATT: I said, "What does that mean?" Continue. 
ANJALI: I don't want to know. I don't want to know. I'm going to spend-- I'm going to move even further that way. 
AABRIA: Yeah. How far you want to go? You move across another dick of gems. 
ANJALI: Excellent. Does any information? 
AABRIA: You feel dick under your feet? 
ANJALI: Yes. (laughs) 
MATT: If I had a nickel. 
AABRIA: But do I have any sensation of what those things are or any--? 
AABRIA: As you move across, you feel, you give it a little test, like, "What the shit is under my foot?" It feels crushable. As you lean into it, it feels like-- You know what? Go ahead and give me, what do I want this to be? Give me an insight check. 
AABRIA: 27. 
AIMEE: (laughs) Oh, oh shit. 
AABRIA: The moment your heel brushes across the back of it, it feels like it brings a memory to mind. 
AIMEE: Ooh. 
AABRIA: All of a sudden, your mind snaps to a conversation you had with her forever ago. But you don't press and you're keeping your eye on her and trying to figure out what's going on. So it's the beginning of your mind beginning to wander, and you snap and call it to attention as you cross over. 
ANJALI: Then for my final thing, as a bonus action, I'm going to spend one ki point to take the dodge action, just in case some shit goes down, because some shit's gone down-- 
AIMEE: Preventative dodge? 
ANJALI: -- and I was not prepared. 
AABRIA: A preventative dodge. 
ANJALI: Yeah, so I believe that's all I got. 
AABRIA: Incredible. Now I get to go. 
AIMEE: Oh no. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm, but why? 
AIMEE: But why? 
AABRIA: The skittering gets much louder. (skitters) 
AIMEE: Ooh, ooh, ooh! 
ERICA: Ugh, ah. 
AIMEE: It's like the Jumanji spiders. (laughter) 
AABRIA: They are like those real fat-body Jumanji spiders. 
ROBBIE: Don't get Jumanji-ed. 
AIMEE: Thick! Thick. 
AABRIA: One here. 
AIMEE: Oh, you put the little gems on there. That's cute! 
ROBBIE: Is that the one redeeming quality, as long as they're cute, you're fine with it? 
AIMEE: Yeah, yeah. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I knew it, I knew it. 
AABRIA: Yeah, they're real cute, guys. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
AIMEE: Opal is me, I am her. (laughter) 
AIMEE: I am she. (strains) Ooh, I don't even have a spider thing and those are gross. 
AABRIA: And put one more back here. 
MATT: Oh, just a bunch of them. 
AABRIA: Just like a couple. 
ROBBIE: There's a couple. 
AABRIA: There's so many of you and just a couple of me. 
MATT: No. 
ROBBIE: They're fine. 
AABRIA: They enter onto the field, as all of you hear inside the bond and inside the world around you, the laughter. Those of you that have had time and interactions with the Spider Queen know her voice. "(laughs) You won't stop me from making her mine without killing her. So what are you all prepared to do? Because I will not die to that." And with that, "That," you all feel a flash of red behind your eyes. 
AIMEE: Oh no. 
AABRIA: The spider way back over here is going to move to a little stack of dicks. 
AIMEE: Oh boy. 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
AABRIA: Those gems. And reaches down and scoops them up. You all see they flash in the midday sun and crush them. 
AIMEE: (gasps) 
AABRIA: And Opal. 
AIMEE: Aw. 
AABRIA: -- you feel something go away forever. You know it in the moment as you lose it. 
AIMEE: Aw. 
AABRIA: There's a part of your past, (sighs) you never really understood what your deal was with Ted. Who she was to you was your sister, but why did she disappear? Why was she inside you? Why did all of the events that brought you to these people, how did they all come to pass? There's a story you remember now, but how could you remember a thing that your mother told you and Ted when you were three years old as she tucked you in, shortly before she disappeared from your home and from your life in Byroden? There's a word, Aevilux, a splinter group. She tells a story, looking at you kindly with shining eyes, mismatched color. A long time ago, a group of people found something called a beacon. They learned from it some great entity or god, a concept that sought to know itself, to understand via experience in the world of Exandria, it split itself apart. This one found far away. These people that worshiped Luxon, that's the word, the Luxon, found, created magics within themselves to split their own souls apart so that they could learn who they were via observation. 
AIMEE: Hmm, mm-hmm. 
AABRIA: As a child torn in two, you observe yourself, you learn who you are, what you like, what you want, what you need, your purpose, and then rejoin, find unity once more. Your mother was one of these people. 
AIMEE: Oh shit. 
AABRIA: So, Ted, Opal, Georgina, are you. You and Ted found each other again, reunited to something stronger than your wholes. You understand yourself because you understand Ted. Ted wants to protect you because she is protecting herself. 
AIMEE: Mm-hmm. 
AABRIA: She's not lost to you, she is you. 
AIMEE: Mm, mm-hmm. 
AABRIA: You are something rare and magical in the world of Exandria, and the memory of that is gone forever, in the moment of knowing it. The other spiders skitter in, getting closer. Let's see. The rest of them are here. They're going to close a little bit. This one can get just a little closer. The one beside Dariax is not going to be able to get in and fight yet. They just appear on the field. You see, all of you, as they arrive on the field, they look between you as combatants, and those gems on the ground and in the trees and in the webs, unsure of their targets, but deciding between both. 
ANJALI: Do we see anything visibly happen to Opal as that is crushed or is that all internal? 
AABRIA: I will allow for Opal to respond in the telepathic bond, if you want to. 
AIMEE: Am I aware of having lost it? 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: But I can't recall the memory? 
AABRIA: Yes. 
AIMEE: So it's like-- 
AABRIA: It's like when you know you had a nightmare-- 
AIMEE: But you can't-- 
AABRIA: -- and then the moment you wake up, you're like, "That sucked, what was it?" 
AIMEE: Yeah, I think you hear: Ouch. 
ANJALI: Oh. 
AIMEE: That's it. 
AABRIA: Okay. Next up is Ted, and then Dariax. 
MATT: Oh, that's right, I'm in this. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Buddy, you rolled very low. 
AIMEE: Dariax just wandered off. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ANJALI: (laughs) He didn't see what was happening. 
MATT: I'm finishing half a sandwich in the corner. What's up? (laughter) 
AIMEE: One of those old meat pies we had from the-- Oh. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) 
ANJALI: Some stuff. 
AIMEE: Thank you. 
ANJALI: Yep. 
AABRIA: Yeah, Ted knows a good target when she sees it. 
AIMEE: Just a fucking mess. 
AABRIA: She's going to round on you and make a pair of attacks. 
AIMEE: Ted, be nice. 
AABRIA: Does a 23 hit? 
ERICA: Yes. 
AABRIA: Does 18? 
ERICA: If it's the same, does it hit? 
AABRIA: Meets it beats it, yeah. 
ERICA: Okay, gotcha, then yes. 
AABRIA: Okay. ♪ Let's get those two in ♪ Oh wait, is that including your Hasted? 
ERICA: Yes, I've took my AC's 20, yeah. 
AABRIA: Okay, so the 18 wouldn't hit then? 
ANJALI: The 18 doesn't hit. 
ERICA: Oh! Yes! 
AABRIA: Yeah, okay. 
ERICA: I was just looking at what I was looking at. 
AABRIA: No, you're good, you're good, you're good! Cool, cool, cool. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
AABRIA: We love it. 
ERICA: I don't think there is, is there? Yeah. 
MATT: It doesn't augment it. 
ANJALI: Yeah, it doesn't. 
MATT: It just tells you the spell, what it does. 
ERICA: I only know how to read things that are there, you know what I mean? 
MATT: It's okay. 
ROBBIE: That's how reading works. 
ANJALI: I'm pretty sure that that's what reading-- 
AABRIA: Cool. You're going to take 14 points of piercing damage from this dark blade. 
ROBBIE: Whew. (sighs) 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: Now I need you to make a concentration check to see if your Haste stays up. 
ERICA: Oh god. 
AABRIA: So it is half damage, I think I said earlier it was the full damage. So you just have to beat a 10 with a constitution save. 
ERICA: All right, well. Yeah, 19. 
AABRIA: Yeah, you're great. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ERICA: So wait, okay, this is so small. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
AABRIA: Yep. 
ERICA: Okay, so I take 14 damage? 
AABRIA: Yep. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: She's going to do her best to try to get in and re-interpose herself between you and Opal. Her primary goal is to keep your attention on her and keep you away from Opal. 
ERICA: Okay, and you said, sorry, to clarify, the spiders looked at the dick gems, and then also at us? (laughter) 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ERICA: Wondering what they should? 
AABRIA: Yes. 
ERICA: But I looked at the dick gem and said, "Oh, that looks crushable"? 
AABRIA: (laughs) You did get a sense of submissive and crushable from these. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: But I think you see in the moment that you hear Opal say, "Ow," you have a vantage point on that spider in the back that lifted up and broke some of the gems that perhaps breaking the gems is bad for Opal. 
ERICA: Okay, gotcha, no matter who does it. Great, gotcha. 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
ERICA: Cool, cool, cool, sick. 
AABRIA: Cool, cool, cool. That's Ted's turn. Dariax, you're up. Opal, you're on deck. 
AIMEE: Oh no. 
MATT: All right, seeing all this go down at the get-go, and then everyone rush in, there's a moment of (laughs) Dariax like: What's happening? Then looks over and sees this change in Opal that he still hasn't even processed since all this went down. There's this pang of worry and sadness that hits him, and he's like: Oh, Opal. He's saying this out loud, he doesn't understand how telepathy works. He's just-- 
AABRIA: Baby. My son. 
ANJALI: Baby. 
MATT: We're going to get you. Don't worry, we're going to get you. Right, everybody, right? He's going to cast Bless at 2nd-level. 
AABRIA: Goddamn it! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: It's what I do. 
AABRIA: I hate it here. (laughs) 
MATT: So it's three, four, yeah. 
AABRIA: Yeah, pick your four. 
MATT: No, it's us four here, we all have Bless on us. 
AABRIA: Okay. Not Cyrus, who said, "Yeah," from behind the tree? 
ANJALI: He's here, he's here. 
MATT: Is Cyrus on the board? 
AABRIA: There's no Cyrus, he's not on, don't worry. 
ANJALI: Where is he? Okay. 
AIMEE: After all the handies, Cyrus? (laughter) 
AABRIA: You know what? That's right. Can I get anyone that exists back there bring me anything for Cyrus? We got to-- 
MATT: There might be some minis to your left over there. 
ANJALI: Would you like 900-- Would you like a die? 
AABRIA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: You can grab one of those. 
AABRIA: Okay. He's going to be one of these guys. He got a handjob, he's going to be a part of this. 
AIMEE: Did it mean nothing to you? (laughter) 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
AABRIA: Give me a performance check. 
AIMEE: Oh boy. (laughter) 
AIMEE: I don't know: Me or him? Oh fuck. 
AABRIA: I just want to know how good a job you did. 
AIMEE: Babe. 
AABRIA: He only rolled a three as initiative so I don't think it's great. 
AIMEE: Girl, like only a virgin knows how, that is a seven. 
AABRIA: Yeah! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah. 
AABRIA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ROBBIE: OTBHJ. 
ANJALI: Woohoo. 
ROBBIE: Dry, chafing. 
AABRIA: He's going to stay back here and be like-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah, bad. 
AABRIA: A three is about as far an initiative, he's like, "Mm, mm." (laughter) 
MATT: It's a 3rd-level Bless, I'm going to give it to him anyway. 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
ROBBIE: Oh man. 
ERICA: Wait, what does that mean for us? 
AIMEE: 1d4, I think. 
ANJALI: Yeah, it's d4, right or no? 
MATT: You add a d4 to any attack rolls-- 
ERICA: Oh! 
MATT: -- ability checks, or saving throws. 
ERICA: Oh my gosh. 
ANJALI: Ability checks, too, we like that. 
ERICA: Plus four attack. 
MATT: All right, I'm going to be like: We're going to get you, girl, we're going to get you. (sighs) How do we get her? What are we doing? (laughter) 
MATT: He's going to start panicking, and he's going to start rushing up to try and join the rest of them in the front. So he's going to start climbing up the side. Ha-- Woo-- I don't know what we're doing. What are we doing? 
ANJALI: Baby-- 
AABRIA: Where you going? Are you trying to get up here? 
MATT: Yeah, get up on the edge there. 
AABRIA: All right, give me athletics or acrobatics. You're going to pass a little thing of dick gems on the way. 
MATT: I have a 11 passive perception. Just goes: Ooh, pretty! And then keeps going. 
AABRIA: Baby. 
MATT: Oh. (laughs) 
ANJALI: Oh no. 
MATT: That's a seven. 
ROBBIE: Uh-oh. 
AIMEE: Ay-yi-yi. 
AABRIA: What's more important to Dariax in this moment, making it up or preserving himself? 
MATT: Oh, making it up, he has no sense of self-preservation in this moment. 
AABRIA: Cool. Roll a d4 for me. 
MATT: Okay. 
MATT: Two. 
AABRIA: Yeah, yeah, you take two points of scrape-y damage. 
MATT: Ah, ow, ow, ow. 
AABRIA: A little bit on your palm. 
ROBBIE: Ooh, it's the worst. 
AABRIA: That kind where you're just like, "Ah, it's fresh." Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Aw, I hate it. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
MATT: Then, let's see, as a bonus action, he's going to look over at Dorian across the way after he's been plucked and held in the air, be like: Don't worry, we all believe in you. You're our fearless leader and you can do this. 
AIMEE: Oh, what? (laughs) 
MATT: He's going to give him a d6 bardic inspiration die. 
ANJALI: Yeah! (cheering) 
MATT: Taken a few levels of training up under his buddy here. 
ANJALI: Aw, baby boy. Baby boy. 
AABRIA: Little baby boy. 
ROBBIE: I told you, pursuing a life in the arts isn't worth it! (laughter) 
MATT: I've done nothing worth anything, so I'm not changing anything in my trajectory. (laughter) 
AIMEE: You hear a guitar string go (warbles) 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
AABRIA and AIMEE: (strum) 
ROBBIE: Okay, thank you. 
AABRIA: Incredible. 
MATT: That's going to be my turn. 
AIMEE: Aw, shit. 
AABRIA: Perfect. (sighs) Opal. 
AIMEE: Now, does Ted, do we have the same abilities? 
AABRIA: No, Ted has a different skillset than you. 
AIMEE: I think it's still worth it. I'm standing close enough to her, right? I'm standing pretty close? 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
AIMEE: Within five feet? 
AABRIA: Yeah, you're within melee. She keeps interposing herself between you and very specifically Morrighan. 
AIMEE: Okay, I'm going to say: Ted, first of all, you look great. Second of all, I know you're just trying to help. But I'm going to cast Darkness on both of us. 
AABRIA: So Darkness is an AoE. 
AIMEE: What does that mean? 
AABRIA: So you pick a point in the world to cast it on. 
AIMEE: Right where I am and she is. 
AABRIA: Amazing. 
ERICA: How big is the AoE? 
AABRIA: How big is your Darkness? (gasps) I get to use. (gasps) 
AIMEE: I'll tell you. 
AABRIA: Thank you. (sniffs) I'm so happy. 
ANJALI: Oh. (laughs) 
AABRIA: This is so good, I never get to play with these. 
AIMEE: Okay, so (laughs) 15-foot radius. 
ROBBIE: 15 radius. 
ANJALI: Mm, no. 
AABRIA: Centered entirely on you. That's going to catch everyone. 
ANJALI: Oh no. 
ROBBIE: Oh no. 
AABRIA: Do any of you have the ability to see through magical darkness? 
ROBBIE: Magical darkness? 
MATT: No. (laughs) 
AABRIA: Not darkvision. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ERICA: No, I don't. 
AIMEE: I do. 
MATT: (laughs) Oh no. 
AABRIA: Yeah, you do. 
ROBBIE: Aw, you creep. 
MATT: That's awesome! 
ROBBIE: How long have you been planning this? 
ERICA: My god. 
ANJALI: Fuck me! 
MATT: I love it. 
AIMEE: I get the Paul Hollywood handshake, my sweaty fucking hand. 
MATT: Yeah! 
AIMEE: Just like-- (strains) 
MATT: That's legit. 
AABRIA: With all the love in my heart: Fuck 'em up. 
AIMEE: Aw. Well, I was just trying to get Ted not to fuck 'em up. 
AABRIA: No no. 
AIMEE: But I think that's the only thing I can do, and I burned a spell slot, one of my three. 
ERICA: Does that mean we can't see? 
AIMEE: You can't see shit. 
AABRIA: You can't see anything. 
MATT: We're essentially blind. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Yeah, I think that's all I can do except for move. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
AIMEE: I don't want to move, because if I move-- 
AABRIA: Why not? 
AIMEE: Well, let me ask you this, so it's 15-foot radius, if I move-- 
AABRIA: So it's technically a static-- Look, I understand I've tried to cheese this a lot where you're like, "I put it on my body so I'm always the center of it." Technically, it's a fixed point in the world. 
AIMEE: Okay. So then I'm definitely not going to move, right, because-- 
AABRIA: So you can move around and stay in-- 
AIMEE: Within-- 
AABRIA: Where you dropped it is where this is, it's not going to move with you. So you can move, you will not provoke opportunity attacks. 
AIMEE: Well, then I would say that, (sighs) I mean, I don't want to, but for the purposes of this, I would probably move us there so we could get a good shot of everyone. 
AABRIA: Perfect. 
AIMEE: Oh yeah. 
AABRIA: You're there. 
AIMEE: Yeah, okay, gotcha. 
AABRIA: Yeah, Ted's going to stay and keep doing the damn thing. 
ANJALI: So is that still in darkness? 
AIMEE: Can she? 
AABRIA: Yes. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
ANJALI: And am I in darkness? 
AABRIA: You are not in darkness. 
ANJALI: But everybody else is gone. 
AABRIA: But what you do see is a big old dome of dark. 
ANJALI: A void. 
AABRIA: You cannot see inside it. 
AIMEE: They can't see me, but I can see them? 
AABRIA: Yep. 
MATT: Correct. 
AABRIA: You have perfect vision on everyone. 
MATT: Shit. 
AABRIA: But do you know what you do have? 
AIMEE: What? 
AABRIA: You got a little buddy. 
AIMEE: (gasps) 
ANJALI: Oh. 
AABRIA: Your familiar can act on this turn. 
AIMEE: I don't want to. 
AABRIA: I need you to kill them. 
AIMEE: Okay, well. I don't know what my familiar can do, actually. Can my familiar do anything, or what can it do? It's a spider. 
ANJALI: I need to pee so bad already. 
AABRIA: Just go pee. 
AIMEE: Go pee. 
ANJALI: No, I don't want to miss anything! 
AABRIA: Go pee, you're good. 
ANJALI: No, we're going to watch. 
MATT: ♪ Don't wanna miss a thing ♪ 
AABRIA: What? If you pee now, you won't miss anything because we're just looking up how Find Familiar works. 
ANJALI: Look really slow, okay? 
AIMEE: Oh, here. 
ANJALI: ♪ I can't miss a thing ♪ 
AIMEE: Well, I got that. 
AABRIA: Don't piss long. 
AIMEE: ♪ Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah ♪ 
ANJALI: I don't even know where to go. 
AIMEE: "Your familiar acts independently, but obeys your command." 
ROBBIE: Oh my god, what's happening is so cool right now. (laughter) 
ERICA: Whoa! 
AABRIA: Sweet. 
AIMEE: "It can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal." 
AABRIA: Correct. 
ERICA: The dick gems are sentient! 
AABRIA: I will say, an important thing for your familiar is it can deliver touch spells on your behalf. 
ERICA: They're talking to us. 
AABRIA: So you can set up future things if you want with it. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: Also, you can use it to give yourself the help action-- 
AIMEE: Oh. 
AABRIA: -- so that when you attack something, you attack it with advantage, which you're already doing because nothing can see anything. 
AIMEE: So then I guess I will go to, because she's not here, thankfully, she can't hear me do it. Can I have my familiar make some movement towards Fy'ra Rai? 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: I don't know where it is. 
AABRIA: Let's get you a little guy. 
AABRIA: I ran out of normal tiny spiders because I used them all. Where did I find the little one? 
ROBBIE: Them all? 
AABRIA: Huh? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) You used them all? 
AABRIA: I used them all; I could've used a different boy. It's funny, I'm going to bring out a very big guy. 
ERICA: Please don't do that. 
AABRIA: Ooh, okay, I understand, we all understand emotionally that it's a spider, but I'm going to use this really cute little squirrel. 
AIMEE: Cute, oh my gosh. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah! 
AIMEE: Squirrel? 
AABRIA: He's a little guy. 
AIMEE: Squirrel! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Squirrel's going to get, oop, right up next to Fy'ra Rai. 
ROBBIE: Spider squirrel, uh-oh. 
AABRIA: ♪ Spider squirrel ♪ 
ANJALI: Spider squirrel? 
AABRIA: Uh-huh. 
AIMEE: Spider squirrel, girl. 
AABRIA: So Opal's familiar just crawled out of the darkness and is looking up at you and does the little hairy jumping spider, like (hisses). (laughs) 
AIMEE: Can I do anything or that's the whole turn? 
AABRIA: That's it, that's your turn. 
ANJALI: Does it look fierce? (laughs) Does it look like it's-- 
AIMEE: I think it's just a tiny baby spider. (laughs) 
ANJALI: -- on my side or not? 
AIMEE: It's got cute eyes. 
AABRIA: You know what? Insight check. (laughs) 
AIMEE: Ooh. 
AABRIA: (gasps) Aw, look at the guy. 
ROBBIE: That's perfect. 
AABRIA: And a little dick. 
AIMEE: Oh my god, it really does. 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: You did that. 
AABRIA: Blame Dani, we were trying to come up with an array that you all could see. 
ANJALI: 22. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
ANJALI: 22. 
AABRIA: 22. 
AIMEE: Dani's like, "They can see dicks." 
AABRIA: (laughs) You see that this thing has never attacked you, probably cannot attack you, but is trying to set up something for the future. 
ANJALI: Oh no. 
AABRIA: So is not necessarily friendly to you, this is not it going like, "Please, please, help my mistress." 
ANJALI: Above, I don't know, what do you call it? Above table, above game in a way-- 
AABRIA: Sure. (laughs) 
ANJALI: -- things. Do we know how-- Do we know what happens to her familiar if it goes under zero hit points, if it dies? 
AIMEE: I think it dies, or just go away, let me see. 
AABRIA: It goes away, this is a thing that happened before, I believe, in Kymal. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
ANJALI: Oh, that's right. 
AABRIA: Yeah, it goes away, and then she has to spend an hour re-summoning it, and I'm pretty sure Opal's bitched about how hard it is. 
ANJALI: Excellent, okay, fantastic. 
AABRIA: But it's fine. Perfect. (laughs) Yeah, at the bottom of the order, Cyrus goes, "I can't see anything." (quiet laughter) 
AABRIA: "Hey, bro." 
ROBBIE: Yes? Yes? 
AABRIA: Bro, can you hear me? It's dark in there. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I am blind, not deaf. Yes, go on. 
AABRIA: "You're in-- It's dark where you are." 
ROBBIE: Urine, there's urine somewhere? 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: "Like a little bit, but we don't have to talk about it right now. I'll get it in a second. I'm very nervous." 
ROBBIE: It's okay, I'm scared, too. 
AABRIA: "Yeah, what do you want me to do?" 
ROBBIE: I don't know, what do you see around you? 
AABRIA: "Big-ass black bubble." 
ROBBIE: Whoa, bubble, don't punch the bubble. 
AABRIA: "You want me to punch the bubble?" 
ROBBIE: No, don't punch the bubble. 
AABRIA: "I can shoot it with my arrow." 
ROBBIE: No, no, don't! 
ERICA: All of us in unison. 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ERICA: No. 
AABRIA: He turns. "Okay, okay, okay. What do I do?" 
ROBBIE: Kill a spider. In general, they're bad. 
AABRIA: "Okay." (laughs) He's going to peek around this corner and come all the way over here. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: And unleash on this spider in front him. 
ERICA: Hell yeah, hell yeah. 
AABRIA: He's still level six. (laughs) 
AIMEE: Oh no. 
ROBBIE: What?! 
AABRIA: What? 
ROBBIE: He hasn't learned anything? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: He would not be a himbo if he had learned a lesson. 
ANJALI: He was too busy getting handjobs. 
AABRIA: Frankly, I think it's crazy that Dariax is so high level. 
ANJALI: He was too busy spending time trying to allow Opal to give bad handies. 
AABRIA: Yeah! 
MATT: He was level 10, but the handy was so bad. 
AIMEE: She's learning. 
AABRIA: (laughs) It just busted his ass back down to six. 
AIMEE: Not good. 
ANJALI: I can't unsee that, I can't unfeel that. 
AIMEE: Not good. 
ROBBIE: How do you do? 
ANJALI: Oh gosh. 
AABRIA: You see hi-- None of you see anything. Fy'ra Rai. 
ANJALI: Yes. 
AABRIA: You actually see Cyrus unleashes a bow and it glances off the big bubble butt of this spider-- 
AIMEE: (laughs) Bubble butt. 
AABRIA: -- bubble butt, harmlessly. The spider rears back, and he's like, "Fuck." 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ANJALI: Do better! 
AABRIA: "Help." (laughter) 
AABRIA: "Help, help." He is staring at you going, "Help, help." The spider hasn't moved, (laughs) he's just nervous about the future. And we are back up to the top. Morrighan, you're up, it is dark as shit. 
ERICA: It's dark as shit. Did I see where Fy'ra was before? 
AABRIA: Wait, hold on. There's one more thing I want to do. 
ERICA: Oh, okay. 
AABRIA: I always forget between rounds. 
ERICA: Classic, classic. 
AABRIA: We're at round two now. 
MATT: We are. 
AABRIA: It's dark. 
ANJALI: (groans) 
MATT: It's going to be fine, we're fine. 
AABRIA: I need everyone, including Opal, to make a wisdom saving throw. 
MATT: Oh. 
AABRIA: Difficulty's 18. 
ROBBIE: Uh-oh. Aw. 
ERICA: A wisdom save? Oh my god. 
AIMEE: 18. No. Hold on, why can't I add? 
AABRIA: I don't know. 
AIMEE: 18, exactly 18. 12 plus six is 18. 
AABRIA: Okay, perfect. 12 plus six is 18, you're perfect. 
ROBBIE: Oh, you got to be-- 
AABRIA: Meets it beats it. 
ANJALI: Oh, plus everybody gets four. All of us get four-- 
ERICA: Oh yeah, yeah. 
ANJALI: -- because of Bless. 
AABRIA: You do all get a plus four on saves. Not you, Opal. 
AIMEE: It's okay. 
AABRIA: But you made it, so you're okay. 
ANJALI: 26. 
ERICA: Oh, 18. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 26. Yeah, you make it. 
ERICA: Oh wait. Plus four or plus a d4? 
ANJALI: Plus a d4, oh sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. It wasn't 26, it was 22. 
AIMEE: Oh, Matt. 
AABRIA: That's just on attack rolls. 
AIMEE: Oh, buddy. 
AABRIA: Attack rolls and-- 
ERICA: 19. and saving throws. 
ANJALI: 26. 
ERICA: 19, 19. 
AABRIA: 19. 
ROBBIE: 18 minus one, plus two, baby. 
AABRIA: Yay! 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Thanks, bud. 
MATT: 17, minus one. 
AIMEE: No. 
ANJALI: Oh, plus? 
MATT: Plus one, so 17. 
ANJALI: Yay. 
AIMEE: All right. We've got it. 
ROBBIE: I think we might've cracked this. 
MATT: Yep. 
ERICA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, are within 10 feet of me? 
MATT: I am. 
ERICA: You have plus three to-- Anyone within 10 feet of me gets a plus three bonus to all saving throws. 
AABRIA: Yeah! 
AIMEE, ANJALI, and ROBBIE: Yay! 
MATT: Yeah! 
ERICA: Aura of Protection, baby! 
ANJALI: 20, baby! 
MATT: Hell yeah! 
ERICA: Paladin power! 
ANJALI: Let's go! 
MATT: Appreciate that! 
AABRIA: Love it. 
ERICA: It's in the rules! 
AIMEE: It's in the rules. 
AABRIA: It's in the rules! The rules of the game say I can do this. 
MATT: That's awesome. Hell yeah. 
AABRIA: Incredible. 
ROBBIE: I finally got a decent roll. 
AABRIA: You all feel something wash over you. A sense of helplessness, of momentum shifting. You reach towards the magic that you share with one another and shake it off. It is artificial and foreign to you, pressed on you by the magic of the Spider Queen that is trying to get you to leave Opal alone. Back up to the top. Morrighan, you're up. 
ERICA: Did I see where Fy'ra was before we all got dark? 
AABRIA: Yes. 
ERICA: So I did? 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
ERICA: Could I roughly estimate that perhaps I wanted to rabbit hop over to her? 
AABRIA: You could try. 
ERICA: All right. I'm going to go, I'm going to yell out. 
AABRIA: Have you ever jumped in the pure dark? It's not a matter-- 
ERICA: Absolutely, I'm in Kymal all the time. It's dark all the time, and I'm in vaults, and those are dark. So yeah, obviously. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ANJALI: Pew, pew, pew! 
MATT: That's confidence! 
ERICA: Obviously. 
AIMEE: (party horn) 
AABRIA: Love that. 
ERICA: I move in the darkness. I slither, I slide. 
ANJALI: And hop! (laughter) 
AIMEE: I half believe it. 
ANJALI: She hippity-hops. 
AABRIA: "I slither, I slide." 
ANJALI: I hippity-hop and I pop. 
ERICA: I slip and slide, it's dark in there. Casinos are all dark and seedy. You know how it goes. 
AIMEE and ANJALI: Yeah. 
ERICA: The Maiden's Wish was dark all the time. They had electrical issues. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Do we have electricity? 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: In Exandria? 
MATT: On a small scale. 
ERICA: I could make an AMF in the dark. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
MATT: In Whitestone. 
AABRIA: No, you're good. 
ERICA: Sorry. 
AABRIA: No, you're good, you're good, you're good. 
ERICA: The flames were bad. 
AABRIA and ANJALI: (laugh) 
AIMEE: The candles were wet all the time. 
ERICA: The candles were so wet! 
AIMEE: Why? 
MATT: (laughs) 
AABRIA: Okay, I'm going to have you make an acrobatics check with disadvantage to bunny hop. 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
AABRIA: It's not a matter of can you figure out how to jump, it's, the hard thing about jumping is knowing how to prep yourself to land when you don't see where you're going. 
ERICA: What if I Misty Step? Does that change it? 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ERICA: Oh! (satisfied laugh) Okay. 
AABRIA: Go ahead. 
ERICA: I'm going to Misty Step then. I'm going to use my-- Yeah. I'm going to use my bonus action. Can I yell out to Fy'ra? Can I just yell out to her to place her with my big old ears that I have? 
AABRIA: Oh hold on. It does say, "You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see." 
ERICA: (groans) 
AABRIA: So. 
ERICA: That does present a problem. 
AABRIA: It does. 
ERICA: All right, I'm going to-- 
AABRIA: A little blind jumpity jump or you can try to blind Misty Step. 
ERICA: You know what? (groans) 
AABRIA: I just might hurt you to do it. 
ERICA: I only have a plus two acrobatics, so that's why I'm like-- My athletics is really good. 
AABRIA: Yeah, this is more of a stick the landing so you don't give yourself a stinger in your big old bunny ankles. 
ERICA: Wait, do I have, because of my Vow of Enmity, or because of Haste do I have-- No, that's just on attack. 
MATT: You get to add a d4 to it, though. 
ANJALI: Add a d4 
ERICA: Oh! Okay, okay. 
ANJALI: That's it, that's it. 
ERICA: I'll roll at disadvantage. 
ANJALI: Oh no, that's-- 
ERICA: Just to see. 
MATT: Yeah, skill check. 
ERICA: Just to see how it goes. 
MATT: I think it is. 
AABRIA: Yeah. It's not a skill check. 
MATT: No, it's not! 
AABRIA: It's attack rolls and saves. 
MATT: Saving rolls, you're right. So I don't do anything. 
ERICA: Okay, so that's-- 
MATT: Thank you. 
ERICA: -- 10, 11, 12 plus-- Oh wait is it d4? 
ANJALI: d4. Yep, you're right. 
ERICA: That's a d4. 
MATT: Don't add a d4, I was wrong. 
AABRIA: No, you don't add a d4 to this. 
ERICA: Oh. 
MATT: I was wrong. That was me. I was wrong. 
AABRIA: Yeah, it's all good. 
ERICA: That's a 12. 
AABRIA: I never remember how Bless works. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ERICA: Then, that's a eight. Yeah. 12 and an eight. 
AABRIA: So total an eight? 
ERICA: So an eight, yeah. 
AABRIA: Okay. You go to bound out and away. 
ANJALI: Eight plus two. 
ERICA: No, six, seven, eight. 
ANJALI: Oh, like I said. Okay. 
MATT and AABRIA: (laugh) 
ERICA: Yeah, like we said. 
AABRIA: Like you said. 
ERICA: I feel like that's a great roll. 
AABRIA: You bound out and away. You get clear of it and you're like, "Jumped a little higher than I thought." Gonna land a little harder than you thought. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: Go ahead and roll a d8 for me. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: I'm going to use the die equivalent to the roll you made. 
ERICA: A five. 
AABRIA: Take five points of damage. 
ERICA: Cool, but do I land near her? 
AABRIA: Yeah, you can land exactly where you were headed. 
ERICA: Amazing. 
AABRIA: It's just a matter of having that problem of like, "Oh my god." 
ERICA: Absolutely, that's totally fine. 
AABRIA: Stinger. 
ERICA: That puts me at, oh god, oh wait. (gags) 79. Okay. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ERICA: I literally cannot count, you don't understand. It's so bad. 
AABRIA: That's okay. 
ERICA: I have squirrel brain. 
AABRIA: You're doing great. 
ERICA: Okay, so I'm right next to Fy'ra. 
AABRIA: Yep. 
ERICA: Correct? Okay, great. I am going to-- I feel-- Sorry, for a little bit of flavor, I am really thinking about what Ted said. Honestly, it's kind of negated by the fact that they threw the first punch, for sure, by sucker punching Fy'ra. But also, why was that my first reaction? I feel the blood and I can't even see it, and it's so sticky. It just feels really wrong and bad and I'm sitting there waiting for the Matron of Ravens to, I don't know, say something to me. But I need to do something other than make something bleed. So I hop over to Fy'ra, and I look at her and I take my hand and I slam it on her arm and I heal her with my Lay on Hands pool. 
ANJALI: Thank you. 
AABRIA: Amazing. 
ERICA: I'll heal you for as much as you're damaged. 
ANJALI: That's a lot, are you sure? 
ERICA: Is that 30? 
ANJALI: It's 31. 
ERICA: It's fine, yeah. 
ANJALI: All right. 
AABRIA: All right. 
MATT: Slick. 
AABRIA: Let's go. 
ERICA: Yeah. What is 65 minus 31? 
AABRIA: Who could say? 
ANJALI: 34. 
AABRIA: 34. 
ERICA: Name your names, you know? (laughs) 
AABRIA: Name your names. That's going to live inside of my body in a really fun way. "Name your names." It's a challenge. 
ERICA: 31, right? 
AABRIA: It's an opportunity. 
ERICA: Yeah. 31, okay. I'm going to say, I'm going to look at her and say, maybe you can bring this to a less bloody conclusion than I would. Then do I have another action? 
AABRIA: Because you're hasted. 
ERICA: Because of my haste? 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Man, I need to get some fucking Haste. 
ERICA: Is that little spider fucker, is he near me? 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ERICA: Great. I'm going to stab him. 
AIMEE: Stabby stab, stab. 
ANJALI: Stabby, stab. 
ERICA: Great. I'm going to stab-- 
AABRIA: That's her familiar. 
ERICA: I don't care! 
AABRIA: Okay, I'm just saying. 
ERICA: It's not Opal. It's not Opal, it's a spider. 
AABRIA: All I'm going to say, you can absolutely do it, but if you, going off of your stated intent to find something other to do, than to make something bleed. 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: I will say you have an opportunity to commune with your deity. 
ERICA: Oh, the Raven Queen. Yes. 
AABRIA: Or, right behind you is a big old dick of gems. 
ANJALI: Yeah. 
ERICA: Well, I don't want to crush the gems. 
AABRIA: Right, crushing isn't the only option. You felt, again, as your foot passed over it you're like, "What magical shit is happening right here?" 
ERICA: Okay, what do I with though? Wait, what do I do with it other than crush it? 
ANJALI: Could I have responded to her? 
AIMEE: Wear it. 
AABRIA: Sure, yeah. You turn to her, you're like, "What the fuck do I do with that dick of gems?" 
ANJALI: I will say, as you heal me, save some of it for Opal, we will need it. Get as many gems as you can. 
ERICA: Okay. Okay. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ERICA: I'll hop, I'll go walk over to the gems. 
AABRIA: There's one literally right behind you. It's a matter of turning around. 
ERICA: Oh, I can't see. 
AABRIA: Oh yeah, sorry. 
ANJALI: It's also on the screen-- 
AABRIA: You've got a little grouping right here behind you. 
ANJALI: -- over there if it helps. 
ERICA: Okay. Then I'm going to reach down and try to grab them, I guess. 
AABRIA: You reach out and grab them and you pull them away from this sticky spider web. 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: As you take them into you and you hold them, and your intention here is to protect them? 
ERICA: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Not break them. There is something in that intention and in that choice that triggers a memory. 
ERICA: (amazed revelation) 
AABRIA: You understand suddenly that you are holding on to some portion of Opal, a bond between the two of you. Something that, if destroyed by the Spider Queen or her minions, she will lose forever, and part of it is her connection to you. You think back to when you were still floating so slowly on the brumestone platform. 
AIMEE: (slowly grinding gears) (laughter) 
AABRIA: You had all given up your huffing and puffing and doggy piling behind and it's just of a quiet moment. The rest of the group is sleeping, and you had an opportunity to quietly talk. At this point, that raven that you know was connected to the Matron of Ravens has flown away, but there's something in the feeling inside of you. You have not been selected, you haven't made a choice yet, but the connection you feel is there. You have an opportunity as the sun drops behind the mountains to speak quietly and calmly. 
ERICA: Can I ask you a question? 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
ERICA: When you-- When you took that vestige, how did you know it was the right thing to do? 
AIMEE: Oh, I didn't. I kind of-- It was the thing to do at the time. I don't think we ever really know. But, it doesn't feel bad to have a purpose. 
ERICA: (exhales heavily) That's all I've wanted my entire life. (exhales heavily) 
AIMEE: You're so good at so many things. 
ERICA: I don't know. I see you and everyone else and it's just-- I wouldn't have survived without you. 
AIMEE: Oh, yes you would have. I mean, you survived in that dump for all these years. 
ERICA: It was pretty bad. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
ERICA: I don't know, I know it's hard and you're going through a lot, but, I just want you to know that I think you're really cool. 
AIMEE: Oh my gosh, I think you're really cool! If I could just have a little bit of your personality, you're so confident. I mean, not in this moment, but usually you're confident and just so sexy, and that's-- But more than anything else, it kind of seems like, I don't know, like you have an inner strength that I don't have. Not yet. I'm still young. But I mean, you're young too. Oh my god. (laughter) 
ERICA: I can't! I can't. (lingering laughter) 
AIMEE: You know, when I first saw you at the Maiden's Wish, I thought, oh no. Another pretty girl. But then I got to know you and I was like, oh wait, actually, if we put our heads together, we can do anything, and look good doing it. 
ERICA: I love that for us. 
AIMEE: I know that sounds really stupid. 
ERICA: No! 
AIMEE: But, there's nothing like being underestimated. 
ERICA: Under promise. 
AIMEE and ERICA: Over deliver. 
ERICA: I like that. 
AIMEE: Me too. 
ERICA: I think you're really pretty, too. I think we're both pretty in like different ways. 
AIMEE: Totally. So it actually really balances it out. 
ERICA: Absolutely, yeah. 
AIMEE: Yeah. Hey, I think you're so good at so many different things. If this doesn't feel like the right purpose for you, then maybe it's just a purpose for a season. You don't have to stick to it. I mean, I have to stick to this. It's stuck to my head. I've tried to take it off. 
ERICA: It's on there. 
AIMEE: It's on there good, yeah. Then she shows her real look, and it's just gruesome. 
ERICA: Oh, oh my god. 
AIMEE: Yeah, sorry. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Morri, it's getting a little infected. 
ERICA: What? 
AABRIA: It's getting a little infected. 
ERICA: Oh, okay. 
ROBBIE: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
AIMEE: I know, I'm trying my best. But if you just need someone to give you permission to just follow your heart, you have it. 
ERICA: Thank you, Opal. 
AIMEE: You're welcome. 
AABRIA: You feel yourself move back from that. Those gems that you claimed here the Spider Queen can never take, and Opal keeps a pillar of her personality and a connection to you. 
ERICA: Aw, that's so cute. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ERICA: So sweet. 
AABRIA: Who are you saying that to? 
ERICA: Aw, that's so sweet. I don't know, I'm just holding these gems! 
ERICA: Aw! 
AIMEE: You just hear: Under promise-- 
ERICA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: -- over deliver. 
ANJALI: Aw! 
ERICA: Aw, and I look and I see her blood on these dick gems. 
ANJALI and AIMEE: (laugh) I'm like, how could I have done that to her? How could I have hurt her like that? Yeah. Okay. 
AABRIA: Anything else? 
ERICA: I don't think-- 
AABRIA: Scrillion points of movement, if you're trying to-- 
ERICA: Oh yeah, I have a septillion point. 
AABRIA: -- be somewhere else. Yeah. 
ERICA: I'm next to Fy'ra. I actually think I'm good, question mark? I'm out of the dark, right? 
AABRIA: (laugh) Yeah, you're good. 
ERICA: Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll just hang out. 
AABRIA: The question mark killed me, that was great. (laughs) 
ERICA: See what happens. I'm on it today. 
AABRIA: Amazing. Dorian, you're up. Fy'ra Rai, you're on deck. 
ROBBIE: After this deep, true, feminine bonding-- (laughter) 
AIMEE: Cyrus was in the background of that flashback like-- (sleazy, suggestive winking) (laughter) 
AABRIA: It's bad. All of you saw that across the telepathic bond. 
AIMEE: Aw! 
AABRIA: The moment you interacted with those gems-- 
AIMEE: So sweet. 
AABRIA: -- you triggered the memory of it between the two of you, but because you are all telepathically bonded, it is something you all-- 
AIMEE: That's cool. 
AABRIA: -- can and did see. 
AIMEE: Love that. 
AABRIA: Those of you that weren't there get a new thing. So some of you have that strange instance of: Oh, I was asleep right there, but now I'm getting a different viewpoint of it. 
ANJALI: Wow. 
AABRIA: Which is weird. 
ERICA: Oh. Do I have anything else I can do? Can I yell something? 
AABRIA: Oh sure! Sure, sure, sure. 
ERICA: Okay. Because it wasn't intuitive for me to grab the gems, I was going to stab them, which is very much where Morrighan's head is. But I'll just yell: Grab as many jewels as you can! 
ANJALI: That's what I said! (laughter) 
ERICA: I was just saying it louder! 
AIMEE: Not Fy'ra Rai being so bossy, I love it. 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
MATT: I don't know who to listen to! 
ROBBIE: I can't see shit! 
AABRIA: We heard "Bossy Genasi" up top and she went-- 
ERICA: We're saying the same thing! 
ANJALI: I am just being on brand! 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ANJALI: Bossy Genasi is apparently my name now. 
AIMEE: Oh my god. Obsessed. 
AABRIA: Incredible. 
MATT: Love it. 
AABRIA: Hey, bud. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to fly straight up. 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
ANJALI: Yes! 
ROBBIE: In the darkness. 
AIMEE: That's smart. 
ROBBIE: Ascend out of the dome. 
AABRIA: Yeah, yeah. Is that okay? It's 15-foot, a dome of influence? 
AABRIA: Oh my god, Matt, you've got so much cool shit! 
MATT: That's what I leave them there for. 
ANJALI: Look at that! 
AABRIA: I love it. I love it here! 
ROBBIE: I'm going to-- 
ANJALI: I've always put Dorian on a pedestal. 
ROBBIE: -- traverse it a little. Now I can see, and I go: Huh! (laughs) (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I've got so much, I am weighed down with so much shit, but I fish around in my backpack for this little mandolin that my boy Dariax gave me. 
AABRIA: (gasps) Oh! 
ROBBIE: I strum a beautiful harmonic tune, and with my Canaith mandolin, I'm going to cast Dispel Magic on the Darkness. 
MATT: Oh! 
ANJALI: Baby! 
ROBBIE: So, I think that just works? What level is Darkness? 
AIMEE: 5th-level. 
ROBBIE: Oh fuck! That might not work. 
ERICA: 5th-level, but you can do 7th. 
ROBBIE: 5th-level? 
AABRIA: I'm sorry, do you think we came to fucking play? 
ROBBIE: I didn't know it was 5th-level. I don't think I've got that capability. 
AABRIA: Let me-- 
ROBBIE: All right, is that-- 
AABRIA: What if I Googled anything to help. 
AIMEE: I also have it, I can-- 
MATT: I think you roll for it to see if you dispel that. 
AABRIA: I think it is a roll. 
AIMEE: It's a roll. 
AABRIA: It's a roll. 
AIMEE: Please pass the rolls. Anyone know that? 
AABRIA: I heard piss. 
ERICA: I heard piss, too. 
ANJALI: I did, too. 
AABRIA: Yeah! 
ERICA and ANJALI: Please piss the rolls. 
AABRIA: I simply won't. 
AIMEE: Please piss the rolls. 
AABRIA: I've never played D&D, so it's pretty exciting to see this for the first time. 
AIMEE: Oh no, I don't have that. 
ROBBIE: Oh, oh, oh. Yeah. 
AABRIA: You're going to make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 plus the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends. 
AIMEE: What do I do here? 
ROBBIE: Okay. So it would be-- 
AABRIA: You can cast Counterspell. 
AIMEE: Yeah, but-- Sorry, I'm confused. So he's going to roll for something. 
AABRIA: Yes, he's going to make an attempt, there's nothing you can do. 
AIMEE: For sure. Then what does it have to beat? 
ROBBIE: Is it my spell attack? 
AABRIA: 10 plus the spell's level, so it's going to be 15. 
ROBBIE: Oh, a 15. 
MATT: It's the ability check. 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
MATT: So, you roll and add your charisma. 
ROBBIE: Oh, I roll a what? 
ANJALI: You add your charisma. 
MATT: You roll a d20 and add your charisma. 
AABRIA: Plus-- 
ROBBIE: Add my charisma. Okay. 
AABRIA: -- three. 
AIMEE: Then I don't have a reaction until I find out what that is? 
AABRIA: You can see it happening. So you're like, oh, you're casting magic. You can Counterspell it if you want. 
ROBBIE: I'm flying over it. 
AIMEE: But what if it doesn't work? 
ROBBIE: We'll see. 
AABRIA: We'll find out. 
ROBBIE: Hiya! 
ANJALI: (laughs) It bounced. That doesn't count. 
ROBBIE: Hiya. Same roll. 
ANJALI: Oh my god. 
ERICA: You got the same roll! 
ANJALI: That's impressively-- 
ROBBIE: Impossible that it jumped up there and did that. 
AABRIA: Oh no, it's consistent. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, dog shit. 
AIMEE: (exhales) Thank god. 
ROBBIE: Nine. I'm just shit at my rolls. Yeah, I fly over and I try to cast it at Darkness, and-- (mouth fart) (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I'm still flying, I was like, oh damn! 
AIMEE: Oh no! 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ERICA: I go, did he just fart? 
ROBBIE and ANJALI: (laugh) 
AIMEE: He knows how to jump to fart. 
ERICA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Dariax is still in darkness? 
AABRIA: No, if you tried to fly high enough to be over the darkness-- 
MATT: No, he is. 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
MATT: I am. 
AABRIA: Oh, Dariax is still in the darkness, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
AABRIA: Damn it, I knew I was going to confuse-- 
AIMEE: Oh my god. 
AABRIA: -- your stupid fucking names! 
MATT: (laughs) We're back, baby! 
AABRIA: I hate it here! 
AIMEE: I just want to say Doriax. 
AABRIA: There's so many letters, and you didn't pick any different ones. 
ROBBIE: My intent was to dispel the magic and fly over and land next to Dariax, but I'm in flight, and it's all happened, my failure happened too quickly to where I could really have a different plan. So, I'm going to try the same plan. I'm going to try to use my mind's eye and imagine where Dariax would be in the darkness based on my keen spatial awareness and drop down next to my buddy below me about 15 feet. 
ANJALI: Oh. 
AABRIA: Okay, here's what we're going to do together. 
MATT and AABRIA: (laugh) 
AABRIA: I need you to make-- 
AIMEE: You're going back into the dark? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
AIMEE: That's love! 
ROBBIE: I'm with my friend. 
AABRIA: That is love. 
ERICA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: ♪ Together ♪ 
AABRIA: Give me an acrobatics check. 
ROBBIE: Acrobatics check? 
AABRIA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Good thing I'm super good at that! 
ERICA: Ooh! 
ROBBIE: 27. 
MATT: Woo! 
ERICA: Nice. 
AABRIA: You're great. You flutter in, and because you're using your little feet flappies-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: -- Dariax, you can hear him coming in hot. You can give him a little landing. 
MATT: Hey, what's up, man? I got you, I got you! I'm tugging at his ankle, trying to help him get to the ground a little bit. 
AABRIA: You get grabbed by the foot and yanked down. 
AIMEE: A shoe comes off. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to feel around in the darkness for him, his little broad shoulders. You do a great job, buddy. I'm going to tap him on his shoulder and return the bardic inspiration as well. So we're both super goosed up. 
AABRIA: These little guys-- 
ROBBIE: We're helping each other out. A
AABRIA: -- just trading their little bardics. 
AIMEE: They need a spin-off. 
AABRIA: Oh my god. 
AIMEE: That would be so cute. 
ROBBIE: Where's my 10? 
AABRIA: We could do one in the afterlife. 
MATT: If you want I can just-- 
ROBBIE: I know, I know. I want to get it. 
AIMEE: I was like yeah! No. 
AABRIA: Oh. 
AIMEE: I know. 
MATT: There it is. 
ROBBIE: Oh man, and that finishes my turn. I burned my spell on the Dispel and that's it. That's all I can do. 
AABRIA: I'm sorry. Can you roll better? 
ROBBIE: I'm trying! 
MATT: (laughs) 
AABRIA: I was just asking, I was just asking. 
ROBBIE: I'm trying! 
MATT: Damn! 
AABRIA: I was just asking! 
AIMEE: Burn! 
AABRIA: I'm just asking questions. 
MATT: Vicious! 
AABRIA: I'm just asking questions. 
ROBBIE: It's a big bag. 
ERICA: Did you say he was using his little feet flappies? 
ANJALI: He's got little winged boots. 
ERICA: I like the idea-- 
AABRIA: He's got little winged boots. 
ERICA: -- of the wind boots struggling to just-- 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ERICA: -- keep him where he needs to be. 
AABRIA: The boots are great. 
ERICA: Okay. 
AABRIA: I think they see his lack of confidence in his ability and they're like, aw, shit. They got the yips in they're like: (stuttered flapping) (laughter) 
AABRIA: Bring it in. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Fy'ra Rai, you are up. 
ANJALI: Cool. The dick gems that are near me and Morrighan, are those the ones that she picked up? 
AABRIA: Yeah, she grabbed these. Here you go, that's for you. 
ERICA: Those aren't dick gems. Oh, yeah they are! 
ANJALI: Okay. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ERICA: Whoa, I thought you were just throwing me a spider web, but there's dick gems on this spider web. 
AABRIA: Yeah! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
ANJALI: Is there one-- What about the one that I ran over that I felt? 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
AABRIA: Yes, there are some under your feet right here. 
ANJALI: Okay. 
ERICA: I love these dick gems! 
AABRIA: It's like 10 feet to your left. Can you see? 
ANJALI: Okay. Since I can't see my girl. 
AABRIA: Yeah, right there. 
AIMEE: Is she way out of melee from-- 
ANJALI: I can't see the guys, can't see anything but these-- 
AABRIA: Your familiar can't attack. 
ANJALI: -- fucking spiders. Cool, cool, cool. 
AABRIA: Tight, tight, tight. 
ANJALI: What I would like to do-- 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
ANJALI: -- is to begin using my movement to run and scoop those up and continue in the direction. 
ERICA: I just choked on my water. 
ANJALI: I believe there are more right next to, underneath Dariax at the foot of the-- 
ERICA: I'm okay. I'm okay. 
ANJALI: So there's the ones next to me and then there's also the ones underneath Dariax at the foot of the wall? 
AABRIA: Yup, start here. 
ANJALI: Uh-huh. 
AABRIA: Because it is an interaction. 
ANJALI: Right, okay. While that is happening, though, I'd like to check in with the Wildmother again, if I may. 
AABRIA: You got a lot of things going. You're cooking a lot at once, my guy. 
ANJALI: Okay, so I can't. 
AABRIA: So, let's go one at a time and we'll see how it goes. 
ANJALI: Okay, cool. 
AABRIA: You move 10 feet to your left and scoop up this array of gems. 
ANJALI: Mm-hmm. 
AABRIA: I guess it's it's vaguely dick-like, if you're a child. 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: You scoop them up and-- 
ANJALI: I've been hanging around with Opal for awhile. I'm picking things up from my girl. 
MATT: She tends to rub off on ya. 
ANJALI: Hey! 
AIMEE: Ey! 
AABRIA: It's only like seven good, though, so you don't like it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Hey. 
AABRIA: You don't like it that much. 
AIMEE: Grin and bear it. 
AABRIA: (laughs) You scoop up the gems. 
ANJALI: Okay. 
AABRIA: You feel a memory trigger. It's only about a week ago. You're laying low in a little-- Village feels general, even for here. Yeah. Village feels generous for here. It is a couple thatched roof, daub and wattle homes at the edge of a bog. It's a little stinky. It's a little like that weird mixture of cold and humid-- 
AIMEE: Ugh. 
AABRIA: -- at the same time. 
AIMEE: Woof. 
AABRIA: You're like, what is the industry? Why are people here when you can be anywhere else in the world? 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: But it's quiet, and it's safe, and some of the individuals that you've met look like aging adventurers is the generous word you give to someone who looks like they have killed a lot of people in the past and might be laying low for another reason. 
MATT: Mm. 
AABRIA: But they don't ask any questions when you come. They point you to an open home with a little nod of understanding that we didn't see you, you didn't see us. If you need anything, no you don't. 
AIMEE: Mm. 
ERICA: Whoa. 
AABRIA: It's one of those quiet evenings, the sun drops below the treeline, the smell of that bog kicks up a little more as spring peepers and little frogs and little critters in the woods get noisier, celebrating that twilight corpuscular time of day. You are exiting the little room as Opal is coming in from doing something, you don't know, but you bump into each other. 
AIMEE: Sorry. 
ANJALI: It's okay. You notice that, or you would see, that she's holding the two parts of the once whole tiger eye that she had before our escape. She's holding both parts of them and moving them between her fingers. 
AIMEE: How are you doing? 
ANJALI: Oh, you know, I'm-- I don't know anymore. 
AIMEE: I give her a hug. 
ANJALI: Oh, uh-- 
AIMEE: It's okay, you can hug back. Yeah, we'll work on it. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ANJALI: Yeah, because she's holding-- (laughter) 
ANJALI: I told you. I told you it was important to heal things with your sister. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
ANJALI: My-- (sighs) I've always known who Fy'ra Kai is. She's my sister, but she's also always been, how do you say? A bit of an asshole. 
AIMEE: (laughs) Yeah. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ANJALI: But I never thought that she would, that she would want to kill me. I don't know who she is, and she has been so much a part of who I am, even when I thought she was gone. 
AIMEE: You know, sometimes in death or in absentia, Opal's proud that she even knew that word. I think we tend to glorify people, their memories, at least. It's supposed to be like that if we're never going to see them again. But then, you see them again. Then it's just a choice to love them. Even if they're assholes. Because in my case, I'm the asshole sister. I can tell you, it comes from a place of deep insecurity. 
ANJALI: Has Ted ever tried to kill you? 
AIMEE: No, but I've definitely tried to kill her ass. And I feel so bad about that. 
AABRIA: You hear inside your head, "No, you fuckin' don't." 
AIMEE: (scoffs) Oh, yes I do. This isn't about you, Ted. 
AABRIA: "You're literally talking about me." 
AIMEE: Shut up. Um, you know, I would be jealous of you if you were my sister, too. You're so confident and you know so much and you can beat anybody's ass. You're a really great person, too. Maybe she's not any of those things and that must be really tough. 
ANJALI: You know, when our parents named us, Fy'ra, for fire. But Rai and Kai, two sides of a coin. Kai for warrior. Rai for trust. 
AIMEE: Mm. 
AIMEE: I look up at the crown on your head. And see how it digs into your skin. I don't know what is happening to you, Opal. But you can trust me to fight for you as if you were my sister, too. 
AIMEE: Oh, I'm definitely your sister. Even if it's just until you get your own sister back. A rent-a-sister. 
ANJALI: Um. She looks at the two halves of the tiger eye. And takes one half. And holds it out. Even if it's just for now. 
AIMEE: (whispers) Thank you. I put it in my pocket, or somewhere close to my heart. And I look around, and I realize I don't have anything to give her. So I just spritz my perfume. (laughter) 
ANJALI: (coughs) 
AIMEE: I know it's not much, but... (laughter) 
AIMEE: I just want you to know, I'll fight for you, too. I'll beat your sister's ass if I have to. Although, she could probably beat my ass, but-- I've often felt like the other side of a coin, too. And it's really hard. So, you and I can just be two coins together. 
ANJALI: We are the richer for it. That's her best attempt at some kind of humor. 
AIMEE: (forced laugh) (laughter) 
AIMEE: But she's genuinely trying to laugh, she just can't. I'm just like, ha, ha. 
AABRIA: Ted's like, "You've got to do better than that. She tried so hard. No, I swear to god, I will turn off your magic for a week. Be better." 
AIMEE: (less forced laughs) But it comes like 30 seconds too late. Because she was listening to the-- (laughter) 
AABRIA: You have a feeling behind your eyes of Ted going, "Nailed it." 
ERICA: The visual of you spraying her in the face and then her going, (cough) You going, "it's not much, but--" Like, you don't even acknowledge that she's going (coughs) 
AIMEE: It's all I have. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Amazing. 
ERICA: I can't! 
ANJALI: After her laugh, I will look down and say: I'll stay in my lane. 
AIMEE: Have another hug. 
ANJALI: Okay. This time I squeeze her real, real tight. Do I-- When I push up against her head, do I feel anything? Because that crown is there. Do I feel it when I push up against it? 
AABRIA: 100% 
AIMEE: Interesting. 
AABRIA: You feel those thick briars made of iron scratch your scalp. It feels, you are not poisoned, but it feels poisonous. That idea of like, something scrapes you and you can feel it slipping under your skin and burning and traveling. This thing does not want you to touch it, and doesn't like that it's that close to you. 
ANJALI: Excellent. I'm going to press harder into it and I will think the words, you won't be with her for long. 
AIMEE: Ooh! 
AABRIA: Impressive. 
AIMEE: Eek. 
AABRIA: You never feel what that does. But deep in the pit of Opal's stomach, something shakes a little queasily to her. And we come back from that. You are holding those gems in your hand, that's your action. 
ANJALI: Okay. 
AABRIA: You still have the rest of your movement and a bonus action. 
ANJALI: All right, okay. 
AABRIA: Those dicks are yours. They are protected. 
AIMEE: To keep. 
AABRIA: You all saw that beautiful moment. 
ANJALI: I will, okay, so I-- thank you. 
AABRIA: Just throwing gem stones at people, like what. 
ANJALI: Great, so-- 
AABRIA: Like Pride. 
ANJALI: I have the rest of my movement. Where can I get-- 
AABRIA: It's not much. 
ANJALI: I would like to walk up the wall, because I can. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Do you enter the darkness? 
ANJALI: Not the darkness, the one behind me. The wall with the other gem on top of it. 
AABRIA: Yeah, okay. 
ANJALI: Right where that gemmy gem is. 
AABRIA: I'm getting the little sticky guy. So you can get up there and be, I just want you to be safe. 
ANJALI: I want to be further away. Well, actually-- I'll stay close to Morrighan. 
AABRIA: You want to be here? 
ANJALI: Yeah... yes. Then I will just, again, spend a-- No, I won't spend a ki point. Bonus action, eh-- Dodge, dash, disengage. What the fuck? So many things. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Thinking in character voice is my favorite thing. 
ANJALI: Excellent, because I can't stop this completely unplaceable accent. 
MATT: I am Fy'ra Rai. These are my friends Dodge, Dash, and Disengage. 
ANJALI: I have no-- (laughter) 
ANJALI: I have no idea who I am or what is happening. Great, so from up there, I'm going to survey the scene and I'm... Yeah, I'm going to survey the scene. So I can get a good vantage point of where everything is right. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
ANJALI: Fantastic. 
AABRIA: I love that. Opal. It's time to turn this up a little bit. 
AIMEE: Oh, naur! 
AABRIA: Legendary action, you get to decide. Do you want to act, do you want your sister to act? Do you want the spiders to act? Or do you want the Spider Queen to act? 
AIMEE: Oh shit! Oh no! Not the Spider Queen. 
AABRIA: (wishy-washy noises) 
AIMEE: No, bitch. 
AABRIA: "Nothing happened last time. It could be better." 
AIMEE: I feel like, well, Ted can't see in there. 
AABRIA: Correct. 
AIMEE: I'm the only one that can do anything. 
AABRIA: Or the spiders. 
AIMEE: Or the spiders on the outside. I mean, I don't want to do it. Aimee doesn't want to do anything. 
AABRIA: Yeah. I mean, Aimee playing Opal doesn't want to do anything. Aimee who wants to maybe have a friend sit by you soon? 
AIMEE: Um, okay. So, da, da, da, da. I am going to... 
AABRIA: You know what? Fuck it. Let's leave it for a roll. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: Make a wisdom saving throw. 
AIMEE: Okay. Ooh. 11. 
AABRIA: You feel this potential. You know the thing, like you are the secret scared thing inside your own brain right now. I think you understand Ted better than you ever have before. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: There's something external to you that presses in on you, it's massive, it's overwhelming, and it leans in, it grabs you. Not by your clothing, but by the bones of your ribcage and pulls you in and says, "Kill them. We need to go." With an 11... "This is taking too long." 
AIMEE: Oh no. 
ROBBIE: (gulps) 
AABRIA: "Drop them now." 
AIMEE: And I have to? 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
AIMEE: Okay, so then what I'm going to do is that I am going to shoot out three Eldritch Blasts indiscriminately. No, I mean, I can see them, so to Dorian, Dariax, and Fy'ra Rai. 
ROBBIE: But why? 
AABRIA: Question. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Would-- To Opal. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
AABRIA: Between the three of them, who's the biggest threat? Who. There's something inside-- I'm going to bring you into the DM of it all really quickly. A lot of times when we run encounters, you're like, "I'm a bad guy who doesn't know what the party's like." 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
AABRIA: I'm just going to attack whoever's close. But you've been with these people your entire adventuring life. You know who you can drop that will make the fight a little easier. So, behaving from the top of your intelligence, as a DM, as the primary antagonist here. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
AABRIA: Instead of indiscriminate to all three, pick one to focus down and make it count. 
AIMEE: Okay, I'm going to spread a little love around and I'm going to go for Dariax. 
MATT: Bring it. 
AIMEE: I'm sorry. 
AABRIA: Let's go. 
AIMEE: Okay, three Eldritch Blasts. Here we go. 
MATT: Does she have advantage because I'm blind? 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm! 
AIMEE: Oh! For three, I have advantage for three? 
MATT: Hey, Dorian! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: The lights just went out. I think I'm blind. 
AIMEE: Do I have to remember? 
AABRIA: The easiest way to do it is to roll two to get one at a time. 
AIMEE: Smart. 
ROBBIE: You can't see, but you're-- 
AABRIA: So, first one. 
AIMEE: Okay, so 15 plus, 25. 
AABRIA: Okay, 25. Second one? 
AIMEE: Oh fuck, 29. 
MATT: Hits. 
AABRIA: Just hits. Third one. 
AIMEE: And 28. 
ROBBIE: Jiminy Criminy! 
AIMEE: I want you as my friend. 
AABRIA: Were any of those a 19 on the die? Oh, no, no. 
MATT: Nah, I'm not. 
AABRIA: Yeah, yeah. You're good. 
AIMEE: They were not and now I get my tens. 
AABRIA: Get your tens. 
AIMEE: And-- 
AABRIA: 3d10 plus 15. 
AIMEE: So, two, four, six, and 13. Plus what? 
AABRIA: Plus 15. 
AIMEE: Plus 15 is-- 
AABRIA: 28. 
AIMEE: 28. 
MATT: 28, yeah. 
AABRIA and AIMEE: 28. 
MATT: So, Dorian I lost-- 
AABRIA: Hold on, really quick. Just so super quick. I would like to remind you that as the fully, invested champion of the Spider Queen, you have Baleful Scion. And they've hit you a couple times. 
AIMEE: Yes, I do. Okay. Once per turn, when you damage a creature you can see, you can deal necrotic damage. 1d6 plus five. Regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you hit. 
MATT: Oh no! 
AABRIA: So roll a d6 for me. 
AIMEE: 1d6 plus five is my bad dice. That is a five plus five is a 10. 
AABRIA: So that goes up to 38 points of damage and you take 10 points of healing. 
AIMEE: Even though I'm up, oh, no I don't, I'm not up. 10 points of healing, that's perfect. 
AABRIA: A paladin smacked the shit out of you. 
AIMEE: That's right. 
AABRIA: Not that long ago. It hurted. 
AIMEE: It hurted. 
AABRIA: All right. So now, with 38 points of damage, what were you saying, my darling? 
MATT: Sorry, no worries. I was saying to Dorian: Oh, it's just dark. 
ROBBIE: Yes, it's dark. You're not physically blind. 
MATT: Oh, okay. 
ROBBIE: I mean, technically, by definition, you can't see, therefore you're blind, but your body is okay. 
MATT: Great, my body is-- (thudding) (laughter) 
ANJALI: Oh no, Buddy! 
MATT: It's not okay! It's not okay! 
ANJALI: Buddy! I don't like it. 
AIMEE: I'm so sorry. 
MATT: I'm sure it was an accident, it's fine! 
AIMEE: It wasn't, I can't help it! 
AABRIA: All right, anything on your bonus action? 
AIMEE: I don't think I can do anything. I don't think I can do anything more. Yeah, I'm good. Because I don't want to use a-- 
AABRIA: Yeah, this isn't your full turn. This is just a legendary action, so yes, good. Amazing. Next up is-- I can read and tell numbers with my mind. We had Fy'ra Rai go. 
ROBBIE: Ted. 
AABRIA: Ted is up. Ted can't see. 
AIMEE: Ted can't see. 
AABRIA: But Ted did just hear that conversation. 
ROBBIE and ANJALI: Oh no! 
AABRIA: And is going to swing a haymaker. 
MATT: I am screaming very loud. 
ANJALI: Poor baby. 
AABRIA: You yelled, but you also were having a conversation in the dark and you fluttered down in front of her, so she's going to wild swing in both of your directions. Oh shit, with disadvantage. Does a 14 hit? 
ROBBIE: It does not. 
AABRIA: Yeah, I didn't think so. Second attack. Does a 19 hit? 
ROBBIE: It does. 
AABRIA: Oh my god. She swings and then comes around and is able to clip you across the chest. 
ROBBIE: (grunts) 
AABRIA: For-- Save me. Nine points-- 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
AABRIA: -- of piercing damage. 
ROBBIE: Piercing, okay. 
AABRIA: Piercing. 
AIMEE: Pew, pew. 
AABRIA: She's like, "Got one!" You can hear her be excited in your head and go, "Ooh, sorry. It's fine." It is quiet inside your group chat once more. That's Ted's turn. Dariax, you're up, and my little 'piders are on deck. 
MATT: I'm up? Okay. Dar-- 
AABRIA: Oh! Sorry. I need you to make a-- Fuck. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. What ya got? What ya need? 
AABRIA: Please give me a concentration check. 
MATT: Oh yeah, yeah! 
AIMEE: Oh, finally you get to do it. 
MATT: I got War Caster, so I have advantage on it. 
AABRIA: Finally. Goddamn it! 
ANJALI: Excellent, yes! 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
AABRIA: You have to make a 19. That's half of-- 
MATT: Oh, that's a 22. I'm fine. 
ROBBIE: Yeah baby! 
AABRIA: Motherfucker! 
ANJALI: Yeah, baby! 
AIMEE: Oh! 
AABRIA: I'll never get rid of Bless! 
ANJALI: I love you! 
ROBBIE: He's back! 
AABRIA: I'm in hell. 
MATT: ♪ Dwarf constitution ♪ All right. 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
MATT: Reacting from the hits, he's like, Darkness hurts! Darkness is bad. We're going to get out of here. I'm going to spend a few sorcery points here to do Quicken Spell. Right, so spend two sorcery points on that. I'm going to Quicken-- 
AIMEE: Cool! Fuck. 
MATT: -- Dimension Door. 
AABRIA: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: Hey! 
ANJALI: Yeah. 
AABRIA: Amazing. 
ERICA: Heck yeah, heck yeah, heck yeah. 
MATT: I'm going to grab your arm, and be like: All right, I think I saw something that way. Let's get out of here! I'm going to go (poof), try and Dimension Door us on top of that higher, the highest platform of this hill. 
ANJALI: Yeah. Nice, nice. 
MATT: Mind you, I don't see it right now, so I'm guessing where it is. 
AABRIA: I believe in you. 
MATT: (laughs) 
AABRIA: I believe in you. All right, really quick, do I have to see it? 
MATT: Dimension Door you do not have to see. I know, because I've had people Dimension Door into dragons before. 
AABRIA: Yes! 
MATT and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
ANJALI: Ooh! 
AABRIA: No. 
ERICA: Into a dragon? 
AABRIA: Ted happens to be a Mage Slayer, so. 
ANJALI: Oh. What the fuck is that? 
AIMEE: What is that? What the fuck is that? 
MATT: Oh. 
AABRIA: Someone that loves when you cast spells near them. 
ANJALI: No! 
AABRIA: Cool, I don't have to-- Yeah, it's going to be a melee attack with disadvantage as you go, but. God, another-- It was a natural 20 and a three. 
AIMEE: Aw, baby. 
MATT: Aw. 
ANJALI: Thank your guys' gods. 
AABRIA: Is it, are we close to 12? 
MATT: No. 
AABRIA: Okay. 
ERICA: (laughs) 
AABRIA: You go. Damn it, Ted. (laughs) I should have given her Devil's Sight. All right, so now you're going to make a little blind attempt to get up to here? 
MATT: Correct. Let me see here. 
AABRIA: Are you taking your-- 
ERICA: There's a dick gem up there. 
ANJALI: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
AABRIA: Yeah, we're going to see. 
AIMEE: There's a dick gem up there. 
AABRIA: There's going to be two thresholds of success. 
ERICA: It's so big! 
AABRIA: One to land well, two to land without crushing those. 
MATT: I respect that. 
ERICA: Oh no. 
ANJALI: Oh fuck. 
AABRIA: So, it'll be two, yeah. Are you trying to take Dorian with you? 
MATT: Yes. 
AABRIA: Okay, make-- What do we want to call this? I'm going to say this can either be perception-- I just want this to be perception. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
AABRIA: Just to see if you can trust vibes and land where you want to land. 
ERICA: There's a dick gem there. 
AABRIA: So now-- 
ERICA: There's dick a gem there. 
AABRIA: -- a 15 is going to get both of you where you want to go. Over a 20, you will not inadvertently crush the gems you don't see under your feet. 
ANJALI: Okay. 
ERICA: I think so, yeah. 
MATT: I rolled-- 
ERICA: To my knowledge. 
MATT: Well, I got a perception of plus one. 
AABRIA: Oh my-- Wait, I thought you were going to-- Okay, okay, okay. I'm so proud of you. 
MATT: Yeah, I got a negative in my wisdom. 
AABRIA: I forgot, I forgot, I forgot. 
MATT: This is Dariax we're talking about. 
AABRIA: I forgot! 
MATT: As I grab you and both (poof). I did roll a natural 18, which puts me at a 19. 
AIMEE: Whoa. 
AABRIA: Yeah! 
ERICA: Get it, boy, get it! 
MATT: I have some bardic inspiration that I recently got here. 
AIMEE: Oh! 
AABRIA: Let's go! 
ANJALI: Yeah, baby! 
ROBBIE: Save the gems! 
MATT: 25! 
AIMEE: All right! 
ANJALI: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Bardy party! 
ANJALI: Get it! 
ROBBIE: Let's go! 
ERICA: Bardy party! (laughs) 
ANJALI: Bardy party. 
ERICA: Brought my bardy for the party. 
AABRIA: I think the thing you do, is because you know there's a height differential between the two of you, you levitate a little bit above where you want to land. Because you're like, I don't want him to stub his legs-- 
MATT: Yeah, that's valid. 
AABRIA: -- on the ground. That gives you just enough eyes on the gems under your feet that you're able to go: (sudden halt) 
MATT: (startled halt) 
AABRIA: (laughs) Do a little splits over. 
ANJALI: Oh no, and you knocked me down. Oh no! 
MATT: I feel his pain. 
ANJALI: I was bowled over by your amazing move! 
AABRIA: I'm sorry! It was so cool, she fell off the top. 
ANJALI: Blown away. 
MATT: I have that effect on people. 
ANJALI: Yes. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
ANJALI: You have definitely blown me away many times. 
AABRIA: Dariax, you do the splits. Yeah, over the gems, under your body. 
MATT: I'm full on, we're talking Van Damme. 
ANJALI: Full on Van Damme! 
AABRIA: Yeah! (cheering) 
MATT: He's like: Oh, shiny! I still have my action. 
AABRIA: Yeah! 
MATT: Since I did that as a bonus action. 
ANJALI: Amazing. 
AABRIA: Yes. 
MATT: Just pick them up. 
AABRIA: Amazing. 
AIMEE: So cool. 
ANJALI: Yeah, baby! 
AABRIA: You lean down, scoop up the gems. 
AIMEE: So rad. 
AABRIA: You feel yourself suffused with light and energy and the scent of Opal's perfume when she's not spraying it directly into your grill. (laughter) 
AIMEE: It's a gourmand. 
AABRIA: It's a gor-- (laughs) Yeah, give me some notes from your fragrance. 
AIMEE: It's vanilla. 
ERICA: It's all I have. 
AIMEE: It smells like the top of a crème brûlée, if you will. 
MATT: Mm, mm. 
ANJALI: Oh. 
AIMEE: Very edible. 
AABRIA: There is-- I think you go back the least far. This is just a couple days ago when you were first taking off. As you hit the road, there's a time in the middle of the night. Dariax, you wake up. You got to take your night piss. It's an important part of your day. 
MATT: It's like a beauty sleep. 
AABRIA: (laughs) You see the constellation of your friends and their various sleeping accoutrement, and one empty one. Opal, gone. You scan around. You see, like light bouncing off of the back of a cat's retinas, but opalescent pink in the dark, down and away, tucked between some flat sheet rock and almost behind a bush, she is back in a corner, muttering. Her eyes are open, unfocused, unblinking. You can hear the murmuring and the muttering. Somehow, it's louder in your ears than it is out in the world. 
MATT: Slowly, carefully get up from my prone sleeping position, and begin to inch over towards her, not to startle her, and be like: Hey. Hey, Opal. 
AIMEE: Stops muttering, but she does not have her Mask of Many Faces on. So she looks like her corrupted self. (gasps) 
MATT: Opal, are you okay? 
AIMEE: How did I get here? 
MATT: Maybe you're having a dream. Can I get you anything? Some water? 
AIMEE: That's okay. Thank you. 
MATT: He steps up a little bit to her as she softens, not affected by her visage, and plops down next to her with his hands on his knees. How are you doing? 
AIMEE: Do you ever feel like you're not really here? 
MATT: That's a very big concept. 
AIMEE: You can do it. I believe in you. 
MATT: Meaning just not present, not focused? 
AIMEE: Yeah, like-- I don't know what I'm saying. 
MATT: No, it's okay. You can talk to me. 
AIMEE: Like, almost like you don't exist. But you do. But it's murky. I'm just kidding. (laughs dismissively) How are you doing? 
MATT: He reaches over and takes your hand and just holds it for a second. (sighs) I can't say that I've had that feeling myself. But it hurts to think that that's what you're going through. 
AIMEE: You know, Dariax, you're really kind. You're a really good person. And I also think you're pretty smart. 
MATT: You're very sweet, too, and a terrible liar. But, I'm getting better. You know? I'm learning from you all. I'm trying to be more focused in my studies. This recorder's not playing itself anymore, you know. 
AIMEE and ANJALI: (laugh) 
MATT: But no, I'm-- (sporadic laughter) 
MATT: I care about you. We all care about you. It's not lost on us that you bear a burden that I don't think any of us really understand. I just, I look at you and I-- I feel like you feel alone, when you're not. 
AIMEE: Oh, I have so many voices in my head, I definitely never feel alone. But I know what you're saying. I don't feel that way at all. You guys are the best friends I could ever hope to have. I just like to feel like I'm, I don't know, like I could enjoy it. Sometimes, I just don't feel like I'm here, like I'm in a daze or something. I don't know. 
MATT: I'll tell ya what. I've spent most of my life up to this point just picking a direction and running. 
AIMEE: Mm. 
MATT: It took kind of-- It took stumbling into some purpose with the rest of you nitwits to kind of, I don't know, put a little more care in what I did. Dorian's looked after me since I began to think about making a difference, and he's protected me and shown me what it's like to have an impact and think about what that impact means to others, you know? So maybe, maybe I got to pay it forward. And I protect you. 
AIMEE: And I protect you. 
MATT: I mean, I know that. But also, don't feel like you got to be away from us over here in the dark. It's a cold night. 
AIMEE: It is cold. 
MATT: Come here, come here. I'll be big spoon. 
AIMEE: Oh, that's really nice. 
AABRIA: As you come over, Dariax, make a wisdom saving throw. 
MATT: That's a 12. 
AABRIA: You're inside this memory, and all of you can see it. But I think, Dorian, because you're also right there, where Dariax has scooped this up, you see that the bundle of gems that Dariax holds, some of the shine goes away. A little bit of black begins to seep across it. Within the vision, Dariax, you don't see or remember what actually happened. Opal doesn't walk over to you. 
AIMEE: Hmm. 
AABRIA: She stays far away. 
AIMEE: So he doesn't finish the vision? The vision doesn't finish? 
AABRIA: It's going to change. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
AABRIA: I will leave it-- Do you want to corrupt this memory? Or do you want me to do it? 
AIMEE: Oh, I-- I want you to do it. 
MATT and AABRIA: (laugh) 
AIMEE: I can't. I can't do it anymore. (laughter) 
AABRIA: Oh no, it got sad! I almost felt bad, but then I know I'm having a great time. 
ANJALI: (laughs) 
AABRIA: You see that Opal takes a step towards you, and then rocks back onto her heels. "No." 
ANJALI: (laughs) 
AABRIA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: She's bowled over. 
ERICA: She just can't stand it. 
ANJALI: I'm just really hurt by what is happening to Opal! It's knocked me off of my axis, you know. 
AABRIA: "Dariax, you understand I can't, right?" 
MATT: What? What do you mean? I'm right here. 
AABRIA: "No. When I agreed to this, I know I did it just to look out for you all, but I made a promise. Something's coming, and I think I have to go soon." 
MATT: Well, wherever you go, we'll follow. 
AABRIA: You see a flash of something across her face, a flare of anger quickly smothered. "No. I think where I go, I need to go by myself. Will you let me go? Will you let me go?" 
MATT: If you think you need to. 
AABRIA: "You need to l--" And you see it, something warring to try to maintain the feeling of talking to Opal. But it's not a great impression of her and it's beginning to fall away. "You have to let me go. Just keep going. Get Dorian wherever he needs to go. I have to go with her. (through gritted teeth) You have to let me go with her." 
MATT: Dorian. 
MATT: "(dark) No." 
MATT: Dorian! 
AABRIA: "No!" 
AIMEE: (startles) 
AABRIA: "Let her go!" You see Opal's jaw opens too wide, the mandible snaps and cracks and splits apart, and she lunges for you. 
MATT: (startled yell) 
AABRIA: In the darkness, the vision goes away and you come back up to the present. You're holding the gems. 
ANJALI: We all saw that in our telepathic bond or no? 
AABRIA: I think at first it was just that iteration, but yes, by the end that new memory started settling in for the little bit where Dariax tried to accept it. Yeah, you all saw it. 
AIMEE: Did I see it? 
AABRIA: Yes. 
AIMEE: I have no memory of what actually happened? 
AABRIA: You remember the real memory, but you are starting to slip back farther and farther. 
AIMEE: Okay. I think I telepathically say: I don't think that's what happened. 
AABRIA: "Be quiet. I'm trying to let them go peacefully. If they stay, my champion, I will make you kill them. You understand that, right?" 
AIMEE: Yes, I understand. 
AABRIA: "So you make them go, or I do." 
AIMEE: Guys, maybe you should go. 
AABRIA: We come back to the present. One more action. Do you want to go, do you want the spiders to go, or do you want the Spider Queen to go? 
AIMEE: Definitely not the Spider Queen. The spiders can go. 
AABRIA: Spiders activated. 
ANJALI: Can I put myself back on the wall? 
AABRIA: Oh yeah! Let's get you back up, buddy. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ERICA: She's prone. It's the rules. 
AIMEE: She had a great fall. 
AABRIA: Hey, you've got to stop drinking before we go into these fights. 
ANJALI: I mean, I'm really cut off. 
MATT: (laughs) 
AABRIA: Spiders, let's see, this one. This is what I'm going to do. This one's going to begin trying to climb up, and I think it's only going to get to about there. We're going to have this one come around the corner. He can't quite get to you to fight you. This spider back here is going to destroy gems. Opal, it happens so quickly you don't even feel the memory. They're getting better at this. It's smoother and easier. This spider is going to lunge for Cyrus. And this one, we'll have it climb up and it's going to join. We'll have this one come up here and then it will be in melee for the next round. 
ERICA: I imagined it with tiny little knives. 
ROBBIE: Oh, it's just moving. 
AABRIA: Just little tiny knives. It's like, have you ever seen those TikTok videos of them crushing the apple snail eggs? 
MATT: Yeah! 
AABRIA: That's all I can think of when it's smushing those gems. It's like, forbidden Gushers. I love it. 
MATT: I'll show you after, it's terrifying. 
AABRIA: Yeah, it's so good. 
ANJALI: I don't know that I want to see it. 
AABRIA: All right, Cyrus is going to take one off big spider. That will hit. You all see that big bubble butt spider leap unto Cyrus and tackle him to the ground, and its mandibles come and they pinch into his shoulder. 
ROBBIE: (unhappy noise) 
AABRIA: Just, "Gah! (gasping)" And he begins to frantically tear away at his clothing like he's on fire. Like he needs to get to his skin. And you all see that blue gets shot through as the veins in his shoulders begin to pulse a sickly green. 
ERICA: Eww! 
AABRIA: He is prone and under the poisoned condition. 
ROBBIE: Oh god. And prone? 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Buddy. 
ROBBIE: Oh, buddy. Hey, buddy. 
AABRIA: He did his best. And that's fine. The rest of them smushing-- Smushing your personality. You can feel it begin to fall away. The threats are not idle. And there's something inside of the Spider Queen that is beginning to panic. It's taking too long. She needs something new to happen. First, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw. The difficulty is 20. 
ANJALI: Oh, come on, girl. Come on, girl! 
ROBBIE: Dang! 
AIMEE: All right. Fuck, that is a 13. 
AABRIA: You feel something inside you begin to bubble over and you start to make a noise. It comes from deep and it's like a groan, not quite a scream, and Ted turns and locks on you, even within the darkness, and is going to run and sprint, and dives into your body. 
ERICA: What's that? 
ANJALI: What? 
AABRIA: And disappears from sight. 
AIMEE: Oh shit. Okay, what does that mean? 
AABRIA: And the rest of you-- Oh, we'll find out in a second. The rest of you, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw. 
ROBBIE: Uh-oh. 
AABRIA: Difficulty is 20. 
ROBBIE: What! 
ERICA: Um, okay. 
AABRIA: You still have Bless up. 
ERICA: Oh, okay. 
AABRIA: And people within 10 feet of you. which feels like, I think you can Fy'ra Rai in that. 
ERICA: Okay. 
ANJALI: 24. 
ERICA: Oh, 17, 18, 19. 
AABRIA: I can never get anyone. 
ERICA: 20, 22-- 25. 
AABRIA: Yep. 
ERICA: So even without anything. 
AABRIA: Oh, perfect. How'd you do? 
ROBBIE: I mean, even if I try, I still wouldn't make it, fail. 11. 
MATT: Nine. 
AABRIA: You both see, from your vantage point, something horrendous. What's the worst thing you could see on the battlefield right now? 
MATT: Oh, um-- The worst, in this moment? Would be-- A true sign of losing Opal. Seeing her become something that is beyond our reach, probably. 
AABRIA: And there it is, in front of your eyes. You see here double over in pain. As arms burst through. As her lower body swells and becomes grotesque. A drider body forms out from under her and she rises to about 12 feet tall. Her head turns and looks at you and eyes open, jet black, weeping black ihchor. Ichor, I don't know how to say that. And other sets of eyes open up. Multiples looking at you. And when she opens her mouth to scream, it's just like in your memory vision, the lie, the truth, you can barely remember anymore. As she laughs. Dorian. What's the worst thing you could see on the battlefield right now? 
ROBBIE: Oh no. 
AIMEE: This is in their mind's eye, right? Because I still have Darkness up. 
AABRIA: You do still have Darkness up. 
AIMEE: Ay yi. I didn't mean to remind you. 
AABRIA: No, no, no. You're correct. It is a convenient slip of fiction that when Dariax saw that, he no longer saw the darkness that would've obscured you. Good catch. 
ROBBIE: I think it's, the worst thing? 
AABRIA: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Stuff worse than death, I think it's everyone corrupted. So like, when we were on that door to the Feywild and Fearne saw a version of herself, I think that horrifies Dorian worse than anything. Full corruption. So I think he would see shadow images of the people that he loves at their worst. 
AABRIA: It's like all of your friends, your brother, are suddenly looking in a mirror and then that mirror version, like burned Fearne, reaches through and grabs them and pulls them in. And then steps out to replace them. 
AIMEE: Ugh! 
AABRIA: And whatever position their bodies were at the time, their heads turn unnaturally at an angle to look up at you to make sure that you know, that they know, that what has come to pass, the worst thing in your heart is true. No one else sees that, just you two. But what you do see. The Spider Queen is done fucking around. She wanted to do this the easy way. Now she's going to do it the hard way. And she's going to make you be the tool of your own severance. Opal, you get taller, you begin the stretch out. You're already lanky, kind of a model. 
AIMEE: I mean, yeah. That's true. 
AABRIA: You are now a full 6'5". Two sets of arms holding daggers, holding crystalline swords. Weep. Just weeping wounds from your head, a crown, another crown. And when you smile, that same black ichor pours from the side of your mouth. As you are joined with a third set of arms. Opal, Ted, and the Spider Queen in unison. And that's where we're going to pick up next week. 
ALL: Whoa! 
ERICA: Oh my god. 
AABRIA: Yeah! I'm sending someone home! 
ERICA: The stress! 
AABRIA: Y'all got the first day paycheck. 
ERICA: The stress of it all. 
AABRIA: We're done! 
MATT: Well, that all feels real bad! 
AABRIA: It's totally fine. It's probably fine. 
ROBBIE: Almost like the worst thing you could imagine. 
ERICA: It feels so bad. 
AABRIA: Everyone's doing super good and you're totally on the top right now and you'll probably never fall again. So I think everyone's doing really well and I'm super proud of them. So, we're just going to call it here. 
ERICA: I wouldn't get too comfy. I have some things. 
AIMEE: I've got Haste and I will cast it on Opal! 
ERICA: You know what, I've got Haste-- 
AABRIA: If you had cast it on Opal, this whole thing would be different! 
ERICA: I will be up at 3:00am thinking about how stupid that was, I will. 
MATT: No, no, that was great. 
AIMEE: Not dumber than me trying to do Eldritch Blast with d4s. Okay. 
AABRIA: I see someone who's like, "Help, no. I did negative two damage to my friends." No, no. Next time, you're collecting bodies. You get that, right? 
AIMEE: I do. 
AABRIA: So get excited. 
AIMEE: Well. 
AABRIA: You too. But until next week, be good, treat each other well, and is it Thursday yet? Ooh! (cheering)

Cooldown[]
AABRIA: Those flashbacks were so fucking fun.
AIMEE: For who?
AABRIA: No, for me to watch.
ERICA: For whomst.
AABRIA: You sprayed-- You sprayed perfume.
MATT: That's a fun mechanic.
ANJALI: It's a great--
ERICA: Oh my gosh.
AABRIA and ERICA: That was so funny.
ERICA: It's the way that you didn't react to her coughing. You just looked away and you were like, "Sorry, that's all I've got." She's just going (gags).
ANJALI: I'm immune to poison but not to that.
AIMEE: Not that.
MATT: Few are.
AIMEE: Now you smell like a cupcake, babe.
ANJALI: Delicious.
AABRIA: It's gourmand.
ANJALI: Also because my hair is on fire so it's like a burnt cupcake.
MATT: So if you just spray it's like (flames increasing).
AABRIA: Yes, that's exactly what I thought, too.
AIMEE: That's why my Intelligence is low.
ANJALI: Is it really?
AIMEE: Oh, yeah.
AABRIA: Intelligence is always a dump stat. Sweet. Yeah, you did great. How are you guys doing?
MATT: Good.
AABRIA: You feeling okay?
MATT: Good, this feels great. This is awesome. I love it. It's a--
ANJALI: Like, I hate it so much I want to keep going. You know what I mean? Like, I just want to get her back.
MATT: It's exciting because we're going to have a week to plot.
AABRIA: Yeah, you have a whole week to plot, but so do I.
MATT: Oh, yeah.
AIMEE: Opal's got a few things up her sleeve.
ROBBIE: I failed at everything I tried today. Every single thing.
MATT: Dorian's back, baby!
ROBBIE: I'm back, baby!
AABRIA: Dorian, you rolled--
ROBBIE: I'm back and I'm settling in! Bleh!
ANJALI: I just drank my entire thing of coffee.
AABRIA: You rolled so high I was like, "It's going to be different."
ANJALI: So I'm going to go pee again.
AIMEE: You're going to be up until 3 in the morning.
AABRIA: "It's going to be different." It wasn't.
ROBBIE: It was bad.
ANJALI: BRB.
AABRIA: What can we do? It stresses me out, like, look, I want to do yucky bad stuff to all of your imagination people's bodies. But I do need you to put up a fighting chance. Like what the fuck do we have to do to your dice?
ROBBIE: I don't know!
AIMEE: They're so pretty, those dice.
ERICA: They need to just be my dice, I guess.
ROBBIE: Maybe that's the problem.
AABRIA: Yeah, dude, you've been rolling high.
ERICA: I know! I swear I really do best as a paladin, like I really do.
AABRIA: You're killer as paladin. It's so good.
ERICA: I feel so conflicted about all of this. It's very difficult.
AIMEE: It's difficult.
ERICA: But I do have a plan, so get ready.
ROBBIE: You have a plan?
AABRIA: It's so scary when you get mean. I'm like, "Oooh, it's mean!"
ERICA: I have a little bit of a plan.
ROBBIE: D&D plans always work exactly the way you want them to.
ERICA: Yeah, it is going to work exactly how I want. Shut up, Robbie.
MATT: Always. Always.
AABRIA: Look, this was going to be a little meaner, and then all of my spiders rolled so badly, I was like, "Hey, it's going to be just you for a second. I cannot get these boys in here."
AIMEE: It's tough, because you want to keep it interesting, you want to keep the fight going, but at the same time, you don't want to fuck over your friends. Because at the end of the day, I want these characters to live. I want to come back and do more!
AABRIA: Yeah! You can roll new characters, though.
ROBBIE: That's dark.
AIMEE: That's fucking dark.
AABRIA: What do you mean?
ERICA: I hate Ted for being like, (sweetly) "Why oh why would you resort to violence?" (evil) "I'm going to kill you." I was like, "Are you kidding me?"
AABRIA: Super clear: The Spider Queen's whole thing is she's a bitch that lies. That's her whole bag.
ERICA: I hate it. I hate it.
MATT: For the record, I'm only going to imagine Ted as Butters now. Thank you for that.
ANJALI: Yes, exactly.
ERICA: (Butters) Why, Morrighan? Why would you resort to violence?
ANJALI: (Butters) Why would you resort--
AABRIA: Ted's definitely got a tinfoil-- her armor.
ERICA: (Butters) I was playing "Hello Kitty" has an adventure.
AIMEE: Emotional!
ERICA: Yeah, I'm so conflicted.
AABRIA: You cried, and I was like, "Don't look at me like I'm going to--"
AIMEE: When I saw fucking Ted, who is a made-up person I've never met before, I was like, "That's my sister! That's her!"
ANJALI: Can I ask questions about this map during our--
AABRIA: Of course, of course. Big ups to Matt-- this map sucked, and then Matt came in and he was like, "Hey, Buddy" and then helped me make it pretty. Thank you, Matthew Mercer!
ERICA: It reminds me of--
AIMEE: Where's the cheesecloth?
AABRIA: Okay, they got really nice cheesecloth-- OK, so fun fact--
AIMEE: It was too nice.
AABRIA: I left my cheesecloth at home, and I had some little janky kind, and they were like, "We'll go get you some new stuff," but they got, like, napkins. They're so nice. I'm like, "This isn't cheesecloth."
AIMEE: Erewhon cheesecloth.
AABRIA: Yes, exactly. They went and got the good stuff and I was like, "I can't shred this."
AIMEE: Yeah, no, you need it.
AABRIA: I'm going to put this in a nice place setting. So it'll be back and then-- The nice thing about having this in two parts is that we can make the battlefield a little--
MATT: I was about to say this feels like we're going into phase two.
AABRIA: Exactly. It was always a two-phase fight, so that's--
ROBBIE: You and I are on a clifftop holding hands.
MATT: Yep.
ANJALI: I know. That's exactly what I--
MATT: We knew it was going to end that way!
AABRIA: Fucking cuties.
ANJALI: So good.
ROBBIE: "Thelma and Louise" without the car.
AIMEE: Maybe we'll just jump.
AABRIA: You could just jump into the spiders.
AIMEE: Your wings are like--
AABRIA: The little feet flappies. Go ahead, ask your question.
ANJALI: No, I'm just looking at all the-- I'm looking for--
AABRIA: Do you want me to put this closer?
ANJALI: --gems and trying to see-- Yeah, would you? Because I have this tree in my way.
AABRIA: Yeah, there's so much stuff everywhere. 
ANJALI: Oh my god, this is so much clearer now. So which ones of these--
ERICA: Dick gem, dick gem.
ANJALI: So we didn't get these. We didn't get-- So these are all attached. I don't know which ones we actually have gotten.
AABRIA: I will go and pull it up from spiders. I just tried to cover a spider, or cover it with a spider instead of sitting there and picking it up.
ANJALI: Oh, I got you. Okay. But so we have there, we have here, here, here. Over there.
AIMEE: You won't catch me doing it.
ROBBIE: You're just facing the wall, like "The Blair Witch Project".
MATT: I know.
ANJALI: We all saw her turn into the thing.
AABRIA: So you all saw her, you all saw Ted like--
ANJALI: Dive into-- So the darkness is--
AABRIA: But you didn't see the big drider thing. That was the effect of failing the wisdom save.
ANJALI: Gotcha.
AABRIA: Then the like-- Did you do a little fart sound?
ROBBIE: I did, yeah.
ERICA: No, he just farted. He farted.
MATT: Just sit down.
ANJALI: I just can't see. Just trying to look at stuff.
AABRIA: You can just hold the map. Do you want-- I can't push it any closer because you have a choir of fucking dice.
ANJALI: I am legitimately wearing 6-inch heels right now and still having to be on my tippy toes.
AABRIA: Well, why don't we take-- You could take a picture of it.
ANJALI: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Before I go I want to ask questions. That darkness that is still up--
AABRIA: The darkness, she is still up. That's crazy.
ANJALI: So we can't see her.
ERICA: How long does that darkness last? Forever?
ROBBIE: I tried so hard!
AABRIA: Forever!
AIMEE: I actually think-- Is it like ten minutes?
AABRIA: Yeah, it's truly the whole ding-dang fight. You're going to have to knock that off of her. So you asked a helpful question. I decided not to answer it.
ANJALI: No, that's quite all right. So we just can't see her.
AABRIA: You can't see her.
ANJALI: The darkness is here?
AABRIA: Yeah.
ANJALI: Is it a sphere?
ROBBIE: Yeah.
AABRIA: It's a little dome.
ERICA: May I ask a question real quick?
AIMEE: Only as Cher.
ERICA: Why didn't we all Watusi?
ANJALI: I was waiting for it! Waiting for it the whole time.
[imitations of various singers]
ERICA: Oh, I did have an actual-- What about my stuff, everything that I cast, it's like Concentration 1 minute. Is it still going to be up when we start up?
AABRIA: 100%. Your Haste is still going strong.
ERICA: If all my stuff, all the things I've done--
AABRIA: Well, there should only be one concentration spell going.
ERICA: Oh, wait, well-- Oh, no, but then I did Vow of Enmity.
AABRIA: I don't think that's a concentration spell.
ERICA: No, it's not.
AABRIA: Yeah, you're good. That's still up.
ERICA: Oh, sick, okay.
AABRIA: Yeah, all your stuff's going to carry over, including the Bless, god damn. It was the only fucking-- I love you so much.
MATT: Come at me.
AABRIA: So fucking mad. That stupid fucking spell. It's just a little guy.
MATT: As a DM, break me. Make me drop that spell!
AABRIA: Fucking I got to--
MATT: I'll just cast it again!
AABRIA: (screams) I'm sorry, you rolled a what?
ROBBIE: I got your back, Aabria. I'll keep rolling as shitty as possible to counteract. I literally looked at the bardic inspiration, my Bless, and my roll, and went, "Oh, it doesn't matter."
AABRIA: That is wild.
ROBBIE: I don't even know if I could--
AABRIA: What did you roll?
ROBBIE: In order? It was a 19 to save, right?
AABRIA: It was a 20 save.
ROBBIE: I rolled a 11, but then I lost one so it's a 10.
AABRIA: Fuck me.
ROBBIE: Couldn't have saved me anyway. I'd have had to roll perfect.
AABRIA: I'm so sorry.
ROBBIE: But low odds.
AABRIA: That's hard.
ERICA: That's so sad for you.
ROBBIE: Thanks. That's what I was looking for, was sympathy and attention, so I'm glad you gave it to me.
AABRIA: Hey, babe, whatever this energy is, is my favorite thing.
AIMEE: It's true.
ERICA: Oh, what?
AABRIA: It's so good, it's so good. Never not this.
ERICA: Oh, what's that? I'm perfect?
AABRIA: Yeah.
ERICA: I'm the best one.
AIMEE: Pick me.
ERICA: Thanks, Aabria. Don't worry, I won't tell the others.
AIMEE: That'll be in my newsletter email tomorrow. My sub-stack.
ERICA: When I send out that little monthly letter about like, "What's Erica up to?" She's just being the best, I guess.
AIMEE: Remember when people used to do that, when actresses would do that back in the day?
ERICA: Oh my god.
AIMEE: Where it's like, "What have I--" I don't have enough-- I wouldn't have enough to fill a fucking month. Like, what have I been up to? Fucking nothing.
AABRIA: Wait, what are you talking about? Is that a thing?
AIMEE: Like, remember those emails people used to send?
ROBBIE: They still do.
AABRIA: No?
AIMEE: Or am I aging myself? Like when you first start in the biz, and people were like, "What is Aimee Carrero up to?"
AABRIA: Oh, that's crazy.
AIMEE: Oh, people didn't used to do that?
ERICA: I never--
ROBBIE: People still do that. Newletters are still like the number one delivery system.
ANJALI: I have a newsletter.
AIMEE: But like a personal newsletter?
ROBBIE: Sure. Where else am I supposed to know if you're appearing in my area?
ANJALI: Exactly.
AIMEE: Okay, this is a fun fact, and I am going to say it on camera. One time, I met Kevin Sorbo and he asked for my email address, and I was like, "I've made it." This is going to be the ticket to my-- This was before Trump, okay? I was like, "That's it, I'm going to be cast in..." I don't know what he was doing at the time. Instead, I got a conservative newsletter that he personally curated and sent out every month. I had to unsubscribe to that shit.
AABRIA: That's so funny.
AIMEE: This was like 2008. I was like, "That's it, I've arrived."
MATT: We'll swap Sorbo stories someday.
ANJALI: Yeah, I think we all got one.
AABRIA: I don't have a Kevin Sorbo story!
AIMEE: The personal newsletter is next level. "I will be appearing at XenaCon by the airport." Which I went to. Not for him.
AABRIA: No, stop!
AIMEE: Oh, I sure did.
AABRIA: Why?
AIMEE: Because Lucy Lawless! I'm a huge fan.
MATT: Lucy Lawless is amazing. She's fucking rad.
AIMEE: Huge fan, I love her. I scared her in an elevator once. Sorry, I'm telling you all the stories.
AABRIA: I love this. Whatever you thought the energy of this wind-down was, you're like, "Here we go." It's perfect.
AIMEE: So I walked into an elevator, Lucy Lawless was there, and I love her so, right? And the one thing I said-- I could have said, "Oh, you helped shape my childhood. I loved your show." I said, "Your daughter and I have the same birthday."
ROBBIE: Cool.
ERICA: That's such a--
ANJALI: That's so--
AABRIA: I think you nailed it. 
ERICA: That's such a deep cut.
AIMEE: Big fan! And that's the only thing I could think to say! "Your daughter and I have the same birthday." And she goes-- (blank stare) Like her soul left her body. I'm sorry, Lucy!
AABRIA: Lucy, I was going to say like, "Big fan of the show, Lucy Lawless."
AIMEE: Oh, I would never recover.
AABRIA: You killed Aimee Carrero with that! She went, "No, please, no, no. I was working my way back. We could have been friends."
ROBBIE: Celebrity ice breakers are hard.
MATT: Right? Right?
AIMEE: Your daughter and I have the same birthday, July 15th.
AABRIA: Look, okay, we have a new-- out of this squad, who do you think has the best Lucy Lawless impression on deck?
AIMEE: Impression?
ERICA: What is a Lucy Lawless impression?
ROBBIE: Just good acting.
AIMEE: No, well, if we're doing Xena, it would be like her battle cry, or it would be-- she was young and inexperienced at the time, her New Zealand accent peeking through the American accent.
MATT: Yeah.
AABRIA: I need a "Ay-ye-ye-ye-ye" from all four of you right now.
AIMEE: Okay, I think Anjali would do the battle cry the best, and I think that you (Erica) would sound like her, but you (Matt) would do the accent, like the New Zealand poking through the American, and then you (Robbie) would just look like her the most.
ERICA: I'm sorry, out of Robbie and I? I've gotten that I look like Lucy Lawless before!
AIMEE: She wore a lot of self-tanner on that show!
ROBBIE: I love you so much!
ANJALI: Thank you for that. I needed a laugh.
ERICA: This was my moment. I get Captain Janeway and Lucy Lawless! Those are my two.
MATT: Not here, sorry.
ANJALI: Janeway's good.
AABRIA: You got to pick one. This is a moment for healing. I don't know what you thought this wind-down was going to be, producer, but right now, we're going to-- This is therapy, so you're going to pick one of them to be your Lucy Lawless. Give me the celebrity icebreaker if you could do it today.
ROBBIE: Oh, can redo it?
AABRIA: We're going to redo it. Then we're going to send this to Lucy.
MATT: You're picking up the opals of your own memories--
AIMEE: Going back into the elevator.
ROBBIE: You're corrupted. You can do whatever you want.
AIMEE: First of all, I wouldn't run to the elevator, like I did, to get in.
ROBBIE: You ran?
AIMEE: Oh, yeah.
ROBBIE: Did you put your foot in right when it was closing?
AIMEE: (demonstrates) And she had blond hair because she was doing "Battlestar Galactica". I would literally saunter in, and be like--
AABRIA: Who'd you pick?
AIMEE: Oh, uh, all of them. I pick Erica. I pick her.
ERICA: But I don't know what she-- okay.
ANJALI: I'll stand by.
MATT: Well, this is her, not her character. Do a New Zealand accent. (NZ accent) Come on, I know you can do it.
ERICA: (badly) Oh, aye?
ROBBIE: (NZ) Sweet ass.
AIMEE: It's more nasal, I think.
ERICA: Wow, you look great.
ROBBIE: That's the worst.
AIMEE: Oh, no, I chose wrong. How about you talk, and I just look at you?
ERICA: Okay.
MATT: There you go.
AIMEE: Okay, so she's in the elevator, she's got her suitcase because she was just on a flight.
ERICA: (Cockney-ish) Oi, this suitcase is real heavy.
AIMEE: Oh, let me help you with that!
AABRIA: It's giving Eliza Doolittle.
AIMEE: Oh, let me help you with that. Oh, what floor?
ROBBIE: (NZ) Four. Aren't you a cute little thing?
AIMEE: You know, I wasn't going to say anything, but you actually were such an inspiration to-- I'm fucking this up now.
AABRIA: No, it's great! You're doing great.
AIMEE: You were such an inspiration to me when I was a child.
ROBBIE: (NZ) Are you saying I'm old?
AABRIA: I didn't realize you were mouthing it!
AIMEE: No, because you were 24 at the time, babe. I've already fucked it up and I haven't even started!
AABRIA: No, you're doing great. I'm the Spider Queen. I love you so much, you're doing so good.
AIMEE: Lucy, listen, I just want to say, you've really impacted my life, and I love you so, and your daughter and I have the same birthday.
MATT: It's a fixed point in time. It cannot be changed.
ANJALI: Cannot be changed.
ROBBIE: Oh, yeah, it's what do they call it? An event, a canon event.
AABRIA: It's a canon event.
AIMEE: It's a canon event.
AABRIA: Aimee Carrero is never here playing D&D if she doesn't tell Lucy Lawless she has the same birthday as her daughter. And scene. That was beautiful.
