MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MARISHA: (mumbles) Loud. 
MATT: Yeah. Well, we're down a couple for the evening, because they're not in the episode and they got shit to do, so we're going to make fun of them profoundly here. 
SAM: I'm not in the episode and I'm here! 
MATT: We're going to make fun of you, too. 
LIAM: That's because you're addicted to sponsorship. 
SAM: I love it. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
MATT: Speaking of which, we do have to go, before we go into the episode, our first sponsor of the evening, D&D Beyond. Sam. 
SAM: Hey guys, be the hero of your table with a free D&D Beyond subscription trial and get exclusive access to monthly subscription perks to personalize your play, share your D&D books with your party and make unlimited character slots to bring all your character ideas to life. But don't just be the hero of your table. D&D Beyond wants us, tonight, to be the hero of the internet. It's been a while since we've done one of these, but with the cast's help, I'm going to make, we're going to make some meme formats. 
MARISHA: Great. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
SAM: With D&D Beyond. So these are-- 
MARISHA: We've done this before, right? 
SAM: We did this, but we made GIFs last time. 
MARISHA: We made GIFs. 
SAM: These are going to be still images that you guys can turn into memes. 
MATT: (heavy sigh) 
SAM: In the future. 
LIAM: Cool. 
SAM: You've seen memes, guys. Don't act like I invented them, I didn't. First up, me and Marisha are going to do a meme called guy mansplaining. (yells) [camera clicks] 
SAM: Okay, good. (laughter) 
MATT: What? 
LIAM: That could be any episode of Critical Role. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: Now Taliesin's going to give us, give me a Drake-style, "Nah, maybe." First, give me the nah. [camera clicks] 
SAM: And now give me the maybe. [camera clicks] (laughter) 
SAM: That's good. Okay. Matt, you're up next. Give me hot dog on your head. 
LIAM: What? 
MATT: I don't think I'm familiar with that one. 
SAM: It's very popular; just do it. This is for the sponsor. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Oh, jeez. 
LIAM: Ew. 
MATT: I don't-- [camera clicks] 
SAM: Great, good. D&D Beyond is going to love that one. All right, Liam, give me, "Hide the Pain Harold." It's a little obscure. First, he seems like he's working on his computer. [camera clicks] 
SAM: And then, in the next shot. [camera clicks] (laughter) 
MARISHA: The old guy! 
SAM: Yeah, the old guy. 
MARISHA: The one that-- I know that-- That's good. 
SAM: Now Matt, follow it up with pineapple on your head. 
MATT: What the fuck?! 
SAM: It's on TikTok; it's a TikTok thing. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Just do it. (laughter) 
SAM: Great. [camera clicks] 
SAM: All right, now Marisha. 
MATT: I hate this. 
SAM: Marisha's up next. Give me, give me that cute doge. 
MARISHA: Mm. [camera clicks] 
SAM: Uh-huh. Now give me, "One Does Simply Not." [camera clicks] 
SAM: Now give me Salt Bae. [camera clicks] 
SAM: Very good. Now, Matt, can you create the classic, handful of rigatoni on your head meme? 
MATT: No, no, no. 
SAM: We've got the handful. 
MATT: No, no, no, no, no! No, this is not happening. This whole thing is ridiculous. 
SAM: Just put it on your head. 
MATT: I'm not going to put it on my head. This is really stupid. We're about to shoot an episode, no! 
SAM: Yes. You're doing it. 
MATT: No, I'm not doing it! 
SAM: Yes! 
MATT: And if you do, well you, you... mm. Sam, you're fucking pissing me off. If you ever do this again, I swear to god, I'm going to get you out of this goddamn thing. [camera clicks] 
MATT: Go, get out of the show. 
MATT: You're out of tonight's episode. Leave. 
SAM: Ooh! Hey, we did it. We did the lady yelling at the cat meme. We did it. Thanks, Matt, and thanks, D&D Beyond. Start your 30-day free trial today at dndbeyond.link/crsub. Matt, back to you. 
LIAM: Cat to you. 
SAM: Oh, cat to you. That was an easy one. 
MATT: Why do I let you do this to me? Thank you, Sam. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: Thank you, D&D Beyond. Liam, you have a next bit of announcements. 
LIAM: (like Laura/Jester) ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ Oh my god, you guys. Are you feeling Den Thelyss in this Chili's tonight? Because that is what I have for you. I'm going to start off with the Mighty Nein dice set for Essek. 
SAM: Did you say Den Thelyss in a Chili's? 
LIAM: In this Chili's, yeah. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
LIAM: Speaking of memes. They are dunamantic and lovely. 
MATT: Ooh! 
LIAM: Look at the 20. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LIAM: And there is the dodecahedron-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LIAM: That's right there on the 20. But that's not all we have. Hidden behind my box is a Critical Role ReAction figure, Essek Thelyss. (cheering) 
LIAM: The second of our exclusive figures found only in Critical Role shops. It is made by artists, designed by Hannah-- I had spittle everywhere, Hannah Friederichs. 
SAM: That's how excited he is! 
MATT: Essek has that effect on Caleb, you know. 
LIAM: Hannah Friederichs and Super7. The packaging is dope, it has-- Look, it's got magic, it's got his parasol, it has time, it has soup. 
MARISHA: Aww. 
SAM: Hey. Drop it, see if it floats. 
LIAM: Well, it's hard to see, the figure doesn't stand. The feet are just above where you set-- 
TALIESIN: So the cloak lets it float. 
LIAM: It rests on the cloak. Can I rip this open? Is that okay? Do we own this? 
MATT: Laura's not here. 
MARISHA: I don't know. Yeah, exactly. 
LIAM: She's not the boss of me when she's not here. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, I'll see if the text comes through. Nah, we good. 
LIAM: It's not hot boi unless he floats. 
MARISHA and SAM: ♪ Hot boi ♪ 
LIAM: Here he is, floating. I don't know if you can zoom in on-- 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LIAM: No feet touching anything. 
SAM: Amazing. 
MATT: It's about right. 
MARISHA: Looks so good. 
LIAM: Woo-woo-woo-woo. 
MATT: Fantastic. 
LIAM: That's it; that's what I got. 
MATT: Thank you, Liam. 
SAM: Good job, Laura. 
MATT: Marisha. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Sam. Either of-- 
MARISHA: You guys. Midst, Midst, Sam's baby, our thing, our new baby. 
SAM: Don't blame this on me. 
MARISHA: We really hope you're enjoying it. And if you haven't listened to it yet, then what are you doing? It's so good. Go listen. 
SAM: I like the whining. We are still in the midst of season one. Episode 12 just dropped yesterday, so it's a perfect time to jump right in. The episodes are slightly shorter than an episode of Critical Role. So you'll be able to catch up-- 
MATT: Just a little bit. 
SAM: -- a lot faster. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Jump right into this reality melting misadventures and it's a great series. 
MARISHA: You guys. It's got blackmail. It's got falling moons. It's got shady cabaret owners who love nutcrackers. 
SAM: That's true. 
MARISHA: And, as Sam said, the episodes aren't as long as Critical Role. They're like 20 to 30 minutes, so you should watch it. 
SAM: The sound design, the imagery, the narrators. They weave a tale in truly such a unique way-- I'm reading this-- in truly such a unique way that you just have to experience for yourself. (loudly) That you do have to experience for yourself! 
MARISHA: You have to go experience it! 
SAM: All right, that's it. 
MARISHA: So good. You can find it on midst.co, our YouTube channel, or on your favorite podcast app of your choice. You can also uncover more about this mysterious islet and put together all of the interesting clues yourself through the appendices. Appendices. 
SAM: Those are like little bonus things that are released after the episode. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: They're really cool. 
MATT: Sometimes they get inflamed, then you have to get them removed, too. 
LIAM: It sounds like a dirty word. 
SAM: Look for all the cool artifacts and artwork over on our socials @midstpodcast. Boom. Done. 
MARISHA: Bam. 
MATT: You did it. Well done. Congratulations to you both. Taliesin, you're up. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I get to do one now. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: (like Laura) Oh my god, you guys! That was kind of messed, that was messed up. It's okay. 
MATT: We're coming back around. 
TALIESIN: It's fine, I go this way. Oh my god. 
SAM: Wow! 
TALIESIN: It's the "Mighty Nein Origins: Mollymauk" book. We've been working on this. I've been working. It was so long. It's all of that backstory that I didn't get to tell because I am bad at rolling. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's now available at your friendly local comic shops and bookstores. It was created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics, written by Jody Houser. 
MATT: Jody Houser. 
TALIESIN: Which was so much fun. Hunter Bonyun was the artist, colorist Cathy Le, and letterer, Ariana Maher. It's really amazing. Can I just, I'm just going to like go, ooh. 
LIAM: Yeah, open it up, show a page. 
TALIESIN: Oh, like, ooh, yeah. 
MARISHA: Colors, it looks-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, look at those. Ah, look, spoilers. 
MARISHA: Oh, he's so hot. 
LIAM: It's thick with tarot theme. 
TALIESIN: Tarot, lots and lots of Moonweaver oracle and lots of cool character background. 
MATT: A lot of thought went into a lot of that. 
TALIESIN: Carnival, so much carnival. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Anyway. Check it out, go pick it up. 
LIAM: Read a book. 
MATT: Heck yeah. 
LIAM: Read a book. 
MATT: Thank you, Taliesin. I believe that concludes our announcements. So let's go ahead and get Sam out of here and get into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off: Our troop of ragtag, thrown together, circumstantial heroes and friends have been wandering the center of Issylra. It is here, in the Demithore Valley, that they encountered a village beneath one of the nexus points of the now seemingly continuous Apogee Solstice, upon which you freed the local villagers of what seemed to be an oppressive influx of Dawnfather faith, the temple encroaching and pressing its will upon the people, as well as the worship. Through relatively violent means, stormed the temple, and helped them and the guardian spirits of the land, the eidolons, to destroy the temple and send the surviving faithful to the Dawnfather away, not to return. In thanks, the people celebrated, and the local elder, Abaddina, granted you some scrying of your requests before sending you onto the next leg of what you seek, which is a means to return home, or at least, for some of you, return to the people that are your home. 
AIMEE: Aw! 
UTKARSH: Beautiful! 
MATT: As part of that gift, Abaddina sent a guide spirit, one of these smaller eidolons in the form of a wind cougar that is guiding you towards your destination, an individual named Hevestro, the Hierophant of the Emerald Tree that resides to the far north within the Irriam Canyon, told if you follow the precipice in the distance of the Ascendant Bridge Mountain, about four or five days' travel, you should reach the chasm that is the canyon. Within there, a shrine awaits, surrounded by blue flora. With that, you've gathered your things, you've made the beginning of your journey early in the day, northward, back into the Serratus Wilderness here to seek whatever lies in front. So as we now begin to press out into the day's journey, I guess, is there anything in particular you need to do while you're on the road? Anything you're particularly looking for? Or we could have somebody roll to see what events may transpire for the day. 
LIAM: I just can't remember. Bor'Dor's cart got totaled early on, right? 
AIMEE: Yes. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: So are we on foot? 
EMILY: The reindeer ran away, too. 
MATT: Yeah, you are on foot. 
LIAM: On foot. Okay. 
EMILY: We are on foot. 
AIMEE: Oh, reindeer! 
TALIESIN: Whatever we're keeping, we have in the hole. 
EMILY: I mean, well-- 
AIMEE: It's a sizeable hole! 
TALIESIN: It's a very big hole. 
EMILY: But I feel like, does the cougar look like they could go faster? (laughter) 
EMILY: Does it look it's going slower-- 
AIMEE: For us. 
EMILY: -- to match our pace? 
MATT: It looks it is matching your pace. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
MATT: It is scouting ahead a little bit and stopping and waiting for you to approach, and then it darts off a little further. 
EMILY: Because I could get a little Phantom Steed, but I think we have too many people. 
TALIESIN: We got a lot of people. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: There's-- 
TALIESIN: Only-- 
AIMEE: We're little. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Two of us. 
TALIESIN: Two of us are small, two of us are rail thin, and then there's me, and I'm a boulder. 
EMILY: I think, yeah. So let's just go at the pace that we can go. 
AIMEE: Sure. 
LIAM: What does our cougar look like again? (laughter) 
EMILY: Our cougar! 
AIMEE: Fran Drescher. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I was waiting! I was waiting! (laughter) 
LIAM: (like Fran Drescher) I'm an air elemental! (laughter) 
AIMEE: From Flushing! (laughter) 
MATT: It is a semi-ethereal looking elemental, so it is a wisp of opaque wind that takes the form of a cougar, and around it, the dust kicks up in a small cloud as it stands or moves. It doesn't seem to make much noise, although the occasional low, guttural growl that echoes like the sound of a wind pushing through slats of wood on a window. 
AIMEE: Wow! 
MARISHA: Did we see a livery or a horse stable or anything in this town? 
MATT: You did, though it looks it mostly, it seems to provide lodging for the various beasts of burden that are owned by the populace here. This isn't a major trade post. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: You could try and purchase some off of locals, if you'd like to. 
EMILY: I kind of gave our money away, I think. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, I don't have any money. 
AIMEE: She got too excited. 
TALIESIN: I'm also broke. 
AIMEE: I think I have money. Hold on. 
MARISHA: Hang on. Wait. 
TALIESIN: I don't know if we have horse money, especially considering these horses are never going to see the light of day again. 
UTKARSH: Can we trade something from the hole? 
TALIESIN: I mean, do we-- 
AIMEE: A dead body? 
LIAM: Do we know all that we have in the hole? 
TALIESIN: I don't have it. 
EMILY: Can I just ask? 
TALIESIN: I'm not the one who has the list. 
EMILY: What is the hole? 
TALIESIN: I have a basic idea of what's in there. 
LIAM: The hole is-- 
MATT: Why do you not have the list? You have the hole. 
TALIESIN: I have the hole. 
LIAM: You have the hole, but you don't know what-- 
TALIESIN: I know most of what's in there. 
LIAM: Someone in the other half-- 
EMILY: It seems like, since I've been around you, you just sometimes make a hole. 
LIAM: It's this long, black, circular piece of fabric, which "Looney Tunes" style, if you whip it out and it makes a full tablecloth and it becomes a hole. 
TALIESIN: It's a basement. 
LIAM: It's about 10 feet deep. It's got some dead bodies in it. 
UTKARSH and EMILY: Still? 
MATT: It did. 
TALIESIN: It did. We cleared them out. 
LIAM: You can't get a dead body completely out of a hole. 
UTKARSH: You can't smell out of there. 
AIMEE: No, never. 
TALIESIN: It has some armor, has some food. 
EMILY: Oh, okay. Okay. 
MARISHA: Are we going to be heading out the way we came in? 
MATT: You came in from an eastward direction. A southeast-- No, it'll be southwest of where you are currently. You were heading northeast into the village. The direction you've been told to follow and that the eidolon is guiding you is north to northwest. 
UTKARSH: Of Abaddina's village. We're still there. 
MATT: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: We're leaving there. 
LIAM: Of Hearthdell. 
MARISHA: I guess, on our way out, if we happen to see any locals with horses, then I'll stop and talk. 
MATT: Okay. Roll a perception check for me. 
MARISHA: Someone will stop and talk. 
TALIESIN: You there! Boy! 
MARISHA: Yeah. Give me that scooter! 
EMILY: You there at the pony party! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Ew, god! 
EMILY: Happy third birthday, bud. 
MARISHA: Starting great. Nine. 
MATT: Nine. As you have your supplies gathered and begin to trek outward, you look about and the only horse you see is heavily affixed to a heavy plow that is currently tilling one of the fields and is being handled by two of the various farmers in the region. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
UTKARSH: We're on foot. 
EMILY: I think, yeah. 
TALIESIN: I got no problem being on foot. 
EMILY: I could use the fresh air and exercise. 
MARISHA: Okay. We'll hoof it. 
EMILY: We'll hoof it without horses. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah. (laughs) 
EMILY: I think, as we go, I should maybe bring up the fact that, I don't know if it was obvious, but I did, during the battle, I may or may not have baby birded blood from my raven familiar and then summoned a demon from Hell. 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
EMILY: And if anyone wants to talk to me about that, because I know that that's like-- 
AIMEE: You want your flowers? 
EMILY: Oh, no! I meant more if anyone is uncomfortable with it. 
AIMEE: Oh, oh! No! 
TALIESIN: Are you uncomfortable with it? 
EMILY: No, I kind of liked it. 
TALIESIN: I kind of liked it, too. 
AIMEE: I kind of liked it. 
LIAM: And you'd do it again? 
EMILY: I, well, it requires blood of a recently dead person. 
TALIESIN: We can make that happen. 
LIAM: Well, situationally. 
EMILY: Don't encourage me. (laughter) 
EMILY: I am trying to be aware of the fact that, yes, I did enjoy the power, but it was for what I thought was a good reason. 
UTKARSH: Does the person have to be dead? 
LIAM: Newly dead is what you're saying. 
EMILY: Yeah, they have to have died within the past 24 hours. 
UTKARSH: Oh, newly dead. 
MARISHA: You got the blood, right? 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You killed the soldier and an angel. 
UTKARSH: That was so intense! The angel I didn't think was going to die. 
EMILY: I actually was wondering, because you don't know where your powers came from. Is there any chance they came from the Dawnfather and that's why the angel frowned at you? 
UTKARSH: No way! 
MARISHA: Mm! 
UTKARSH: Can't. That makes no sense. 
EMILY: Okay. 
UTKARSH: Not a chance. 
LIAM: It's been a couple of days, though, since you've had-- This is all new to you, right, since the jump? 
UTKARSH: I've never seen the kind of stuff that I've seen in the last two days before. 
LIAM: Yeah, you've been throwing electrical-- 
AIMEE: Farting lightning bolts. 
LIAM: Farting lightning bolts around. Are you getting-- 
UTKARSH: Sorry about that. 
LIAM: -- the hang of it? 
MARISHA: Do you like it? 
UTKARSH: I think when I'm very, very scared it comes out. That's all I can see. That's all I can say. You guys, the angel was right above you, right? Or you were on its back? 
LIAM: Well, no. Deni$e and I rode on Prism's friend. 
UTKARSH: Oh, you were on the demon. 
LIAM: Right. 
UTKARSH: Which was big! 
TALIESIN: Did we ever get a name, or was there just no name? 
UTKARSH: Bargador. 
AIMEE: Oh yeah! 
UTKARSH: Baragador. 
EMILY: Oh, I think Tootsie? 
AIMEE: Tootsie. 
TALIESIN: Tootsie. 
EMILY: Tootsie. 
AIMEE: Tooty! 
ALL: Tooty! 
MARISHA: Burgerder. 
EMILY: Tooty! 
TALIESIN: Not Trudy. 
UTKARSH: Between that and the rock monster-- 
MATT: That's the true name. 
UTKARSH: I think, when I'm afraid, the powers focus themselves. 
EMILY: But I feel, with any skill, you can train it, and, I mean, both Laudna and I know Counterspell. So if you ever wanted to practice. I mean, this is what we do back at the Cobalt Soul. If you're practicing and your form isn't right, then they just Counterspell you and you don't have to worry about doing anything wrong. 
LIAM: Right, exactly! We're just walking through, down the road, right? Nothing's happening right now. Nothing to be afraid of. 
AIMEE: Mm! 
UTKARSH: Sure! 
EMILY: So yeah. 
LIAM: Except Laudna. But other than that, and that's a constant, so maybe you could try a little zap. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Now. Hit a tree or something. 
TALIESIN: Or see if anything else is sitting in there or anything else feels right. I don't know how any of this shit works. 
UTKARSH: Sure! I'm happy to shoot at trees on the way. 
EMILY: I just want to help you build your confidence, right? 
UTKARSH: And I appreciate it. 
EMILY: Because they say anxiety is just excitement without the breath. So if you just give it some breath, you know? Maybe it'll-- 
AIMEE: You know, we should write that down. 
MARISHA: This is honestly very well spoken. 
EMILY: I think I read it somewhere already. 
MARISHA: Did you really? Okay. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: I didn't believe in myself until that moment. 
TALIESIN: That was so much, I didn't actually hear it. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You don't believe in yourself? 
UTKARSH: Anxiety's just breath before fear. 
EMILY: No. (laughter) 
EMILY: No. 
MARISHA: No, that also feels accurate, though! 
EMILY: No one crochet that! That's not correct! 
MARISHA: I feel like both apply. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Either way, I'm game. 
EMILY: Yeah, I'm just saying. 
MARISHA: I think, in a way, so Prism, stop me if I'm wrong, you learned your magic? 
EMILY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Over time. 
EMILY: Painstakingly. Yes. 
MARISHA: You studied. I was kind of like you. I was just sort of born with it and just had to discover it over time. And you're right, it's often just feelings and intuition and trying to go with your gut instinct. 
EMILY: So cool! 
UTKARSH: I point to a tree and I yell: Silvery Barbs! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: Nothing happened. 
MARISHA: Did anything happen? 
MATT: Do you have Silvery Barbs on your spell sheet? 
UTKARSH: No. 
MATT: Nothing happens. Absolutely nothing happens. It is a pregnant pause, silence, a bird shits off a branch. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Cone of Cold! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Maybe it's been in you this whole time. 
EMILY: Wish spell! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: Could be. 
TALIESIN: That one time, it works, though! 
UTKARSH: Yeah. I have faith. That Silvery Barbs seems really exciting! And I really want to learn that one. 
MARISHA: You know, just... follow your own truth. You know? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Everybody here has their own thing. Yeah. I didn't have my, my stuff kicked in later and I'm still figuring it out. But you got to experiment a bit. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Throw some shit around. 
UTKARSH: Okay. 
EMILY: I guess I just wanted you to know that you're in a safe place to experiment, at least from where I'm standing. Maybe not for Orym. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Do you need to be afraid? Do you need anger? Do you need-- 
AIMEE: Was that a height joke? 
EMILY: Oh no! No! Oh my gosh, Orym! No, it wasn't! It wasn't a height joke. 
LIAM: I just thought he was about to treat me like a guy with an apple on his head. I thought I was about to get shot. 
TALIESIN: He's going to fucking kill you in your sleep. 
MARISHA: Which we could try. 
UTKARSH: Well, I'll just keep them away from Deni$e. 
AIMEE: Yeah. Thank you. 
UTKARSH: More lightning bolts. That was really unfortunate. I apologize. 
AIMEE: Apology accepted. 
UTKARSH: I was very, very scared. Well, should we get going? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
AIMEE: Oh, I thought we were going. 
TALIESIN: We're walking. 
UTKARSH: Oh, we are walking! 
MARISHA: We were doing a walk and talk. 
EMILY: Oh, you've been on my shoulders-- 
AIMEE: An Aaron Sorkin walk and talk. 
EMILY: -- this whole time. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Mr. President! 
MARISHA: Aaron Sorkin walk and talk. 
UTKARSH: Oh, this is a great walk and talk. 
MARISHA: We're "West Wing"-ing it. 
UTKARSH: That was a long shot. 
TALIESIN: Wow! 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs) 
MATT: Guided by your eidolon, and you eventually move beyond the relative safety of the Outerwalk Road and deeper into the northern Serratus Wilderness, this beautiful expanse of dense forest is occasionally broken by rolling hills and tall grass fields that sway in waves with the colder wind. Once you step within the canopies of the long stretching forest that fill the majority of this valley, there's a dream-like hue of green amongst these shadowed paths and underbrush. It's vibrant and encompassing, leaving you feeling both welcomed, but also incredibly small within the vast unkept timberland before you. The climbing hike is broken up occasionally with continuous peaks and valleys, and cluttered across the landscape of lush growth, rocky terrain, hidden rivers. The occasional summit breaks out of the forest canopy and you have a view of the surrounding valley itself, the distant mountain rages that encompass it like the outside of a bowl. And there, before you, the point you keep eyes on, the majestic dark monolith that is the Ascendant Bridge Mountain, looming northward. For the first day of travel, I need somebody to roll a d20 for me, please. 
LIAM: Guest rolls. 
MARISHA: Yeah, new people first. 
EMILY: Guest rolls? 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
EMILY: (wails) 
AIMEE: Pre-rolled. 
EMILY: Come on! Fucking nat 20, bitch! Yeah! 
LIAM: No. One, one, one, one! 
EMILY: 17! 
MATT: 17. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
EMILY: Wait, is that bad? Yeah, we don't know what that means. It's probably random. (laughs) 
AIMEE: I know. 
TALIESIN: We live in chaos. 
MATT: The majority of your first day of travel is relatively uneventful. The beauty of the landscape now that most of the clouds seem to have dissipated over the recent days. The vibrant blue sky above you with the whispering tangles of colorful rainbow, technicolor leylines that still remain visible even at the height of the day's sun, in itself is, knowing the context of it, ominous, but still beautiful in its own right. You can hear the life that fills this valley the birds, the critters, the daytime entities that call this place home. Even in the most shadowed places, there is a mystical beauty about the space as you traverse it. 
EMILY: Is this what hiking is always like? 
AIMEE: I don't know, I try not to do it. 
TALIESIN: I definitely try not to do it, this is-- 
LIAM: You've never been hiking? 
EMILY: No, I'm an indoor kid for sure. 
LIAM: Oh, yeah. 
EMILY: At least, I was. 
AIMEE: The first time you got to dig a hole? You'll never want to do it again. 
TALIESIN: That's so true. 
EMILY: Wow. 
TALIESIN: I like... yeah, yeah, no. 
AIMEE: We're right here. 
UTKARSH: I don't think she-- Did you? 
EMILY: Have I--? Yeah, I've shit a couple times. So I have dug a hole. 
AIMEE: In a hole? 
EMILY: Yeah. Isn't that what you meant dig a hole for? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
EMILY: Okay. Yeah, no, yeah, I've shit, don't worry. 
UTKARSH: It's beautiful. 
LIAM: Do you still? 
MARISHA: Yes, like once a month. 
AIMEE: Oh bummer, that's got to be the worst. 
TALIESIN: Like a sloth. 
MARISHA: It varies. It's still functional, moving, but just very slow. 
AIMEE: Sluggish. 
EMILY: So it's not like more? It's not like one huge one? 
TALIESIN: I'm imagining you've been climbing down a tree like a sloth. 
MARISHA: Yeah, a little bit. 
TALIESIN: Then back up another-- 
LIAM: Is it like what an owl spits out? 
AIMEE: Ugh! God! 
LIAM: A dried little husk with, like, the skeleton of a vole in it. 
AIMEE: (retching) 
EMILY: All the undigested-- 
AIMEE: Is that how owls poop? 
TALIESIN: I love all of this. 
LIAM: Yeah, they eat, and then they vomit out and all the, it's the skeletons of the rodents. 
MATT: It's more like a, it's like a-- 
LIAM: It's like a cat's hairball almost. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Like a killer whale's ambergris. 
LIAM: Yeah. (laughter) 
AIMEE: I don't even know what that is, and I'm not going to Google "ambergris." (laughter) 
MATT: Well, as the day eventually comes to a close and the forest night and the sounds of evening begin to take over, the cold chill of the air and the gentle fog and mist that seems to crawl in to encompass the forest floor begins to surround you. It's here in this space that you get the sense that most of your day's journey is done and that camp should be made. Who is going to look for a suitable place to make camp? 
MARISHA: I will. 
EMILY: Let me see. 
UTKARSH: What's his name? Pâté should. 
AIMEE: I can start looking for wood and-- 
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, I'll have Pâté help me do a scout. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Oh, I'll wait. 
EMILY: I'll send Mother. Mother, go spend some time with Pâté. 
MARISHA: Get the flying creatures on it. 
MATT: (Pâté) "Oh, all right, I'll go and do it. Come with me, Missy, I'll treat you right." The bird goes, "(unimpressed croak)." (Pâté) "Yeah, that's about what I expected." 
MARISHA: I think she's warming up to you. 
MATT: "Is she really?" 
MARISHA: I feel like it. I feel like it's the first time she's acknowledged your existence. 
MATT: "That's true." 
MARISHA: So, progress. 
MATT: "That's points!" 
MARISHA: Yep. (laughter) 
MATT: (wings whooshing) 
AIMEE: I need the spinoff with Dynios and Mother and Pâté. 
EMILY: I will summon Dynios, too, and say: Dynios, can you follow the familiars? 
AIMEE: It's Three's Company. 
MATT: "Are you absolutely serious right now?" 
EMILY: Dynios, you can travel farther than they can. Okay, I can see through your eyes from 300 feet and I can only do it from like 150 feet. 
MATT: "I mean, you're not wrong. They look incapable of really helping whatsoever." 
EMILY: Also, Dynios, you just seem like a man of such class and style. I feel like you would absolutely have to beat on the best place. 
MATT: "You don't have to brown nose me. I know how good I am at things." 
EMILY: Okay. 
MATT: "Very well." The book glides off, and says, "Wait up, don't go too far." 
TALIESIN: Emily, stop making one-shots. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Just don't. 
AIMEE: I can't wait. 
MATT: It's just me at the table at this point. I hate this idea. 
AIMEE: Full Tyler Perry-ing yourself, just playing all the characters. 
MATT: All right, so I will say, amongst them, it is a survival check to look for the best place to set up camp. So whichever one of those three companions, you want to have them roll a wisdom check. 
EMILY: I don't know that Dynios-- 
MARISHA: A wisdom check. 
EMILY: A wisdom check, let's see, survival. 
TALIESIN: The book has a-- 
EMILY: I got a plus zero, but I think I would be using, I don't think he has his own stats. 
UTKARSH: There you go. 
MARISHA: 18. 
AIMEE: All right. 
MARISHA: For Pâté. 
TALIESIN: Well. 
MATT: (Pâté) "I'm just trying to impress the lady." 
UTKARSH: Go, Patty. 
MATT: "(chuckles)" 
MARISHA: Go, Patty. 
MATT: "Hey, flappy bird, look over here. Looks like it's suitable for suiting up and having a night's rest, what you say?" (Mother) "(unimpressed caw)" (Pâté) "Yeah, that's right. How about you, bookie?" (Dynios) "I regret everything that I have agreed to in the past half hour." 
EMILY: I'm in heaven, this is so-- 
AIMEE: One-man Hamlet. 
MARISHA: One-man show. Yeah, one-man Hamlet! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: We should ask Hevestro how they're doing, too. 
EMILY: Huh? Who's Hevestro? 
UTKARSH: Do we still have the cougar with us? 
EMILY: Oh. 
MATT: The cougar, you have. Hevestro is the individual you're going after. 
LIAM: The person we're trying to find. 
UTKARSH: Oh, the cougar. 
MATT: Yes. 
EMILY: Oh, did we ask their name? 
UTKARSH: Yeah, I want to get another person and I want to get another-- 
EMILY: Yeah, talk to the cougar. 
UTKARSH: Excuse me. 
TALIESIN: Now you have-- 
UTKARSH: Cougar. Cougar, wild cougar. 
MATT: "(growling)" 
UTKARSH: Do you, using your heightened cougar senses, can you smell or taste anything in the air that might be of danger to us or hear anything? 
AIMEE: Oh, cutie. 
MATT: "(snarling)" 
EMILY: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: What did Pâté think about what the cougar just said? 
MARISHA: Pâté, do you have any insight? 
MATT: "What's going on? I found a space, come this way." 
MARISHA: Oh, he's-- 
MATT: "I got you all hooked up, don't worry." 
MARISHA: He was distracted. 
UTKARSH: Is there any running water around us? 
MATT: Immediately, no. You've encountered one river a while back, but it was not parallel to the path you were taking but you gathered based on the size of this valley and the recurring weather that you've encountered in the short time you've been here, that rivers are probably not uncommon. 
UTKARSH: I was wondering about food, fishing, berries. 
MATT: Nothing fishing nearby, but-- 
UTKARSH: The jerky's low. 
MATT: You can look for berries, if you'd like to. 
UTKARSH: I'm going to go looking. I'm going to go find us some grub. 
MATT: All right, make a survival check for me. 
EMILY: I would love to go hunting. 
UTKARSH: Wait, is this a nine or a six? 
TALIESIN: I've totally got uncooked pasta sitting in the-- 
MARISHA: That's a nine. 
UTKARSH: Nine. 
TALIESIN: If we want. 
AIMEE: Uncooked pasta. 
TALIESIN: Ready, just ready to be boiled. 
UTKARSH: Nine. 
MATT: Nine. You're really excited because you found some really, really delicious looking black-- 
UTKARSH: What's nine plus six? 15? 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
UTKARSH: 15. 
MATT: You're extremely excited. You found some very delicious blueberries. 
AIMEE: Uh-oh. 
MATT: You avoided the black ones because you looked at them and went, "Those are probably toxic." 
UTKARSH: Ha-ha! You thought you had me! (laughter) 
LIAM: Woods. 
AIMEE: That plus six. (laughter) 
MATT: But you do return with the cluster of, what you believe to be, healthy to digest berries. 
AIMEE: Oh boy, I feel like Deni$e has a rabbit she's killed with her bare hands. 
EMILY: Oh my gosh, it's still whimpering. 
AIMEE: That's okay. (thumping) (laughter) 
UTKARSH: I could've just said I caught a rabbit? I didn't have to roll anything? 
AIMEE: No, I probably do have to roll for it. 
AIMEE: Well, roll to see the quality of the rabbit. 
AIMEE: Hey, you know what? My animal handling is superior. 
EMILY: Oh, that's so dark. I'm really good with animals-- 
MATT: That's extremely dark. 
EMILY: -- so I can kill them. 
AIMEE: I got a plus five. 
TALIESIN: I've never been happier. 
AIMEE: Animal handling check. 
MATT: You're going animal handling, okay. 
AIMEE: I'm going to need it. What's that? Is that... 12. 
MATT: 12, okay. 12. 
AIMEE: See now a rabbit. 
MATT: No, no, so see, yeah, you do manage to-- 
MARISHA: It was foaming at the mouth, which was why it was so easy to catch. 
MATT: Here's the thing. 
UTKARSH: It came up to you. 
MATT: Survival is hunting. 
AIMEE: Oh fuck! 
MATT: Animal handling means-- (laughter) 
MATT: You coax it to you in a friendly manner. It does not see you as a threat. 
UTKARSH: Awful. 
MATT: As it leaps onto your lap, (cracking) 
AIMEE: Good bunny. 
EMILY: Wow. 
MARISHA: The most fucked up-- 
AIMEE: I won't be ignored, Dan. (laughter) 
MATT: With that, a fine dinner of berries and bunny is presented here. 
LIAM: I'd like to pet your rabbits, Orym. 
AIMEE: All right. 
UTKARSH: We could cook the rabbit with blueberry compote. 
MARISHA: Oh, that sounds delightful, actually. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, start a little fire. 
MATT: Yeah, go ahead. 
AIMEE: Blueberry compote. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, a little blueberry compote. 
LIAM: I know that everyone has been playing video games this past weekend because all you want to do is craft-- 
EMILY: Yes. 
LIAM: Hunt. 
EMILY: Yes. Yes. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
LIAM: Look for berries. 
EMILY: I want to put a rocket on a korok. (laughter) 
EMILY: Please, let me shoot him into the running waters. (laughter) 
MATT: You're only day one on the journey, we'll get there. But as you all gathered, having your meal, out here in the really the beginning leg of what you hope is the final leg of this journey, in this strange, unfamiliar space, you begin to chew on your meal. Any conversations you wish to have, or we can cut to an evening's watch? 
TALIESIN: So. Orym, I was wondering, do you know how to, I don't know, meditate or I don't know-- 
LIAM: Yeah, is that something you want to do? 
TALIESIN: Well, there was, there was... There was just an offhand comment a couple days ago that I should, I don't know, talk to rocks. I don't know, it didn't really... 
LIAM: Talk to rocks? 
TALIESIN: Or just... 
LIAM: I mean, generally meditation is, yeah, it's about doing none of those things. You just sit in your thoughts. You want to breathe before you get to the fear and anxiety. So you just... Here, just close your eyes. 
TALIESIN: (grumbles) Nothing good happens from that. All right. 
LIAM: Yeah, close your eyes. I'm standing next to. Have a seat. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LIAM: I'll stand. Okay. You just want to exhale. 
TALIESIN: (aggressive exhale) 
LIAM: Right? Okay, you're present, cool. Then just, but that's fine. You just want to keep doing that for, let's, we're going to go for one minute. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LIAM: Just to start it off, okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay! Okay. 
LIAM: Roll a wisdom save. 
TALIESIN: 11. 
LIAM: 11. You start thinking of waffles. 
AIMEE: Yum. 
TALIESIN: I'm hungry. Can I open my eyes? I'm really hungry. 
LIAM: I don't know where this is going, Ashton, but. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: You generally just need to take a beat, sit down and stop worrying about every single thing, which is kind of hard in today's environment. 
TALIESIN: Well, I'm not a big worrier and most of that is because I don't stop. I'm a very big believer in you just keep, if you keep moving then, you know, momentum means that, you know, you don't really have to focus on anything unpleasant for too long. 
UTKARSH: Amen. 
TALIESIN: When you do, that's what, you know, there's booze and people. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no. 
LIAM: You okay? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm down. Damn. Also, you can always just, you know... 
LIAM: Are you okay? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm okay. I just, I'm starting to think about my situation in ways that I'm not... 
UTKARSH: Can we all hear this? 
TALIESIN: I'm not being quiet about it. 
LIAM: Maybe 15 feet off from the fire. 
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm... yeah. I've decided maybe it's time to start thinking about my situation. 
LIAM: That could apply to so many things right now. 
TALIESIN: How I got here, what it means, what happened to me. I mean, the Ashari shit, the fucking helmet, this fucking thing. I don't know, yesterday kind of threw me. 
LIAM: Yeah. How about a couple of days ago? 
TALIESIN: That also threw me. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yesterday especially. I mean, they both did, but... Yeah, I'm trying to recenter. 
LIAM: Well, probably help to get back to our other half. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, well. 
LIAM: Then maybe you'll find some answers while we try to fix this. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Maybe. 
TALIESIN: I'm starting to wonder what fixing looks like. I'm starting to really wonder what fixing means. 
LIAM: Sorry, Ash. I really wish I had something helpful. 
TALIESIN: Are you starting to wonder what fixing looks like? 
LIAM: I'm starting to doubt it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm doubting it. 
TALIESIN: Me too. 
UTKARSH: I'm spreading out the blueberries into a thin sheet to make fruit leather. 
AIMEE: Delish. 
EMILY: Jerky and fruit leather. 
LIAM: Fruit leather. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. Just-- Yeah. We can-- I don't know. I feel a little lost and confused, and I don't think I'm the only one. I'm just-- 
LIAM: (laughs) I think the best that we can do for each other right now is if you see me falling down, pick me up. And I'll do the same. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. That's not that far, so that helps. It's just a-- 
MARISHA: Now that's a short joke! 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yes, it is. 
EMILY: I would never. 
LIAM: Very used to it. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
LIAM: Very used to it. 
TALIESIN: It was too easy. Yeah. Yeah, that's-- Thanks, man. I'm going to work on that quiet, sitting down thing and not brooding. All right. 
LIAM: While we quiet down over here, Orym's going to try, because I know that Ashton deals with pain, he will slowly start to do that massage move, where you like pinch. But I'll do it real slow because I don't want to like-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, I can actually say that actually rapid heavy movements, way easier than slow. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's very odd, but it is. 
LIAM: Well, Orym takes that direction-- 
TALIESIN: Just go for it. 
LIAM: -- and tries to take your mind off of things. 
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck! Jesus! Fuck! Oh, wow! (groans) Nope, that's good. That's good. 
LIAM: That's the good pain. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
LIAM: How are those berries coming? 
TALIESIN: (gritted) Woo! 
UTKARSH: By morning, we'll have enough fruit leather to last us a day or two. (laughter) 
LIAM: You're making Fruit Roll-Ups? 
UTKARSH and AIMEE: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
EMILY: Can you do little shapes in them, too, that we can peel them out? 
UTKARSH: Natural sweetening. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
UTKARSH: I guess I could. So I take out my dagger, I start cutting stars and circles. 
AIMEE: That's cute! 
MATT: Make a dexterity or performance check for me. (laughs) 
LIAM: Or use lightning. 
AIMEE: (laughing) Yeah. 
UTKARSH: (laughs) That is an 11. 
MATT: An 11. Okay. What do you carve into it? 
UTKARSH: A star, like a just a regular. 
MATT: Yeah, it's not bad. Some cute little shapes. 
UTKARSH: Yeah. A little circle. 
EMILY: Are we staying in a little tent or something? Because I could put a little glyph, you know? I won't do the exploding stuff. 
TALIESIN: No, I was amused, but-- 
EMILY: Just maybe a little glyph for protection. I could just throw a Hold Person glyph there, so that if someone approached camp, perhaps there would be a chance to catch them in the act. 
AIMEE: That's very nice. 
LIAM: Do we have a tent? 
TALIESIN: We usually just sleep rough. 
MARISHA: I don't think we do. Yeah. Just bed rolls. 
EMILY: Sleep rough? Bed rolls. Okay. Then I'm just-- 
UTKARSH: Bed rolls are in the hole. 
EMILY: Okay, then never mind. I won't do that. Can I try something, though? 
MATT: Of course. What would you like to try? 
EMILY: I've been looking at these Draconic divine anti-magic old magic runes. Bor'Dor, can I borrow your crossbow? 
UTKARSH: Sure. 
EMILY: I want to try and carve one of these runes into it and see if it does anything. Would you be morally opposed to that curiosity? 
UTKARSH: No. I guess, no. That sounds actually very interesting. 
EMILY: Okay. 
UTKARSH: That sounds cool as shit. Let's see what it does. 
EMILY: Yeah. So I want to carve these runes in. 
MATT: Okay. 
EMILY: Into the crossbow. 
MATT: Okay. Roll an arcana check for me, if you don't mind. 
EMILY: Okay. 
UTKARSH: But then, maybe somebody else shoot it for the first time. 
AIMEE, EMILY, and MARISHA: (laugh) 
EMILY: I don't think it'll do anything, but you got to try sometimes. 19. 
AIMEE: Ooh! 
MATT: 19. Very good. 
TALIESIN: (impressed whistle) 
MATT: You carve them pretty accurately. You're proud of yourself and what displays there. Your understanding of enchantment magic through your studies, the process of enchanting an item is a protracted period of time, depending on the scale and power of the enchantment. 
EMILY: Okay. 
MATT: But the Apogee Solstice is a unique circumstance and you're uncertain if that would have any impact whatsoever. 
EMILY: Okay. It may be decorative, it may be destructive. 
UTKARSH: I'm going to hand it to Deni$e. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Can you please-- 
AIMEE: You want me to fire one off? 
EMILY: Do you want to flirt with another rabbit and then point blank it? 
AIMEE: No, I only do that when necessary. Should I point to a tree and then just-- Do you want me to? 
UTKARSH: I don't want to, so yeah. 
TALIESIN: I want you to. 
AIMEE: Yeah? 
UTKARSH: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
AIMEE: All right. She aims at a tree. 
LIAM: I jump in our hole. 
MATT: Now, in this moment-- 
UTKARSH: I hop in there with you. 
MATT: In carving the rune, what is your intent with the rune specifically? 
EMILY: Honestly, it was just naked curiosity. I just wanted to see if the runes had magic in themselves, and it just seemed like a foreign magic. So-- 
MATT: Understood. 
EMILY: Honestly, it's just naked curiosity. 
MATT: No worries. With your arcana check, you would know that runes by themselves set the groundwork to hold magical intent and power. So when the runes are carved in there, they're awaiting the power to be instilled within them. It's like filling a cup. 
EMILY: Can I try to fill a cup with a spell? 
MATT: That's what I'm saying. What sort of magic are you intent on possibly trying to put within this? 
EMILY: Well, it is Draconic magic and I have a spell that's Draconic in nature, so I want to try and put a 4th-level Dragon's Breath in it. 
MATT: Okay. 
UTKARSH: That would be great! 
MATT: All right. 
AIMEE: So maybe I should go over there and do it. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
AIMEE: Or do it from afar. 
EMILY: I think, yeah, just at the tree and aim it away from us. Just get a nice-- 
AIMEE: What does Dragon's Breath do? 
EMILY: -- 15-foot cone, I think. 
MATT: Only one way to find out. 
AIMEE: Oh shit. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
EMILY: I say, pull the trigger. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
UTKARSH: I tell the cougar: (whispers) Get in the hole. 
EMILY and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: "(snarls)" Jumps inside. 
AIMEE: All right. So very dexterously, I think she finds a tree to stand next to and then points at a tree that's 15 feet away, maybe 20 feet away. 
EMILY: 15-foot cone. 
AIMEE: Okay, so maybe within that. 
UTKARSH: 30. 
AIMEE: Then counts to three, shoots it, and then does a roll to the back of the tree. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
MATT: Okay. You fire the crossbow. As you fire it, the runes that you had carved into it glow ever so faintly in the bolt as it releases. If you would look at this in a rapid slow motion, you would watch the bolt release, and as it crosses the threshold of the front, it instead shatters like a powder of iron filings that then ignite into a massive burst of fire. 
EMILY: Oh! 
MATT: Indeed, a flame bursts from it in a 15-foot cone that torches out for a minute-- 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: -- lighting Deni$e and singeing her eyebrows a little bit. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Oh no! They're painted on. (laughter) 
EMILY: The paint starts melting. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Rudy Giuliani style. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Oh! 
MARISHA: Oh my god, what a pull. 
LIAM: We didn't even spill any blood from someone who died. 
AIMEE: Not yet. Oh. Right. 
LIAM: Something like that. (laughter) 
MATT: If you wouldn't mind, roll a d20 for me. 
EMILY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
EMILY: All right, honey, show up for mommy. That's a three. 
LIAM: Oh. 
UTKARSH: Nice! 
AIMEE: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
MATT: A three. Okay. You pull back at it, and that's incredible. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MATT: You look back excitedly. The rest of you also notice the front of it is on fire. The flame is starting to consume the crossbow. 
UTKARSH: No! 
AIMEE: Shit! I throw it and then I pour some dirt on it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
EMILY: Quick, quick, pat it out! 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I just do a little Prestidigitation to dampen the flames. 
MATT: Okay. So it's a little bit charred. You don't think it's not functional. 
EMILY: Okay. 
MATT: But what you gather from this exercise is by the nature of the heightened magic of the solstice and the nature of the runes that you had carved into it, it can temporarily capture some kinds of magic to be expelled once within a short time after it's been put in there. You're not sure quite how long. It has a gradual expiration time, if you will-- 
UTKARSH: Wow. That's pretty cool. 
MATT: -- if it's not used. 
EMILY: Dangerous. 
AIMEE: Right. 
LIAM: Does the crossbow look filthy and functional, or is it obliterated? 
MATT: It's not obliterated, but it looks like also with each use you have to see whether or not it can withstand the force of what it's doing. And with progressive low rolls, it may destroy itself. 
EMILY: Bor'Dor, I have to really deeply apologize because of what I did to your crossbow. 
UTKARSH: It's okay. I gently hold the crossbow. It's okay. That was objectively incredible. 
EMILY: Okay. 
UTKARSH: And I think it's still going to work. 
EMILY: Okay. 
UTKARSH: It can still shoot arrows if I need to? 
MATT: Or bolts. Yeah, yeah. It seems like it should be. 
MARISHA: Can I do a little Mending action on it to see if I can bring it back? 
EMILY: Oh, thank god someone has that. 
MATT: Yes, you can. 
MARISHA: To bring it back to its original form. So I just kind of beep. 
MATT: It looks beautiful. Interestingly, the areas around the runes still carry a bit of the charring and you get the sense that the nature of the runes that are there, the damage is progressive. You can't mend away the magical damage that it's taken. 
UTKARSH: Wow. 
MATT: But it can still receive spells of a certain kind. 
EMILY: Okay. Bor'Dor, so you just-- 
AIMEE: Good to know. 
EMILY: You let me know if you want me to fuck around with your crossbow, because I'll try. 
MATT: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Okay. 
EMILY: Okay. 
AIMEE: You have problems. 
EMILY: You know, curiosity is a blessing and a curse. 
UTKARSH: That's true. 
LIAM: You've clearly studied. You can do a lot of things. 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
LIAM: You've clearly studied a lot. Do they encourage this sort of-- 
EMILY: No, not at all. When you guys saw me-- 
LIAM: -- improvisation? 
EMILY: -- I had never cast a spell before because every time I go to cast a spell, a consortium of mages just says, "No, your form is all wrong. Counterspell." So truly I thought I was terrible up until my very first fight. 
LIAM: So you've studied for years and never cast a spell, and Bor'Dor-- 
EMILY: Never successfully completed. 
LIAM: You've only spent time with sheep and never cast a spell. So in a way, you're starting at the same like you're colleagues. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: You know a lot more than I do. 
EMILY: Yes. Well, I mean, I did really actively study it for 10 years, so I have a leg up. 
UTKARSH: Book smarts and sheep smarts. 
EMILY: Sheep smarts. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
EMILY: Hmm. 
UTKARSH: I'm proud of us. 
EMILY: That's good. 
LIAM: Shmarts. 
EMILY: Shmarts. 
MARISHA: Speaking of, do you want to do just a quick, before we all turn in tonight, just a little 10, 15 minute intuition lesson? 
UTKARSH: Sure. 
EMILY: I think we should. Ooh! Okay. Let's make a dummy and I can Magic Mouth, like, "Please don't hurt me, Bor'Dor." 
AIMEE: "I don't like it." 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I don't like it. Yes, that's good. 
EMILY: We'll make a little straw man for you to just go to town on. 
MARISHA: That's good. Didn't I grab some bones? 
UTKARSH: I don't know. Shooting lightning. 
EMILY: You have a tooth, don't you? 
MARISHA: I have a tooth. I have a weirdo tooth. 
UTKARSH: Is shooting lightning bolts or fire in the middle of the woods-- 
AIMEE: Just one tooth! 
UTKARSH: -- that we don't know anything about a good idea? 
AIMEE: No, no, it's terrible. It's terrible. We did it. 
TALIESIN: There's also, I think clearly you can probably do more than shoot lightning. You've demonstrated that you know that. 
EMILY: Yeah. I think you've got seriously untapped potential. 
MARISHA: I agree. 
UTKARSH: I don't know, actually. 
EMILY: I'm so curious to see it. 
UTKARSH: I think I might've hit my peaks. 
LIAM: Orym's keeping an eye and an ear for any problems while we shoot fire into the sky and-- 
UTKARSH: Let's do it. 
MATT: Perception check for me. 
MARISHA: With Prism's help, if you wouldn't mind maybe holding a few things. I have an old spine. 
EMILY and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: So I take the spine to use as its-- 
AIMEE: I got a wig. 
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Great. Then-- 
AIMEE: Styles it nice. 
TALIESIN: There's some armor we have not cleaned. 
MARISHA: So that's what I was going to say. We can bring out just like one of the cloaks-- 
UTKARSH: What is happening? 
MARISHA: -- from the-- 
MATT: Magic, my friend. 
MARISHA: -- like crimson, whatever. 
MATT: The Ruby Vanguard. 
MARISHA: The Ruby Vanguard. 
EMILY: I'll do a Bigby's Hand to hold it and make it move around. 
MARISHA: Like dance a little? That's great. 
EMILY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Then I'll just find some sticks to stick it on and then-- 
TALIESIN: I've seen some terrible shit in my life. 
MATT: It's a nightmarish snowman is what this is. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Then we'll use one of the helmets. 
UTKARSH: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Boy, won't we. 
MARISHA: Then I'll take the tooth from the old man. 
EMILY: Yes! 
MARISHA: And fuse it to the front. 
AIMEE: Disgusting! 
UTKARSH: You guys are amazing to me. You're the best teachers. 
MATT: Really crafty. 
MARISHA: Then just attach it, Mend it, use some of my red string to very hastily and it's a bit shoddy, but it works. 
MATT: It works. All right. 
AIMEE: I'm picturing "Nightmare Before Christmas." 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes! 
UTKARSH: Can I just use some of your blue goo to draw a face on it? 
MARISHA: Oh! 
UTKARSH: Some eyebrows? 
MARISHA: Sure. I just do like a little necromantic drips. 
UTKARSH: Some of your open sore. 
AIMEE: Oozes. 
MARISHA: There you go. 
MATT: There you go. 
LIAM: Orym watches next to Ash and just says: There's no single way to cope with grief. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Hold on, let me spritz the wig. 
TALIESIN: I'm definitely going to-- 
EMILY: Yeah, I'm going to Prestidigitation some makeup on. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
EMILY: Okay. 
MATT: Beautiful. 
AIMEE: That's not bad. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So spine, stick arms, helmet with the dangly tooth. 
EMILY: Yes. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: That claymation puppeteer who did the Alice in Wonderland. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: All right. With the stage set, and the training galley prepped. 
TALIESIN: Right. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
MATT: Bor'Dor. 
UTKARSH: Okay. How do I do a Fire Bolt? 
EMILY: A Fire Bolt? Do you have it? 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
EMILY: Do you? Okay. Well, I mean, I actually don't know how to do it. I have Sacred Flame, so really-- Well, for wizards, it's about words, right? So I have to say a very specific incantation in a very specific tone, following a very specific tome. 
LIAM: (snaps) 
EMILY: But for you, I bet you just picture one and it happens. 
MARISHA: Yes, for-- 
UTKARSH: So I look at this beautiful contraption we've made, and I start getting hot, I can feel my blood starting to boil a little bit-- 
LIAM: We've seen your character art. We know. 
UTKARSH: Huh? Say what? 
LIAM: We've seen your character art, we know. 
UTKARSH: Then I'm getting-- 
TALIESIN: It's not like he's getting hot. 
UTKARSH: -- really warm and I'm looking at it and I see it go up in flames in my mind's eye. Then I shoot-- Oh, it's a cantrip. A Fire Bolt at the thingy. 
MATT: It's a cantrip. Correct. So roll an attack. 
EMILY: Come on, Bor'Dor. 
UTKARSH: Poor guy. 
AIMEE: Just watch the hair. 
EMILY: One of those isn't even a d-- 
MARISHA: Do d20 first. 
MATT: Roll a d20 to see if you hit it first and then-- 
UTKARSH: Aren't these both d10? 
EMILY: Yeah, yeah, but that'll be one once you-- 
UTKARSH: No, no, I'm going to hit. I'm going to hit. 
EMILY: I think you are, too. 
UTKARSH: That's a big four, baby. 
EMILY: No! 
MATT: Plus. 
EMILY: It's my fault! I'm being too aggressive-- 
UTKARSH: 12. 
EMILY: -- with Bigby's Hand. 
MATT: 12, okay. Okay. So the good news is it's barely moving. It's more just being handled there. So you do manage to hit it. Go ahead and roll your damage. 
UTKARSH: Yes! I rolled it already. It's a 10. 
MATT: A 10. Okay. (impacts) Immediately, while the hand clutches it, the construction that you've managed to pull together instantaneously disintegrates and is engulfed in flame in a beautiful display of arcane talent. 
MARISHA: Yes! Yeah! 
TALIESIN: That's some impressive self-actualization. 
LIAM: There you go. 
UTKARSH: I saw it happen. 
TALIESIN: Is it still on fire? 
EMILY: That was incredible! 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to-- 
AIMEE: Well, I'm going to grab my wig first. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and grab the cloak and start bashing it out. 
MATT: Okay. You eventually put it out. 
EMILY: It's got a pixie cut now. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Wow. 
AIMEE: French bob. 
UTKARSH: What a rush. 
EMILY: That was great, Bor'Dor. 
TALIESIN: You got anything else in there that you're feeling? What is it? Quiet. Sit and be quiet. 
LIAM: Yeah, think of something. Anything's possible, think of something wild. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: A bit weird. 
AIMEE: Good night's sleep. 
LIAM: Before we get a good night's sleep. 
AIMEE: Eight hours, good night's sleep. 
TALIESIN: Reel it in a bit. Reel it in a bit. 
UTKARSH: Okay, let's try this. 
LIAM: Six and a half. 
AIMEE: Flushing toilet. 
UTKARSH: I go over to-- Wait, who can I-- 
TALIESIN: That's the biggest lie of D&D, is that you can get eight hours sleep. 
AIMEE: Right. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
EMILY: I greatly disagree. 
UTKARSH: Okay, I'll go over to-- 
EMILY: My priorities are right. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, should we just go to sleep-- 
MATT: They are. 
AIMEE: She is hydrated, well-rested, in her lane. 
LIAM: This is a good time to experiment. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: If you want to. 
UTKARSH: Okay, then I'll go over to-- Thank you, by the way, this is like, let the new guy figure out what the fuck is going on. 
MATT: No, it's all good. 
EMILY: It's also just fun for me. 
MARISHA: This is the best. 
TALIESIN: Let's have a montage. 
UTKARSH: Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: I couldn't help but overhear you speaking at regular volume about-- 
TALIESIN: I'm very loud. 
UTKARSH: -- wanting to meditate. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
UTKARSH: I have a feeling I might be able to help you in some way. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
UTKARSH: So, is it okay if I touch you? 
TALIESIN: I mean... Sure, let's go for this. 
UTKARSH: I don't know if this is going to work. I have no idea, but I just have a feeling. I go up to Ashton and I hold right here, thumb behind his ear, just a gentle touch. 
TALIESIN: Actually, I can't feel anything over there, so that's good. 
UTKARSH: I cast a sec-- This might not work. I don't even know what this thing does. 2nd-level Calm Emotions. 
EMILY: Ooh! 
MATT: Okay. Okay. Do you resist the magical influence? 
UTKARSH: You can trust me. I don't know what I'm doing. 
TALIESIN: Nah, fuck it. Nah. 
MATT: Okay. Then indeed, while you were already pretty calm after the conversation you had, there's an ever-present just an anxiety or attention that buzzes in the back of your mind at all times. That faint bit of life trauma that never quite leaves as a specter in the back of your head. In this moment, for the first time in a while, it's gone, and you feel this gentle wave of just relief come over you. 
EMILY: Wow. 
TALIESIN: I don't feel anything. It's just sort of-- (snorts) I'll be over here. 
AIMEE: Oh, he's having a good time. 
UTKARSH: What happened? 
AIMEE: It worked. 
UTKARSH: Oh. 
EMILY: Whatever you did was a good thing. 
TALIESIN: No, I'm good. Wow. 
UTKARSH: You okay? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, oh yeah. 
UTKARSH: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm good. 
EMILY: He's blissed out. 
UTKARSH: Can I do it to myself? 
MATT: (laughs) If you want to. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Mage whippets over here. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go over here and think about rocks. 
UTKARSH: Mage whippets, yeah! I'll take a mage whippet. I do it to myself, too. 
MATT: (laughing) Oh my god. 
EMILY: Can you do it to me, too? (laughter) 
AIMEE: Just burning through all his slots. 
EMILY: I think it does it for a bunch of people. No, I'm pretty sure it does for more than-- 
UTKARSH: Oh, wait a minute, you're right. I only get three. 
EMILY: No, but I think you can-- 
MARISHA: You can cast at a higher level. 
MATT: Is it concentration? 
EMILY: I think Calm Emotions is for-- 
TALIESIN: I don't think it's concentration. 
EMILY: It's a group of people. You could do it to all of us. 
MATT: That's true, yeah. 
AIMEE: Then we can get a good night's sleep. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: So then I do it to all of us. 
MARISHA: Ooh, I love this. 
UTKARSH: So that's two. Because I used one on him, and then I'll use a second one on everyone. 
TALIESIN: Everyone gets a Xanax. Okay. 
MARISHA: Ooh, yes! 
AIMEE: That's nice. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go find, not too far away, I'm going to go find a rock and, yeah, do the thing. 
MARISHA: You're going to go talk to a rock? 
MATT: All right. You go meditate. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to go talk to a rock. 
MARISHA: All right. 
UTKARSH: I hope that works out for you, bro. (laughter) 
UTKARSH: Can I go to the cougar and ask if I can be her small spoon? 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: Certainly. As you approach, the cougar is curled up over in the middle of the woods. You approach as-- 
TALIESIN: It's going to be cold all night. Is it a warm sleeper? 
UTKARSH: Room for me? 
MATT: Roll for animal handling. 
AIMEE: Don't you wish you were me? (laughter) 
UTKARSH: Oh shit, I lost my character. Hold on, where are you? I think that is going to be a 17. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's getting a little bit, I can see it's-- 
MATT: The eidolon looks at you for a moment, takes a step closer, and puts his nose out to smell your hand a little bit. (sniffs) 
UTKARSH: It's blueberry. 
MATT: Curls up and plops on its side. 
MARISHA: Aw. 
UTKARSH: Yes. I go in. I lift one of its heavy paws and put it over my neck. 
MATT: Pretty light, being an air elemental, strangely. But it still plops over you. 
MARISHA: That's cute. 
MATT: It feels like-- 
UTKARSH: Is there warmth? 
MATT: No, there's no warmth, but there is an odd, continuous buffeting of gentle wind, like a very, very low level Theragun. 
AIMEE: Oh yeah, that's good stuff. 
MATT: Or, you know, a massager. 
UTKARSH: Okay, cool. 
MATT: (soft purrs) 
LIAM: Sounds vaguely like Jennifer Coolidge. (laughter) 
UTKARSH: (laughs) Yeah. 
MARISHA: Jennifer Coug-idge. 
AIMEE: I'm taking the dog, dumbass! I think Deni$e grabs another bunny. 
TALIESIN: Jenni-Purr Coolidge. 
AIMEE: But she doesn't kill it. 
LIAM: Jenni-Purr Coug-idge. 
AIMEE: She uses it as a-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's not bad. 
EMILY: An airplane neck pillow? 
AIMEE: Like a lovey. Yeah! (laughs) 
MATT: I like the idea of Deni$e sleeping soundly, and this poor bunny that's like-- 
UTKARSH: You killed my brother! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: You killed my mama! Mama! (laughter) 
LIAM: He's right over there! 
UTKARSH: I can see his bones. 
EMILY: I can smell him on your breath. 
AIMEE: I left his skin! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: The undead one puked him out in an owl pellet. 
TALIESIN: Sleep well, Thumper. 
MATT: Fantastic. 
MARISHA: It's a good point, though. I'll pocket the rabbit skin. 
MATT: Okay, there you go. Put it on your list. 
EMILY: We might need it for more target practice. 
LIAM: How long does Calm Emotions last again? 
MATT: It lasts for a minute. 
LIAM: A minute, okay. 
MATT: It's short term, but it sets you into a better mood. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. It's nice. 
AIMEE: It's like having a melatonin right before bed. 
LIAM: A reset. 
UTKARSH: Oh. It's only a minute, okay. 
EMILY: That's nice. 
AIMEE: But that's good to know. 
MARISHA: It's good. Just enough to get us to-- 
MATT: Any other business for the evening? 
MARISHA: -- go to sleep. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take first watch, and some of that's going to be sitting on a rock. 
AIMEE: Enjoying it. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Listening to, you know, letting everything in. 
MATT: Okay. Roll a wisdom check for me. 
TALIESIN: All right. I can do it. 
UTKARSH: I knew it. 
TALIESIN: Too many dice today. Too many dice, you ever do that? 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
UTKARSH: Bless you. 
AIMEE: Bless you. 
EMILY: Gesundheit. 
TALIESIN: 14. 
MATT: 14? 
TALIESIN: Straight wisdom. 
MATT: As the quiet sounds of the surrounding wilderness encroach upon your now further stilled mind, you feel your very tense essence, for the first time in a while, discorporate a little bit, relax and almost seem to reach out and mingle a bit with the energies of the nighttime forest that surrounds you. You begin to connect with the stones beneath you. You begin to feel the weight and eternal strength of the Exandrian stone that sits beneath the growth and ferns. You can sense the life that suffuses these spaces, both on a small scale, the plants that call it home, that set roots within the stone and rock that you yourself could possibly even muster within your body. You also, even in your still sense, can feel the vibration of the eidolon as it sleeps cuddled up around Bor'Dor with a slight purr. 
AIMEE: (purrs softly) 
MATT: From that, too, you can feel the dozens and dozens of other subtle spirits that wander, curious, beyond the campsite that you've chosen. You're uncertain how much time passes. But you feel focused. With that, we'll say the watches through the evening continue unproblematic. No issues that occur, almost like the spirits that you reached out to were present to keep watch for you on your journey. 
UTKARSH: Beautiful. Yeah. 
MATT: The next day rolls around as you all come back to the world of the conscious folk, gather your things, a morning's meal, and trek out for a second day's journey. 
AIMEE: Eyebrows back on. 
UTKARSH: Long rest? 
MATT: Long rest for all of you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
EMILY: Yeah, I think I slept rather than tranced after that Calm Emotions. 
AIMEE: That was good stuff. 
UTKARSH: Calm Emotions back. 
AIMEE: Good stuff, Bor'Dor. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was great. That was really great. 
AIMEE: Hey, you got a connect? 
MATT: With that, who would like to roll for the second day of travel? 
TALIESIN: It's you. 
AIMEE: I guess I will. 
TALIESIN: Yes, you are. 
AIMEE: I'll use one of these. 
UTKARSH: Go, Deni$e! 
MARISHA: Your nails are so fabulous. 
AIMEE: Natural 20, baby! 
MARISHA: Hey! 
AIMEE: Thank you! 
MARISHA: What does it mean? 
UTKARSH: Battle, for sure. 
TALIESIN: Pew pew pew! 
MATT: Natural 20 means your second day's journey goes not just without issue traveling through there, but roll a d6 for me. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: Is it something nice? 
EMILY: This is how many magic items we find. 
MARISHA: I don't know! 
LIAM: Something nice? 
AIMEE: Oh, that's a five. 
MATT: Okay, a five. To this point, all right. 
MARISHA: We see a magical unicorn. 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: No? 
MATT: No, you do not. 
TALIESIN: (sweetly) Hi, Bells Hells. 
MATT: But you do, later in the afternoon, come upon a clearing in the forest where the ground itself seems to divot about 15 feet across by eight or so feet deep. It's like there's a crater in the middle of this clearing that is completely overgrown with vine and root and all manner of local flora that has filled in this space. 
MARISHA: That's a crater with... Okay, crater with vines. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
EMILY: Crater with vines. 
UTKARSH: Can we walk around it? 
AIMEE: We should go around it, I think. 
EMILY: Is anyone-- 
TALIESIN: There's 12 little girls in two straight lines. Sorry. 
EMILY: -- kind of curious about the flora that is growing from this crater? 
AIMEE: Not particularly. 
MARISHA: A little bit. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm in a mood. 
EMILY: Can I Mage Hand a couple flowers? 
MATT: Sure. (pop pop) You pull a few little fern leaflets, yank them off and pull them over in your direction. At a quick glance, roll a nature check. 
EMILY: 16. 
MATT: 16. These look very healthy, and in line with most of the other natural life that has taken root within this forest. 
MARISHA: I'm going to do the old faithful. Pull out a hand of ball bearings, chuck it in the hole. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Great idea. 
TALIESIN: She does this. 
MATT: Couple of mice skitter off from living within there, but-- 
MARISHA: It's infested with rats! (laughter) 
AIMEE: Do we get a sense of how, the diameter of this big crater? 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MATT: It's about 15 feet across. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
TALIESIN: That's not bad. 
AIMEE: So we can easily walk around. 
MATT: Oh yeah, you could easily walk around. 
EMILY: Does it look like a crater from something from the sky? Meteoric? 
MATT: Make an investigation check. 
EMILY: This is my shit. 16. 
MATT: 16. It looks like it could be either, if it's a sinkhole, it's very consistent, consistently diameter sinkhole. Or if there's an impact crater, then the center is obscured by the growth that's centered around it. 
EMILY: I just feel like we're close to this place of ascension. 
TALIESIN: Orym, can you, I know you've got some-- 
UTKARSH: Light it on fire. 
LIAM: Orym walks over to the eidolon, and eye to eye says: Does this seem okay to you? 
UTKARSH: I forgot about the eidolon. 
MATT: It just sits at the edge. Doesn't seem to be acting nervous, but it also instinctually is taking the most direct path it can on its intended journey. 
LIAM: What are the flowers like again? 
MATT: They're all manner of beautiful, different colorations, from what you can see, especially here in the middle of the clearing in which there's more sunlight that comes through. You can see there's bright reds and pinks and yellows. 
MARISHA: Send Pâté in there? 
UTKARSH: Hello? Is anybody in there? 
LIAM: Is there anything threatening? 
MATT: No response. Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: I'll send Pâté in to do his little dance. 
MATT: Okay. 
AIMEE: I can picture-- You know those birds that do the mating dance, and they're like... 
MARISHA: Oh yeah! 
MARISHA: Birds of paradise. 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Da da da da da, da da da da da. 
LIAM: 17. 
MATT: 17, okay. You don't see anything dangerous lurking, and the bowl of this crater, the growth seems to be pretty close to the ground throughout. There's no trees. There's nothing beyond maybe a few inches, five or six inches of height. 
LIAM: I think Orym's struck by the absurdity and weirdness-- 
AIMEE: Yeah, it's so weird. 
LIAM: -- of the world being on the precipice, but the weather being so beautiful for the day and a half they've been traveling, how peaceful it is here. He starts growing similar flowers out between his fingers and knuckles and starts walking down into it. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Even though I don't think it's a good idea, maybe, I do it anyway. 
AIMEE: Are you in a trance? 
MATT: Okay. 
EMILY: I definitely like it. I'm becoming an adrenaline junkie. 
LIAM: Breath comes before fear and anxiety. Just keep breathing. 
MATT: Are you joining as well? 
EMILY: Yeah, I think I feel like I'm aware that I think if I see Orym doing something, I'm like, okay, we're all allowed. 
MARISHA: That's fair, actually. 
UTKARSH: I'm going to walk around to the other side. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LIAM: When Prism leans down, he makes an identical red and yellow flower appear in the hair over one ear, and then he turns around to keep walking in. 
TALIESIN: Okay, let's keep an eye on this shit. 
AIMEE: I guess I'll go through the rear. 
MATT: Okay, as a number of you begin to slowly descend the bowl of this crater towards the center-- 
UTKARSH: Nobody's walking around? Okay, here we go. 
MATT: Pâté, of course, you just sent Pâté in. He's (whooshes) on your shoulder. "What are we doing? Are we going in? I was told to go in as well. So if we're going in as a team, it makes me feel safer." 
MARISHA: Do you still have that peaceful feeling? 
LIAM: We're just trying to-- 
AIMEE: Do the dance! 
LIAM: -- live in the moment and inhale and exhale one breath at a time. 
MATT: Leans real close into your ear and goes, "Yeah." 
AIMEE: Oh god. 
LIAM: That's okay. 
MARISHA: He's so cute. He's such a charmer. 
LIAM: I'm used to you. 
MARISHA: I love him. (laughter) 
LIAM: This is fine. (laughter) 
MATT: You reach the bottom of the crater rather rapidly. It's not massive. You stand here with the thick brush that covers the interior of the center, and you look around, up into the sky, and it's oddly serene. 
MARISHA: I'm just going to-- 
TALIESIN: How'd it get there, is my question. 
MARISHA: Well, I've got-- I've got an idea, but it would require kind of decimating the beautiful flowers. 
UTKARSH: Burn it, right? 
EMILY: I mean-- 
MARISHA: Burning it is one thing. 
TALIESIN: Or maybe we pull them back a bit, if we want to be-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll join Ashton and just-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, getting a little bit in there. 
MARISHA: Seeing if there's anything under there. 
MATT: Okay, you begin to pull back the plants, tear some of the roots and vines away. 
TALIESIN: Very gently. I mean, gently. 
MATT: And-- Indeed, there is something that has been grown over. You see the exposed half of a petrified skeleton-- 
EMILY: (gasps) 
MATT: -- that sits embedded halfway into the stone of this space. You see a ribcage and a bit of a spinal column that's exposed as you pull back the roots. 
LIAM: Humanoid. 
MATT: From what you can tell. You may have to clear a little further to see. 
MARISHA: Here, everyone scoot back a little bit. I'm going to cast Wither and Bloom right in the middle. 
MATT: Immediately, all of the nearby flora just-- 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
AIMEE: Oh shit. 
MATT: -- shrivels away into gray and dust. 
EMILY: It's beautiful as well. 
MARISHA: Sorry, Orym. 
UTKARSH: Nice. Great job. 
TALIESIN: Can we-- 
LIAM: No judgment. 
AIMEE: The little flowers just (whimpers) 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: Here in the center-- 
LIAM: This is fine. 
MATT: -- you can see the entirety of a humanoid skeleton that is, arms and legs splayed out, embedded within the stone, and even the bone that's exposed doesn't look like bone texture. It looks like it's a continuation of the stone, or it's been petrified over time, you're uncertain. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and I know this is a weird usage of either Earthwalk or using Merge With Stone or both of them to see if I can get around it. I'm curious, because-- 
UTKARSH: Pull it out? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, or at least raise it up a bit, because I know I've got, Merge With Stone, I know what it is, but I don't know if this is too weird of a usage of it. 
MATT: I like creative uses. 
TALIESIN: I will get rid of that. 
MATT: So you watch as Ashton takes a step into the rock, seems to slide into it, almost like for a moment, he becomes part of the stone itself. 
UTKARSH: Whoa. 
EMILY: Wow. 
MATT: You reach down, and indeed, you can feel, within the stone beneath, there is the other half of this skeleton. To remove it, I would need a high DC dexterity check. 
UTKARSH: You can do it! 
AIMEE: Would my stone-cutting ability have anything to do in assistance? 
MATT: If you'd like to try and assist him in carving it free. 
AIMEE: I would love that. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, I'll take whatever, because my dex is fine. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
MARISHA: I pull the rock chisel out from my hair. 
MATT: You specifically have a tool for this. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Oh yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
AIMEE: I have smith's tools. 
MATT: Great, so you have a hammer with you. You have your rock chisel. 
AIMEE: I got it all. 
TALIESIN: I can put pressure up while everybody tries and loosens it. 
MATT: Indeed. Now, so here's the thing. Either you can do it with advantage, or you can both roll once independently. 
AIMEE: Then add dexterity? 
MATT: For you, it would be your dexterity modifier plus your proficiency modifier, because you're using tools that you're proficient with. 
AIMEE: Oh, great. 
TALIESIN: So yours would be better. 
AIMEE: Yeah, okay, so I'll do that. 
MARISHA: Come on, Deni$e. 
AIMEE: I may need a little help. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you roll one and I roll one. 
AIMEE: Okay, so then I add this, and then I add plus three. 
MATT: Just a moment. 
LIAM: What are we doing? What kind of check? 
TALIESIN: It would be your-- 
MARISHA: Dex plus proficiency. 
AIMEE: Dex plus proficiency? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Yeah? Okay, so three. 
LIAM: I don't even know what's being done. 
EMILY: Orym, we're taking a skeleton out of a stone. 
MARISHA: She's trying to chisel the skeleton out. 
LIAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: So add your dex plus your proficiency bonus, which is probably like four. 
AIMEE: 16. 
TALIESIN: Better than mine. 
MATT: Okay. It is very delicate, and while you begin to pull some of its skull free from the stone, much like-- This is a rapid style attempt at excavation. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MATT: You get part of the skull free, and with that, some of the chest cavity collapses inward, unfortunately, through the process. But you do get the skull free, and it does dislodge. 
EMILY: May I cast Identify on it? 
MARISHA: Yes! 
MATT: Yes, you may. 
EMILY: All right. 
MATT: The features of this, it is humanoid and not larger or smaller than a standard human, though the features of it do seem more lithe. The skull is more, I don't want to say pointed towards the back, but the skull pulls back and is thinner in places. It looks delicate, but not elven, though it seems similar. You cast Identify on it, and indeed, this skeleton belonged to a githzerai. 
EMILY: Yes! From the sky! 
MATT: Which you know to be one of the people that call the Astral Sea outside of Exandria home. 
AIMEE: An ET? 
EMILY: This is an extraterrestrial corpse. 
LIAM: A what? 
TALIESIN: A what? 
EMILY: From the sky. 
TALIESIN: Like a bird? 
EMILY: No no no, further than the birds. Like from outer space. 
LIAM: Like the angel. 
TALIESIN: Like a moon. 
AIMEE: Oh! 
EMILY: No, not even like an angel. It's not an immortal being. It's just, people who live in outer space. 
UTKARSH: An alien. 
AIMEE: So you think that he crash landed here? 
EMILY: Or perhaps the fact that the body was fused with the stone would almost feel perhaps prison-like, or-- 
AIMEE: Prison meteor? Right? Because there's a hole. So something must've (impacts) then maybe killed it on impact. 
MATT: Could be. If you want to make an investigation check to look into the details of the impact? 
AIMEE: With my plus zero? Oh yeah. 
EMILY: Can I give her the help action? 
AIMEE: Yeah, I'll need that. 
MATT: Do you want to take one as well? 
EMILY: I might do it with my stats. 
MATT: You can do it with yours as well. 
AIMEE: Yeah, do that, do that. 
MATT: What'd you get? 
AIMEE: Nine. 
EMILY: 16. 
MATT: Nine. 16, okay. 16. 
AIMEE: Jail. 
MATT: Two things. One, the crater indeed is based on an impact, though an impact of this size should have shattered and destroyed any sort of mortal entity that crashed in here. The state of it means that its impact was also buttressed with an intentional enchantment. 
EMILY: Receiving. 
MATT: So this was placed here as a punishment. 
EMILY: It was! This was placed here as a punishment! 
MATT: The second thing you notice as you're looking over it is while you can see there are remnants of adornments, the clothing, armor, that were once on it that have long been turned to ash, and there's the ghost shape of where it may have worn things, the one thing that remains looks to be a singular metal band upon one of the stone bone fingers of the corpse. 
AIMEE: Pick it up. 
EMILY: He was married. 
MATT: It is around the finger, and is still merged with the stone. 
AIMEE: Well, I got my little tools. 
TALIESIN: I'll try and give it a good lift up also from the bottom. 
MATT: Okay. I'll say between the tools, if you're not worried about damaging it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the skeleton's gone. 
MATT: Indeed. You (slicing) tear the ring from it. 
AIMEE: What are we going to do, give it to the Louvre? 
MATT: It is-- 
MARISHA and EMILY: (laugh) 
MATT: It is almost-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: -- like a, what's the word I'm looking for? It's a smooth, shiny, metallic band, like a malachite, I think is what it is. 
AIMEE: Oh cool! Nice. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit! 
AIMEE: Like the green? That nice little-- 
MATT: Oh, what was-- 
AIMEE: Is that what? I don't know. I could be wrong. 
MATT: Hematite! That's what I was thinking about! 
EMILY: Oh, hematite. Yeah. 
MATT: Hematite look to it. 
EMILY: All of this, this is iron! This is iron from the sky! 
TALIESIN: Okay. I mean-- 
AIMEE: Would I know that as my-- Is iron something that dwarves know about? Yes? 
MATT: You have a good feel on stonework and architecture and the historical significance of that. This particular metal, you're not too familiar with. 
TALIESIN: Mind if I-- 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Put it on! 
TALIESIN: Give us a-- I don't know. 
MATT: If you want, make an intelligence-- a history check for me. 
AIMEE: History. Okay. Eight plus zero is eight. 
UTKARSH: Hey! 
MATT: Yeah, you're still a little bit of at a loss. 
AIMEE: (confused noise) 
TALIESIN: You can do that thing again, or no? 
EMILY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Like that-- 
EMILY: Oh yeah. I can-- 
LIAM: Have you read about anything like this? 
EMILY: Have I read anything about this? Dynios, have we read anything about this? 
MATT: (slurps) "No, I have not. I don't spend my time wandering or researching the central sections of weird, absconded forest floors. No." 
EMILY: Dynios, we really never talk about you. What did you do before you were trapped in a book? 
MATT: "Oh, I'm so glad you finally asked." 
EMILY: Actually, real quick. I have to cast Identify. 
MATT: "Oh. Okay." 
EMILY: We'll talk about it later. 
MATT: "All right." 
AIMEE: Daddy's in a bad mood. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Way to undermine your book. Yeah, go ahead. 
EMILY: I was doing it. 
TALIESIN: Confidence level. 
EMILY: Actually, Dynios, I do want to know. 
MATT: "No, it's too late now." 
EMILY: I know. I'm sorry. I set you up to be sassy. 
MATT: (slurps) The face goes away. 
AIMEE: I want to know! Dynios! Dynios! I want to know. 
EMILY: Our relationship has changed! Please, come back out! I was being cruel! Okay. I will cast Identify. 
MATT: Cast Identify. 
EMILY: On this. 
LIAM: Woo! 
AIMEE: Whoa! Da fuck? 
EMILY: Ring of Volcanic Flesh. 
UTKARSH: No way! 
TALIESIN: What? 
EMILY: "This smooth, hematite-like band feels cold to the touch. While attuned to this ring, the wearer gains plus one to their armor class. The ring has three charges. When the wearer takes fire damage, they may expend a charge to reduce the damage by 2d6. When the wearer is hit with a melee attack, they may expend a charge from the ring to deal 1d8 fire damage to the attacker and push them 10 feet directly away from the wearer! You regain all charges after completing a long rest." 
AIMEE: That's pretty good! 
UTKARSH: Cool! 
AIMEE: Who's got a low armor class? 
EMILY: Me, but it would not be well used on me. 
AIMEE: Oh. (laughs) 
EMILY: I feel like-- 
TALIESIN: I got a vibe from that. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, go for it! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
EMILY: It's earthen, and if it-- 
TALIESIN: If you don't mind. 
EMILY: Did come from the sky-- 
UTKARSH: So it's for defense? 
TALIESIN: I mean, it's for defense and attack and it's-- 
LIAM: And it's dopeness. 
TALIESIN: For being in the middle of shit, which is-- 
EMILY: Not to mention you're kind of like earthen and then this is rock from the sky. 
TALIESIN: I owe you some cool shit that looks better on you. 
AIMEE: No. No, you go ahead, honey. 
TALIESIN: No. 
AIMEE: You take it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay. I'm going to-- Actually, I have an idea for that. Yeah! Yeah, all right! I'm going to... Okay, it is an attunement thing. Cool. All right, I'm going to put this thing on. It probably won't matter until we take a short rest, but yeah. 
LIAM: I'm threading flowers through Pâté's eye socket. (laughter) 
AIMEE: That's so dark! 
MATT: "That kind of tickles! Thank you!" 
UTKARSH: All right. 
EMILY: Can we take a bit of this sky rock, too? 
AIMEE: I thought you were going to say, "Can we take a picture?" 
TALIESIN: I think we should. 
UTKARSH: I thought so, too. 
EMILY: We also should all take a selfie to remember this moment. 
AIMEE: I'll use my stone cutting tools to just a little sketch. 
UTKARSH: It's a sketch. 
AIMEE: Just one by one. 
MATT: Excavatin' for the 'grams. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Let me take an etchie. 
AIMEE: Yeah, just an etchie. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow! (laughter) 
MATT: Oh my goodness! 
AIMEE: That's funny! 
EMILY: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: We keep it moving? 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
UTKARSH: Cool. A magical ring! Not bad. 
LIAM: Weirdest thing to find right now. 
TALIESIN: Right? 
EMILY: It really is. Do you think that that came from wherever the gods came from? Doesn't it make you think of what's happening in Ruidus? 
AIMEE: Did it come from Ruidus? 
EMILY: A body trapped in stone as a punishment? 
TALIESIN: This feels like it's been here a while. I don't know. 
UTKARSH: Can you do a... Do you know how long it's been here? Can you do an age check, whatever it's called? Can you carbon date it? 
MATT: That'd be an investigation. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I would need someone-- 
MATT: Investigation or nature. 
EMILY: I can do an investigation. 
MATT: I'd say nature could also be-- 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, that's probably, the skull would be the thing to look at. 
EMILY: That's going to be a 21. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
EMILY: To carbon date. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: With all of your carbon dating materials that you brought with you. 
TALIESIN: Arcana date. There we are. 
MATT: There you go. Hard to be specific, but based on the state of the space around it, the level of overgrowth that doesn't appear to be dissimilar to the surrounding flora, you gather that it's probably been here for quite some time. This has not been a recent arrival. 
AIMEE: Like years, probably, for it to overgrow like that. 
MATT: Possibly hundreds of years. 
AIMEE: Oh, oh, oh! 
UTKARSH: A long, long time. 
EMILY: I'm just saying there's a similarity with the imprisoning someone in stone. 
AIMEE: Mm-hmm. 
EMILY: It makes me wonder if, perhaps, however distant, they may share some common source. 
AIMEE: Yeah! 
EMILY: But you know. 
AIMEE: That's good thinking! 
LIAM: Off-world stuff. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. Continuing onward, pressing forward. Your second day's journey comes to a close. With that, the evening comes once more. Searching for a place to stay for safety, are you sending Pâté out for another survival check? 
MARISHA: Sure! 
MATT: Go ahead and roll a survival check for me. 
MARISHA: To another scout mission! 
MATT: "Two for two. I got you all. Don't worry." 
MARISHA: Don't fail me! Do it for the raven! 15. 
MATT: 15. "I've found a very nice little soft space, a lot of fungus and sponges, lot of moss you'll like. It smells real good!" (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's what I heard, yeah. It's got fire charges or something like that. 
AIMEE: Some mushies. 
MARISHA: That's so sick. 
EMILY: Dynios? Dynios? I'm really sorry about earlier. My confidence made me act sassy and that was really unfair to do to you. 
MATT: "Honestly, it didn't hurt my feelings that bad. If anything, I'm excited to see you being slightly more sassy. Confidence is something you've entirely lacked this whole time, and to be also honest, entirely frustrating since I've been assigned to you! So be more sassy! Be more confident! Be more assertive! Tell people what you think! Take what you want! Tell them what you need! If they won't give it to you, remove it from them and make it your own." 
MARISHA: You're getting read by a book. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Daddy has spoken! 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
EMILY: Okay. I will do that. 
MATT: "Good." 
EMILY: I will absolutely do that. 
MATT: "Fantastic!" 
EMILY: Within reason, of course. I'm trying to, yes. 
MATT: "Yes. Certainly." (whooshes) The face vanishes into the book. 
LIAM: Is Dynios readable? 
EMILY: Readable? He's my spell book. He's just trapped in there. 
LIAM: This is just private for you. It's like notes. 
EMILY: Well, you could absolutely read it. I don't know if you could make magic from it. 
LIAM: No, I couldn't make magic. 
MATT: "Oh, you absolutely cannot read me." (laughter) 
AIMEE: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Wow! 
EMILY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Now who's sassy as shit? 
LIAM: I put a little flower and press it. 
MATT: "No!" (laughter) 
MATT: The book (spits) spits it out. (laughter) 
EMILY: That's so funny! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and pack a pipe of tobacco and just chill for... Actually. 
EMILY: Yes! Oh my gosh! Yes! Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Do you smoke? 
EMILY: Oh yeah. I'm a student. Of course I smoke. 
TALIESIN: Okay. (laughter) 
AIMEE: (coughs) 
TALIESIN: It has to light it. It won't work if you don't light it. 
EMILY: Oh, what? I was eating it. Yeah. Okay, right. Light it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: (laughs) 
EMILY: Okay. Yeah, right. 
UTKARSH: (laughs) 
EMILY: I smoke it like a cigarette with the tobacco. 
TALIESIN: Do I know what this does, or do I not know what this does? 
UTKARSH: We gave it to the guards at the gate. 
MATT: You would know upon acquiring it. 
TALIESIN: I would've figured this out. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. I'm such an asshole. I'm going to expend a charge on that pipe. 
MATT: Okay. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: Explain what transpires. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
AIMEE: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: As you're smoking-- 
EMILY: I'm back at school. Studying what? 
TALIESIN: The smoke starts, actually-- 
AIMEE: In Paris. At Uni. 
AIMEE and UTKARSH: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Isn't dissipating; it's staying in front of you and it-- 
AIMEE: Uh-oh! 
TALIESIN: Becoming its own little weird, little cloud and it's just hanging there for some reason. 
EMILY: Hello? Hello? 
TALIESIN: Slowly, it begins to reenact the scene of your most impressive and historic achievement. So why don't you tell us what we see in the smoke? 
EMILY: You want to go there? We're going to go there? 
TALIESIN: It's the pipe, not me. 
EMILY: We're going to go there? 
TALIESIN: It's the pipe, not me. 
EMILY: All right. 
MATT: Dynios is like, "I have to see this." 
EMILY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Is it starting to-- 
EMILY: Probably the most impressive thing Prism has ever done is-- You see a small stage is set by the smoke, like a, yeah, a small stage is set by the smoke of the Shadow Realm, so it's very bare, very cold, withered plants, small, parcelized, little villages. And you see a mage come and you see this little tiny Prism go up, make herself indispensable to that mage to the point where, when the mage goes to leave, he invites her back to the Cobalt Soul and she escapes the gloom and misery of the Shadow Realm to chase possibly something more for herself and maybe something more for the Shadow Realm as well. 
TALIESIN: You spelling bee-d your way out of your hometown. 
MATT: Hometown. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Did you get a scholarship, too? Was this part of a contest? Did you write a portfolio? 
EMILY: No, no. It was just, I mean, a mage came and it's really hard to leave the Shadow Realm. So I just really cleaned his quills. That's not a euphemism. (laughter) 
EMILY: Now, if I say it again, it will sound like a-- I cleaned his quill. Okay. I just made myself really, really useful and then he extended an invitation and it's a really big deal to leave the Shadow Realm. It's really hard to leave and it's a really tough place. That is my most impressive achievement. Second would probably be that spell I cast the first night I met you guys. 
AIMEE: Mm. 
TALIESIN: That was very impressive. 
LIAM: Not the devil? 
UTKARSH: Remember, you did a demon, too. 
EMILY: Yeah. Yeah. I've had an impressive two days. 
TALIESIN: That's debatably heroic. 
LIAM: You're all hits. 
EMILY: Thank you! (laughs) Well, I think maybe you guys are bringing it out of me because I have about 10 years of dormancy and questioning the fact that I ever left the Shadow Realm to begin with and wondering if my mother is mad at me because I really only told her via letter. But I mean, she named me Prism, right? Naming me Prism, rainbows in a world of shadows, right? That's got to be dreaming-- 
TALIESIN: It's a bit hippy, yeah. 
EMILY: -- of something more. Is this what you were hoping for when you spiked my tobacco? 
TALIESIN: Honestly, the tobacco's fine. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's not the tobacco, it's the pipe. 
UTKARSH: Oh! 
EMILY: Really? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Towards Prism, I say in Undercommon: You know, it's been quite some time since I've had anybody to practice my Undercommon with. 
EMILY: Well, you haven't lost your accent. 
MARISHA: Really? 
EMILY: It's beautiful! 
MARISHA: It can get a little-- 
EMILY: Phlegmatic? 
MARISHA: Yes! 
EMILY: But it's a pretty phlegmatic accent to begin with. 
MARISHA: It is. True. True. 
EMILY: Just the death rattles in there. 
MARISHA: Oh! Well, thank you. (laughs) 
EMILY: Well. 
TALIESIN: I feel like she needed a nerd friend. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I think your mother is probably quite proud. You went off and you pursued something to I seek a higher existence! 
EMILY: Yes! I honestly think the things I've been doing the past couple days are the most I've felt that I have made her proud. If anything, I've probably avoided going back because I've been worried I haven't done anything to make her proud. 
UTKARSH: Hmm. 
EMILY: When is the last time you were there? 
MARISHA: Oh, I haven't actually been there. 
EMILY: Oh! 
MARISHA: I sort of just-- I don't know. The language sort of just came to me one day. 
UTKARSH: You ate somebody, didn't you? 
MARISHA: I ate somebody? 
UTKARSH: You ate someone and you got their language abilities. 
LIAM: Are you not still speaking Klingon right now? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I think the first thing we heard in Common was: "I ate somebody?" (laughter) 
LIAM: I thought we were just (growls). 
MATT: Do you speak Undercommon? 
UTKARSH: No. (laughter) 
UTKARSH: No, I speak Common. 
MATT: But roll an insight check. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
UTKARSH: No, it's good! It's a three! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Beginner's luck. 
EMILY: Nat one! 
MATT: So they're talking in growls. (laughter) 
MATT: You're just between them, going. 
MARISHA: It's still-- 
EMILY: Just death rattles. 
MARISHA: It's even funnier that he just asks if I ate someone. 
MATT: Yeah. Without context. 
UTKARSH: You ate someone, didn't you? 
MARISHA: I drop out of Undercommon. 
UTKARSH: Just a guess. 
MARISHA: I guess, in a very roundabout way. 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I didn't really eat anybody, just the undead soul of a necromancer-- 
UTKARSH: (snaps) 
MARISHA: -- found its way into my body. 
EMILY: Really? 
MARISHA: So. Yes. 
EMILY: Well, you have to-- I mean, if I were you, I would be very curious about what would happen if I were to go to the Shadow Realm. 
MARISHA: You know, there was a moment that we thought maybe our adventures would take us there, but it just didn't pan out. The whole Solstice happened. But I would actually enjoy it. I would love. I mean, I like visiting new places. 
EMILY: I mean, it's a tough place. It's really not romantic at all. 
MARISHA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: (uncertain noise) 
EMILY: But I mean, I don't know. I guess I would be curious to see what it brought out in you to-- 
MARISHA: Oh! Yes. Well, perhaps when we have a little bit of downtime, maybe we could go together. 
UTKARSH: Wait, you can just go right now? 
EMILY: What'd you say? 
UTKARSH: Can you go right now, or is it a distance you have to travel? 
EMILY: Oh. No, we would have to basically have someone send us there. That's not magic I can do yet. 
MARISHA: It's like another dimension. It's sort of a-- 
EMILY: Like a fringe realm. 
MARISHA: Yes! One or two clicks away from this one. 
UTKARSH: Wow! 
MARISHA: You know, my mother, she actually wanted me to do very much exactly like what you're doing, to go off and be taught by-- 
EMILY: Really? 
MARISHA: -- intellects and to see the world and to expand my horizons. So, I don't know. I'm proud of you. 
EMILY: Thank you! Thank you! I really do hope someday I can see her and she can say, "It was worth it. It was worth it, you leaving." Hmm. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
EMILY: I hope so. And-- 
UTKARSH: It was worth it. I promise you that she's happy that you're gone. 
EMILY: I love the way you worded that. (laughter) 
EMILY: I think Prism, at this point, has two big tears and she's like: Excuse me, I need to go dig a hole and take a shit. (laughter) 
EMILY: Then she walks into the corner. 
TALIESIN: Don't take the pipe! Oh, she took the fucking pipe. (laughter) 
LIAM: Take Susan Sarandon with you. 
AIMEE: That's the name of the pipe? 
LIAM: The cougar. 
MARISHA: The cougar! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: The cougar! 
MARISHA: Just going through hot, famous ladies? (laughter) 
EMILY: I think I stand behind a tree and go (whimpers). 
AIMEE: Aw! You know, I love a self-made bitch. I sure do. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Absolutely. 
MATT: All right. Any other conversation to have? Or we can move to the end of the evening. 
UTKARSH: I'll hand out some blueberry Fruit Roll-Ups. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit! That's right! 
MARISHA: Ooh. Can I have the little Ruidus and the little Catha? 
TALIESIN: That's a circle. 
MARISHA: It's clearly supposed to be Ruidus and Catha. 
TALIESIN: It's a blue circle. 
UTKARSH: It's a circle. 
TALIESIN: Okay? No. 
UTKARSH: I just did basic shapes. 
AIMEE: Bluidus. 
MARISHA: Bluidus! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
UTKARSH: Hey! 
AIMEE: I got jokes! I got jokes! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Man, this shit's good! 
MATT: Wonderful. Well, who's keeping first watch? 
LIAM: I will. 
MATT: All right, roll perception for me. 
LIAM: That would be a 26. 
MATT: 26. Okay. Your watch goes without issue, and with a 26, you do notice, at certain times of the night, you catch something moving on the horizon and your nerves begin to catch in. But you see a pair of glowing eyes, but they're oddly soft, not intense. Once you make connection with them, once you both acknowledge each other, there's a sense of comfort that washes through you that you can't explain. 
LIAM: I'm seeing unknown eyes in the dark and it's comforting? 
MATT: Oddly. You're trying to consolidate what that means. Is this dangerous? Should you be at the ready? You begin to look around and you can see these little, amongst the fog that gathers and the smoke of the fire that's now down to a low ember between you and your sleeping friends, you can see little wisps drift around and move for moments. With your very specific, honed vision, you see dozens of small sprite-like spirits that mingle with the smoke and drift around. 
LIAM: And it's comforting. 
MATT: In ways, you're uncertain. It feels unnatural that you're comforted by them. 
UTKARSH: Sirens. 
LIAM: Yep, yep. Yep, yep, yep. I'm debating which magical person to wake up. I bump Prism's ankle. 
UTKARSH: That's a good idea. 
EMILY: (gasps) Yeah? 
LIAM: (whispers) Hey, sorry. 
EMILY: (whispers) Yeah? 
LIAM: (whispers) Do you see that? 
EMILY: Do I see it? 
MATT: It takes you a bit to focus, but eventually you can see it a little bit. If you want to make a religion or arcana check, your choice. 
EMILY: Okay. Both are banging! It's going to be a 26. 
TALIESIN: Jesus! 
MATT: 26! 
EMILY: Either religion or arcana. 
TALIESIN: Woof! 
UTKARSH: Love it. 
EMILY: Five intelligence, baby! 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
MATT: The best that you can gather, which is pretty solid, having not studied this intensely, but based on what you have read, recent conversations, and the spectral entity that has been guiding you on this journey, these are likely all local spirits-- 
UTKARSH: Hmm. 
MATT: -- of the woods that you traverse, themselves growing more comfortable with your presence as you pass through and playfully sharing the space while most of you dream. 
TALIESIN: Hmm! 
EMILY: They're-- 
LIAM: Is that a problem? 
EMILY: Sorry? 
LIAM: Is that a problem? 
EMILY: I think it might be truly the exact opposite of a problem. I think it may be like we're essentially having a little slumber party with the local spirits. You seem like you have some sort of affinity with nature or something. 
LIAM: My mom does, just a little. 
EMILY: You might be attracting them. (laughs) 
MATT: You see one that's drifting in the air and it looks like a wisp of smoke that drifts like this gentle blue-green smoke and it glides over past the sleeping Laudna and then lifts up above and you can see this soft pair of eyes apparate towards you and this little wisp of it in the side, this tiny little, oblong, dual-sided point of a spirit goes. 
AIMEE: (laughs) It's Tinkerbell! 
MATT: (whooshes) 
LIAM: Does it have form or is it more like taffy, like spirit taffy? 
MATT: It's more like spirit taffy, but it has a raindrop, small persona that comes to points at each end as it glides and drifts. Then it creates a pseudopod of its energy as it waves to you and then (whooshes) glides off and you see it take off, and other ones are pairing off and weaving through the branches around and playing and dancing through the smoke, and some of them are sitting on the chest of some of your companions and watching them sleep. 
EMILY: Can I make a little Bigby's Hand so he can dance with them? (laughs) Just make a little elevation so he can, if you feel calm. 
LIAM: Oh, lift me on a hand? 
MATT: If you want to try. 
EMILY: If you want. 
LIAM: I mean, I'm not going to argue with anything, unless you're going to feed me to a demon. Yeah. 
EMILY: It seems like they want to dance with you. 
AIMEE: ♪ Can we dance ♪ 
LIAM: Sure. 
AIMEE: ♪ Dun dun dun ♪ 
MATT: Describe what your hand looks like as it apparates. 
EMILY: Oh, as it apparates? Unfortunately, I am from Shadowfell, so it does look like a hand from the grave. (laughs) 
MATT: (guttural growls) 
LIAM: (sighs) I'm used to this by now. 
MATT: (laughs) 
EMILY: But then, it really dexterously glides him so that he can be amongst these little spirits. 
LIAM: Okay. So I'll add to that. The ride is a little strange, but workable and Orym will, a little bit of a surf feel, but more the Zeph'aeratam. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: He will, with no weapon in hand, recreate similar forms and movements that he does in his-- 
AIMEE: That's all he knows! 
LIAM: -- practice. 
MATT: As you do, returning to this comfortable state and familiar endlessly practiced forms, the glow of the firelight from beneath, you can see more of the spirits begin to pull away from the rest of the group and begin to gather like a collective school of fish. But here, amongst the smoking clouds, they begin to swirl around you and this spectral dark shadow hand. As they glide up, their eyes begin to alight a little brighter, causing this firefly, cloud-like look as they spiral and curl silently around you. It's this beautiful display, soundless almost, except for this faint bit of wind that drifts through the trees as the fog begins to pour through, and it's this beautiful connection with nature, but nature in its purest form. There's something about the life and the energy here that is extremely ancient while also innocent and playful. 
LIAM: I think what Orym is thinking about while he's dancing with spirits on a giant skeletal hand-- 
EMILY and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: -- is how, even in the most terrible of times, and these are the most terrible times right now, we still do find moments of beauty and happiness here and there in moments and that you still have to appreciate them, even when they're surrounded on all sides by darkness and hardship. As he winds down, he just, with a half smile to Prism, goes: Breath before fear and anxiety. 
EMILY: Yeah, take a deep breath because I bet there's more fear ahead. 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
EMILY: Breathe it in! Love it! 
LIAM: I pat the large, skeletal finger. 
EMILY and MATT: (laugh) 
EMILY: Since I think I move it, I just nuzzle your head. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, it's all creaky. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
EMILY: (squeaks) (laughter) 
LIAM: Ugh, this is such vanilla fantasy. It's been so done to death. (laughter) 
AIMEE: I like it! 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
MATT: Fantastic! As the spirits eventually disseminate amongst their evening revelry, some lingering and keeping their eyes, some copying the one time you waved as you see a few more wave as they vanish off into the night. Your watch comes to a close and you return to rest and the evening goes without issue. The third day of travel greets you the following morning. 
AIMEE: Ay-oh! 
MATT: Go ahead and roll another d20 for me, if you don't mind. 
MARISHA: That's you. 
AIMEE: You got to roll (growls). 
UTKARSH: 16. 
MATT: 16! Fantastic! With a 16-- 
AIMEE: We just never had time. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
AIMEE: It's easy. 
MATT: You being guided by your wild elemental cougar-- 
AIMEE: (laughs) Sandra Bullock. 
MATT: Yes. 
EMILY: She's wild! 
MATT: Letting you name them for each day. 
EMILY: Terry Pratchett. No, Terry-- 
AIMEE: Hatcher? 
EMILY: Teri-- 
UTKARSH: Yeah, Hatcher works. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
EMILY: Yeah, that's right. 
UTKARSH: Felicity Huffman. 
LIAM: Margaret Thatcher. (laughter) 
UTKARSH: Margaret Thatcher! 
EMILY: Yummy! Yum, yum, yummy! 
AIMEE: No free milk for you! 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
UTKARSH: Yeah! 
MATT: A beautiful warm day is ahead of you. 
AIMEE: Oh! 
MATT: Most of this is outside of the forest itself. Instead, gliding past the exterior of a mass portion of the Serratus Wilderness and now into these beautiful rolling hills of tall grass that shift (whooshes) over stone outcroppings that pierce out from parts of it and indeed, the monolith of the mountain that you've been following, the Ascendant Bridge grows closer still. You get the sense that you can't be more than a day or two's travel from your destination, but it is a welcoming journey. As the warm wind is a nice change of pace from the chill that seems to permeate this valley most of the time that you've been here, you take in and appreciate this little moment of respite as you push forward. 
AIMEE: Deni$e is sunning herself as she walks. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Titties out. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Yes! 
AIMEE: Cleavage out, I mean. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
AIMEE: She doesn't know you that well. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Just full cleave. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
EMILY: I mean, barbarians cleave. 
MATT: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: It's the claven cleaven. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Didn't happen. 
MATT: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: I felt it. 
MATT: Felt it? It was right there. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, it just left. It was a sneeze. It was an almost sneeze. 
MARISHA: A sneeze? 
LIAM: I thought you were going to cast something. 
AIMEE: I know! I was like: Not now! 
TALIESIN: Sneezing and casting is like-- 
EMILY: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Nope. 
MARISHA: Pollen's real bad in LA right now, you guys. This is so bad. 
MATT: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: I really thought it was right there. It's gone. 
AIMEE: Look at the light next time. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to briefly walk next to Prism and just: Sorry about the pipe last night, by the way. I just felt like you needed a brag and I really wanted to see what a brag looked like, so-- 
EMILY: Thank you! I mean, that's really sweet! 
TALIESIN: Well, sweet as I get. 
EMILY: A really fun pipe. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! I know, right? No one else knew about it either. I've been keeping that on the down low. 
EMILY: Really? 
MARISHA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
EMILY: (laughs) That's fun! 
TALIESIN: I've had it a while. 
EMILY: (laughs) Well, no apologies necessary. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
EMILY: If anything, you're right. It did turn into a brag because I was feeling like: Oh fuck! I'm doing it. I'm finally doing what I came to do. So yeah, it felt good. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Good. I've been on the road with a bunch of very talented people and you've got the vibe. It's good. 
EMILY: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah. 
EMILY: You as well. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I've been doing this a long time, so-- 
EMILY: Really? 
TALIESIN: Some form of it or another. Yeah. 
EMILY: How long? 
TALIESIN: (exhales) Eight years more, I guess? I don't know. It's been a while. No, more than that. Wow! Since school. 
EMILY: Since school? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I left school a little-- Well, I left school a little early to pursue a very lucrative life of crime. 
EMILY: It's a little bit fun, though, right? 
TALIESIN: Yes! 
EMILY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Except for when it isn't. But when it is, yes, it's very fun. 
EMILY: Yes, I think I'm starting to get a taste for adrenaline. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
EMILY: Yeah. I think that, yeah. 
TALIESIN: When it goes poorly, it goes very poorly. 
EMILY: I look forward to finding out how that feels. 
TALIESIN: The bad days are bad. The good days are very, very good. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: But especially with these people. Why are you waving? Oh, fucking-- 
MARISHA: I'm not waving! I'm just fiddling! 
EMILY and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Hmm. I'm just overhearing a conversation. I'm sorry! 
LIAM: Why are you see through? 
EMILY, TALIESIN, and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: You know I have thin skin. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MARISHA, LIAM and TALIESIN: Literally. 
MARISHA and EMILY: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Jinx! You owe me wine. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just yeah. 
EMILY: Did anyone have anyone that they were trying to Scry on at any point? 
LIAM: I mean, if you're offering it, it wouldn't hurt to-- 
MARISHA: To check in. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Do you want to try and Scry on your brother again? 
UTKARSH: No, I had a question for you, though. 
MARISHA: Mm! 
UTKARSH: When we were-- 
AIMEE: Yeah, that's what I'd do. What do you think? 
UTKARSH: When we saw your friends on the mountain, there was one who seemed more important to you than the others. I don't know their name or what's the story there, but I just was curious. I didn't mean to ask in front of the whole group. I really was just going to ask just you. 
MARISHA: I'm assuming you're talking about Imogen, whom I've known the longest out of this whole group. In fact, me and her have been together for two, three years before connected with these chucklefucks. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: And she saved me and I'd like to think I saved her as well. So yeah. So we're... sisters from another mister. Do people say that? 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: I've heard it before. 
MARISHA: I don't know. Yes. 
UTKARSH: I've heard it before. 
AIMEE: You got the same dad? No, the same mom. Oh, that's nice! 
MARISHA: The same mom. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Hmm. Yes. 
UTKARSH: Well, that sounds like a really special friendship. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. So just hope she's okay. She, I think, felt the effects She, I think, felt the effects, and for many complicated reasons of the Apogee Solstice, more than a lot of us, and I was afraid I'd lost her. She's something we've come to have learned is Ruidusborn. 
AIMEE: Wait, she was born there? 
MARISHA: No, she was born under the light of a flare of Ruidus. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
MARISHA: So she has this special connection, got a lot of her powers from Ruidus. 
LIAM: Do you know about this? 
EMILY: I mean, I know what Ruidusborn means. Do I know anything more? 
MATT: Go ahead and roll a history or arcana check. 
EMILY: 22! 
MATT: 22. I mean, it is known through history. There are many great or terrible figures through history that have been acknowledged to have been born under a flare of the red moon. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MATT: It is classically and superstitiously, but also historically considered the Moon of Ill Omen and those born under its sign are destined for great, usually terrible things. 
UTKARSH: Mm! 
MATT: That nature means that most children that are born under a flare of Ruidus often live a life of ridicule or fear or they just do not let anyone know and the family tries to cover it up. It's usually pretty rare. Usually. 
EMILY: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: So yeah, there was-- Yes. 
EMILY: So I share all that. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
UTKARSH: So is she inherently-- Was she born evil? 
MARISHA: No. No, not at all. 
EMILY: I mean, part of me feels like the Ruidusborn thing, the great or terrible, it's almost the cultural weight of that that might have more of an effect in skewing towards terrible and maybe is not inherently-- 
MARISHA: Absolutely. 
LIAM: Wrapped around it. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It's difficult. 
UTKARSH: Public opinion. 
MARISHA: Yes. You know, after a while, when so many people put you in a category, sometimes it's easier to just lean into it. 
UTKARSH: Sounds like you and her have a lot in common. 
MARISHA: Yes. You're very astute. (sighs) 
UTKARSH: Are your friends as powerful as you are? 
LIAM: More. 
TALIESIN: More. 
EMILY: What? 
MARISHA: Imogen is very powerful, very capable. But there was a risk, a fear, a possibility that she was going to get wrapped up and maybe assimilated into, basically, a Ruidusborn cult and feels like we got really close. 
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, when we get where we're going, you guys might want to split off from us because we're looking to dive back into the middle of all of this. I mean, you're amazing, and you're figuring out amazing, but we've seen some shit in the past week. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
EMILY: It's okay. I have some plans. It seems like you have-- 
AIMEE: I mean-- 
TALIESIN: We got to get you-- 
AIMEE: To Dariax. 
TALIESIN: Your appointed ass kicking. 
AIMEE: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: I mean, unless you want to help save the world, or whatever. That'd be appreciated, too. 
EMILY: That's along the lines of my plans. 
TALIESIN: We've got-- 
EMILY: I mean, not in such lofty terms, but I do feel as though I'm good with texts. So I might, perhaps, exploit my Cobalt Soul pedigree to get access to some interesting literature. 
MARISHA: (chuckles) 
TALIESIN: Got it. 
LIAM: You got to find Dariax and scoop him up. 
AIMEE: Yeah. Throw him off a cliff. (laughter) 
LIAM: Pick him up, dust him off, keep him close. 
AIMEE: Yeah. We'll see. You know what I forgot to ask Joanne is if Dariax was in Tal'Dorei. When we scryed, could I tell where he was? 
MATT: Unfortunately, with scrying, it's usually pretty focused on the-- 
AIMEE: Just a close up? 
MATT: Yeah. Everything in the periphery, beyond a few feet, gets a little blurry beyond that. It's just the focus of the actual spell. 
AIMEE: Right. 
MATT: But-- 
EMILY: Do you want to try to Scry again? 
AIMEE: Well, I think he should do for his brother first. I don't want to get ahead of the line. 
UTKARSH: I don't need to do that, I need to-- It didn't work last time. 
LIAM: Or stick on the road. There's no reason why we shouldn't help you out. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Exactly. 
AIMEE: Unless there's no brother. (laughs) 
UTKARSH: I can-- I mean, sure. I'll do something. I'll give her... 
TALIESIN: Points there. 
UTKARSH: The crossbow is not going to work. Oh, I have a sling that you gave back to me. 
AIMEE: Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. 
EMILY: Okay, a sling? 
UTKARSH: Mm-hmm. Is this a possession of his? 
UTKARSH: It's something that was in the home, yes. I don't know if it was made in our house or not, but hopefully. 
EMILY: Okay. 
LIAM: Has he ever used it? 
UTKARSH: I believe so, yes. We all did. 
EMILY: Great. So I guess I should ask you-- She gave me the scroll. 
UTKARSH: I hope that he's still alive. 
EMILY: Can I have copied it down into my spellbook? 
MATT: Yeah. You've definitely done it over the past couple days of your journey with your downtime. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
MATT: Because it does require a focus you likely would've acquired one while you were there as well, or she may have presented one for you. 
EMILY: I also have a-- I have a quill, so I copy things really quickly. 
MATT: Oh yeah. Yeah, without issue. But the spell itself does require a focus of at least 1,000 gold worth, which I'll say, knowing that this is what was required of-- 
UTKARSH: Holy shit. 
AIMEE: Damn. 
MATT: You could have acquired-- 
EMILY: What about that ring? Can I focus on that ring or will it disappear? 
MATT: It's usually a crystal ball or a mirror or something that was designed for that. 
UTKARSH: Damn. 
EMILY: Wait, quick, everyone-- 
LIAM: What about a sentient book? 
MATT: Right. What I'm saying is knowing this when you acquired the spell, you likely could have been granted this by the Elder as well who may have given you-- 
EMILY: Okay. 
MATT: I think she would've given you a mirror. I think it would be a small circular mirror about that large-- 
UTKARSH: Great. 
MATT: -- that has this unique, twisted, hammered brass vibe around the edges that would go up into a filigree curl with little opals embedded on each side to hold it. 
TALIESIN: Little magical ring light around the edge. 
MATT: Yes, exactly. 
TALIESIN: It really brings out-- Sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Whoa. 
EMILY: (laughs) All right, Bor'Dor. Look in. I'll put the little slingshot on. 
UTKARSH: I'm just afraid. I won't say it to the group, but internally I'm afraid that my brother's dead. 
EMILY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. As you focus your first time, letting this incantation find you, you close your eyes and you hold the mirror as a focus. The mirror begins to shift. The imagery on its surface begins to ripple like the surface of water. You instinctually close your eyes. Unlike the basin in the middle of this cottage where you saw it done once, you are part of the focus, Prism, and you feel your consciousness suddenly rocket out of your current self. You are thrust into the clouds of some unknown space and you are plucked into a heavily wooded area, a cabin. An empty cabin. Furniture, kind of not heavily furnished. Dark, shaded, empty. 
UTKARSH: Can I see what she sees? 
EMILY: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Can I see-- 
MATT: You can glance into the mirror where she's holding it and you can see the same imagery. 
UTKARSH: Where is he? 
EMILY: Is this your house? 
UTKARSH: Well, that's where he stays. Yes. Where is he? 
EMILY: I don't know. Is there any evidence of dishes in the sink or-- 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
EMILY: 17 on the die. 
MATT: 17 on the die. Best you can see in the nearby surroundings is there's some leather working tools on the wall. You can see there's a couple of tanned hides that are draped over a nearby stool. 
EMILY: I would like to also use this perception check, based off of what Deni$e just said, to see do I see any signs of a sick person being there? 
MATT: Not a sick person. You see furniture, it looks like the-- Looks like a singular, wooden, log cabin interior. There is a bed, a simple bed. But no one seems to be occupying it. 
AIMEE: Hmm. 
EMILY: Okay. So what does this-- He's not here? Is that a good sign? 
UTKARSH: I hope so. No, there's no way that can be a good sign. 
EMILY: Well, he's not dead. 
UTKARSH: But he's not there. What if he was taken away? Oh, what if he got freaking-- 
EMILY: Shunted? 
UTKARSH: Right. Well-- 
AIMEE: Is there evidence that more than one person lives there? Or like-- I don't know. I'm going down a rabbit hole. 
EMILY: But this is definitely a house you recognize this time? 
UTKARSH: Yes, that's where he stays. Yes. 
EMILY: That's where he stays. Where he lives? 
UTKARSH: I was just there. 
EMILY: He just stays there. Okay. Okay. Well-- 
LIAM: Maybe the sling's more tied to your house? 
EMILY: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Doesn't make any sense. 
EMILY: I'm sorry I couldn't get you better information. 
TALIESIN: I think we've all learned to never go anywhere without a couple sentimental objects on our person. 
EMILY: Yeah. That is a good call. 
TALIESIN: No matter what we're doing. 
AIMEE: I'm sort of curious to know, maybe we can get an update on their friends or Ludinus. 
UTKARSH: Ooh. 
AIMEE: Maybe see what's up. I don't know, I'm curious-- 
EMILY: If I take an arcane rest, I can get another 5th-level spell and do it again. 
AIMEE: Got it. Okay. Maybe tomorrow. 
EMILY: Like I said, I do have the likeness of Ludinus. We could try to scry on him. 
TALIESIN: Let's try it tonight just in case something happens on the road to-- 
MARISHA: Yes, agreed. 
EMILY: Okay. 
UTKARSH: Thank you for trying. 
EMILY: Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't get you more. 
LIAM: Also, Laudna, maybe for tomorrow, you must have something that belongs to Imogen, right? 
MARISHA: Oh, yes. I'm sure. 
LIAM: Started with Chet the other day. Maybe we could focus on her. 
UTKARSH: Silvery Barbs. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs. Yes. 
MATT: So your journey continues on for the remainder of the day. Eventually, the day turns into night just as you reengage with the forest across the field. The mountain comes close and you assess likely another day's journey or so, you will discover, hopefully, the destination, the Irriam Canyon. Did we roll a d20 for that day? 
EMILY: I don't know. 
MATT: I don't think we did. Somebody else please roll as we close the day out. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
UTKARSH: Wait, no, I rolled 17. 
MARISHA: He rolled at the top. 
AIMEE: He rolled at the beginning of the day. 
MATT: That's right, you did. Never mind. We're good, we're good. So we're good. Thank you for that. 
AIMEE: We're like, (frantic yells)! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: No! 
TALIESIN: We rolled! We rolled! 
MATT: You all settle in to your evening's camp based on what could be your last night before you reach your destination. But a fire is set, you can gather what materials you have for food or hunt if you like, and prepare for the journey ahead. What would you like to do? 
EMILY: Would you like to scry on Ludinus or someone? 
LIAM: I don't have-- I don't know how it works. I don't have anything of his, but you think just the description? 
EMILY: My only thought is I have this-- 
UTKARSH: You have something. 
EMILY: I have this likeness of Ludinus on my-- 
MARISHA: Not of Ludinus. 
EMILY: -- canonically expressed playing card. 
LIAM: Right. 
UTKARSH: But wouldn't that just show you where the playing card was made? 
EMILY: Well, based on the description of the spell, but also if we're using it differently, that's also fine. Would have to defer to Matthew for that. 
AIMEE: Matthew. 
EMILY: I'd have to defer to Matthew for that. 
UTKARSH: Who the hell is Matthew, Prism? 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Well done, well done. 
EMILY: Because in the scrying thing it says that there's a minus two to the save to be scryed on if you have their likeness or picture. 
MATT: Correct. 
AIMEE: Oh. 
EMILY: But I'm also cheesing, so you can say stop. (laughs) 
MATT: No, no, no. Do what you want to do. Would you like to try to scry on him? 
LIAM: If it helps, looking at the card. He looked like even more up his own ass than is painted on that card. 
EMILY: Okay. Okay, so I'll Prestidigitation it to look more up his own ass. (laughter) 
AIMEE: The smug just-- 
MARISHA: Yeah (laughs). 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
EMILY: So yeah. It might not work, but maybe we can try. All right. Okay, whew. Ready for another psychic rollercoaster. 
MATT: Okay. You prepare yourself, you grasp the mirror, you finish the incantation in the center of the ritual circle you draw. You feel your consciousness pull from within you and then immediately stop and hang in a gray expanse of nothing like a wall. 
AIMEE: Oh fuck. 
MARISHA: Ugh. 
AIMEE: Damn it. 
MATT: There is nothing. 
AIMEE: He's got a fucking protection or some shit. 
MARISHA: 100%. 
EMILY: I come out of it. 
UTKARSH: Psychic block. 
EMILY: Yeah, he's-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
EMILY: I was hoping he would be too arrogant to have Nondetection up, but I'm guessing he has some sort of-- 
AIMEE: He's got, what is it? An unlisted number? Motherfucker. 
EMILY: Yeah, he blocked my call. Sorry. 
UTKARSH: He probably. has magicians, right? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
EMILY: Sorry. 
UTKARSH: Putting up spells. 
TALIESIN: He's got a lot of stuff. 
LIAM: That's it for the night, right? 
EMILY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah, okay. 
UTKARSH: Any water around? 
EMILY: That's what I can do. 
MATT: You can make a survival check if you want to look for a water source. 
UTKARSH: 17. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
UTKARSH: Plus whatever it is. 
MATT: Oh yeah. You do a short walk around, take about 20 or 30 minutes and wander off. You do find a river that is running-- 
LIAM: Through it? 
AIMEE and EMILY: (laugh) 
MATT: Yes. (laughter) 
MATT: It may eventually become parallel or crossover with the path that you're going, but it's about 30 minutes or so. Looks clean, maybe either recent snow melt or from the nearby mountains or hills. It's not a heavy river, it's more like a wide brook. But definitely clean water at your disposal. 
UTKARSH: So I get some clean water. 
MATT: Okay. 
AIMEE: Deni$e still boils it. No matter what. Always boil some water. 
UTKARSH: Any fish? I really want to fish. 
MATT: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Any fish? 
MATT: Go ahead and make a survival check. Yeah. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Fucking fish. 
MATT: So you go-- He leaves off into the forest. 
AIMEE: What, you guys don't want to rabbit anymore? (laughter) 
MATT: He vanishes for 40 minutes into the woods. 
AIMEE: Yeah, sure. 
UTKARSH: Nine. 
MATT: Nine? 
AIMEE: Yeah, what he's doing. Fishing. 
MATT: Nine. It's tough. 
TALIESIN: Including your survival? Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: With a nine, you do manage to catch one fish. 
UTKARSH: Yes! 
MATT: After six or seven bites that get away. 
AIMEE: A goldfish. 
MATT: You pull it free and you take it out and it looks-- At first glance here in what little modicum of light that you have, as a half-elf, if I recall, right? So you're still able to see in low light pretty well. You glance at it. It is about that long, about that thin and a pale lime green. It will significantly feed a few bites for one person. 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
AIMEE and EMILY: (laugh) 
UTKARSH: I'll save it for the cougar. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Just goes right through her. 
UTKARSH: Then I'll bring water back to the camp. 
MATT: Okay. So you gather bits of water and bring back clean water to the camp. What are the rest of you doing? 
EMILY: Bor'Dor, do you want me to try and put a spell on your-- 
UTKARSH: Fish? 
EMILY: No, on your crossbow. (laughter) 
UTKARSH: No, I'm okay. 
EMILY: Okay. 
UTKARSH: I want to save it for if we ever need it. But if you can make this fish bigger. 
EMILY: I actually can. 
UTKARSH: Yes! 
EMILY: Can I cast Enlarge on the fish? (laughter) 
EMILY: Seeing that he's missing-- 
UTKARSH: I don't know why this means so much to me. 
AIMEE: Prism is Jesus! 
TALIESIN: Magic can't do-- Well, okay, magic can do this. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Multiplication of the fish! 
MATT: I'll allow it. 
LIAM: Water, too! 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
EMILY: Only for, I think-- 
AIMEE: Turn it to wine! 
EMILY: It's only for a short time, so cook it real quick. Cook it real quick. 
UTKARSH: There's a fire going, right? 
MATT: So this fish now this long becomes this long. You cook it up real fast, you prepare it and you share it. All of you enjoy the bites. It's like a snack filling. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say, does it shrink? 
MATT: Then at the end of the hour, you're suddenly hungry again. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Anybody want a fucking rabbit? 
UTKARSH: Yeah, I'll eat rabbit. 
TALIESIN: Yes! Oh my god. 
AIMEE: Deni$e goes and gets a rabbit. Come here, little rabbit. (cracks) 
MATT: Roll survival for me. Or animal handling, depending on what you want to do. 
AIMEE: They're both the same, plus five. 
LIAM: Hi, bun-bun. 
AIMEE: Oh fuck. Oh shit, that's a 24. 
MATT: 24. You hunt rabbit and a number of other various prey animals that will make a fine meal when cooked for the rest of the troop. 
UTKARSH: Yum. 
AIMEE: Of course Deni$e is a good cook. 
MATT: Indeed. Now you're all-- 
MARISHA: We can make a stew. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You know? 
TALIESIN: We got everything we need, so-- 
AIMEE: Great. In the hole? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
AIMEE: With the dead body? 
UTKARSH: It's a kitchen down there. 
AIMEE: Anybody got some adobo or sazon or something to go with it? 
MARISHA: We have some spices. 
TALIESIN: We do. 
LIAM: We do. We robbed a kitchen. 
TALIESIN: We robbed a kitchen. 
AIMEE: You did? 
MARISHA: I took all the spices out of that kitchen. 
AIMEE: She makes a little sofrito in the pan which is this Puerto Rican herb situation. 
MARISHA: So good. I'm suddenly hungry. 
MATT: You're all enjoying this fine bountiful meal, cooked, quietly eating around the campfire here in the evening. 
UTKARSH: This is delicious. 
MARISHA: I scooch up next to Bor'Dor. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Are you doing all right? Sometimes I look over and you're staring off into nothing. You know, just look a little stressed sometimes. Then you snap back out of it and then it happens again five minutes later, so. 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I sense the struggle. 
UTKARSH: Well, it's a lot to take in. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
UTKARSH: You say that your friends are stronger than you are. That's totally-- 
MARISHA: Well, I mean... 
AIMEE: They should speak for themselves. 
MARISHA: I'd say it's on par. 
LIAM: She didn't say that. 
MARISHA: You know? Equal. Stronger than them? Yes. 
UTKARSH: Everyone can hear. We're chatting, right? Openly? 
TALIESIN: Not Chetney. Chetney is kind of-- 
MATT: You're all around the campfire. 
EMILY: Yeah, let's talk some shit. 
MARISHA: That is true. But Chetney turns into a werewolf. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, but how long is he going to live? Let's be honest. 
UTKARSH: Chetney with a U or with an E? 
MARISHA: An E. 
TALIESIN: Months at best. Very old. 
UTKARSH: Chetney. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Wheezes. 
UTKARSH: You think the six of you are strong enough to kill a god killer? 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
LIAM: Not when you put it like that. 
TALIESIN: I think-- I don't really think of it that way. 
UTKARSH: Well, that's the way it sounds. 
TALIESIN: That's-- 
MARISHA: That's fair. Yes. 
UTKARSH: Or do you hope to stop Ludinus, who you can't even scream on? 
EMILY: Scry. 
UTKARSH: Scry on. 
AIMEE: Good one. 
EMILY: Been screaming about how I couldn't scry, so that's fair. 
TALIESIN: I will feel pleased if we stop him, or at the very least, get some people who shouldn't be there out. We tried real hard to stop him and it didn't really work. 
UTKARSH: How many people did you kill? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
MARISHA: Over the course of the entire journey, or-- 
UTKARSH: No, when you were trying to-- How many of his people did you take out? 
LIAM: A decent amount. 
MARISHA: I don't remember. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the other thing-- 
LIAM: The ship. 
UTKARSH: What ship? 
MARISHA: Oh, we did. We did crash a whole-ass ship onto this Malleus Key. So I'd say dozens. You know, you kill a lot of people and you get numb to it, I guess. 
TALIESIN: There's a couple that stick with you, but yeah. 
AIMEE: Can I ask-- 
MARISHA: Does that make you think less of us, Bor'Dor? 
UTKARSH: No, no, no. I don't think less of you. I just hope that you got enough. That you took out enough. 
AIMEE: When you said you were going to get people out, who are you talking about? He's got people prisoner? Are you talking about his followers? Like he's a cult leader? What? 
TALIESIN: Oh, he's definitely a cult leader. That was a cult. I mean, I know cults. That was a cult. 
LIAM: He did have some prisoners. 
AIMEE: Or maybe you're talking about mitigating the damage that's going to be done? 
TALIESIN: Or-- 
LIAM: I don't think we know what we're even talking about yet. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, because are you trying to kill him? Are you trying to stop the gods from dying, or are you trying to stop a man whose followers believe in him? Are you trying to destroy their belief in him, or are you trying to destroy the predator? 
TALIESIN: I think-- 
UTKARSH: Pred-- 
TALIESIN: Predathos. 
UTKARSH: Predathos. 
LIAM: I don't know if we can do that. 
EMILY: When you describe him as a cult leader, it does make me think of something I've been thinking all along which is that a lot of times, wizards come up with schemes based off of faulty information. When you talk about him being a cult leader it makes me think of him believing something is true but it isn't necessarily true. 
AIMEE: Yeah, we don't know for sure that there's a god eater on this moon. Do we know that for sure? 
EMILY: The description of god eater sounds like-- 
AIMEE: Fake. 
EMILY: Someone else gave it that name. 
UTKARSH: I do know that we just saved an entire village from the wrath of god. 
TALIESIN: A god. 
AIMEE: An angel. 
UTKARSH: Angel. 
AIMEE: Not a god. 
UTKARSH: Father. The Father. 
LIAM: Ludinus is-- He's been around for-- 
TALIESIN: A long time. 
LIAM: Centuries, many centuries. When the last time we saw him-- 
UTKARSH: I'm guessing you've been around for centuries. 
LIAM: He kind of checkmated us into oblivion. 
AIMEE: You mean here? Threw you here? 
LIAM: I-- 
TALIESIN: I think that was an accident. 
LIAM: He had a plan at least six years in the making, I'm sure longer, and my friends and I, especially me, walked right into it. 
AIMEE: So he's been around for centuries, he's got this conspiracy theory, maybe, I don't know, and he believes that it's going to happen if he does A, B, and C, and people believe in him and he's been planning this for centuries, so why do we think he's any closer than he was before? 
UTKARSH: Wow! Good question! 
LIAM: Don't know. Don't know. Something-- 
MARISHA: I do feel like we maybe, we hopefully, mitigated some of his plan. 
TALIESIN: Doesn't feel like that. 
MARISHA: Neutralized it. We just don't know. 
UTKARSH: We won't know. 
TALIESIN: I got to be honest, I'm finding it harder and harder to-- I think I want to stop him, not because of what he wants to do, but because I don't know if that's the person I would like around if there's a vacuum. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: I'm not even necessarily against the vacuum at this point. 
MARISHA: I'm not sure if I am, either. 
UTKARSH: Vacuum? 
AIMEE: Godless world. 
TALIESIN: Getting rid of all of them. 
MARISHA: I think-- 
TALIESIN: Some of them. 
MARISHA: As time goes on, maybe we just need to accept that Exandria's going to change, and, to exactly the point you're making, maybe it's just about not even making a change for the better, but just not making a change for the worst? 
TALIESIN: Maybe it's just not him. 
MARISHA: It's just not him. 
AIMEE: I got to be honest, aren't you tired? 
UTKARSH: Aren't you finished fighting? 
MARISHA: We're exhausted. 
TALIESIN: Always. 
MARISHA: At least I am. 
TALIESIN: When have we not been tired? 
UTKARSH: Why not just find your friends and leave? 
MARISHA: We've thought about it. 
EMILY: I, for one, would welcome a change, given further research because, like I said, the Shadow Realm is kind of a tough place and a change for it could be good. 
AIMEE: God never did anything for me. Not one thing. 
EMILY: But I also agree with Bor'Dor, that if you want to just find your friends and relax and not feel like you have all of this on your shoulders, you also don't have to do that. It's-- 
MARISHA: The issue is just that, we just know too much now. I mean, even you talking about saving the town. I was so frustrated and angry at them, and I think it's because we can sit here and say all we want to do is try and control that which we can control in our very small sphere, but we know too much. I wish we were like the Hearthmoor. 
TALIESIN: I can't walk away with, everything that I've done has to be worth something. I can't walk away. I put too much into it now. 
UTKARSH: That sounds like a gambler's mentality. 
MARISHA: Time sunk fallacy. Yeah. 
UTKARSH: You ask me why I stare off blankly and it's because I don't know if you are strong enough to do the things that you say, and I don't want to fucking die because of you. 
TALIESIN: Might die without us. 
UTKARSH: Well, that is probably why I'm still here. 
TALIESIN: If we do nothing, people are going to die. If we do something-- 
UTKARSH: I can't promise, and I can't promise that I'll be with you when this happens. 
MARISHA: No, yeah. I don't think any sane person should. 
LIAM: I don't know how we can focus on anything other than getting back the people we lost right now. We honestly don't know what the hell happened where we were. 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We've seen things. Done things. 
LIAM: You've got to find your brother. You want to find Dariax. 
AIMEE: I'm just tired of fighting. I'm tired of running. I just want to settle down, retire my fucking weapons, my whip. Well, maybe I'll use the whip for something else. 
UTKARSH: Keep the whip. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Don't you just want to-- 
EMILY: You mean like getting your coffee in the morning? 
AIMEE: No. No, Prism. Not that. (laughter) 
UTKARSH: It's to make the toaster work. (laughter) 
UTKARSH: Sorry. 
AIMEE: Sometimes you just get tired. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Of fighting. 
UTKARSH: You have people you love. You know where they are. That's more than most. 
MARISHA: More than you? 
TALIESIN: I don't know if I'm at-- Well. 
UTKARSH: Well, I don't know where my family is, but I can say that I would choose them over anything. 
EMILY: I totally see where you're coming from, Bor'Dor, but I personally feel invigorated by this entire experience. 
AIMEE: You're young still. 
EMILY: I know, and I was going to say it's probably youthful optimism. You just are inflated with the sense that you could really make a difference, that maybe you'd be the person who read the text in the ancient tome that you stole from the restricted section that made sense of everything and then you could report it to people and everyone would have better information on which to act upon. And I have to say, I'm glad to be here. 
UTKARSH: Oh, well. 
EMILY: I don't think that'll be like putting the knife in Ludinus' back or anything like that, but I do think that I have a narrow lane that could. 
UTKARSH: I'll do it, if you put me behind it. 
EMILY: So maybe you do want a part to play after all. 
UTKARSH: If it makes the pain go away, if it ends this complication or whatever this confusion is, I'd do it. You get me next to Ludinus, I'll stab him. 
TALIESIN: I think we got-- 
LIAM: I grab the little playing card off the ground near Prism and I prop it up on a rock. That guy's got to go. 
TALIESIN: That I agree with. 
EMILY: I agree with that. I think we can all say that we have different ideas of the deities, but that guy's fucking gone. 
MARISHA: Let's get some rest. 
UTKARSH: I'll take first watch. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Do you want company, or no? 
UTKARSH: Sure! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. The rest of you find a modicum of rest after a somewhat tense evening conversation to close it out, while the two of you both stay up to keep first watch. Anything you wish to discuss before you roll perception? 
AIMEE: I feel like Deni$e wants to listen in a little bit because she's got this just a little bit of suspicion about the brother not being there. And just-- 
MATT: Do you want to roll an insight check? 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
EMILY: It was a weird scry. 
AIMEE: Yeah, I will. But I think just not like a-- Just like a-- 
MATT: No, I know. You've been listening for a bit. 
AIMEE: Just a little listen in, just in case. What'd you say? 
MATT: Insight. 
AIMEE: Nine. 
MATT: Nine. Kind of hard to read. 
AIMEE: Dang it! 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
AIMEE: She's too far. She can't hear it. 
MATT: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Over Prism's fucking snoring! 
EMILY: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Yeah, we're talking in-- 
AIMEE: (aggressive snore) 
LIAM: Wah-wah-wah-wah. 
MARISHA: In Undercommon? 
EMILY: It's a spell. It's a spell of slumber. 
UTKARSH: What we think is Undercommon. 
TALIESIN: Are you talking Undercommon? Because I don't speak Undercommon. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, I speak Undercommon. 
TALIESIN: I do not speak Undercommon. 
AIMEE: (barks) 
UTKARSH: Waka-waka-waka! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: (high-pitched noises) Wee! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure that's Muppet. 
UTKARSH: I thought it would work. I thought maybe I would know, but I don't. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: It's like heavy metal singing. 
AIMEE: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: (growls) 
UTKARSH: ♪ (nonsense syllables) ♪ No, still nothing. 
AIMEE: (babbles) 
LIAM: There it is! 
MATT: Yep. You got it. 
EMILY: That's Undercommon. 
AIMEE: (growls) 
TALIESIN: You know, it's possible your brother went for help. 
UTKARSH: How. 
TALIESIN: Do you ever go to town? Do you guys ever go-- 
UTKARSH: Rarely. 
TALIESIN: Is there anywhere you would want to go, since you're out right now? I hadn't been out from where I lived in quite a while before this-- 
UTKARSH: Anywhere I would want to go? 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
UTKARSH: No, I'm not like you. 
TALIESIN: Just like the beach. 
UTKARSH: No, I want to go back home. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) 
UTKARSH: I don't. I'm not you. I don't understand you people. Give me your pipe. 
TALIESIN: (buzzes lips) Done! I'm packing it. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Can't say no to that! 
UTKARSH: Smoke it. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
UTKARSH: With this, with my lighter, my BIC. I pull out my magical BIC. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
AIMEE: Your white BIC. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: It says, "To my favorite brother." I'm like, "Oh! You fucker!" 
UTKARSH: White BIC. Ash on the bottom. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah! Ash on the bottom! 
UTKARSH: Just dirty, stinks. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Stinks! 
MATT: I don't know if you grasped the enchantment on the pipe, right? 
UTKARSH: Well, I don't know. 
MATT: Yeah. All right. You smoke it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: Tilt shift camera, show us. 
TALIESIN: I'm so excited! So what the pipe shows, and I will pull it up so that I say it exactly right, as these things are very specific. Bless you. Where are we? There we are. It reenacts your most impressive and heroic achievement. 
UTKARSH: So what you see, what we see, is me standing in front of all of you, standing in front of a makeshift dummy doing a Fire Bolt for the first time. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: What else? Do we see anything else? Or is that the one? 
UTKARSH: Me lifting my arms up like this and feeling like I belong for the first time. 
TALIESIN: You know what? I'm taking the pipe back and smoking it, too. (inhales) It won't work anyway. It only works once a night. 
UTKARSH: That's fucked up! That's not cool. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: I thought this was a vulnerable moment for both of us. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. 
UTKARSH: Well, now-- 
TALIESIN: Honestly, I will say I think yours is better than mine. 
UTKARSH: Well, now you know that my-- I don't know what you know. I just thought you should know that. 
TALIESIN: I-- Do you know what that says to me? Actually, I will say, yeah, I do know something now. I get the feeling it's probably all uphill from here. I think a week from now that's not what's going to happen. 
UTKARSH: Oh, I thought you meant uphill, like harder and more exhausting. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that, too! 
EMILY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's fair. I didn't mean it that way, but that's also true. But yeah. I think this is the start of something, if you want it to be. It doesn't have to be. 
UTKARSH: Let's get to this Hevestro and see what he has for us, or they, see what they have for us. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I don't actually know. Wow! Do you want to roll? You roll. You roll a-- 
MATT: Roll a perception check. 
TALIESIN: Perception check. 
UTKARSH: Oh, right! For the night. 
MATT: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: For the watch. 17. 
MARISHA: Nice! 
MATT: All righty. Pretty solid view. 
UTKARSH: 19. 
MATT: Fairly protected, the evening. We'll say for the entirety of the night based on the positive rolls you've had on this journey. 
LIAM: I want to do a little thing. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: In the dead of night. 
MATT: Okay. 
AIMEE: You want to fart? 
LIAM: (fart sounds) That's my secret, Deni$e. 
TALIESIN: That's our cougar. 
LIAM: I'm always farting. 
EMILY: He had some of that beer. 
AIMEE: That's the secret. I'm always farting. (laughs) 
UTKARSH: It's me and I blame it on the cougar. 
LIAM: Damn it, Kim Cattrall! 
EMILY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Damn it! 
UTKARSH: Kim Cattrall! 
AIMEE: I love fucking! 
MARISHA: Don't blame it on Kim Cattrall. 
LIAM: Okay. 
UTKARSH: (laughs) 
LIAM: No, I don't fart. You wouldn't hear it if Orym did, anyway. He's so wee. What I do do-- 
EMILY: He's so wee! 
TALIESIN: Subsonic. 
MARISHA: Yeah, some high frequency! 
TALIESIN: Only teenagers can hear it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's right. 
UTKARSH: Pew pew! 
LIAM: -- is plant Seedling, blade down into the dirt and I will spend a minute adorning it with flowers. When I feel like everyone's out, will say: I don't know if you can hear me. I don't know if you can hear any of us anymore. I hope you can. I've heard too many stories firsthand and read too many tales to discount the good that you, many of you have done in this world. I don't know if you have anything left in you, but I'm praying. We could really use a little help down here. I know you can, too, and we'll do our best. But any miracle you can spare. I just leave it planted in the ground and go back to sleep next to them. 
MATT: I'd say the two of you keeping watch probably clock that quiet moment off to the side. 
UTKARSH: (sighs) Fucking idiot. (laughter) 
MATT: But the evening goes by from that point without issue, until eventually, the morning light comes, the warmth and hope of what may be your last day's travel to your destination before you. And with that, we're going to take a break. (cheering) 
MATT: As we're past that time. Be back here in just a few minutes. We'll see you shortly.

Break[]
(fantasy music) (mysterious music) 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. (gasp) Could anything be more perfect? Roll an investigation if you want. It's basically perfect. The cuteness! It's overpowering. Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself. Oh my gosh. It's so amazing. I mean the Traveler always says, impulse purchases are a good decision. This is a lot of stuff you guys. We have so many cool things right now. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. (adventurous music) 
TALIESIN: Knowledge of what lies beyond The Flare continues to be elusive. Glimmers of understanding lead us down branching paths with no discernible end. The mark of a strong investigator is to always question the status quo. An extraordinary investigator is one who's not afraid to question the nature that lies within them. The phenomenon which occurred in Newfaire at The Steel was the catalyst needed to test such a theory. Lightkeeper O'Neill had her concerns that the newly found circle in question could benefit from further training. But, then again, there is no sufficient preparation for the horrors that bleed into our world. Thus begins the trials of the circle known as The Vassal and the Veil. Assignment 436: The Cold Embrace. 
(dramatic music) Hi. We're the narrators of Midst. What's Midst? It's very simple. It's a weird surrealist fourth wall breaking reality bending science, fantasy space western about a small, doomed planet floating in a cosmic ocean of spooky darkness. Upon whose alien landscape an ensemble cast of characters, including a crotchety outlaw, a freakishly virtuous cultist and a weird, diabolical bastard, make awful decisions and fight like hell to survive when the moon falls out of the sky and a large number of terrible things happened in rapid succession. It's exciting, it's funny, it's scary. It's got neat sound, weird music, amazing visuals, and every episode comes with bonus content you can read and examine. Midst is performed solely by yours truly. As the three of us narrate all the action, play all of the characters, and bend a lot of the rules about how telling stories is normally supposed to work. Midst is pretty fun, very strange, and it feels like VR for your brain. We believe you'll enjoy it. Or maybe you won't, but there's really only one way to find out. You're going to have to listen to Midst.

Narrator: Holly Mistletoe thought she had it all. As you can plainly see, sales are up 7%. Narrator: But when she finds herself back in her hometown for a very special holiday. I can't believe I have to come back to my hometown, it's so provincial. (gasps) Seamus? Seamus O'Shamrock? I didn't know you still lived here. You own and operate a small, charming coffee and pastry shop? Only when I'm not raising horses. Narrator: She'll discover just how much her life was missing. Has anyone ever told you you're a really good baker? Has anyone ever told you you're more adorable than the custom emotes you can use in Critical Role's professionally moderated chat with a Twitch subscription? Happy Valentine's Day. Narrator: This holiday season, or that holiday season, or whatever holiday season it might be. What is it? Void Tech is going to foreclose on the horse ranch. They can't do that, not on the 4th of July. (fast instrumental music) With the proceeds from our wholesome Halloween haunted house, we can raise enough money to save the horse ranch from your greedy company, Mr. Fatstacks. Damn you Mistletoe. If it hadn't been for your big city business savvy, I would've been able to fool those small town provincial bumpkins! We may be provincial, but we have values. Like watching episodes of Critical Role before they go on YouTube with a Twitch subscription! Fiddle faddle! Narrator: Stand up and celebrate. Mr. Fatstacks: I eat my feelings! Ah! Narrator: Make every day a holiday. Oh, okay. Boop. No. Narrator: And give the gift of love. Is this? A subscription to Critical Role. I can gift those with my Twitch subscription to Critical Role. Yes. Narrator: Laura Bailey as Holly Mistletoe. Don't be violent, that's not romantic. Narrator: Travis Willingham is Seamus O'Shamrock, and featuring Sam Riegal as Maxamillian Fatstacks in "A Holiday Subscription for Love. The Ballad of Mistletoes and Shamrocks: Part 2." (lively orchestral music) 

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So as you wake up, gather your materials and press on for the day of travel, any preparation to do before you head out? 
UTKARSH: Stretch. 
MATT: Stretch. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MARISHA: Stretching is important. 
EMILY: Hmm. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
EMILY: Fuck it, also, I'm going to-- Oh, no, it only lasts for an hour. 
AIMEE: I'd like to do a sleight of hand on something, but I don't want to say out loud What it is. 
LIAM: Oh, sneaky. 
MARISHA: Ooh, text the GM. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Sneaky. 
MARISHA: Oh, or he'll come to you. 
AIMEE: Yeah! 
LIAM: This whisper, not brought to you by WizKids or anything. 
EMILY: But it is brought to you by WhisperKids. 
LIAM: WizKids really cool. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
AIMEE: All right. 
MATT: Okay. Roll sleight of hand for me. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
UTKARSH: One. 
AIMEE: No! It's not good, though. 
EMILY: If I know what she's doing, can I help? 
AIMEE: Do you know? 
EMILY: I feel like I know. 
TALIESIN: That's not knowing. 
MATT: Whisper to her. 
AIMEE: I can whisper to you. 
EMILY: I want to give you a help action. 
AIMEE: Although, it's not-- It's like-- wait, one sec. 
TALIESIN: Unless this is some-- 
MARISHA: Process of elimination. 
EMILY: I don't think it's on me. 
AIMEE: Should I do it again? Yeah, if she's helping me. 
EMILY: So I want to give her a help action. 
MATT: Okay. 
AIMEE: No. 
EMILY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You already have-- 
AIMEE: That's going to be 13. 
TALIESIN: Is that with the first roll, or--? 
AIMEE: That was with the first. The second one's worse. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
AIMEE: But my stealth-- I can add my stealth instead. 
LIAM: Orym is doing pull-ups with a 31 passive perception. 
EMILY and AIMEE: (laugh) 
MATT: Yeah, you see the two of them conspiring. (laughter) 
AIMEE: This was supposed to be a cute little thing, real cute, real quick. 
MARISHA: Now it turns into a thing. 
AIMEE: Now it's a thing, now everybody knows. (laughter) 
AIMEE: I'll put it back. I'll figure something else out. 
MATT: Oh, well, I mean, it's not just putting something back, there is-- Sorry, I'm checking one thing. 
AIMEE: Mm. 
LIAM: (fart sound) 
AIMEE: (fart sound) (laughter) 
AIMEE: Listen, Orym, we got to do something about your flatulence. 
TALIESIN: Stop emoting with it. 
EMILY: She wanted to sleight of hand a toot from your butt. 
TALIESIN: That should not have a personality of its own. 
LIAM: That's how I make "Metal Gear" alarm sounds. (alarm tooting) (laughter) 
AIMEE: ♪ (trumpet fanfare) ♪ 
UTKARSH: Heather Locklear lets one out. 
EMILY: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Heather Locklear. 
MATT: Oh my goodness, I'm having-- (groans) a problem with getting your-- 
AIMEE: My chart? 
TALIESIN: Ah. 
MATT: Sorry, I'm having to check with it just-- 
LIAM: Marisha, play Rollies with me. 
MATT: I know. 
MARISHA: Rollies, okay. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: My apologies. 
AIMEE: No, please. 
EMILY: I'm also writing on-- 
LIAM: I got a nine. 
MATT: When you-- 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
LIAM: Go to hell. 
MATT: When you get your Twitter hacked-- 
MARISHA: Straight to hell. Wasted natural 20. 
MATT: -- you change all your passwords and suddenly things that were easy to log into are now very challenging to have to re-log into. 
AIMEE: Marisha2. 
MATT: Indeed. 
AIMEE: Capital M. 
MATT: Not out loud! (laughter) 
MATT: Well, I've got to change them all again, thanks! (laughter) 
MATT: God. 
AIMEE: My mother-in-law has a thing on the back of her phone. I swear, this is not a joke. My mother-in-law has a thing on her phone that says, "Password: children1." 
MARISHA and UTKARSH: No way! 
EMILY: Is it deception? 
AIMEE: No, it's on the back of her phone. 
MATT: Here we go. 
MARISHA: Children1. 
AIMEE: Children1. 
UTKARSH: No! 
AIMEE: Can you believe it? 
UTKARSH: Have you told her? 
LIAM: Bank account-- 
AIMEE: Yes, now everybody knows. 
LIAM: Bank account 3201. 
MARISHA: Social Security. 
TALIESIN: Ah. Oh no. 
MATT: Now you're not loading when I finally get through all that. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Sweet. 
MATT: (sighs) So much to say. 
AIMEE: So much to say, jolly good-- 
MATT: Well. 
UTKARSH: ♪ So much to say ♪ 
MATT: But thank you. 
MARISHA: ♪ So much to do ♪ 
AIMEE: ♪ So much to see ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ So what's wrong with ♪ 
MATT: Whatever. 
MARISHA: ♪ Taking the back streets v 
MATT: Cool, thanks, phone. 
LIAM: Hack to you, Matt. (laughter) 
MATT: Nevertheless. Wait, wait, okay. (laughter) 
EMILY: I think I know the number you're looking for. 
LIAM: That's the rest of the show. 
EMILY: Matt. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's never going to love you back. 
EMILY: I think I know the number you're looking for. 
MATT: You succeed. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
AIMEE: Great. Okay. 
MATT: I was down to the wire checking, yeah, you succeed. 
AIMEE: Thank you. 
MARISHA: Well. 
AIMEE: Okay. I'm going to keep it in my pocket. 
MATT: Okay, well. So you all trek onward for this final day of travel, hopefully, depending on the roll. I need one more d20 roll. 
EMILY: Let's roll on the big one. 
AIMEE: Oh yeah. 
EMILY: Let's all three of our hands. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Our powers combined. 
MATT: I love this. 
AIMEE: Captain. 
MARISHA: That's the most awkward thing I've ever seen. 
TALIESIN: Come on, natural one. That's how you get a natural one. 
UTKARSH: Five! 
MARISHA: That's pretty low. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Good. 
MARISHA: Five. 
UTKARSH: But we all get to add-- 
LIAM: Final. 
TALIESIN: No, no, you want low-- 
MATT: Nothing. 
UTKARSH: Melee! 
TALIESIN: You want low. 
AIMEE: Why? Because you want to fight? 
LIAM: Yes. I want trouble. 
TALIESIN: If you want to, you can 
AIMEE: Me too. 
TALIESIN: This is the trouble. 
MATT: Okay, roll a d6. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
AIMEE: Yay! 
EMILY: We're doing all together again, all together again. 
MATT: There you go. 
LIAM: Got to. 
AIMEE: And-- Oh. (laughter) 
EMILY: Three! 
MATT: Three. 
TALIESIN: So that basically means-- 
MATT: Okay, got it. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Pull up the map. 
MATT: No. 
AIMEE: No, shan't! 
TALIESIN and EMILY: (laugh) 
MATT: You continue on for a number of hours, moving through the dense forest, pushing through branch and fern until eventually the tree lines come to an abrupt halt, at the edge of a wide crevasse that winds through this rocky region of the wilderness. You're uncertain how long this crevasse is from side to side as you step up to the edge of it, but the portion that you can see, you are completely surrounded across the way by trees and the treeline to your right and left before it curves slightly out of your periphery on each side. It is about 250 feet across and about 120 feet deep to its base bottom below. You do hear the rushing of water, and glancing down over the side, you can see there is a river that snakes through the bottom, drifting through. More there is also open rock and stone, but the river does carve through it, and you can see signs of long-set erosion over heavy floods and storms of the past that have continued to push this crevasse deeper and deeper. The cliff face before you is fairly sheer, resembling a massive sinkhole edge or a tectonic collapse of an older age with occasional-- 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
MATT and AIMEE: Bless you. 
LIAM: Gesund. 
MATT: -- occasional shallow-- 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
MATT: -- outcroppings that occasionally peek out of the rock walls, but the delve itself looks rather treacherous. Other thing you notice as you approach is the wind cougar that's been leading you just walks off the cliff-- 
AIMEE: (gasps) Meryl Streep! 
MATT: And just-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: Meryl! 
AIMEE: Where are you going? 
MATT: -- walks down to the bottom and sits and turns around and looks up at you expectantly. 
MARISHA: Oh, just waiting. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Oh, cool. Cool, cool, cool. 
UTKARSH: Just walks straight down? 
MATT: It's a fairly sheer cliff with some little-- 
AIMEE: You said it's 120 feet down? 
MATT: 120 feet down to its face. It's not a complete drop. 
AIMEE: No, right, right, right. 
MATT: But it's dangerous. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Huh. 
MARISHA: I look down and I go: Damn it, Charlize Theron! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: You could lower people down on that disc of yours, it might actually be-- 
EMILY: It actually can't do altitudinal changes. 
UTKARSH: Sweet. 
EMILY: It's a-- 
AIMEE: Useful! (laughter) 
EMILY: Okay, so it's this spell that you get really early on and it teaches you how particular and punishing it can be to be a wizard. 
LIAM: I love this fucking wizard. 
MATT: Yep, that one in particular. 
MARISHA: So I can help with five of us. 
TALIESIN: One, two. 
MARISHA: If someone else has something else that they might be able to do. 
EMILY: I mean-- 
AIMEE: I don't think you need to carry me. I mean, I feel like, as a mountain dwarf, I think I'm pretty handy and I can probably take care of myself if you want to take other people. 
MARISHA: We could also do it in batches. 
EMILY: I could also try to Enlarge my Mother, not my mother, Mother. I could try to Enlarge my familiar, comma Mother to perhaps bring some-- ferry some smaller-- 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
MARISHA: If you can do that, then I can handle the rest of us. 
AIMEE: Great. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, I mean. 
AIMEE: Want to hop on? 
UTKARSH: Hop on the mother. 
LIAM: I'm a little guy. 
EMILY: Yeah, I'll Enlarge Mother. 
MATT: Okay, now Mother's, you know, a nice-sized raven enlarged to about hawk size. Hawk size isn't large enough to carry-- 
EMILY: (laughs) It's nothing! 
AIMEE: Both of us! 
MARISHA: Hawk size. 
UTKARSH: Orym-- 
MATT: -- anybody. 
MATT and AIMEE: Maybe Orym. 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm Link. (whooshes) 
AIMEE and MARISHA: Yeah. 
EMILY: (laughs) Use Mother like a paraglider! 
MATT: Hey, you can certainly try. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Oh no. 
UTKARSH: Here we go! 
MATT: So as Mother sits there on the precipice of the, what you now assume, based on the trajectory of your eidolon guide is to be Irriam Canyon before you. 
UTKARSH: (gasps) 
AIMEE: Wait! 
LIAM: Irriam Canyon. That's where we were going. 
AIMEE: I got a map, though. Where is that? 
LIAM: So we're looking for blue flora. 
UTKARSH: (gasps) 
LIAM: That's the shrine. 
EMILY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, it's down in the canyon. Oh, right, and this, so it's basically-- 
UTKARSH: Well, let's just-- 
TALIESIN: Northern canyon. 
MARISHA: Irriam Canyon. 
TALIESIN: It's the shrine on the northern side of the canyon, so yeah. 
UTKARSH: The eidolon will lead us there. 
LIAM: Can't see that from here, can we? 
MATT: No, not from here. 
AIMEE: Is that in the midlands? 
EMILY: I'm going to hit Mother with a Mage Armor. 
MARISHA: They built the shrine in the northern depths of the Irriam Canyon. Is what you said. 
UTKARSH: Maybe send out Pâté to look for some blue stuff. 
MARISHA: I could do that. I mean, we still have the cougar. 
TALIESIN: Let's get down there. 
AIMEE: Yeah, let's get down there. 
TALIESIN: The cougar's going the right way. 
MARISHA: It's going the right way. 
UTKARSH: Great. 
MARISHA: All right. 
UTKARSH: Let's go! 
TALIESIN: I'm not Googling some names to fuck up my algorithm. 
AIMEE: How does it go for Orym? 
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe-- 
MATT: We're about to find out. 
AIMEE: Oh no! 
UTKARSH and EMILY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Let's see how Orym does first. 
MATT: Mother is perched up on the edge. Massive black feathers that streak on the back. 
UTKARSH: You can do it! 
MATT: The wings at the ready, the head looks around. (clicking) (croaks) 
AIMEE: (gasps) 
LIAM: You're super capable. I'm feeling good. I grab the feet. I have magical shoes, I have-- 
AIMEE: Thank god! 
LIAM: -- Boots of Springing and Striding, so I-- 
MARISHA: Get a little lift. 
LIAM: -- leap, yeah. I get a running jump with this-- 
UTKARSH: Hang glider action. 
MATT: You're using Mother as a hang glider. You're not letting her carry you. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Great, I love it. 
TALIESIN: He's getting a little velocity. 
LIAM: I'm going to try to glide to the opposite side. 
MATT: That's perfect. 
MARISHA: Wait, you're not going down? 
AIMEE: Past the river? 
TALIESIN: We're going down. 
LIAM: I'm going to go at a downward angle. You know how "Breath of the Wild" works. 
MARISHA: Right. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: So as-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: As Mother is, (wings flapping) picks up into the air, and is going to lower to try and grab Orym. Orym grabs and goes running with it. Mother immediately goes (croaking) pulls back. 
EMILY: Mother, submit, submit! 
MATT: A little thrown off the edge, they both leap off the side and plummet about 40 feet immediately-- 
AIMEE: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- as Mother is unable to capture the wind of being pulled out from under. 
LIAM: I didn't hit that button! 
MARISHA: What? (laughter) 
MATT: However, will attempt to catch herself beneath the wing. If you can roll a-- Roll an athletics check for Mother, which, unless if she doesn't have the skill, it's a straight strength check. 
LIAM: We're basically gods. 
MATT: She's Enlarged-- 
TALIESIN: Hey! 
MATT: She's Enlarged, so you get to add a d4 to the roll. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: At least one. 
MARISHA: At least one. 
EMILY: Mother! Oh wait, she makes-- I'm pretty sure Enlarged you make strength checks with advantage. 
MATT: Is that what it says? Okay. 
EMILY: Let me double check. I'm going to do it by the books. 
TALIESIN: That would be badass. 
EMILY: Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on strength checks. 
MATT: There you go, there you go. 
MARISHA: Hell yeah. 
MATT: Never mind. 
EMILY: Honey, I got a buff raven. 
AIMEE: Yes! 
EMILY: Come on, gorgeous. 
AIMEE: Not bad. 
EMILY: Okay, 18, but she has a minus two to strength, just like me. 
MATT and AIMEE: (laugh) 
EMILY: So 16. 
MATT: 16. Rapidly, wings fan out, and picks herself up, and as the wind catches underneath, you feel your hair get blown back, you feel yourself slip to the base of her talons, but hold on tight as she picks up, and for this moment, you are gliding. 
UTKARSH: (gasps) 
AIMEE: Aw. 
MATT: You are being carried through the canyon. 
UTKARSH: They're beautiful. 
MATT: This beautiful perspective as she swirls around the open space, rotating, slowly bringing you to the bottom of the canyon itself. 
LIAM: Do we see any blue flora on the way down? 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
UTKARSH: Come on. Give us a good one. 
TALIESIN: We should all probably-- 
LIAM: Oh, I rolled two ones, but as a halfling, I reroll ones. 
AIMEE: You get to roll again! (applause) 
UTKARSH: No way! 
AIMEE: Thank god. Oh, oh! 
LIAM: That's a 30. 
AIMEE: I thought that was a 20 at first. 
MATT: Jesus Christ. 
AIMEE: I was like, "Mah!" 
MARISHA: That's a Laura. 
MATT: From-- I'll put it-- Here, I'll do this. I'll say that Mother, before she takes you down, actually brings you up above the canyon a little bit. Because from being within the canyon, you only have as much a view, it's not a straight line. It curves and cracks through, so you wouldn't be able to see much within the periphery of what you have, but with a little bit of elevation, you can see a little ways to the northeast, maybe about half to three quarters of a mile from where you currently stand, you can see there's a glimmer of blue coloration within the valley. You're uncertain if it is what you're seeking, but it is the closest thing you can tell within the vicinity that may or may not be what you're looking for. 
LIAM: One single question. Does it look like it's on the opposite side of this crevasse? River? 
MATT: It looks like it's on what would be the northern side of it, yes. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to be really irritated if we all get to the bottom of this canyon, and then-- 
AIMEE: Just a couple blue flowers. 
MARISHA: Then the cougar goes, "Cool, you're here," and then goes up and goes on the opposite side of the canyon. 
UTKARSH and AIMEE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That's what I'm afraid is going to-- He made a face, he made a face. 
AIMEE: Oh boy! Listen, Laura Linney, don't fuck us. 
MARISHA: Yes, thank you. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I was trying to think of another cougar in the moment and I forgot and couldn't think of any. 
UTKARSH: (laughs) 
MATT: What are you doing? 
MARISHA: I guess we-- oh god, I guess we have to go down, right? 
TALIESIN: We do. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, you're going to take us all down, right? 
MARISHA: All right. 
AIMEE: Well, except you and me. I guess I'll just-- 
UTKARSH: No, there's five now. 
AIMEE: Oh, okay, yeah. Thank god, okay. 
EMILY: Orym had his own little journey. (laughter) 
EMILY: Which I-- 
LIAM: Whee! 
EMILY: -- wipe a little bit of sweat off my brow because that worked out. Yeah, and let's go. 
MARISHA: All right. Do you all trust me? 
UTKARSH: Yep. 
EMILY: So much. 
TALIESIN: Never. 
EMILY: I do. 
MARISHA: On the count of three, we're going to jump. Ready? 
UTKARSH: Yep. 
MARISHA: All right. You have to jump, you have to be falling. It's the only way it works. 
UTKARSH: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, ready? 
AIMEE: Do we all have to fall at the same time, or can I watch you do it first? 
UTKARSH: I think we've all got to go. 
AIMEE: All right. 
MARISHA: Just don't get without of 60 feet of me. 
EMILY: This is so thrilling. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
MARISHA: All right, ready? One. Oh yeah, let's do the death drop, that's even better. One, two, three. 
EMILY: Ha! 
MATT: So you all leap. 
MARISHA: Feather Fall. 
MATT: Great, and it's good-- 
LIAM: You all plummet. 
MATT: -- you do it quickly because the cliff wall is not-- 
AIMEE: Oh shit. 
MATT: -- directly down. It is at an angle. 
AIMEE: Oh shit! 
MATT: An issue that has transpired once in a previous campaign. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
AIMEE: Oh no! 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
MATT: Long (kisses) live the goldfish. (laughter) 
MARISHA: The goldfish lives. 
MATT: You all immediately begin to glide at an angle as the wind catches you and you are plummeting rapidly, but not at a speed in which you will probably hurt yourself upon impact. It'll be a little bit of a rough tumble or a catch yourself as you go. But as you begin to careen down, you can see the winding river that's going through. You can see the changes in the rocky basin that makes up the center of this canyon and the rather jagged footing that some of the stone provides so you all have to maneuver as best you can through the wind as you go. For the sake of it, let's do a, say a group athletics check. 
EMILY: All right. 
MATT: Athletics or acrobatics, your choice. 
TALIESIN: Come on, come on, come on. 
LIAM: Come on, Athlete. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
AIMEE: Ooh. 
EMILY: Ugh. 
AIMEE: Ay, look at that. 
EMILY: Okay. 
AIMEE: Mira, that's a 29. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: 20. 
MATT: All righty. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
UTKARSH: Three. 
MATT: Three. 
EMILY: 11. 
MATT: 11. 
MARISHA: Nine. 
LIAM: That's just right. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Squished, squish, squish. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
EMILY: I roll both my ankles. Ow, ow! (laughter) 
UTKARSH: Yeah, I for sure. 
AIMEE: (like Prism) Help, Mother! 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
LIAM: The farmer, the grad student, and the dead lady all-- 
MATT: Indeed. 
LIAM: -- eat shit. 
MATT: Five points of bludgeoning damage as you-- 
AIMEE: Oh boy! 
MATT: The three of you land onto uneven ground and sprain your ankles a little bit in the process. 
MARISHA: Ah! 
AIMEE: Yike. 
MATT: But you all are now at the bottom of the canyon and as soon as you all land, your spectral guide immediately gets back up. (growling) Turns around, and starts marching along the, what would've been the right hand side in the northeastern direction along the canyon. 
UTKARSH: Right. 
AIMEE: Right up there-- 
MARISHA: In the bottom, I know. 
AIMEE: No, Cher, don't! 
LIAM: Straight up. (laughter) 
MARISHA: No, Cher. 
MATT: But following this, a lot of the ground around the river, and in some areas where it gets a bit thinner in places, there's quite a bit of mud, quite a bit of thick, clay-like material that you walk across, your boots get stuck a bit and you have to pull your boots out of it. You can see there's sections of the stone and rock walls where singular trees have sprouted and grown over time, sit isolated amongst the rock surface. You can see all manner of small bushes and bog plants that have taken root here in the more moist-held portion of this canyon. Who is leading this trek? 
EMILY: I have two rolled ankles, so probably not me. 
AIMEE: I guess I can lead, because I-- 
LIAM: Good climber? 
AIMEE: Good climber from mountain stock. 
MATT: Okay, yeah. This terrain is not unfamiliar to your background. 
AIMEE: It's fine. 
EMILY: I may also use the wake-up call of rolling both my ankles to cast False Life on myself. 
MATT: Yes, you may. 
EMILY: Get some temp HP. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: You have some Mage Armor, some stuff like that loaded. 
EMILY: I did. I put Mage Armor on myself and on the bird. 
MATT: You got it. 
UTKARSH: On the bird. 
LIAM: Who I'm walking with, who is my height right now. 
AIMEE: Doing the dance that Pâté did on the thing. 
LIAM: They're both three feet tall. 
UTKARSH: She's taking a liking to Orym. 
TALIESIN: I love that dance. 
MATT: Continuing along, you eventually begin to hear the sound of heavier rushing water. As you curve around a bend, close to where you saw that brief little spot of blue color in the distance, there's a massive waterfall that is cascading down the southern side of this canyon, where it hits the ground and spreads out into a small pool, and it continues to flow into that river, which actually divides in two directions. It almost is carved into two different paths, and is going into both sides of the canyon where it sets, or at least it's merging with perhaps another source of water even further beyond that you have not yet seen. But you can see the water continues past the waterfall in the direction you're traveling. It has this massive, moss-covered hill settled at the base of it, and you can just see a little bit across the side of the canyon and a little further beyond it, like an oasis patch of extremely vibrant blue bushes. 
EMILY: I have Breath of the Wild brain. Can I send Dynios to see if there's anything hidden behind the waterfall? 
MARISHA: There's always something. 
TALIESIN: You always have to check behind the waterfall. It's a law. 
UTKARSH: (laughs) 
EMILY: Dynios. 
MATT: "Yes?" 
EMILY: You ready to get wet? 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
MATT: "I'm a book. That's the entire opposite of what I want at all times. What's wrong with you? No, I don't want to get wet!" 
EMILY: Come on out. Take his spectral form, and just huck it. 
MATT: "(screams)" (water splashing) 
TALIESIN: How do you not do that all the time? 
EMILY: I don't know, I guess I'm turning into a jock. (laughter) 
AIMEE: Wait, so you pulled him out of the book? 
EMILY: Well, it's manifesting it. 
AIMEE: Is it like Stefan? Are we looking at Stefan now? 
EMILY: No, it's a spectral form. 
AIMEE: From Family Matters, and he got hot? (laughter) 
MARISHA: He's been hot the whole time. 
AIMEE: Daddy. 
MARISHA: Damn. 
MATT: Oh my god. I haven't thought of Stefan in a long time. (laughter) 
MATT: As your tome returns, waterlogged and very unhappy, gliding through the air with a huff. Have you ever seen a book huff towards you? This may be, for most of you, your first time. "I regret to inform you that there is nothing behind the waterfall that I could ascertain, and now I am damp purposelessly!" 
EMILY: Okay, well, stay out and dry off because, you know, it's a nice day. 
MATT: "I'm going to, but not because you told me to." 
EMILY: Good, I like a little defiance. 
MATT: "Mm!" 
EMILY: Hmm! 
AIMEE: Hm. 
UTKARSH: How far away are we from the vibrant blue? 
MATT: Five minute walk. 
LIAM: That's a wet-ass paperback. 
EMILY: Yeah. Do you think that we just walk right towards this? 
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, let's be cautious. 
UTKARSH: Hevestro! 
TALIESIN: Well, there we go. 
AIMEE: That's Opal behavior right there. Food! 
MARISHA: What's Jodie Foster doing? 
MATT: Continuing to walk alongside the stream and the moss-covered hill in the center of the canyon area over towards where you can see the blue growth has now gathered. It's this large archway. This whole portion of the side of the northern part of the canyon wall is this vibrant, cerulean glow, almost, with very, very healthy, richly colorful plants. 
MARISHA: All right, I'm kind of with Bor'Dor. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: No. Don't. Stop. 
MARISHA: Skip over. 
AIMEE: Am I still leading the way, I guess? Can I look at my whip of warning? 
UTKARSH: I think we bounded. 
AIMEE: My whip. Anything? 
MATT: Your whip of warning. 
AIMEE: My whip of warning. 
LIAM: Whip of warning? 
AIMEE: I got a whip of warning! 
TALIESIN: Whip of warning. 
AIMEE: What? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's cool. 
AIMEE: Is it warming me up like it does? Or it is lighting up? Is it warning me of anything? 
UTKARSH: Spidey-sense? 
MATT: There's a faint warmth to its touch. 
AIMEE: Uh-oh. All right, just keep quiet. 
UTKARSH: Nobody responds when I yell? 
MATT: No response, no. 
AIMEE: Keep-- 
LIAM: What is our cougar's demeanor right now? Is it on guard? Does it seem alarmed? 
MATT: No, it's just walking. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'll keep an eye behind us. I'm going to keep looking around. This is definitely, we're walking towards it. 
AIMEE: My hand on my whip. 
MATT: You can see there's the blue bushes beyond. There's that muddy hill that sits next to the water. It has a patch of very vibrant purple and red flowers that sit upon its apex by the water. You can see there's, to the left on the cliff face, there's a heavy crack in the side of the mountain where it looks like part of the stone has either crumbled at one point and left a pile of rock and dust on the ground, and there's the beautiful, clear water that fills that portion of the river that flows through and creates that small little pool basin. 
EMILY: Can I do an investigation check to see if this is all an illusion? 
MATT: Yes, you may. 
UTKARSH: Ooh, hoo hoo hoo hoo! 
LIAM: Oh shit. 
TALIESIN: This is definitely making me anxious. 
UTKARSH: You've played before. 
LIAM: I love wizards. 
EMILY: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20. There's nothing illusory of the immediate surroundings, which brings you comfort. Something about the hill feels off. The exterior of it shimmers slightly. 
EMILY: I point that out to everyone. 
UTKARSH: The hill with the purple and red flower on it? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Pâté! 
EMILY: I don't trust it. 
MATT: "What's up?" 
MARISHA: Fly into that shimmery hill. 
AIMEE: It's like a fucking door. 
MATT: "It's not really shimmering, it's just sort of a hill." 
MARISHA: No, it's just-- Can you not see it? It's got a little bit of a glitter. 
TALIESIN: I can't see it. 
LIAM: Like dive bomb it, you mean. 
MATT: "I don't have eyes." 
MARISHA: Oh shit, I forgot you don't have eyes. 
EMILY: You can use your turn to see through him. 
MARISHA: I can. 
MATT: "I mean, I can still see. It's a part of the magic. I'm just pointing out a very specific thing. But yeah, I'll go check it out!" 
MARISHA: Go flying into the wall. 
MATT: (cracks) (flapping) Takes off over the hill. 
TALIESIN: I swear, that guy does a bit every time. I don't trust him. (laughter) 
MATT: (flapping) (small impact) Lands on the hill. 
MARISHA: Can he go through it? Try and go in it. Go in the side of the hill. 
AIMEE: Headfirst! 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Goes and-- 
EMILY: Go to the flowers. 
MATT: Glides to the flowers, drifts through the flowers. 
EMILY: Pick one. Pick one. 
MARISHA: Through the wall, Pâté. 
EMILY: Pick one and then put it behind Mother's ear. 
MATT: Tries to grab a flower. "I can't grab it, it's not really there!" 
MARISHA: All right, all right. But can you go in, behind the bush? Through the wall? 
MATT: "What, through the wall?" 
MARISHA: Yes, I've said that like three times. 
MATT: (flapping) You're gliding it to the crack in the wall, the bush? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: He glides over. You're looking through his eyes? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay, as you focus in, and you get closer to that section where the cavern rolls around, the cluster of the arch you can see, there is a cavern entrance. There is an opening that leads deep into the rock beneath and through the north side of the canyon. Getting in a quick glance, you can see, too, where it is, it's a natural opening, but it looks like it's been shaped, either carved, chiseled, or magically shaped to have a more continuous and... What's the word I'm looking for? 
UTKARSH: Cylindrical, half circle? 
TALIESIN: Intentional? 
MATT: Symmetrical, that's the word I'm looking for. Symmetrical opening. 
MARISHA: You were that close. 
MATT: There are small grooves intentionally written into the exterior of it, like there's some sort of a statement, language, or writing. 
UTKARSH: What language is it? 
EMILY: Read it, read it. 
MATT: The only one who's nearby is Pâté, so it would be-- 
MARISHA: Can I recognize it, the language? 
MATT: What languages do you know? 
MARISHA: I know Common, Shadowcant, and Undercommon. 
MATT: You cannot read this. 
MARISHA: All right. Can I recognize the origin, even though I can't read it? Does it look Dwarvish? Does it look Primordial? 
MATT: Make an arcana check. 
MARISHA: 21. 
EMILY: Gorgeous. 
MATT: Primordial. 
MARISHA: Primordial? 
MATT: You recognize the script. 
MARISHA: Which he does. All right. 
EMILY: Maybe you could try to write it down. Because you can see it, right? Maybe you can-- I put a pen and paper in your hand. 
TALIESIN: Or we could just walk right over there. Well, I figure we could just walk over there and look at it. 
EMILY: But it might say, "Be careful!" 
MARISHA: "Don't step on the flowers! 
TALIESIN: It would be kind of a dick thing to have that sign after you've already stepped on the flowers. It might be like, "Don't go inside here, because that's a bad idea." 
MARISHA: Can I do, am I able to try and-- 
AIMEE: Not in my neighborhood. 
MARISHA: Try and copy it onto the paper? Is that doable? 
TALIESIN: It just says, "Well, you done fucked up." 
MATT: You can certainly try. Looking through the vision of your-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Make a dexterity check for me. 
TALIESIN: I'm so excited. 
MARISHA: Okay, all right. This might be bad, I don't know, but we're going to try. 
TALIESIN: I really hope it is. 
MARISHA: Just a straight dex roll? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: I don't think it's going to work. Eight. 
MATT: Eight. 
TALIESIN: That's not Primordial. 
MATT: It's a bit chicken scratch, sleep sketching of someone trying to write down a dream they just had in Primordial. Then you wake up and look at it, and you're like, "This doesn't make any sense." 
LIAM: It's a Rorschach of a skull. 
AIMEE: Grilled cheese. (laughter) 
MARISHA: All right, I tried. We might just have to go up there. 
EMILY: Yeah. Yeah, we tried. 
MATT: Okay. Your weapon's burning in your grasp. It's really, really warm on your hip, Deni$e. 
AIMEE: All right, well, listen, my whip is telling me-- 
LIAM: You stressed? 
AIMEE: No! 
LIAM: What's it telling you? 
AIMEE: It's just telling me there's maybe dangers around here. 
LIAM: Your nails are amazing. 
AIMEE: Thank you, thank you. 
LIAM: I'm seeing them for the first time. 
AIMEE: Thank you very much. 
MARISHA: You're just noticing them? 
AIMEE: So I have a special thing here. 
LIAM: Well, I saw all this! 
AIMEE: Oh, wait! 
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm on Pirates of the Caribbean. (laminated paper wobbling) 
AIMEE: Laminated, baby. 
LIAM: Flowchart's out. 
AIMEE: Hold on, I have-- 
MARISHA: Laminated! 
LIAM: I noticed the flowchart. 
AIMEE: Well, oh, two-story work. Can I climb up fast? 
MATT: If you want to. What are you trying to climb? 
AIMEE: So because I'm a little confused here, so Pâté went through-- go ahead. 
MATT: So there's the canyon. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MATT: Right, where there's the river that goes through and the waterfall that's coming down. There's the hill with the flowers on it that's sitting next to the water in the center. Beyond that, there's the big crack in the other side. 
AIMEE: Yes. 
MATT: The north side of the hill, and then just beyond that, all of that, just as the chasm curves out of the way, you can see the mass of blue plant life that has encapsulated what you cannot see from your perspective, but have been told there is a cavernous entrance into the side of the canyon. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Maybe we avoid the hill, but go into the cavernous entrance with the blue flora. We were supposed to look for blue flora. That was the vibe. 
UTKARSH: It's a good sign. 
EMILY: Good. I definitely am like, maybe we're currently surrounded? 
AIMEE: I see. Well, if we're surrounded, we're already fucked. 
UTKARSH: What's our cougar's temperament? 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: Cougar's walking over towards where the blue plant life is. 
UTKARSH: Okay, I'm walking behind the cougar. 
MARISHA: I guess we could try and follow the steps of the cougar, maybe. 
TALIESIN: Eyes peeled. Is it even worth trying to stealth this? 
MARISHA: Could try. 
MATT: You're going to try and group stealth? 
TALIESIN: Pass Without a Trace. 
EMILY: Ooh, baby! 
MATT: All right. Everyone make a stealth check. 
TALIESIN: Make a stealth check, add 10. 
EMILY: Okay, gorgeous. 
AIMEE: Ooh, 27. 
EMILY: 24. 
UTKARSH: Add 10 to this? 
TALIESIN: Add 10. 
UTKARSH: 27. 
TALIESIN: Plus your stealth number. 
MARISHA: 31. 
LIAM: 28. 
UTKARSH: 29. 
MATT: Dang. 
TALIESIN: 26. 
AIMEE: Hold on. Oh! (laughs) What did I say, I was 27? I'm 38. Now. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
AIMEE: Stealthiest bitch you know. 
MATT: There you go. 
TALIESIN: Welcome to that plus 10, man. 
MATT: So as you carefully maneuver quietly across the rock and shale and mud, you follow not directly the path of your spirit guide, necessarily, but the path that is driest and less likely to make sound. Following in single file, you do so, almost catching one stumble into the nearby clay, but righting yourself as you do. As you begin to pass by the hill, you can hear, you especially, a low breathing. 
AIMEE: Shit. 
MATT: A long, drawn out (deep breath) (deep breath continues) 
LIAM: Does it sound large? 
MATT: (deep breath continues) 
EMILY: Is it the whole hill? 
MATT: (deep breath continues) 
TALIESIN: It's the bloody hill. 
MATT: (deep breath continues) 
UTKARSH: The hill with the flowers on it. 
MATT: You can barely see the hill shifting slightly. 
MARISHA: The hill is breathing. 
MATT: The hill appears to be breathing. 
AIMEE: The hills have eyes! 
MARISHA: This is the hill-- 
UTKARSH: This is where the flowers weren't real. 
MARISHA: Yes, where the flowers weren't real. 
LIAM: Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
UTKARSH: Pâté couldn't have told us that the fucking hill was breathing? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
AIMEE and MARISHA: He did what he could. 
EMILY: As we're passing by, can we try to read the Primordial? 
MARISHA: Yeah, are we close enough yet? 
MATT: You pass by the hill unnoticed. Whatever it might've been, whatever the circumstance may be, it did not notice you passing by, because you rolled really fucking high. 
UTKARSH: Fuck off, stupid hill. 
MARISHA: Dumbass hill! 
TALIESIN: Let's get to the good shit inside. 
MATT: An encounter that will never be seen. 
ALL: Aww! 
AIMEE: Wait, let's go back! 
EMILY: Can we just do it? 
AIMEE: Hill! (whip crack) 
MATT: No, no. No, no. 
MARISHA: Fuck you, hill. 
MATT: It's fun. I like it. 
TALIESIN: It'll go poorly when we try and leave. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh fuck, we forgot! 
MATT: Passing that, traversing that portion, you eventually come upon the vibrant blue growth oasis here, and it surrounds, like a massive wreath, this whole side. You can see now within the rock as you approach, too, what you thought were either glimmers of additional plants or bits of reflective water catching the sunlight, there are little cracks in the side of the mountain around this that have bits of crystal emerging, natural crystal has slowly burrowed its way through, or parts of the rock has cracked and fallen and exposed crystal lying underneath, but there are these little veins of natural, semi-opaque crystal. 
MARISHA: What color are the crystals? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: 15-- 16. 
MATT: They appear to be prismatic. 
MARISHA: Prismatic! 
AIMEE: Did you do this? 
EMILY: But I, but you, but I-- 
AIMEE: But how! (laughter) 
MATT: It could all be just a clear-- 
MARISHA: Trick of the light. 
MATT: A trick of the light, or it could be that there are some that are red. 
EMILY: It's elemental. 
MATT: Some that are purple. 
EMILY: Energies. There's fire and cold and acid, do you think? If this is primordial, it could be these have those elemental energies in them. 
TALIESIN: Let me read the label. 
EMILY and MARISHA: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Read the label. 
MATT: You approach the archway. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Being the one in the group that can read Primordial, the script reads, "Within the Verdant Tomb, we keep her spirit enduring." 
UTKARSH: Verdant. 
LIAM: Are we still in view of the hill we snuck by? Or have we moved within? 
MATT: You're still within view. 
LIAM: Okay, Orym's going to fade back in the group and stare at the hill. Since Orym heard a deep rumble, I'm going to watch it for as long as possible and see if I can figure out what the hell I heard, see if the hill shifts in any kind of discernible, living way. 
MATT: Okay. 
EMILY: It was within the view of the hill? We keep her tomb alive? 
TALIESIN: Verdant? 
MATT: Within the Verdant Tomb. 
EMILY: Within the Verdant Tomb, we keep her-- 
UTKARSH: Verdant means what, green? 
MATT: Keep her spirit enduring. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
UTKARSH: Healthy green? 
LIAM: Healthy green. 
UTKARSH: Are any of the crystals loose? 
MATT: You can go check it out, if you'd like. 
UTKARSH: I'd like to. 
MATT: Okay. You walk up to the nearest one. It's a little ways off to the side. You can see there's growth around it and a lot of these crystals have the blue plants growing vibrantly around them. So you go up to it and you feel, and it's not loose, it's embedded strongly. 
UTKARSH: Could I try and use my dagger to wedge one out? 
MATT: Sure, make a strength check for me, if you don't mind. 
MARISHA: Good call. I had the same feeling. 
UTKARSH: Wow. Ooh, it's a 20! 
AIMEE: Oh! 
MATT: Whoa, look at that! 
UTKARSH: Because my strength is a zero. (laughter) 
MATT: Fantastic. So, indeed, you get your dagger there and find a portion of the nearest crystal that looks like it either has sustained a little bit of damage from the elements, or it is the exact right wedge spot to get the dagger in. A big chunk of it cracks, hits the ground, and falls next to you. It is a beautiful, semi-opaque crystal that has some areas that are imperfect, some areas that are perfectly clear and it creates these refractions in it. As you look at it and pick it up and hold it to the light, indeed, it has a prismatic feel where the light comes through and seems to separate into different colors and different angles. As you shift and move it in your grasp, too, the colors seem to almost change from different facets. 
UTKARSH: Cool. 
EMILY: Maybe I should cast a spell through it. 
TALIESIN: Bor'Dor, can I see that for a second? 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Am I getting anything off of it? I don't know. I'm looking into it. Just seeing if there's anything. I don't know, I'm getting a-- It's not déjà vu. I don't think I've ever been in a crystal cavern before. 
MATT: No, not necessarily. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: If you want to make an arcana or history check, if you'd like. 
TALIESIN: I'll make an arcana check. Why not? Nope. 
MARISHA and AIMEE: (laugh) 
MATT: Not ringing a bell for you, necessarily. 
TALIESIN: Odd. 
EMILY: Do you mind if I do something weird? 
TALIESIN: Always. 
LIAM: Please. 
EMILY: Can I hold it to my hand and then cast Ray of Frost-- 
MATT: Sure. 
EMILY: -- into it to see if it's a elemental refractor or something. 
MATT: Sure. Yeah. 
EMILY: But I'm doing it so-- It's going to be so quiet because I'm holding it to the ground. The thing's here, so it's like the spell's going-- 
TALIESIN: The idea of you smothering a spell is really-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
AIMEE: (mouth fart) (laughter) 
MATT: Perfect. 
LIAM: Just a little queef. (blows) 
AIMEE: (blows raspberry) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
EMILY: Matthew, it's so quiet. (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh, wait. You said cold. It's a shivering queef. 
MARISHA: It is a shivering queef. 
LIAM: It's a shivering queef. 
AIMEE: The fuck is that? 
MATT: There it is. It's a-- 
AIMEE: Long story. 
MATT: It's not one of my finest moments. Forever emblazoned on the internet. 
AIMEE: I love that. 
MATT: It was-- "Quiver and shift" was what I was trying to say. 
MARISHA: He was trying to say quiver and shift and it came out-- 
EMILY: No! 
MARISHA: -- shiver and queef. (laughter) 
LIAM: Your pain is our pleasure. 
MATT: That's okay. 
MARISHA: It broke us for a long time. 
EMILY: I think it's still an eloquent mistake. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MATT: Thank you. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: There's always poetry. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Sometimes it's limerick. 
EMILY: You tried to write one poem and you said another. 
MATT: I did, I did. Pun to limerick, it's a fine line. As you concentrate and force the cantrip into the cluster of imperfect crystal-- 
EMILY: It's so quiet. 
AIMEE and MATT: (laugh) 
UTKARSH: (quiet mouth queef) 
MATT: Children. Children. 
TALIESIN: I'm fine. 
AIMEE: Children. Please. 
MARISHA, EMILY, and LIAM: (laugh) 
AIMEE: Oh, help. 
UTKARSH: What? 
LIAM: I'm sorry. I mean, I'm only a little sorry, but I am sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) It's okay. 
EMILY: I'm doing it in the name of knowledge. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You push your Ray of Frost into the crystal and where it-- (laughter) 
MATT: What? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Sorry. Okay, I'm back. 
TALIESIN: Boys! 
UTKARSH: Here we are. 
TALIESIN: Boys! 
MATT: Can you roll initiative? (laughter) 
MATT: I will teach you-- 
AIMEE: We've lost Liam. 
MATT: -- to mock me! No. 
AIMEE: We've lost him. (laughter) 
MATT: The Ray of Frost, which has a specific amount of force and intensity to it gathers within the crystal and then there's a brief moment before it (forceful shattering) refracts out, like the force of it has been divided into nine separate, smaller rays that all of a sudden fire out at different angles. I need-- 
UTKARSH: Oh shit. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
UTKARSH: You always got to be breaking my shit! Here we go. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: I need-- I'll ask you honestly. Who here would be standing within about 30 or so-- What's the range on the spell? Is it 60 feet? 
EMILY: The spell Ray of Frost is 60 feet. 
AIMEE: Oh, yeah. So all of us. 
MATT: That's all of you. I'd like everybody to make a dexterity saving throw for me, please. 
AIMEE: Remember how quiet it was, though. 
MATT: It was very quiet. (laughter) 
AIMEE: So I add the three, but what is this number? 
TALIESIN: You also might have a dex-- 
MARISHA: Ooh, nat 20. 
TALIESIN: You might have a feat. 
EMILY: You have Danger Sense. 
AIMEE: Oh, right. 
UTKARSH: 21. 
AIMEE: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: This is advantage roll for me. 
MATT: You got a one? 
LIAM: Advantage on dex saves-- 
UTKARSH: No, 21. 
MATT: 21, great. Okay. 
LIAM: -- that you can see. 
TALIESIN: Nat 20. 
LIAM: While not blinded. 
MATT: Dang. 
AIMEE: I can see this. 
MATT: Nat 20, nat 20, 21. 
LIAM: 17. 
MATT: 17. 
AIMEE: 18. 
MATT: 18. 
UTKARSH: Ah ha! 
MATT: All right. All of you just-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
MATT: -- duck out the way and it doesn't strike any of you. But a series of the points where it impacts on the rock nearby, you can see little clusters of ice that builds up where it is. Looking at it, these rays are nowhere near as strong as a singular cantrip, but it did seem to take the energy you put into it, and then scatter it and disperse it in multiple directions. 
UTKARSH: Wow. 
TALIESIN: I want one. 
AIMEE: All right. 
EMILY: This seems like a really important artifact. 
TALIESIN: I want one. 
MARISHA: It's cool, yeah. 
UTKARSH: Put it in my pocket. 
MATT: Cool. 
TALIESIN: I definitely want one. 
EMILY: Also, I'm really sorry for putting you guys in danger's way with that. I was really trying to be quiet. 
UTKARSH: Well, here's a question. 
TALIESIN: That was awesome. 
UTKARSH: That was really cool. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: If we get a bigger one, will it be more powerful? 
MARISHA: Or a bigger spell? 
EMILY: I think if you put a bigger spell in it-- 
MARISHA: Or both. 
EMILY: -- it could almost-- 
UTKARSH: Oh, the size of the rock doesn't matter, though. 
EMILY: -- amplify the number of-- 
TALIESIN: Don't know. 
EMILY: -- people that it hit. 
TALIESIN: Could be. 
TALIESIN: Maybe it would just divide it more. 
MARISHA: Could be both. 
MATT: (low rumbling) 
EMILY: Because imagine if you're-- 
MARISHA: What is that? What is that? 
MATT: The wind cougar that has been guiding you-- 
MARISHA: (relieved) Oh. It's Felicity Huffman. All right. 
MATT: Yes, Felicity Huffman-- 
AIMEE: (laughs) 
LIAM: What a pull. 
TALIESIN: Puffman! Puffman. 
MATT: There you go. (laughter) 
MATT: The spirit enters the cavern about 10 or so feet before it stops and turns around, looking at the rest of you, then bows its head. 
UTKARSH: It disappears. 
AIMEE: Oh, are you done? 
MATT: (soft blowing) The wind form dissipates and scatters. 
UTKARSH: Wind-ona Ryder. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Pretty good, right? 
AIMEE: Bye, J.Lo. 
MARISHA: (laughing) Wind-ona Ryder. 
AIMEE: Thank you for your service. 
EMILY: Bye, J.Lo in "Hustlers." 
LIAM: Get them all out. Hannah Waddingham. Get them all out. Get them all out. (laughter) 
MATT: Having completed its task-- 
TALIESIN: Punningham. 
MATT: -- it returns to wherever the elements carry it. 
AIMEE: (sighs) 
LIAM: Did I perceive anything about the hill before we all dodged the shivering queef? 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) Roll a perception check for me. 
TALIESIN: I had just gotten it out of my system. 
LIAM: Oh, I roll low. It's a 20. 
MATT: It's a 20? Okay. "Low." You swear, at one moment, you watch the entire hill shift about a foot in one direction. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You saw a couple things splash on the edge of the water. 
AIMEE: Hmm. 
MATT: So you definitely get the sense that the hill is something. 
LIAM: Okay. 
EMILY: I feel like you should take some of this, right? Because you could throw it into the middle of the battle and then shoot just one Eldritch Blast and it would refract to a bunch of people. 
MARISHA: I love that idea. Are there any more crystals that seem loose-- 
TALIESIN: I want to fuck with this shit so bad. 
MARISHA: -- on the floor? 
MATT: Loose? No. There's the one that Bor'Dor has. But you have to try and remove any others that may be present. 
UTKARSH: How big is the one that I have? 
MATT: It's about maybe the size of a golf ball. 
MARISHA: Would you want to try and dislodge another one? 
UTKARSH: I could, or we could just break this one, right? 
TALIESIN: No, no, no, that one's perfect. 
LIAM: It refracts light, you said? Colors as it spins? 
MATT: Yeah, in the light, you can see it-- It creates almost a technicolor disco ball. 
LIAM: Okay. 
UTKARSH: You got a-- 
TALIESIN: If we see any reasonable looking ones, we'll take. 
UTKARSH: Who's got an axe? 
AIMEE: I got an axe. I got an axe. I got my stone cutter's tools. 
TALIESIN: You do not! 
UTKARSH: Oh, you have stone cutter's tools. 
AIMEE: Oh, yeah. Got it all. 
LIAM: Let me ax you something. 
AIMEE: But I don't know if we should be stealing from this fucking place, that's all. 
TALIESIN: I mean, it's a mine. Is it really-- Yeah, okay, that's fair. On the way out, maybe. 
EMILY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: On the way out. 
EMILY: "Within the Verdant Tomb--" 
UTKARSH: But aren't we going in to teleport to another place? 
EMILY: "-- we keep her spirit enduring." 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll have time to-- We don't know what we're going to see. 
LIAM: We're here to find the Hierophant and-- Right? That's the term, right? 
AIMEE: How do we find the Hierophant? 
LIAM: We don't know. 
TALIESIN: Down. 
MARISHA: The Hierophant of the inward tree. 
AIMEE: Emerald. No. 
UTKARSH: Let's go. 
MATT: Emerald Tree. 
MARISHA: Emerald? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: But the eidolon delivered us and just said-- It's bid adieu. 
AIMEE: Oh, wait, there's a shrine in the rock we have to find, right? Or is this the shrine in the rock? 
TALIESIN: This is the shrine. 
AIMEE: This is the shrine? 
UTKARSH: For sure. 
AIMEE: You all want to steal fucking shit from a shrine? 
UTKARSH: Well, too late. 
MARISHA: It wouldn't be the first time. 
LIAM: Are we at a dead end or does it-- 
TALIESIN: I've done worse. 
LIAM: -- continue on. 
MATT: Oh, the cavern continues inward. You're all standing at essentially the entry. 
AIMEE: I think we should keep going in. 
LIAM: Okay. 
EMILY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I agree. 
UTKARSH: Let's do it. 
AIMEE: I have darkvision. 
MATT: All right, what is the marching order here? If you don't mind me asking. 
MARISHA: Ooh, the marching order. 
UTKARSH: What's that mean? 
TALIESIN: Anyone have light? 
EMILY: I would love to be in the middle. I have light. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
UTKARSH: I'll go first. 
TALIESIN: Oh, oh, are you sure? 
LIAM: What does that mean for you? 
AIMEE: I have darkvision. 
UTKARSH: I think I'm okay. 
EMILY: Look, our little friends are here! 
MARISHA: Bor'Dor said he wants to go first. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MARISHA: Let him go first. 
LIAM: Well, I think the darkvision dwarf should be-- 
UTKARSH: I'm tired of going in the back. 
EMILY: I also have light to provide. 
UTKARSH: I want to go first. 
MATT: Fair enough. 
AIMEE: Okay. Yeah, sure, you can go first. 
UTKARSH: Maybe bad for character development. 
AIMEE: I'll go second. 
MARISHA: Yeah, go right behind. 
EMILY: Can I put my hands-- 
TALIESIN: Put the squishies in the middle and I'll be-- 
EMILY: -- in front of the Bor'Dor? 
TALIESIN: I'll be last. That way, we can put you in the middle of the-- Let's break it up. 
MATT: Doesn't have to be single file, either. 
TALIESIN: Paperclip in. 
MARISHA: Maybe you can go shoulder to shoulder. 
LIAM: I'll go in front of you and I'll listen. 
UTKARSH: Are those our real people? 
LIAM: I'll listen hard. 
EMILY: I don't know yet. 
AIMEE: I'll go shoulder to shoulder with Bor'Dor. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'll go shoulder to shoulder with Orym. 
AIMEE: Shur-dur to shur-dur. 
MARISHA: Shur-dur to shur-dur. 
TALIESIN: I'll take up the back. 
LIAM: I'll walk beneath Ashton. 
MATT: Oh, you're going shoulder to shoulder with Orym, you said? 
LIAM: Shur-dur to shur-dur. 
TALIESIN: Shur-dur to shur-dur. 
MARISHA: No, this works. 
UTKARSH: Shoulder to shoulder. 
TALIESIN: Shur-dur to shur-dur. 
AIMEE: ♪ Step by step ♪ 
UTKARSH: You look like Captain Marvel. 
AIMEE: So-- 
EMILY: Where am I? I should be in the middle. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
EMILY: I'm so weak. 
AIMEE: Yeah, you should be in the middle. 
TALIESIN: I can see the little purple beret. 
LIAM: I know that Deni$e can see well in here. I can see okay because of the light the Prism's casting. So I'm going to be listening hard for problems. 
MATT: Okay. You got it. 
AIMEE: Do we see anything? 
UTKARSH: I wonder if I can-- Oh, you're right, we should look. 
TALIESIN: We're also still under-- Yeah, that stealth is an hour, so we should still be fine. 
AIMEE: Oh. Good. Gorgeous. 
MATT: Indeed. So, no more than 30 feet or so within this dark cavern interior, as your light fills the space, the width of this tunnel opens up from the 10, 15 foot wide entry arch that you stepped through to a 40 foot wide central chamber that has branching tunnels and alcoves that reveal themselves as the light catches them. You can see there are signs of living quarters for one or more individuals. There's wooden furniture and stump stools that are set up in the spaces that have been carved into organic shapes. There are hemp rope lines that are run across the interior of these chambers that hang tools and decor. Some that looks handmade, some that was procured from finer distant locales that almost stand out as unique against this somewhat homey and natural living. But it looks like this is a center of a small community or is built to sustain and host a number of individuals, at least. 
EMILY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Signs of any life? 
MATT: You don't see any signs of life, necessarily. You do see there are beautiful exposed geodes of multicolor crystal that emerge from breaks in the cold stone like they did in the exterior. These veins run throughout all aspects of the rock and as your light catches it once again, gives this beautiful, almost interior disco light feel to the chamber-- 
UTKARSH: Wow. 
MATT: -- as you move through. 
UTKARSH: You sure you don't want to (pop) break one off? 
AIMEE: No. 
UTKARSH: Just a quick chisel? 
AIMEE: No. It belongs to them. 
LIAM: Just to follow up on Ashton's question, everything looks relatively tidy? There's no half-eaten plate of food that is just left? 
TALIESIN: No Crocatoan? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LIAM: Ooh! 12. 
MATT: Oh. 
LIAM: Can't see in here. Rolled two twos. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I don't know shit. 
MATT: Yeah, it's tough. The only thing you do see that's any sort of sign, is you do see two stone fire pits that sit towards the front and then towards the back of this common area. They're blackened with soot and signs of old fire. But you're uncertain how long it's been since they've been lit or used. 
LIAM: Okay. 
UTKARSH: Any odor? Any smell? 
MATT: Any smell in here? Make a perception check for me. 
UTKARSH: 16. Plus-- Wait for it. 18. 
MATT: 18, okay. Smelling around, you smell-- 
UTKARSH: (sniffs) 
MATT: -- a very mineral heavy interior. Bits of old smoke that sits within the chamber. Nothing terribly recent, but definitely it feels like there have been fires in here many, many times and it permeates the atmosphere in the proximity of these fire pits. 
AIMEE: As a dwarf, do I sense that other dwarves live here? Does it feel dwarven? 
MATT: None of this feels dwarven. Most of the caverns here are either natural or have been magically carved. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
MATT: Other than the entryway to these little alcoves and offshoots, which do have a fairly circle or oval shape to them. It looks intentional. Most of the caverns themselves feel natural or natural formed. 
AIMEE: I see. Gotcha. 
MATT: Furniture and living spaces have been built into them. But yeah, no signs of people. 
EMILY: Maybe we should write on a piece of paper. I mean, something better than, we come in peace. Because if we are entering a village, maybe sneaking in might be-- 
UTKARSH: Why don't we just say hello? 
EMILY: Okay, I'm into just saying hello. 
LIAM: So in, what was it? Primordial, right? 
EMILY: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's the idea? 
EMILY: Yeah, do you think-- 
UTKARSH: Oh, in Primordial. 
EMILY: You could. 
MARISHA: Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
EMILY: Just in case, so we don't, you know? 
TALIESIN: We haven't seen anybody. 
EMILY: I know, that's true, yeah. 
UTKARSH: What if they're watching us? What if they're invisible, like--? 
EMILY: Like I can do? 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You said there are branching chambers. 
MATT: Indeed, there's a number of ones off to the side. 
AIMEE: One main. 
MARISHA: There's a main one? 
MATT: The cavern goes deeper on the far end of it. You can see there's a descending cavern about 15 feet wide from side to side. 
EMILY: Should we dip back into one of these common areas just to see? 
AIMEE: Well, I feel like if we're looking for a shrine-- But maybe my definition of a shrine is off. But wouldn't it be a place that has something to enshrine? 
UTKARSH: Deity. 
EMILY: Part of me is wondering if that hill was the Verdant Tomb in which they keep her spirit enduring. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
AIMEE: Well, maybe we just keep going down. 
TALIESIN: Either down or to the left or right into the small little pockets? 
MATT: So there's the main common area here, and there's-- Now that you go through and count, there are six different alcoves that look to have ropes with curtains that could close them off if you wanted to, they're left open. You can see there's beds, there's sitting arrangements, simple bits of furniture. You can see some simple tables around here. It looks like a rugged common area. 
LIAM: So the offshoots you're describing are like it's an irregularly shaped cavern and pockets once we go poking into-- 
MATT: Yeah, little small chambers. 
TALIESIN: Monastery bedrooms. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MATT: It feels like that. 
MARISHA: Let's just keep walking. 
AIMEE: Yeah, I say we keep going. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's-- 
UTKARSH: Any sound? Voices? Chanting, perhaps. 
EMILY: A trickle of water. 
MATT: Let me bring it into a darker interior vibe as well, to match the-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm not going to go into any of them, but I'm going to poke my head into one since we're here. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Just nothing? 
UTKARSH: Are our footsteps-- 
TALIESIN: I'm not crossing the threshold or anything. 
MATT: Right. Glancing inside, you can see the bedding, the quarters in each of these chambers looks untouched, like it's been set and made and has likely been like that for a bit. There aren't signs of it being recently or suddenly messed with. 
TALIESIN: Is there a bit of dust? Not a thick layer, but a-- 
AIMEE: Yeah. Deni$e will run her hand on the wall and see how long has that dust been there? 
MATT: I mean, the wall has quite a bit of dust on it. 
AIMEE: Well, maybe one of the furniture. 
MATT: It's more, I'd say there's dust and soot. 
AIMEE: Soot. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: But if you want to roll an investigation check you can ascertain-- 
AIMEE: Yes. 
UTKARSH: I wonder if they got shunted. 
MATT: -- some more details. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Could be. 
AIMEE: Fuck that, too! 
EMILY: All of them got shunted? 
TALIESIN: That's not the craziest theory. 
EMILY: Right? Especially because this is clearly a-- 
AIMEE: It was a two. No, that's trash. Sorry. 
EMILY: Oh, okay. 
MATT: Yeah. No. I mean, there's dust and there's soot. 
AIMEE: I love how I didn't say anything. I was just like, "No." 
UTKARSH: (laughs) 
MATT: You check it and go-- 
AIMEE: Anyway. 
MATT: There's dust and soot. 
AIMEE: There's dust and there's soot. 
UTKARSH: I'm going to just say: Hello? Is anyone here? Oh, maybe you should translate. Ashton, do you mind? 
TALIESIN: Honestly, we should keep it down for now. If they see us, they'll let us know. They either already know we're here or we're nice and quiet. 
MARISHA: I don't know. I'm kind of with Bor'Dor. 
TALIESIN: In Primordial, I say, not loudly, but: Hello? If anyone cares, we're fucking here. Hi. 
EMILY: Oh, Primordial curse words! 
UTKARSH: I like that tone. That sounded very friendly. 
MARISHA, EMILY, and AIMEE: (laugh) 
MATT: No response. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
UTKARSH: Is it loud? Is it an echo chamber? What's happening? 
MATT: With enough volume, a bit of an echo begins to pick up. Yeah. 
EMILY: Let's just keep going deeper. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Let's keep going. 
AIMEE: Yeah, I say we see if we can hit the end of this place. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, let's go. 
TALIESIN: I'm bad at this, too. I'm going to do a quick check for traps. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: On the cavern going down. I'm not the person to do this, but our normal person is not available. I got to do my fucking best. 
UTKARSH: How do you check for traps? 
EMILY: I'll shine a light on it. 
UTKARSH: Perception? 
AIMEE: Also, so the 60 feet-- 
TALIESIN: Thank you for the light. 
LIAM: Yeah. Investigation. 
UTKARSH: Investigation. 
TALIESIN: My investigation is crap. 
AIMEE: Mine too. 
EMILY: Oh! I have good investigation. 
TALIESIN: You want to help? 
EMILY: Yes! 
TALIESIN: All right. I will give you advantage. 
EMILY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Hold the light. 
EMILY: Okay! 
TALIESIN: This is normally what you choose. We're looking for wires, pressure points, or-- 
EMILY: Yeah, because I haven't looked for traps before. Okay, I see. Oh, I see. 
TALIESIN: Anything that looks off-color. 
EMILY: Okay. Looking for that. That is 22. 
UTKARSH: Yay! 
MATT: 22! Glancing around here, you do not see any signs of any wires or set traps, pressure plates, any hidden glyphs that catch your eye. You do see signs of footprints. 
AIMEE: Footprints. 
MATT and EMILY: Footprints! 
TALIESIN: Going down and not up, or going up and not-- 
MATT: Both. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
LIAM: Shoe and boot? 
TALIESIN: Someone had feet. 
MATT: Bootless. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: Bootless! 
MATT: Bootless humanoid feet. 
EMILY: This feels like a barefoot crowd. 
UTKARSH: These people are above us. 
MATT: With a 22 investigation, likely elven or half-elven. 
AIMEE and LIAM: Mm. 
TALIESIN: Oh, look at that! 
EMILY: This is going to sound creepy, but this is elven or half-elf feet. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
AIMEE: You got a foot fetish? 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT, MARISHA, and AIMEE: (laugh) 
EMILY: Don't read into it, but I know for fact. 
AIMEE: You've been on wikiFeet? 
TALIESIN: It's too late. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Already gone into it. 
EMILY: Don't read that. No one extrapolate anything from this, but I know that-- 
LIAM: Work it into the lore. 
MATT: Exactly! 
EMILY: (laughs) 
AIMEE: wikiFeet? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
UTKARSH: So there. 
AIMEE: Deni$e got a five out of five on wikiFeet. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
UTKARSH: Elven. Half-elven. 
EMILY: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Wow! 
EMILY: Okay. I say we just follow it. Go deeper. 
UTKARSH and AIMEE: Yeah. 
EMILY: Let's follow these feet. 
TALIESIN: Follow the feet? 
UTKARSH: So now, in elvish then-- 
TALIESIN: Elven. 
UTKARSH: Elven? Elvish is the language, though? 
MATT: Either or. 
UTKARSH: I'm going to say: Hello? I'm here with my friends. I'm one of you. We mean you no harm. Have a good day. 
MATT: It echoes through the chamber, both beyond and back-- 
AIMEE: You know what I think will help too, if you say the street you were born on. 
EMILY: Oh yeah. Why don't you tell them-- 
UTKARSH: The street that I was born on? 
AIMEE: Yeah. Go ahead. Say it real quick. 
UTKARSH: I'm from Cyrios Mountains. 
AIMEE: Yeah, but what street? 
UTKARSH: What street? It's a mountain! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
AIMEE: But what street on the mountain? 
UTKARSH: What are you talking about? 
AIMEE: What's the mailing code? 
UTKARSH: What? 
EMILY: What's your brother's name? 
UTKARSH: Jesper. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
EMILY: Jesper. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
UTKARSH: So I yell into it: I'm from the Cyrios Mountains, the third dirt road next to the pine tree. 
EMILY and MARISHA: (laugh) 
UTKARSH: No idea. Are there pine trees in the Cyrios Mountains? 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
MATT: Yeah. 
UTKARSH: By the third pine tree. 
MATT: It echoes throughout, until eventually there's silence once more in the cavern. No response. 
LIAM: WiccanFeet. The joke was WiccanFeet. 
EMILY: WiccanFeet! 
UTKARSH: WiccanFeet? 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: How much further this cavern goes? 
EMILY: Yeah. Let's keep descending. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We'll pick up that thread a little later. Yeah. 
UTKARSH: I thought it was a good idea! 
EMILY: I thought it was good. 
AIMEE: Yeah! 
EMILY: I thought you did the-- 
UTKARSH: I probably scared them off, talking about streets. 
EMILY, MARISHA and AIMEE: (laugh) 
AIMEE: The coordinates. 
MATT: The cavern descends ever so slightly. The moisture on the interior of the walls giving a glistening texture, occasionally broken by the crystals that push through. Along this way, you can see now there are almost flower boxes built into the sides of the walkway that you go through and within them there is soil and there are vibrant blue plants suffusing the space within. 
EMILY: That's good. We like that. Plants that grow without sunlight. 
TALIESIN: Some of the same fauna that we saw outside? 
MATT: Indeed. You can see now within this area, there are almost bands of metal that are pressed now into the stone cavern itself with intent. Within them, you can see it's partially support and also partially decor. There is a faint light that is now beginning to lowly light the descent below where you can see the floor begins to open up and the ceiling begins to widen out into an interior, a further interior chamber. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy! 
MARISHA: Let's keep going. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
EMILY: I say just keep going. 
UTKARSH: Yeah, just keep it moving. 
TALIESIN: Eyes peeled. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I got a bad feeling. 
EMILY: We could all do back to back. 
TALIESIN: How's your whip? 
AIMEE: How's that whip? 
UTKARSH: Oh! 
MATT: It's a little warm to your touch. 
AIMEE: She's warm. 
MATT: As you all begin to step down, that faint green light that fills the space becomes brighter and brighter. Eventually, the ceiling begins to level out and you can see there is a beautiful, majestic chamber before you where a central platform climbs in natural steps of mineral and rock shaped over eons of a faint sound of water that is running down the walls from above. You can see they're reflecting light from multitude of crystals that now fill the walls of this chamber. Some of them clear, some of them clouded, and you can see the lines of water that run through and between them, that drip, drip, drip and form this small pool in the center. The apex of this climbing mass of stone steps rises up to what you can see is a glowing green obelisk, a 12-foot or so monolithic crystal that comes to a pointed apex. 
UTKARSH: Emerald. 
MATT: It is giving off a dull green glow that just fills the chamber. It looks like it's shaded or obscured towards its center. Looks smooth, like it's been either carved or set or it has formed in a way that gives it a refined or a cut aesthetic. There are markings on the walls that resemble glyphs, ritual markings, recently set, drawings and inscriptions across the stone where the crystal isn't occupying. You can see along the center of some of that rising platform, there are all manner of drawings that you recognize as reminiscent of ritualistic markers, grooves and shapes and glyphs that are used to channel and power magical energies. This chamber, indeed, is a shrine as well as something that has been prepared for some sort of an event, prepared for some sort of magical moment. 
LIAM: You said the obelisk was faded or obscured somehow in the middle? How do you-- 
MATT: It is glowing, but the deeper you look in towards it, it's just dark-- 
LIAM: Inside? 
MATT: -- like the exterior of it is giving out light, but there's a shadow towards core. 
EMILY: I wonder if this is going to be-- I mean, I might as well try and cast Identify on this obelisk. 
UTKARSH: Yeah. 
EMILY: I don't know that it will net anything. 
TALIESIN: Any of this Primordial, or it's all glyph? Look and see. 
MATT: You don't see any language. These are just runes and glyphs and bits of magical inscription. 
EMILY: I'm just feeling a mirror between this crystal that disperses magic and then the idea of dispersing the concentrated magic of the gods. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's something about-- Does this have a residuum vibe? 
MATT: Make an arcana check. 
TALIESIN: Because I've seen residuum. 
MATT: You have. It gives you a similar vibe. Yeah. 
UTKARSH: 18. 
TALIESIN: Here's a fun arcana check. Here we go. I never even looked at this one. 15! 
MATT: 15. It does look very much like residuum. 
TALIESIN: Huh! 
EMILY: What is residuum? 
AIMEE: Oh yeah. 
EMILY: What does that do? 
TALIESIN: It's a-- 
AIMEE: Like a power-- 
TALIESIN: It's a magic amplifier. 
AIMEE: It's power? Yeah. 
UTKARSH: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Can I remember this? 
MARISHA: Was there a caveat to that, though? 
TALIESIN: The asshole said-- 
MARISHA: It looks like residuum, but. 
MATT: Well, residuum is processed. 
AIMEE: Yeah. 
MATT: This looks natural. 
AIMEE: Would that be something Deni$e would've traded or stolen? 
MATT: Oh yeah! 
AIMEE: In her day? 
MATT: Oh yeah. Well, you may have heard of it. If it came across, it was very small amounts. 
AIMEE: Okay. 
MATT: It is-- 
AIMEE: This is an enormous amount. 
LIAM: Pricey on the black market. 
MATT and AIMEE: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: The asshole in the castle said it can be used instead of material components. Yeah. I do remember that. Yeah. 
EMILY: Oh my goodness! I mean, this can't just be for powering a teleportation. This seems to be that we've stumbled on something else. 
MARISHA: I'm just assuming if this is what they refer to as the Emerald Tree. 
EMILY: Yes. 
UTKARSH: Mm-hmm. 
EMILY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Are there any other entrances, exits here? Is there anyone else present? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TALIESIN: Does this feel a tomb? 
LIAM: 24. 
MATT: 24. You glance around the walls of the chamber and you see the same ritual markings and you can see candles that have been set up that have since expired the flames or they've melted entirely with wax drippings down the sides of the walls. You can see bits of herbs and natural offerings that have been arranged and set in specific patterns as part of this setup. You don't see anybody necessarily in the chamber. Not approaching closely, but looking up at the crystal, that shadowed space in the crystal almost-- 
UTKARSH: It's not blood. 
MATT: -- looks like an empty space where a body would be or the outline of a person. 
UTKARSH: What? 
AIMEE: Oh, maybe that's our-- 
MATT: You glance up in the ceiling where you can see the crystals all rising, and amongst the cluster of crystals, you swear you see a face. 
UTKARSH: What? 
MATT: Right as you meet its eyes, it smiles. 
TALIESIN: Fuck me! 
MATT: And that's where we're going to end the episode. 
ALL: (screaming) No! 
AIMEE: What? 
UTKARSH: You're joking! 
MATT: Nope. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: We'll pick up there next time. 
TALIESIN: Ugh! I fucking knew it! 
AIMEE: It's still early! 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: It's really not. 
MATT and EMILY: (laugh) 
AIMEE: We've only been playing 25 minutes! 
MATT: (laughs) 
AIMEE: Oh no! 
LIAM: Laudna's jaeger pilot is dying from allergies. 
UTKARSH: No! 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: I know. 
AIMEE, UTKARSH, and EMILY: Aww! 
AIMEE: Buddy! 
EMILY, MATT, and AIMEE: (laugh) 
MATT: But we shall-- 
TALIESIN: I fucking knew it! 
AIMEE: No! 
MATT: -- pick up from there next time. 
UTKARSH: Sorry, guys! 
MARISHA: We keep her spirit enduring. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So it feels like she might be in there, whoever she is. 
EMILY: Maybe she doesn't even want to be in there. 
TALIESIN: She's licking a bloody, fucking magical popsicle in the center of that goddamn room. There's just nothing but residuum. It's a giant battery. It's a giant magic battery. 
MARISHA: But Hevestro was the keeper of the shrine. So maybe Hevestro is the one in the ceiling? 
TALIESIN: Could be, or it's possible we've been set up. 
EMILY: Yeah, I'm starting to-- 
UTKARSH: Why would Abaddina set us up? 
EMILY: But then, she all of a sudden was like-- 
AIMEE: That bitch! 
EMILY: All of a sudden, she was like, "Mm, you can call me Joan," at the end. What's that about? 
AIMEE: I don't know, but I slept next to her all night! 
EMILY: (laughs) 
MATT: That's when I immediately mistrust somebody is when they give me their name. 
AIMEE: Yeah! (laughs) 
AIMEE: Call me Joan. Yeah, right. No one's named Joan! 
EMILY: Call me Joan? Okay, you can call me mistrusting. 
AIMEE: Okay, weirdo! 
TALIESIN: If you say so, "Matt." 
LIAM: Whatever, Emily! 
MATT: You finally figured it out after all these years, Taliesin. 
TALIESIN: After all these years. 
MATT: Oh man! Well, we'll pick up from that fun little image next time. 
MARISHA: It's possible we were fucking played! 
MATT: It's possible. But we'll find out next time. 
TALIESIN: Something happened. 
MATT: Thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? 
LIAM: No! 
MATT: Good night. 
AIMEE: No, it's not!
