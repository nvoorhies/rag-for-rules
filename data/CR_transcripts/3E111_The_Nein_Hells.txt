Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (random noises) 
MATT: Melting internally and outside. Before we jump into our session tonight, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with our sponsor of the evening, "Assassin's Creed Shadows." Sam. 
SAM: The ultimate feudal Japan video game experience, "Assassin's Creed Shadows" immerses you in 1579 Japan with the country on a brutal path to unification, driven by the iron will of Daimyo Oda Nobunaga. 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: Something just hit me. 
LAURA: What is that? 
SAM: It's some sort of a-- I don't know what it is. Oh, and they've made it so hard to open, so I'm just going to fake that I opened it. (laughter) Oh no, it says, (laughter) oh, oh, okay. (sighs) 
LAURA: Is it double-knotted? 
SAM: I can't get it. 
LAURA: Let me see. 
ASHLEY: There we go. There we go. There we go. You got it. 
ROBBIE: Yay! 
MARISHA: It wasn't that hard. You're just weak. 
LIAM: For fuck's sake. 
ROBBIE: Oh perfect, How many of them are there? 
SAM: I don't know. 
ROBBIE: Keep going. 
MARISHA: Oh, what? 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Is it just paper? 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
ROBBIE: A Matryoshka note. 
SAM: Okay. Okay, I got it. "Assassin's Creed Shadows" lets you live in the intertwined stories of Naoe, an adept shinobi assassin, and Yasuke, the African samurai of historical legend. 
MATT: Sam, you seem strangely nervous suddenly. 
SAM: No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
MATT: What did that note say? 
SAM: It says that there is a hidden shinobi warrior watching from the shadows who will assassinate me if I fail this assignment of advertising. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I think you already failed it. 
MATT: I don't think that's how this works. It's probably a prank from the crew. Just ignore it, it's fine. 
SAM: Yeah, it's just a prank. It's a prank, okay. "Assassin's Creed Shadows" offers a unique dual fantasy gameplay. I can't do this, Matt! What if it's real? What if there's an assassin hidden in the shadows? 
MATT: I'll read it! I'll read it, you big fucking baby. (laughter) 
MATT: (sighs) "Assassin's Creed Shadows" offers unique dual fantasy gameplay allowing players to switch between Naoe, the samurai, and Yasuke, the shinobi, wait, sorry. It's actually Naoe, the shinobi, and Yasuke, the samurai. See, I made a mistake, and it's totally-- [blow dart] 
ROBBIE: Oh! Oh! (laughs) (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh. Oh my god. 
LAURA: Yeah, no! 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
SAM: It's real! It's real! 
TRAVIS: No. No, it's not. No, Matt is just messing with you, Riegel. Here, here, I'll do it. Naoe is a quick-witted shinobi assassin who uses noise, light, and shadows to evade her enemies. 
MARISHA: Wait, what are you doing? Why are doing this? What the fuck? 
TRAVIS: Well, no, it's just in case, you know? 
MARISHA: Jesus, god damn-- Oh. [blow dart] 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
SAM: See that? (laughter) 
ROBBIE: This is horrible. 
LAURA: Marisha! 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, well, Yasuke uses his shocking power and precision to destroy the will of Japan's suppressors. Robbie, you read it! I don't want to get-- [blow dart] 
ROBBIE: What? 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
SAM: He got got a dart! 
ROBBIE: Me!? I don't even work here! 
SAM: Well, don't do it, Robbie. Don't do it! 
ROBBIE: All right, I'll-- Gah! [blow dart] 
SAM: Oh no! 
ASHLEY: Robbie! 
SAM: Oh no! 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: Oh no, quick, other side of the table. Run! Get out of here! [so many blow darts] 
ASHLEY: Oh no, oh no! Oh! 
LAURA: Augh! 
SAM: Oh no! Laura's fell out, and she still got darted. Fine, by my honor, I will finish the ad myself. Get ready to explore the vast world of "Assassin's Creed Shadows." To learn more, check out assassinscreed.com/shadows. Woo! I lived. Perhaps I survived because the shinobi was me all along! (laughs) Matt, back to you. And scene. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: (sighs) 
SAM: This is my dart gun. 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Wow. That's so crazy we didn't notice you doing at all. 
SAM: Because I'm a shinobi. 
ROBBIE: That's amazing. 
ASHLEY: Wow, wow, wow. 
LAURA: You are, really are. 
ROBBIE: Amazing, 
SAM: I move in the shadows. 
ROBBIE: We saw you the whole time. 
SAM: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Oh! (laughs) 
TALIESIN: These darts are really sharp. 
ROBBIE: Actually, it is kind of sharp. 
MATT: Yeah, a little sharp. 
MARISHA: Max Schapiro will fix it in post. 
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, "Assassin's Creed Shadows." 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Marisha, you got some announcements? 
MARISHA: Oh yeah! 
LAURA: Darts look like little carrots. 
MARISHA: Oh boy. Narrative Telephone is back, baby! 
MATT: Yeah. (cheering) 
MARISHA: Back by popular demand. Beacon members can watch the first episode of this monthly series right now. 
TRAVIS: Oh man. 
MARISHA: As Matt tells our very first story this go around. The rest of us, we try our best. 
LIAM: Very naughty. 
TALIESIN: Mh-hmm. 
MATT: It's going to be fine. 
MARISHA: It's brutal. 
MATT: It's going to be fine, I'm sure. 
MARISHA: It will be available for everyone on YouTube October 30th. 
SAM: But Beacon people get it first. 
TRAVIS: It should be regimented. 
MARISHA: It's a Beacon exclusive? 
TRAVIS: Beacon, yeah. 
SAM: Oh wow! 
MARISHA: Yes? 
SAM: That's great. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: First and only. 
LAURA: Oh wow. (laughter) 
MATT: I know we just hired you, so you're still getting up to speed. Sam, Travis, you got some announcements as well. 
TRAVIS: Yes, episodes seven through nine of "The Legend of Vox Machina" season three are available tonight-- (cheering) 
TRAVIS: -- on Prime Video! I know you guys have been loving the first six episodes. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: I'm sure seven, eight, nine: super boring. So feel free to skip these. 
SAM: Yep, it really just take a downturn. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You can just jump to the end. 
SAM: Filler? They're filler episodes. 
TRAVIS: Make sure you catch it with everybody else because, you know? 
TALIESIN: Shopping episodes. 
TRAVIS: You don't want to miss them. 
MATT: Yeah. It's weird to have three bottles in a row. It's like-- 
TRAVIS: That's right. Next week brings the big finale with episodes 10 through 12. And then October 29th, we'll have a wrap party discussing the second half of the season and bringing you all of our perspectives and behind the scenes. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Goodness and details. We can't wait for you guys to experience the thrilling finale of season three. I can't believe we're halfway through.

TRAVIS: So make sure to check it out. 
MARISHA: No. 
LIAM: ♪ We're halfway there ♪

SAM: It is, Sam always wears his on the plane. 
TRAVIS: Dang.

ASHLEY: This feels softer than even all the other ones. 
LAURA: I feel like it is softer. 
ASHLEY: It does, right? 
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. 
LAURA: Feel it. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah! That is actually, I think that's softer.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: So last we left off, Bells Hells had returned to Vasselheim, having thwarted, it seems, the Unseelie reunion with the Vanguard. In doing so, eliminated one of the powerful associates of Ludinus Da'leth, the Sorrowlord Zathuda himself, the blood father to Fearne. With the information you have, you walked through the city, you gathered some supplies, and you prepared yourself for what is the looming return to the surface of Ruidus, where you and another troop are to secretly traverse once more towards the capital city of Kreviris, to delve beneath its surface into a hidden spot before infiltrating the core of the city to notify those back on Exandria that you are in position, so the assault can begin and distract the enemy forces and factions to best enable both of your teams to succeed at their goals. After you've gathered your things, said some goodbyes, ordered some alcohol, climbed into a dead titan's ass crack bar. (laughter) TRAVIS": "Ass crack bar." 
TALIESIN: Good times. 
LAURA: Shanks. 
MARISHA: Shanks. 
ASHLEY: Shank you. 
MATT: You met up with two familiar Zephran family members of Orym, who escorted you to Lake Umamu on the far western side of Issylra, where you had uncovered that secret underwater portal, the backdoor entrance to Ruidus and its hidden tunnel. Unknown to most but just a few. As you arrived in the familiar abandoned fishing village, now partially taken over by the Zephran forces in preparation for your arrival, you set up within the nearby inn, where you had stayed before, talked amongst yourselves until your companion team arrived. One you've met a couple members of, but have been told they're referred to as the Mighty Nein, a very chaotic introduction of both sides coming to meet together was left on a final question from Laudna, which was-- 
MARISHA: Oh, oh, okay, we're jumping in. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Why are there only seven of you? I think I said something like that. (laughter) You're the Mighty Nein. 
LIAM: (Caleb) It's funny, that is not the first time we've been asked that question. There's been a time or two. 
LAURA: (Jester) Well, you have your cat and I have my weasel. So technically, we are nine. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) (gasps) You have a weasel? 
LIAM: I have a-- 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Oh boy. 
LAURA: Sprinkle. 
MATT: You see slowly crawling out from under-- 
MARISHA: Do you think he would want to-- 
MATT: You see slowly crawling up from under her hood, this frazzled red weasel. 
TRAVIS: (Sprinkle) It never ends. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh my-- 
LAURA: This is Sprinkle. 
MARISHA: I love him so much. 
LAURA: I know, he's beautiful. 
MARISHA: This is Pâté. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: He's amazing. 
MARISHA: Did you just cum? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Crazy O face. 
MARISHA: Do you want to hold him? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Can I hold Sprinkle? 
LAURA: Yeah, there you go. 
MARISHA: Okay. Here we go. 
MATT: Sprinkle just (frazzled chittering) in your grasp, while Pâté's like, "Hello there, nice little blue lady!" 
LAURA: Oh, hello there, little dead rat. (laughter) 
MATT: "You look all fancy and pirate-like." 
LAURA: Do you want to ride on my hat? 
MATT: "Ooh, is that a euphemism?" 
LAURA: (laughs) You know it is. 
MATT: "(laughs) I like this one." (laughter) 
MARISHA: Hi, Sprinkle. Do you talk? 
MATT: (chitters) 
MARISHA: Oh, that's good! 
LAURA: You can ride on her, Sprinkle. It's okay. 
MARISHA: Do you want to go for a ride? 
MATT: It does not. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I shove him awkwardly in the house that's probably too small for him. Just kind of-- 
MATT: A poof of red fur just (poofy explosion). 
MARISHA: There you go. 
LIAM: These two look very good together. 
LAURA: (chuckles) They do. 
MARISHA: Wha-- Sprinkle and me? 
LIAM: Matching. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Uh-huh! 
MARISHA, LAURA, and LIAM: (laugh) 
LIAM: What's going on, you guys? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I know, I have decision paralysis of who's going to respond. I'm like (anxious pants). 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) That's good, you guys are the reinforcements. You're bringing up the rear. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Yeah, you're bringing up the rear. This is great. That's what we needed. 
TRAVIS: I don't know if you understand, but we are Bells Hells. We are the ones that settled this beautiful town and located the secret passageway to Ruidus. 
ASHLEY: Its back door. 
TRAVIS: You're very welcome. 
MARISHA: Beau speaks up. (laughs) (laughter) 
MARISHA: This feels so awkward. (Beau) Yeah, I remember you guys back at the Key, or at least some of you. I don't remember you. 
ASHLEY: I remember you very well. 
LAURA: How'd y'all get out of there? 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) I was there. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: How did we get out of there? 
MATT: The same way you get out of everything else, by escaping. 
MARISHA: Well, you see, we escaped. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: No, well no, you played it out. You teleported in the middle of the crux at the live show in Wembley. 
LAURA: Don't you remember? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Do you know what happened to-- 
TALIESIN: It's been a rough few days. It's been a rough few days. 
TRAVIS: Three lifetimes of characters in your head. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Do you know what happened to Planerider Ryn? 
MARISHA: Huh? 
ASHLEY: Planerider Ryn. Do you remember what happened to her? 
LIAM: What happened to Planerider Ryn? 
TRAVIS: Oh, she was like a Planewalker, but turned to stone down by the Malleus Key. We were trying to-- 
LAURA: Oh, we found more pieces. 
ASHLEY: Her stone arm was gone. 
TRAVIS: -- get then out before, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Still down there. 
TRAVIS: Probably didn't happen then, if it doesn't ring a bell. 
ROBBIE: This is so cool. I feel like I have thousands of hours to catch up on. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: This is Dorian Storm, by the way. 
ROBBIE: Hello, nice to meet you, hi. 
LAURA: Oh, hello. You're also blue. 
ROBBIE: You are blue as well. 
LAURA: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Oh, you are beautiful, too. 
LAURA: You're so handsome! Not as handsome as Fjord. 
LIAM: Eh. 
TALIESIN: He's green. (laughter) 
MARISHA: "He's green!" 
ROBBIE: Fjord? Hello, Fjord. 
LAURA: This is Admiral Fjord. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Yes. 
LAURA: He's in charge of several fleets on the high seas. 
TRAVIS: Fjord Stone. 
ROBBIE: You have fleets? 
TRAVIS: We are merchants, Jester. We've talked about this. Stone's Throw Shipping is, we are a merchant vessel. We are not-- 
LAURA: Kind of. 
TRAVIS: We are not pirates! 
ROBBIE: You are very much dressed like a pirate. 
LAURA: I'm a pirate. 
MATT: (Pâté) "I'm a pirate, too!" 
LAURA: Yeah, Pâté! That's his name, right? 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Yes. 
TRAVIS: I suppose we could all be space pirates-- 
TALIESIN: Make him a little hat. 
TRAVIS: -- since we appear to be going to the moon? 
LAURA and MARISHA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Ooh, we're-- 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and MARISHA: Space pirates. 
LAURA: I've always wanted to be a space pirate. 
TRAVIS: That took on well. 
ASHLEY: Me too, oh my god! 
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to-- 
ROBBIE: No, really, something we've really been missing is branding. I'm glad you're here. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. That's what I'm known for. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, fantastic. 
SAM: (Veth) What can we expect up on the moon? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) What?! 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
SAM: Is there a-- 
LIAM: (Orym) We probably want to-- 
MARISHA: Oh, this is Veth. 
SAM: Oh, hi. Yes, hi. 
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. (Beau) This is Veth. 
SAM: Nice to meet you. Yes, is it-- 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Hello, good-looking. 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: How are you? 
SAM: I'm good. What's your name? 
TRAVIS: Chetney Pock O'Pea, but you can just call me C-Poppa. 
SAM: (Veth) (laughs) No, I don't think I will. 
ROBBIE: What am I looking at when I see Veth right now? 
SAM: Just a-- Well, she's dressed pretty fiercely right now. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
SAM: She's got a cool black Catwoman type suit on. 
TRAVIS: What? 
TALIESIN: What? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I mean, what? 
MARISHA: Catwoman? 
TRAVIS: What! 
SAM: She, yeah. So, I'm sorry. I got-- 
LIAM: She's a halfling. 
SAM: She's a halfling. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
SAM: She's short and she's badass. She's got cool buttons all over her. She's got packs of different potions and stuff like that. She's got a cool crossbow. I got all suited up to go rescue my son. But when I got there-- 
LAURA: (Imogen) Is he all right? 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) You have a son? 
SAM: Yes, yes, I have a son, and-- 
ROBBIE: Uh-huh. 
SAM: I mean, technically I have a husband, but we have sort of an open relationship sometimes. 
ASHLEY: Oh, how interesting. 
LIAM: Insight check. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Always, always. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Yes. (laughter) 
MATT: Go ahead and roll a persuasion or a deception check. 
LIAM: Oh, damn it! 
TRAVIS: Where's Orym when I need him! 
ROBBIE: So real. 
LIAM: Oh! I'm Caleb! It's a 21! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Yay! (laughter) 
SAM: Natural one. 
MARISHA: Wait, Caleb was asking Veth? 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MARISHA: Okay, oh. 
LIAM: Well, I was just thinking. 
MARISHA: Just thinking. 
SAM: Just-- 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Oh, that explains things. I was getting a very major mid-life crisis vibe going on. Now that really-- 
ASHLEY: How did that-- 
TALIESIN: -- knocks it down. 
LIAM: Did that feel authentic to me or like bullshit? 
SAM: No! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Although, above the table, I know what your character look like. I just knew you were going to do something with your outfit. (laughter) 
SAM: I came to rescue my son, but you guys had already finished the fight or whatever, so I-- 
LIAM: (Caleb) Do-- 
ASHLEY: Why were you rescuing your son? I'm so sorry, sir. 
SAM: He ran off with the rest of my group, and my group fucking brought him along for some reason. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Well-- 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) We thought he had your permission. 
LIAM: That's an over-- simplification of what happened. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA: (Jester) He was super capable. 
LIAM: He did very well. 
TRAVIS: He handled himself very well. 
LIAM: He rode a dinosaur. 
TRAVIS: The camp has been-- 
SAM: He what?! 
LIAM: Rode a dinosaur. 
TRAVIS: I would've left that part out. 
SAM: I mean-- 
TRAVIS: But okay. 
LAURA: Caleb did it. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: Of course, Caleb did it. I-- (scoffs) 
LIAM: It was pretty cool. 
MARISHA: (Beau) And to be fair, we did scold him. 
TRAVIS: 100%. We were very reprimanding and stern in your stead. 
MARISHA: Yes, yes. 
SAM: I just don't want him to get too cocky because he's got this girl at the camp that he's interested in. I just don't want him to go running off with her or something. 
LAURA: Luc? 
TRAVIS: He has mad game, I will say. 
SAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: He is very charismatic. 
SAM: Yes, her name is Beth which is so weird for me. 
LAURA: That's creepy. 
SAM: It's a weird mother thing. 
LAURA: No, no. 
SAM: It's so gross. 
MARISHA: Oh, you think he's trying to date his mom? 
SAM: Maybe, I don't know. It's gross. 
LAURA: Well, you're super hot. I don't blame him. 
SAM: Well, thank you. 
LAURA: That's still creepy, though. 
TALIESIN: That got weird. 
SAM: I am hot, aren't I? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) You are. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Especially in that suit, I have to say. 
LIAM: (Orym) Can we talk about the task at hand? 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Mr. Dorian, who is the most level headed of your group of people? 
ROBBIE: None. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
LAURA: Oh now, listen. 
ROBBIE: We've been lacking leadership for awhile. 
ASHLEY: That probably would be me. 
LAURA: Lacking leadership? 
ROBBIE: You know it's true in your heart. 
ASHLEY: No. 
TRAVIS: We should start from a place of honesty, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm probably the most level headed. 
TALIESIN: I can definitely tell that's not true. 
TRAVIS: Honesty. 
MARISHA: Laudna just reaches over and puts Fearne's hand down. 
ROBBIE: Chetney speaks for us often, but we don't always want it, but he is okay at it, I would say. 
TALIESIN: Caduceus is going to walk over to you two because oh god, I love high wisdom. It's just great. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: So, where have you come from? What's the plan? Anything that we should know? Do you want to leave tonight? Do you want to leave tomorrow? Does anybody want dinner? I could cook. Is there a kitchen? 
LAURA: Dinner sounds great. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA: There's a kitchen here in the-- 
TALIESIN: Any allergies? Any issues that anybody has? 
ROBBIE: Almonds, actually. 
ASHLEY: I can eat anything. 
LIAM: Orym looks way up Caduceus' body. 
MARISHA: How do you know that? 
LIAM: (Orym) Yeah, I think dinner is a good idea. I think we should sit down and compare notes and figure out whether we're leaving soon, in the morning. 
LAURA: How much do y'all know about the moon, Ruidus? 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) We don't actually know too terribly much. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Not very much. 
TRAVIS: We're just told that we-- They needed some of the best to go in and compliment a group of fellow adventurers. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Caleb and I have been in the weeds a little bit, but mainly dealing with the Cerberus Assembly and their connection to this, but certainly haven't-- 
LAURA: Right, right. 
MARISHA: -- been there. 
LAURA: Ludinus has been very involved up there. 
LIAM: (Caleb) As we understood it, you have been-- 
LAURA: To the moon, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Yes. Hospitable? 
LAURA: Depends on where you are. 
TRAVIS: Is there gravity? 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Yes, yes. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yes. Yeah, there's gravity. 
ASHLEY: There's gravity. 
TRAVIS: But we made our way to the Astral Sea once and shit was cray. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh, Caduceus by the way, I'm so sorry, I always-- I'm going to go start cooking. 
ASHLEY: Hello. 
TALIESIN: I'll be right back. 
LIAM: That is a good idea. 
TALIESIN: Almond, cats. No cats, no almonds. 
TRAVIS: I could eat. 
LIAM: I don't think everybody's introduced themselves. My name is Caleb Widogast. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. 
LIAM: Ja. 
TRAVIS: I'm Fjord, and this is of course, my lovely fiance. 
LAURA: (Jester) Hi, I'm Jester. I'm a pirate. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Hello. 
LAURA: Space pirate. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) You are engaged? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We are, yes. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. 
LAURA: We got engaged a few days ago. 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
MARISHA: A few days ago? 
LAURA: A week ago? How long has it been? 
MATT: A few weeks. 
LAURA: Like a few weeks now. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness, you have-- 
LAURA: Time passes so quickly. 
TRAVIS: What is time, when you're ♪ In love ♪ 
LIAM: Congratulations, when's the date? 
LAURA: Nott, you weren't even there! 
SAM: I don't see a ring! Where's the ring? Did you not fucking get her a ring? 
LAURA: No! Listen. 
SAM: My god! 
TRAVIS: It was in the moment. I meant to come around-- 
LAURA: I mean, I still-- 
SAM: That's one thing that you have to do! 
LAURA: You know, honestly-- 
LIAM: What did you do with that-- 
LAURA: But I do still have the fire-- 
LIAM: -- fire resistance ring? 
LAURA: I'm wearing it! 
LIAM: Oh, is that the ring? 
LAURA: Well, I was using it as the ring because Fjord didn't give me another one, so. 
TRAVIS: I thought it had sentimental value. 
LAURA: No, I like it, and I know how much you spent on it so that's important. 
TRAVIS: It was worth the money. 
LAURA: It is. I'm fire resistant now when I attune to it, which is not all the time. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, we got interrupted. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Can somebody set up the table while you act like crazy people? 
TRAVIS: Yes, we'll do that. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: That's Caduceus and also this is Beau. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Oh-- 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. Finish the introductions. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Oh, yes. 
MARISHA: Yeah, Beau, Beauregard Lionett. I'm actually with the Cobalt Soul. 
TRAVIS: God, your personality just shines through. Maybe introduce your other? 
MARISHA: My other? 
TRAVIS: Your partner. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, yeah. This is Yasha. 
ASHLEY: Hello. My name is Yasha Nydoorin. It's very nice to meet all of you. This is-- How fun. 
MARISHA: Hey. 
ROBBIE: Wait, wait-- (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Great. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, right? 
TRAVIS: Really. 
ASHLEY: I feel like I'm getting a little bit more-- 
MARISHA: Yasha, Yasha. 
ASHLEY: What? 
MARISHA: That's the one I was telling you about that's kind of cute. 
ASHLEY: Oh, hello. You are Imogen, right? 
LAURA: (Imogen) I am. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's very nice to meet you. 
LAURA: You've heard about me? 
ASHLEY: I have, actually. 
TALIESIN: You talk about her? 
ASHLEY: We saw you and-- Yes. We can discuss this at another time. 
LIAM: We saw you from across the campaigns. 
LAURA: This is Laudna. 
TALIESIN and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Oh, is this your-- 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Yes. 
ASHLEY: Hello, very nice to meet you. 
MARISHA: In fact, Imogen got me this ring. 
ASHLEY: Oo, how lovely. 
LAURA: I did. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: It didn't cost 5,000 gold pieces. 
SAM: Yeah, but at least she got something! 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
ROBBIE: So wait, you two are coupled up as well? 
MARISHA: (Beau) Yeah, me and her. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) And me and her. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Well, that I knew. I understood. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: This must be an adventuring thing, like a show-mance sort of thing that just kind of happens. 
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, you get on the road. 
ROBBIE: That's what it feels like. 
ASHLEY: You share a lot, you kill a lot. 
MARISHA: (Beau) You go through a lot, yeah. 
ASHLEY: You connect in many ways and-- 
MARISHA: To be fair, I fucking hated her guts when we first met. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, she did not like me. 
ROBBIE: Oh, okay. 
ASHLEY: At all. 
LIAM: Who is this gentleman with the horns? 
SAM: (Braius) Hi, I'm sorry. Braius has been sort of-- 
TALIESIN: You don't have to answer that man, you don't have to answer that. 
SAM: Braius has been standing in the back, taking it all in. His eyes keep going to Jester. Just sort of, he feels like he's seen her before somewhere. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: (Jester) Can I help you? 
MARISHA: Oh. Oh! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: Sorry, I was-- 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Did it just take that long over there? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Sorry, I was just-- 
TRAVIS: Yep, they did. 
SAM: Hi, I'm Braius. I'm actually a new member of this group and it's lovely to meet you all. How long have you all been together? 
LAURA: Oh my, so long. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, very long. 
LAURA: How long has it been? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Trauma shortens it all, but months? Longer? 
LAURA: Oh, you're talking to-- 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: Oh. No. 
SAM: No, no, no. No, sorry, not us, not us. 
ASHLEY: C-Pop. 
TRAVIS: Oh. I'm going to go join Caduceus. (laughter) 
SAM: I mean the other group. 
TALIESIN: I'm making you sous-chef. Come on in. 
TRAVIS: It smells good in here. 
TALIESIN: Damn well, it does. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Okay, wait. Because that guy seems familiar, but I don't remember an old guy. Was he the wolf? 
LIAM: Which guy are you talking about? 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Yes, he was the wolf. 
MARISHA: The dog? 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Yeah, yeah, no. 
ASHLEY: He turns into a wolf and does a thing. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's a whole thing. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I didn't know he was fucking ancient. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Oh he turns into a dog. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he was a werewolf. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah, a wolf. 
MARISHA: Like a dog, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh, a wolf? Oh, that might be better. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: That's interesting. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yasha-- 
LAURA: He's actually really powerful. 
ASHLEY: -- I'm so sorry to objectify your wife, but how do you work out? Like, what do you do? Because this is such an amazing-- The abs. 
LAURA: They really are. 
LIAM: Orym perks up. 
ASHLEY: We've all been talking about them. 
LIAM: (Orym) What's your regimen? What do you do? 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Oh shit, here it goes. 
MARISHA: You got to keep it tight, you know. So every day you wake up-- 
LIAM: I know. 
ASHLEY: She keeps it real tight. 
MARISHA: -- bust out a set. 
LIAM: Squats? 
MARISHA: (scoffs) Yeah. 
LIAM: Pull ups? 
MARISHA: Yep. 
LIAM: One handies? 
MARISHA: 100%. 
LAURA and SAM: One handies? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, Dorian eases over toward Beau and loosens his sash to the side a little bit so you can see his abs. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's good too. 
LAURA: You don't really have to move the shirt. You're wearing a sheer shirt. We see them all the time. 
ASHLEY: We can see it under there already. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to dip off to the back with Caduceus and Fjord. I'm outta here. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) You're two cans short of a six pack there, friend. 
SAM: But where did you all meet? What part of the world I guess is what I was asking. 
LAURA: (Jester) Oh gosh, I mean, you know. 
TRAVIS: I mean some of us-- 
LAURA: I mean, I'm from Nicodranas. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) All over. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Wildemount. Some of us from Tal'Dorei. 
SAM: Wildemount. 
ASHLEY: I'm from Xhorhas. I don't know if you ever-- 
SAM: Zadash. 
LAURA: Oh! Well. 
TRAVIS: Sure, we have-- 
LIAM: (Caleb) Well, I'm from north of Zadash, yeah. 
MARISHA: I studied in Zadash. I'm from Kamordah originally. 
TRAVIS: Are you from Zadash? 
SAM: I spent some time there, yes, yes. 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Oh yeah, that's right. 
LAURA: Cool. 
TALIESIN: I forgot about that. 
ASHLEY: We went through Zadash a lot I think. 
SAM: Oh, you did, you did. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: At the temple of the Platinum Dragon? 
SAM: The Platinum House, yes. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right! We did go there! 
LAURA: (laughs) That's right. 
ASHLEY: We did go there. 
LAURA: What a fucking crazy time that was, right? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. You and Veth-- 
SAM: (Veth) Yeah, we fucked that place up. 
ASHLEY: -- had a good time. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah, we did. Oh my gosh. Do you remember? The Traveler was so happy about it. 
SAM: Yeah! 
ROBBIE: Get ready. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: Yeah. It was crazy, and we drew dicks all over the dra-- 
TRAVIS: No, no, you mean you were there when you heard, heard about the vandalism? 
LAURA: I don't think-- No, we were the vandals. 
ASHLEY: No, they were the ones-- 
TRAVIS: No, no, no! 
ASHLEY: -- who did it, Fjord. 
SAM: Chaos crew! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: No, no, no. You see, they-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck yes. 
TRAVIS: -- they like to claim other feats that are not theirs. 
LAURA: What are you talking about? 
TRAVIS: I think this nice horned gentleman might have been at that temple at the time when those poor, unfortunate needy artists-- 
LAURA: Oh, those poor, unfortunate people at the temple. 
TRAVIS: -- took advantage. Yes. 
LIAM: The odds of you two being in the same place at the same time so many years ago and here today, that does not seem-- 
TRAVIS: Astronomical. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh! 
LIAM: That's not really-- 
ASHLEY: No. 
LAURA: What if we were? It's like fate. Oh my gosh! It's brought us together. What's your name again? 
SAM: (Braius) Braius. 
LAURA: I'm Jester. 
SAM: It's nice to meet you. 
LAURA: I give you a hug. 
SAM: Oh! Oh. I-- 
MARISHA: Did you just cum? 
SAM: No. (laughter) 
SAM: It's nice to meet you. 
LAURA: You as well. Listen, if the Platinum Dragon doesn't treat you well, you're always welcome to follow the Traveler. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: What is the Traveler? 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
ROBBIE: Another god. 
LAURA: He's kind of not quite a god, but he's kind of like a god. He's super powerful, gives me lots of-- 
SAM: Like a Betrayer god? 
LAURA: I mean-- 
LIAM: All these years later and still going strong. 
LAURA: Listen-- 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Wait, so is the Traveler one of the gods that might get eaten by the-- 
LAURA: No, no, no, that's the best thing about it. He's not on the menu. 
ASHLEY: Oh. (laughter) 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Oh. 
SAM: I've never heard of this god. 
LAURA: He's the Traveler. 
SAM: What are his tenets? 
LAURA: Draw dicks on things. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Fair. 
LAURA: Create a little chaos wherever you go. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
ASHLEY: I like that. 
SAM: Sounds pretty good so far. 
LAURA: Basically do whatever you want and also tell people how cool-- 
TALIESIN: Do you have any literature? 
LAURA: Yeah, I have a brochure. Here you go. 
TALIESIN: Oh god, I'm into it, all right. 
ASHLEY: You have some pamphlets? 
LAURA: Here, would you like a-- 
SAM: Oh, I've-- 
ASHLEY: I'll take one of those. 
SAM: I've seen one of these before. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Thank you so much. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh! He's going to be so happy. You should totally meet him. 
TALIESIN: What's one more god? Take it. You're at what, three, four now? Just take a fifth. 
LAURA: Oh, you have other ones? 
MARISHA: Braius? 
SAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: Are you all right? 
SAM: No. 
MARISHA: Suck it in. 
SAM: No. 
LAURA: Oh no, what's wrong? 
SAM: You ruined my life. 
TALIESIN: You seem like you're doing pretty well now. 
LAURA: What do you mean? 
SAM: You destroyed my life. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
LAURA: How? 
SAM: You fucked everything up. I had a-- 
ASHLEY: Yasha pulls out her sword. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: Listen-- 
SAM: I'll pull out my flail. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Do you have a problem? 
LAURA: No, no, no, no. 
ROBBIE: It's going down. 
SAM: I do have a problem. 
LAURA: You guys, we all have to work together. 
ASHLEY: No, no, I know. 
LAURA: What is going on? 
ASHLEY: What-- What's happening? I can't-- (laughs) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: This is very hard. (laughter) 
MATT: You're doing great, you're doing great. 
LAURA: What are you-- What? 
LIAM: I would like to remind us all of the task at hand and what is at stake. We can certainly discuss-- 
LAURA: The world is at stake right now, Braius. 
MARISHA: (Beau) I don't know, maybe you should fight, see who's stronger. 
TRAVIS: No, Beau. I think we're going to try and use words this evening. 
ASHLEY: I'm stronger. 
LAURA: No, listen, listen. 
SAM: I don't think that you are. 
ASHLEY: Do you want to bet? 
TALIESIN: Are your people always this crazy? 
TRAVIS: I will admit-- 
LIAM: Unfortunately, they are. 
TRAVIS: -- that perhaps post meal, a little display-- 
LAURA: I'm going to try to charm you. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
SAM: Oh? Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm very hungry. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Food's ready. I'm not putting it out 'til you all keep quiet. 
MATT: All right, you're attempting to cast Charm Person on Braius? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Braius, go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw for me, if you don't mind. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Big roll, big roll. 
MARISHA: Right over Fjord, trying to negotiate. 
SAM: What does that say? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Which one? The two numbers on it? That's a nat 20. 
SAM: That's a natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: So-- 
TRAVIS: That's a good dice. 
MATT: -- you resist the spell and are also aware that you were almost charmed magically. and are also aware that you were almost charmed magically. 
SAM: What are you trying to do to me? 
LAURA: Just make you my friend. 
TRAVIS: Jester! 
LAURA: What? 
TRAVIS: Perhaps you should tangle. That might be the fastest way to settle all this. 
ASHLEY: You want to tangle? 
TRAVIS: After dinner, because I think once we break bread, get a chance to know each other, that might be the perfect opportunity to unite ourselves in this effort. 
LAURA: Yasha, you don't have to fight him. 
ASHLEY: True. 
LAURA: Although you guys color coordinate really well. 
ASHLEY: We do color coordinate. 
LAURA: You do look really cool together. 
ASHLEY: But that's besides the point. 
SAM: I like your aesthetic. 
ASHLEY: But you might want to have one last meal before you die. 
LAURA: Oh! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wow. She has been taking cues from you. 
TALIESIN: Kids, Chetney's doing amazing things with these lentils. You would not believe it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Caduceus, where did you learn to cook? (laughs) 
SAM: We can table this. But I will have my satisfaction. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Would an apology suffice? We are about to throw our bodies on the pyre for the sake of the world. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: It would be good to have more people than less. 
LAURA: What if I just say I'm so sorry I ruined your life? 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) She's so sorry, Braius. 
TRAVIS: Maybe we could help repair one of your party. I don't mean to inquire, but are you well? 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) That's a complicated question. But no, this is a work of art. This is fine. 
TRAVIS: It is? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Because there is a hole-- 
LAURA: Maybe could I draw you later? 
TRAVIS: -- in your head. 
LIAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
LAURA: I don't think I've-- 
LIAM: I've been standing-- 
TALIESIN: I love being drawn. 
LIAM: -- on the wrong side this entire time. Would you turn around from me? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, of course. 
LIAM: Oh, that is fascinating. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
LIAM: Look at this. 
TALIESIN: Everyone keeps doing that. 
LAURA: Hey look, Caleb, that looks like-- 
MATT: Now, Caleb-- 
TALIESIN: Oh boy! Hey! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Look inside. 
MATT: You've gotten a message or two regarding this troop from Essek. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: You have not been able to compare notes directly since you've all been scattered to the four winds. But he did mention one individual with a very unique feature in their head that seemed to be tied unmistakably to a beacon, the Luxon, or just a dunamantic source in general. The minute you see this, you know this is the exact person that Essek mentioned. 
LIAM: Caleb starts to trace his finger in small patterns on that scarred section of your head and I use one of my signature spells now, which is Fortune's Favor. Spell Mastery, excuse me, and-- 
TALIESIN: That feels weird. 
LIAM: -- ignite the spell Fortune's Favor in you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that feels very weird. 
LIAM: He was right. How did you come by this? 
TALIESIN: Well, it was all kind of by accident. Long story short, I was attempting to rob somebody. Fell out of a window, and then a bunch of friends just did their best to put me back together and then-- 
LIAM: Oh, you see, we are going to get along just fine. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, great! 
TRAVIS: Sounds right up our alley, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Speaking of Essek, when we were at his abode and there were pictures on the wall, did that include-- You said there was some adventuring party. Does Bells Hells have a vague recollection that that's a connection to Essek? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: In fact, as soon as he mentions Essek's name, though he may not be present, many of you begin to pick up the images you saw or the portrait that you saw on the wall at Essek's house. This is exactly the same team. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to come out of the tent where I was just with Caduceus, and I'm just going to: Oh man, he is great. We just figured it out. We know someone you know! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Yes. Essek. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that-- Ah. 
TRAVIS: You know Essek? 
ROBBIE: We do, we do. 
ASHLEY: We do, we do. 
TALIESIN: That makes sense. 
LAURA: How do you know Essek? 
ASHLEY: We know him through-- 
ROBBIE: It's complicated. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Well, he was kind of our mentor. He helped us get around. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: It was Aeor and that whole insanity. 
LAURA: He's a wonderful-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Because you, he kept mentioning-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: He was like: Oh, my partner's busy. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
MARISHA: Was that you? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Guilty as charged. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ROBBIE: We were in your home. It was charming, lovely. 
LIAM: Oh, thank you. We work very hard at it. Did you see the garden? 
ASHLEY: Yes, beautiful. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hm. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Yes, good. 
ASHLEY: Also, love how he floats. I was trying to figure that out. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LIAM: He showed us. 
LAURA: I started floating because of him. 
LIAM: Because of him? 
LAURA: Yeah, I thought it was a cool thing. 
TRAVIS: Floating because of him! (laughter) 
LIAM: You are the Ruidusborn, ja? There are two of you? You and-- 
LAURA: Yeah, us. 
ASHLEY: I am, as well. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: What can you tell us about our foes, the people that we are-- 
LAURA: Well, I think y'all are going to fight the Weave Mind, which is-- 
ASHLEY: Good luck! 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: Well, talk to me. Talk strategy with me. 
LAURA: Well, it's a group of-- 
LIAM: Strengths, weaknesses. 
LAURA: We don't exactly know. It's a group of, I think, five very ancient-- 
ASHLEY: Very old. Very, very old. 
LAURA: -- Reilorans who-- 
LIAM: Reilorans. 
LAURA: -- control a lot of the population there. 
ASHLEY: Wait, do you know what Reilorans are? 
LIAM: Well, we've heard it discussed a little bit through-- 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Natives to the moon. 
LIAM: -- communications with the Tempest and Lady Vysoren. 
MARISHA: Laudna does a Silent Image of a Reiloran. 
LAURA: That's a Reiloran. There's lots of different types of Reilorans, but-- 
LIAM: I've had it explained to me that you share some overlap or similarities somehow with these creatures, these beings? 
LAURA: A lot of psychic abilities-- 
LIAM: Ah. 
LAURA: -- have become more present in my powers. 
LIAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: You have psychic abilities? 
LAURA: In your head you hear: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
LIAM: In your head, you hear: Oh, very interesting. 
TALIESIN: (Cadeuceus) Do I hear that there's a psychic in there? (laughter) Could you read my mind and actually set a table? That'd be great. 
SAM: Yes, yes! Caleb, enough of this boring talk for now! Let's get to dinner. We can talk strategy then. 
LIAM: I have just one last question, and then please, everybody, dig in. But are we staying here for the night? Because that will dictate what I do for the next hour or so. 
ASHLEY: Well, where do you want? 
TRAVIS: What time of day is it? 
MATT: At this point, you guys are meeting just as the light of the sun passes the mountains, so you're entering dusk into evening. 
LAURA: It's up to y'all. We could spend the night here and then make our way. The portal to Ruidus is through the lake. Everyone here will be able to open up the water. 
SAM: Oh, fuck! 
LAURA: So we won't have to use our powers. 
ASHLEY: What's the matter? 
LAURA: You won't have to face the water or anything. 
ASHLEY: You just have to swim down there. It's not that big of a deal. 
SAM: (screams) 
LAURA: I don't even think we'll have to swim. I think the Ashari here are going to hold the water back. 
SAM: Okay, all right. I'm in. 
TALIESIN: That sounds nice. 
LAURA: There's a cave that the portal connects to that we could all sleep in there. If that's better for your spell conservation. I'm not sure. 
LIAM: Well, I think there's some preparation that I and my friend, and he looks to Jester, can do if we are spending a night here. But if we are going straight in, I will maybe hold back. We could eat more comfortably, as well, than these humble abodes that you have-- 
TRAVIS: I think we defer to Bells Hells. Is there an urgency to go this evening, or should we eat, gather ourselves-- 
ROBBIE: Everything these days is pretty urgent. 
LIAM: (Orym) I think-- 
ROBBIE: But we're rested. Is your party well-rested? 
LIAM: -- prepared is probably better than rushing in. 
LAURA: The longer we take to-- This is based on information we've gathered. The longer we take to set up and get in our position on Ruidus, the more of their armies they'll be able to bring over, and the people on the front lines will have to fight. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Well, then we should go. 
ROBBIE: Would a leisurely dinner be enough time for your hour that you need? 
LIAM: (Caleb) Well, if we are dealing with beings with mental capabilities, there are certain things that I could do for myself, for you, Yasha, to make sure that you are not-- 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Oh, yes. Yes. 
LIAM: -- boned in the heat of things. 
LAURA: (Jester) Yasha's super easy to be swayed, you know? It's happened so many times. 
ASHLEY: Very strong, very very strong, but not up here as much. 
MARISHA: I don't know. Sometimes that's not true. 
ASHLEY: Sometimes it's not true. 
MARISHA: Sometimes it's not true. I mean, I love you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: But sometimes you can be a fucking pain in the ass. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I want to be. 
LIAM: I know Caduceus is cooking, but if he's putting extra love and care into that cooking, then perhaps Caduceus-- 
TALIESIN: I can pack it up. That's fine, if we need to do that. I already assumed-- 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) This is enough for you and me, Caducey. This is so good. 
MARISHA: Is the dog man already eating? 
TRAVIS: Wolf! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I was just talking about you. Okay. 
MARISHA: Let's sit down and eat. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah, that's fine. 
TALIESIN: I didn't want to pack this anyway. It would've just gotten cold. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Wow, what is this? 
TALIESIN: Well, I don't know-- 
ASHLEY: This looks good. 
TALIESIN: Clearly you actually added some things. This is something from back home. I've collected a few things. I garden, obviously. This is lentils in a lettuce wrap. It's got a little bit of spice to it, because I know not everybody likes to eat vegetarian. It's also got some very specific cabbages and a few extra little spices that only grow-- 
LIAM: (Orym) Is that quinoa? 
TALIESIN: That is quinoa! Well done. 
LIAM: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Neat. Yummy! 
TALIESIN: And a special tea that cannot be found anywhere else. Carnelion tea. It has these very tiny flowers, very pungent. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: That sounds amazing. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a little sweet, a little spicy. 
ASHLEY: Where are you from? 
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's complicated. My family-- We kind of have a quiet temple. You've never been there, it's all right. 
MARISHA: You worship a god? Wait. (Laudna) You worship a god? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (slapping sound) (laughter) 
LAURA: I'm Laudna now! 
ROBBIE: That's cheating! 
ASHLEY: What god do you worship? 
TALIESIN: Well, I worship the Wildmother. I'm a cleric of the Wildmother. But also, we are under the-- My family also has ties to the Arch Heart, and a tiny tie to the Matron as well. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Those last two! 
SAM: (Braius) We met the Arch Heart. 
LAURA: And the Matron. 
LIAM: Those are all-- 
ROBBIE: And the Wildmother. 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: We didn't meet the Wildmother. 
LAURA: Well, we didn't, but Orym did. 
ROBBIE: Well, we-- 
TALIESIN: Don't you all get around? 
ROBBIE: The collective we, the royal we, if you will. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: We've had a lot of visions and interactions, the last couple of weeks. 
MARISHA: (Beau) What's your connection to the Matron of Ravens? 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: Don't really have one, per se. We did literally just meet her-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we went into a pool of blood. 
LIAM: -- within the last 24 hours. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) I really liked her. 
ROBBIE: Fought our worst fears, some of our deepest regrets, proved ourselves in a trial of the gods. 
LAURA: (Jester) Wow! 
ASHLEY: She was fine. 
LIAM: I feel insane right now. 
ASHLEY: I do, too. 
MATT: This is my favorite episode already. (laughter) I haven't had to do anything. 
TRAVIS: We're right in the pocket. 
TALIESIN: Caduceus is going to walk over to Braius. (Caduceus) Huh. 
SAM: Oh yeah, huh. 
TALIESIN: I like your armor. 
SAM: I like your fur. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. The black and white is fun. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: You're a creature of faith as well, aren't you? 
SAM: I am. 
TALIESIN: I could tell because you're scowling. (laughter) 
SAM: Your friend has me on edge. (Veth) Oh, are you on edge? Do you need someone to maybe relax you? 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
ASHLEY: Oh wow! 
MARISHA: I've been waiting for this. 
TRAVIS: Please fuck yourself! 
LAURA: He doesn't like us because we ruined his life. 
TALIESIN: Veth, take it down 20%. 
SAM: (Braius) I wouldn't say that she ruined my life. 
LAURA: Well I just mean, Veth was there, too. 
SAM: No, she wasn't. 
LAURA: She was a goblin at the time. 
SAM: It was you and some fucking goblin. 
LAURA: She was the-- 
TALIESIN: (laughs) Oh no. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
LAURA: Yeah, it was just me and a goblin. 
SAM: (Veth) Yes, it was just you and a goblin! I wasn't anywhere near there. I wouldn't have done anything like that. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Veth! 
LAURA: It's okay, Veth. 
SAM: I know it's okay, because I didn't do anything! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Here, let me settle you. I'll just-- Do you like booze? I've got a lot. She'll just lead him away. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Predatory! 
TRAVIS: Self service. 
TALIESIN: I'll have a talk with both of them later. 
MARISHA: Laudna's going to start eating the lettuce wraps. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wow, she's a lot. 
LAURA: Which one? 
TALIESIN: Well done on the sauce by the way, Mr. Chetney. 
ASHLEY: Veth. 
LAURA: Mm. Yeah, she is. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to pull out a little piece of dried meat from my pouch and then start breaking it off with Chetney and putting it into our lentils. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Sprinkle it on, sprinkle it on. Nice call, Storm. 
ROBBIE: It's delicious, though. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is really good. 
MARISHA: Beau pulls out the equivalent of a protein bar. 
ROBBIE and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: She eats the lettuce wraps, but it's tough when you're high protein. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You know, vegetarian diet. 
TRAVIS: Sometimes you wish you had some meat in your pocket. You know, just a little bacon or something. (chuckling) 
TALIESIN: That side dish is a cauliflower derivative. It has tons of protein in it. But fine, don't listen to me. I don't know what I'm talking about. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Nothing beats red meat, my guy. 
TRAVIS: Did you guys catch them up on everything that awaits once we go through the water hole? 
ROBBIE: We sort of got into the moon is kind of like this, but that's about it. 
LAURA: Imogen is not attuned to the circlet right now, and is getting a little overwhelmed by all of the thoughts. 
TRAVIS: Imogen, or? 
MARISHA: So just like all of us right now? (laughter) 
LAURA: I can normally handle it, but I feel like somebody here is just singing constantly. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Singing well, or singing poorly? 
LAURA: Jester's in the corner-- 
TRAVIS: We know who's singing. 
LAURA: (Jester) ♪ (The Girl from Ipanema) ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "The Girl from Ipanema"? (laughs) 
MARISHA: Here's a question. Once we get to-- 
TALIESIN: The Girl from Ank'Harel. 
MARISHA: -- get to the other side of this portal, how long of a journey is it into the heart of the city? 
LIAM: (Caleb) Hours, days, weeks? What are we talking about? 
TALIESIN: Are we walking? 
LAURA: (Imogen) Well that again depends on what all you can do. 
TRAVIS: A couple days, yeah. 
LAURA: To get across the plain, the desert, to get to the city, it was a few days, if I'm remembering correctly? 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Well, not having been there, if you have some object from this city, I could shunt a handful of us there. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Oh yeah, what do you want? I've got this behemoth finger. That's pretty good. I've got this dead alien. That's pretty good. 
LAURA: Oh, that would take us straight down into-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: You also have that figurine. 
MARISHA: Oh! I've got this little dancer. Yes! 
LAURA: The little figurine would take us up top of Kreviris, and then the little alien baby would take us potentially down into the city. 
LIAM: Well, you are the expert on the lay of the land there, so what would be the best place for us to hilo in? 
LAURA: Oh gosh, it would certainly be harder to hide out near the alien baby. That's where we were attacked the last time. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) What if we got-- Do we want to be just slightly outside the gate, or do we want to get all the way in? Because there is that little outpost, and it wouldn't be hard to take care everyone who was there. 
LAURA: But we don't have anything from that outpost. The little glass figurine that Laudna took was from that weapon shop. 
LIAM: (Orym) Well, I wonder-- 
TALIESIN: The weapon shop is actually a really good idea. 
LIAM: I wonder how thinned out or not it is in there, because if they're garnering all of their forces, not the folks topside who just seemed like regular folk, but their army, if it'll be easier moving through. We have to have-- 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. 
LIAM: -- the ability to sneak around. How's your group at being low key? 
ROBBIE: As a group, you're mighty, but are you sneaky? 
LAURA: (Jester) So sneaky. The sneakiest people you've ever met. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yeah, I can-- 
ROBBIE: Insight check. (laughter) 
MATT: Sure, make an insight check. Make a persuasion or deception, and you don't have to say which. 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
SAM: Solid. 
LAURA: What did you roll? 
ROBBIE: Nat 20. 
LAURA: Well, then you succeed, right? No matter how high I roll. (laughter) 
MATT: Unless you roll a natural 20 as well. 
LAURA: I didn't. I rolled a 19. 
ROBBIE: Are you guys sneaky? 
LAURA: We can be sneaky. You think you read from me that we can be sneaky. 
ROBBIE: Maybe she's telling the truth. 
LAURA: Maybe I'm not the sneakiest person you've ever met. 
TRAVIS: We also are good at creating cover as we move, and all sorts of things. 
LAURA: Oh yeah! 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Can't outrun mistakes. 
LIAM: (Caleb) We have ripped off some pretty high security locations. 
LAURA: That's right! I have this one ability, I can make us all go into these smoky, ethereal people, and we can just-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: -- move through this weird semi-ethereal plane that nobody can see. 
MARISHA: Like ghosts? 
LAURA: Basically, we're ghosts. 
TALIESIN: Ghosts. 
LAURA: But I can only do it to six people. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) We can totally just drop Beau off of really high things. She just kind of falls and never gets hurt, like a cat. It's very odd. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Yes. 
ASHLEY: It's really incredible. 
LIAM: What do you mean? You don't do anything to mitigate it, like turn into a fish or something? That's the wrong character. 
TRAVIS: Yes, it was! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: But a good references. 
TALIESIN: And, bloody nose! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That sounds very relaxing. For you, not-- 
MARISHA: Beau ignores that, because Marisha doesn't have an answer. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Teleporting in is probably the best way. The land, the sands of the moon have creatures that move through it that detect vibrations. 
LAURA: Yeah, dangerous. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) That's right! 
TRAVIS: So the closer we can get, probably the better, and I think silence is golden, because as Imogen said, there's people with psychic abilities. I think stealth is going to be our key. We need to link up with the coalition? The Volition? 
LAURA: The Volition, I think. 
TRAVIS: The Volition, yeah! Whew. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Chet can teleport some of us. How many can you teleport, Caleb? 
LIAM: Well, my entire group, if need be. 
TRAVIS: Oh, great. I have this. I open the bag of holding, and a big-ass fucking magic staff comes out. It's got all sorts of magic. 
TALIESIN: It's a lot shorter than mine. 
MARISHA: Where'd you get that? 
TRAVIS: This? I made it. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MARISHA: You made that? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MARISHA: You made that staff? 
TRAVIS: I'm actually a master craftsman, but I also make magic shit. 
LAURA: In your head, Beau, you hear: He did not craft that himself. That was Ludinus' old staff. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it looks very Cerberus-y. But you do make stuff. 
TRAVIS: Who were you talking to? 
MARISHA: I was talking in my head! You couldn't hear it! Because there's conversations above the table between 15 people, and then in our heads! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: She's literally making the same face that we all make when we're doing it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, fair. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We should be able to tell by now. 
MATT: Right? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Also, you look over and Laudna's sitting off in a corner and she's starting to tie red twine to Sprinkle to turn him into a puppet. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Sprinkle has just given up, and is just-- 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Sprinkle! 
TRAVIS: (Sprinkle) Maybe this is it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: (Jester) Be nice to him. He's not dead like your guy, fully. 
TRAVIS: Are you sure? 
MARISHA: (Laudna) He's enjoying it! Look at him! 
LAURA: Sprinkle, are you liking this? Oh, he loves it. My bad. 
LIAM: That's the most life I've seen from that weasel in years. (laughter) 
LIAM: I am going to make the strong pitch that we prepare for a night. I know that we are pressed for time, but what you are describing sounds difficult, and I feel like we should be stacking the deck in our favor as best we can. If we rest for the night, I will throw up the tower, and we can-- 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) I would actually say-- 
LIAM: -- rest in style. 
TALIESIN: -- I don't know what throwing up the tower means. It sounds weird. Getting at least across-- 
LIAM: Sometimes it's a euphemism, but not always. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's all of my worst fears. I think just getting to the moon for now, and just getting into it, because the caverns are pretty private-- 
LIAM: Either way. 
TALIESIN: Then we can sleep there. At least we're on the other side. 
LAURA: (Imogen) So we could get to the cave tonight. 
ASHLEY: Get there tonight? 
LIAM: So there's some cover on the other side immediately. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's a cave right away-- 
TALIESIN: Also, just in case-- 
LAURA: -- so then you could throw up your tower? 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Yes, it's sort of an extradimensional space. It's vast on the inside, really quite tremendous, but has a low footprint on the outside. 
MARISHA: (Beau) I like the grumpy one's plan. 
TALIESIN: I like the grumpy one agreeing with me. 
LIAM: Are you talking about them or me? 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MARISHA: Well, I would call you by your name and tell you when you're being an asshole. 
LIAM: Sometimes you call me the grumpy one. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Well, sometimes I'm called the grumpy one. 
TALIESIN: You are grumpy. 
ROBBIE: Who's the fun one? You. 
LAURA: (Jester) That's me! 
ROBBIE: I knew it. I knew it. 
TALIESIN: I think, yeah, because just in case something goes wrong on the way there, it's just one less step for something to go wrong, and a little bit of time to-- Just in case something goes wrong, which it always does. 
TRAVIS: True, plus-- 
LAURA: Jester sits next to Braius. 
SAM: He's just stewing off in the corner. Veth has left his side. 
LAURA: Braius? 
SAM: (grunts) 
LAURA: I am really sorry I ruined your life. 
SAM: Are you? 
LAURA: Yeah, I really, really am. That was not the point. 
SAM: What was the point? 
LAURA: Well, kind of to be funny, and also, you know, the Traveler was having a really hard time, and he needed a show of faith, and so that was what he wanted me to do. He was kind of ignoring me at the time, you know? So, I was struggling, and sometimes he wanted a big show of artistic faith, you know? So that's what I had to do! I really do-- 
SAM: Artistic? 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Yeah. 
SAM: Artistic. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm an artist. Are you-- I'm an artist. 
SAM: I've seen what you do, and I would not necessarily call that art. It's more vandalism. 
LAURA: Well, listen. That particular night, it was a bit. But I am a really good artist. Did you see, when you were in Essek's house-- 
SAM: I saw some dicks. 
LAURA: Well yeah, I did those, but I also did a couple of the big paintings, too. 
SAM: Well, those were real paintings. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: You did those? 
LAURA: Yeah! I run an art class at Veth's camp. 
SAM: You do? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Do you have any of your work? 
LAURA: Well, I don't-- (sighs) Yeah. I look in my pink bag and I pull out one painting. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: It's a work in progress. I'm still... But it's a painting of Fjord. He's kind of naked in it. But he's got-- 
SAM: I noticed that. 
LAURA: Yeah. I was going to give this to him as a wedding present. 
SAM: Is that accurate? (snickering) 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
SAM: Mm. 
LAURA: I mean, I embellished a little bit. He doesn't normally wear the crown on his dick, but-- (soft laughter) 
LAURA: I thought it was a nice touch. 
SAM: It is a nice touch. It actually helps with the symmetry. It goes with the shine in his eyes. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I thought too. 
SAM: It's nice, it's a good touch. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
SAM: Here, I'm painting this one right now. I'll pull out of my sack a canvas that has Orym painted on it. There's still work to be done on it. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: This is the little one of our group. 
LAURA: You should make his dick more present in the picture. 
SAM: Oh, that's not a dick, that's his sword. 
LAURA: Oh. (laughter) 
LAURA: It's a really good painting. 
SAM: Yeah, well, I guess it needs work if you thought that was a dick. 
LAURA: Well no, I just-- It's a work in progress, you said. 
SAM: It's splatter. I do a splatter style. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: It's more interpretive. 
LAURA: That's really cool. When did you start painting like this? 
SAM: Well, I found my art when I was excommunicated from my church because of you. 
LAURA: So because I ruined your life, you were able to become such an amazing artist? 
SAM: I guess so, yes. Technically. 
LAURA: Wow. 
SAM: But I also lost my purpose in life and also my fiancée left me. 
LAURA: Your fiancée left you? 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Because you lost your job at the Sanctuary? 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: She sounds like a total bitch. 
SAM: She was awesome. (laughter) 
LAURA: What was she like? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: She was beautiful and kind and nice and smart and she loved me for me, and her name was Suzy Greene. 
TALIESIN: What was her mother's name? 
LAURA: Suzy Greene? 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Wow, that's a really nice name. 
SAM: She was a very nice girl. 
LAURA: Why did she leave you just because you lost your job, though? 
SAM: Because I lost everything. I was sort of-- (sighs) I came originally from this place, the Dynasty. Do you know the Dynasty? 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the Dynasty. 
SAM: They don't really like us over there in the Empire. But I was there, I was allowed to come in as a religious refugee. 
LAURA: For the Platinum Dragon? 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: But then when they kicked me out, I didn't have that status anymore, and they sent my parents back and I lost everything. I was kicked out and so-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
SAM: Suzy said that we couldn't marry anymore. 
LAURA: I'm very, very sorry. Do you want me to send her a message? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: What do you mean? 
LAURA: Well, I could call her and tell her that you've been reinstated into the Sanctuary and that the Platinum Dragon now thinks you're so amazing and you're about to go to the moon on a top secret mission and you're one of the most important people in the entire world. I could tell her all of those things. 
SAM: You could tell her all of that? 
LAURA: All of it. 
LIAM: 25 words or less. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Okay. You would do that for me? 
LAURA: Of course I would. I mean, I ruined your life, it's the least I could do. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Do you need something of hers, or--? 
LAURA: Oh yeah, do you have anything of hers that would help me? You could maybe tell me what she looks like. 
SAM: I do. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Or a thing of hers would be even more helpful. 
SAM: I have a thing of hers. 
LAURA: Okay, give it to me. 
SAM: It's her underwear. 
MARISHA and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That hasn't been washed, has it? 
LAURA: What do they look like? 
MARISHA: What? (laughs) (laughter) 
MATT: Hell yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, they're big. Big old granny panties and there's an extra hole in the back for the tail. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Aw. Was she a minotaur like you? 
SAM: She was a quartertaur. 
LAURA: What is a quartertaur? 
SAM: Well, one of her grandparents was a minotaur, so she-- 
LAURA: Does she have little teenie weenie horns? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, that's so cute. 
SAM: Just a little nub tail. 
LAURA: Okay, so what did she look like outside of that? I've got to get an image. 
SAM: She wore glasses. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: And she had a big old ass. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: And... (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Let's get specific. 
SAM: She had a button nose and big dimples. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Cute. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Big, flat teeth. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: You know, for grinding. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Two eyes made out of coal. (snickering) 
LAURA: Okay. (snickering continues) 
LAURA: Suzy Greene? 
SAM: Suzy Greene. 
LAURA: Okay. Is there anything specific-- 
TALIESIN: Of the Nicodranas Greenes. 
LAURA: -- you would like me to tell her, or just build you up? 
SAM: You said you could tell her all of that, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll tell her everything. 
SAM: All right, yeah, all of that. 
TALIESIN: Who's on count? 
SAM: Tell her that I miss her. I think about her every day. I haven't been the same without her. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: I considered becoming a dark version of myself. 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: But you didn't? 
SAM: Well, I'm at a crossroads right now. Maybe you could tell her that, too. 
TALIESIN: (doubtful) Mm. 
LAURA: Well, would she want you to be a dark version of yourself? 
SAM: No, well-- 
LAURA: Maybe it's mysterious, though. 
SAM: Maybe. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Just tell her I'd love to hear from her or something. 
LAURA: Okay. How would she get in touch with you? 
SAM: I don't know, how does your magic work? 
LAURA: Well, I have to reach out. Unless she's super powerful, too. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Then she can reach out to me whenever she wants to. 
SAM: I guess-- 
LAURA: Does she have magic? 
SAM: No. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Just her personality. 
LAURA: And that sweet, sweet puss. (cackles) Okay, here we go. (laughter) 
LAURA: Suzy! Listen, I'm here with Braius. He's a shell of a man. 
MARISHA: Ooh! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) (laughter) 
MARISHA: (laughing) What?! 
LIAM: You got 14 left. 
SAM: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
LAURA: He misses you so much. But he's become important and super powerful. 'Kay? (laughter) 
SAM: What about the rest? What about the rest? 
LAURA: Hold on, I've got to wait, hold on. 
MATT: You hear "(gasps) What the hell? Who is this? Braius, what? Is this some kind of a joke?" You get the sense she just woke up because being dusk here in Issylra, it is early, early morning. 
TRAVIS: That's never a consideration. 
LAURA: Oh, it's the middle of the night where she is, I think. It sounded like she just woke up. Do you want me to tell her anything else? 
SAM: Everything else. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I love a drunk text. This is amazing. 
LIAM: Before you rattle it off, I'm just going to-- 
ROBBIE: "You up?" 
ROBBIE and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
MATT: I think the dynamics of this... 
TALIESIN: "I miss you." 
MATT: Yeah, it's probably morning. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm going to interject that Caleb, while not close enough to hear any of this, has been just smiling and watching from 50 feet away and has watched the dynamic and Braius' physicality just melt over two minutes, and he smiles knowing that Jester is Jester, and then heads out. 
TALIESIN: Ashton is sitting right next to you just with full "Tell Me More." Yeah, this is "Grease." 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Listen, I'm the person responsible for ruining his life. But now, he is strong and he's being sent on a secret mission. 
SAM: That's good, that's good. 
LAURA: And you are at the front-- 
LIAM: Bep. (laughter) 
SAM: The front of what? What are you-- 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: The front of what? 
LAURA: The front of his thoughts is what I was going to say. 
SAM: Why didn't you say it? 
LAURA: "Of his thoughts," I did say it. 
SAM: Oh, okay. (laughter) 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh wow, Jester sucks at persuasion. 
TRAVIS: Yes. Yes! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes, that's correct. (laughter) 
LAURA: I forgot about that. 
TRAVIS: For years. 
LAURA: 10. 
MATT: Okay. "Look, I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're trying to do, but that was long ago. Leave me alone." 
LAURA: (uncertain humming) You know, she sounded like, number one, she sounded really gross, like she's probably let herself go, okay? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: You could hear that? Could you see her, too? 
LAURA: I couldn't see her, but I could hear it on her voice. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: Was she slurring her speech or something? 
LAURA: It sounded, you know like when you-- It sounded like maybe she lost a lot of those flat teeth. Do you know what I mean? 
SAM: Oh, she was mumbling, or-- 
LAURA: She was mumbling and also she sounded maybe like she hadn't had a bath in a long time. 
SAM: Oh. What of her voice made you think that? 
LAURA: Yeah. You get the vibes. You can get a sense off of things. 
SAM: It doesn't sound like her at all. Are you sure you got the right person? 
LAURA: Suzy Greene, she knew who you were. She knew who you were, and she was like: Oh, Braius? (wistful sigh) But I've let myself so go. 
SAM: Oh, she said that? 
LAURA: Yeah. And then when I was like: He's so powerful, she was like: Oh, that's too powerful for me, is what she said. 
SAM: Do I get the sense she's lying? 
MATT: Make an insight check. (laughter) 
MATT: You make a deception check. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: I love all of this. 
LAURA: Natural 20! 
ALL: Whoa! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: There we go. 
SAM: 17. 
MATT: 17? 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
SAM: She said that? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Something must have happened to her. It doesn't sound like she was so confident before. 
LAURA: Weird. That's really weird. 
SAM: Maybe in a weird way, you helped me dodge a, I want to say bullet but it's like a projectile. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Ball bearing, dodged a ball bearing. 
LAURA: I think there are bullets. 
SAM: A metal projectile. 
LAURA: Yeah, there's things, there's guns here. 
SAM: You mean a pepperbox? 
LAURA: Yeah, that. 
TALIESIN: There's literally one with us right now. It just shoots poop. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: You're right. 
TALIESIN: Poop shooter. 
LIAM: Pooperbox. 
SAM: I have a lot to think about. 
TALIESIN: The pooperbox. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Your name was Jester, you said? 
LAURA: It was. 
SAM: Thank you, Jester. 
LAURA: Saint Jester, the pirate. 
SAM: Saint Jester the pirate? 
LAURA: Saint Jester the pirate. 
LIAM: It's growing. 
SAM: You're the saint of your god? 
LAURA: Yeah. He's super cool. Just letting you know. 
SAM: I also have a pretty cool god, a couple. 
LAURA: Platinum Dragon, yeah? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Unless-- 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Okay. I hope he doesn't get eaten. (chuckles) But if he does, you can have the Traveler. 
SAM: I don't think-- Oh yeah. No, we're going to prevent that from happening. I think your friend wants to fight me. 
LAURA: Which one? 
SAM: The big one. 
LAURA: Oh, Yasha? 
SAM: Yeah, the big monochromatic one. 
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no. She wants to just fight everyone. If they're into it, she's into it, you know what I mean? 
SAM: I do have a lot of stress, I could-- 
LAURA: If it's a friendly fight, yeah. Yasha-- 
LAURA: I'm just standing off to the side sharpening and looking. 
MARISHA: I'm talking to Yasha. (Beau) So okay, he's a big guy. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yeah. 
MARISHA: So I think you can bob and weave underneath of him, you know? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he looks like he's probably going to move slow. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so. 
ASHLEY: So just like pop, pop. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Use his weight against him, you know? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I could use his weight. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You got to practice the slipping that we've been working on. 
LAURA: Hey, you guys. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. 
MARISHA: Hmm? 
LAURA: Braius is so nice and he doesn't want to fight anymore unless you want to do it to release tension. 
ASHLEY: Is this true? 
MARISHA: Is that true? (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
SAM: Sometimes I like to blow off some steam, yeah. 
ASHLEY: You do? 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Friendly? 
ASHLEY: Me too. A little friendly steam? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I got some headgear here recently, actually, if you don't want to-- 
SAM: Some pads? 
MARISHA: Your head is so fucking big. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I got some pads. 
LIAM: Are we sure we don't want to do this inside the tower? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, we can. 
LAURA: (Imogen) I would love to see-- 
MARISHA: Oh, we were just passing time while people finish eating. 
LAURA: -- the inside of this tower. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Wait, I don't understand. The inside of your-- That just appears? 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Don't fight until you've had half an hour to digest. What's wrong with you? 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) We should take them inside the tower. 
SAM: We can do this after dinner, too. I don't want to force it now. 
MARISHA: Well, we're going to get to the moon and then we'll get to the tower and then we'll fight. 
TALIESIN: Moon, cave, tower, fight. 
LIAM: Let's eat like civilized people, make this journey you're talking about. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) But I've been eating this whole time. 
MARISHA: Yeah, same. 
LIAM: Game plan and-- 
ASHLEY: This is delicious lentils. 
LAURA: (Jester) Oh my gosh. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: What? What? What is this? 
LAURA: It's a cupcake. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
LAURA: I know. Caduceus never brings them. 
ASHLEY: Wait, you just came up with these? 
LAURA: No, I like to bring them with me wherever we go. Especially if I know we're going to go somewhere where they don't have these kind of things. 
LIAM: (Orym) Do you have pastries? 
ASHLEY: Wait, can I-- 
TALIESIN: Ashton makes eye contact with you. 
LAURA: Here you go. 
TALIESIN: This might be hell. 
LIAM: Whoa. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: It is other people. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: "It is other people." 
TRAVIS: We went through a fucking portal. 
ASHLEY: This is delicious. 
LAURA: It is. Don't worry. 
LIAM: Is the size correct? 
LAURA: I stocked up, okay? So whenever you want any, just let me know. 
ASHLEY: We used to have a baker with us but he is no longer with us. 
LAURA: Oh, I'm so sorry. 
ASHLEY: Yes. So I've really missed having a really nice, warm cupcake or just pastries. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) We should share a recipe. Oh my god, thank you. 
ASHLEY: Recipes. This is so good. 
LAURA: I don't bake these myself, though, I just buy them. 
LIAM: (Caleb) You lost your little shiny companion? 
ASHLEY: Yes, we did. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm sorry to hear that. We are no stranger to such things happening. It's always hard. 
MARISHA: You had people die, too? 
LIAM: Yeah, once. 
MARISHA: When? When you were fighting in the Astral Sea? 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Don't sound so excited. 
MARISHA: Is that mean? Oh, when you were fighting in the Astral Sea? 
LIAM: Which one of my friends told you about the Astral Sea? 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) I believe I did outside. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he did. 
LIAM: Oh? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yeah. A long time ago. Many years ago. 
MARISHA: Do you think that was like the moon? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) I guess, Astral Sea, the moon. 
LIAM: It's a little different. 
TALIESIN: It all sounds spacey to me. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yeah, we lost one of our best friends. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm so sorry. 
LAURA: In a city that was full of, all the buildings looked like bodies and body parts. 
LIAM: What city was this? 
MARISHA: That sounds awesome. 
ASHLEY: You remember. 
LIAM: Oh, I got confused again. 
ASHLEY: Yes. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's two. 
ASHLEY: He knows this. 
TRAVIS: After three times, you got to do a lap. 
ASHLEY: Yep. 
MATT: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Four, take off an article of clothing. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
TRAVIS: It's like strip poker. Three of them, you got to take something off. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Ignorance is bliss. 
SAM: (Veth) Are you okay, Caleb? 
MATT: Yep. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) But in a strange twist of fate, the one that we lost sort of came back. It's a little confusing. But then again, what's not these days? 
MARISHA: Were they dead? Were they dead and they came back? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) More or less. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) We do have parts of our friend that we keep just in case. 
LAURA: (Imogen) You carry parts of his body? 
ASHLEY: Well, his face. 
LAURA: Oh wait, no. 
LIAM: Now you did it. (laughter) 
LAURA: Fuck! 
LIAM: Just Molly's head in a shoulder pauldron. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) We rep it all the time. 
TALIESIN: We need a jar that we have to throw dice in. Every time you fuck up, you got to throw one of your dice in. 
TRAVIS: He was made of metal. 
ASHLEY: He was made of metal, so it was a different, it was easier to keep. 
TRAVIS: He actually went with your friend Essek to Aeor. He was an Aeormaton. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, he was an Aeormaton. 
TRAVIS: He gave his life to protect us. 
ASHLEY: We still have his face. 
TRAVIS: It was very noble. 
SAM: You have his face? 
ASHLEY: Well, I think so. I think it's his face. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) May I see? 
LIAM: (Orym) Well, this is-- 
ASHLEY: Chet? I don't know. Chet, you should have it. 
TRAVIS: Am I carrying around FCG's face-- 
ASHLEY: Do you have his face? 
TRAVIS: -- in the bag of holding? I'll just hold up the bag of holding and then you can ask for it-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll get it. 
TRAVIS: -- and if it's in there, it'll come out. 
ASHLEY: Don't we have it? 
MATT: You tell me. 
LAURA: Did you take it? 
ASHLEY: I feel like we kept-- 
TALIESIN: Somebody, who has-- 
LAURA: I don't remember taking his face with us. 
TALIESIN: Who has what? 
ASHLEY: But I feel like we kept part of him in case we needed-- 
TRAVIS: If you took it-- 
ASHLEY: Was it the chest part? 
LAURA: We kept a lot of parts. 
ASHLEY: It was the chest piece. 
LAURA: Chet's wearing part of him. 
ASHLEY: The face, the chest. 
TRAVIS: So is Orym. 
LIAM: Orym has shoulder pauldrons made from his shoulder joints. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Which kind of is a little fucked. 
ASHLEY: What? 
LAURA: When you think about it. 
ASHLEY: That I can't tell the difference between a chest and a face? 
LAURA: No, that we're wearing parts of his body-- 
TALIESIN: I don't think so. 
LAURA: -- on our bodies. 
ASHLEY: Why not? 
TALIESIN: Why? 
TRAVIS: We keep him with us, what do you mean? I think he would appreciate it. 
ASHLEY: I just have on his jacket. I think what you guys are doing is weird. (laughter) 
MARISHA: (Beau) I mean, she's got a point. We carried around Molly's coat for quite some time. Yasha had it. She still has it. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) We did. I still have it. 
ROBBIE: Nice coat. 
ASHLEY: I'm still doing good over here. I'm not making any mistakes. 
LAURA: (Jester) To be fair, Molly's coat-- (laughter) 
LAURA: -- is super cool. 
ASHLEY: It is super cool. 
MARISHA: All right, let's get to the fucking moon. Should we do that? Has everyone eaten? 
TRAVIS: I think so. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
TRAVIS: So we go through the water, through the hole. 
MARISHA: Going to go through the water. 
TRAVIS: We bamf over to the cavern on the moon and then we set up Caleb's dick tower. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, Veth, you ready to go for a swim? 
SAM: (screams) No! 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Oh, actually-- 
LAURA: Was this a fancy feast that we were eating? 
TALIESIN: It was not a fancy feast. 
LAURA: Why not? 
MARISHA: Wait, it wasn't? 
TALIESIN: Because we're not cats. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) If you're worried about the water, by the way I have the ability to make people breathe underwater. 
TALIESIN: No way. 
TRAVIS: It's not an issue. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Well, I think I-- 
TALIESIN: It's not time for that yet. 
SAM: Still going to touch me 
MARISHA: Hang on. We got to talk to your sister-in-law. That's who she is, right? 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Maeve and Leeta? 
MARISHA: Yeah, Maeve and Leeta. 
LIAM: You're talking to me, right? 
MARISHA: Yes, I'm talking to you, Orym. 
LIAM: Leeta, yes. 
MARISHA: Because the Ashari can part the sea. 
LIAM: Maeve would probably take care of that, yeah. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) But if they don't, we actually have a thing called a hole and we could just open it. We could throw you in it and then close it up and take you with us. You never have to get wet at all. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. But we just have to make sure that it's less than 10 minutes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, you will suffocate. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, because you'll suffocate. 
MARISHA: We've killed a lot of people in it. 
SAM: No. No, thanks. I don't want to go into a dark suffocating hole. 
TRAVIS: Oh, what's life without a little danger, sweetness? 
LIAM: Well, let just talk to my sister. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) In the hole, no one can hear your safe word. 
ROBBIE: Do you just not like water, or does it affect you as person? 
SAM: I don't like water in general. No, I don't. 
ASHLEY: I really am curious to hear more about how you and your husband, or estranged, have this open situation. 
SAM: Oh, well, I mean, I don't-- We don't-- I-- You and I can talk about it later when we're alone, or something. How about that? 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: Is your husband also a minotaur? 
SAM: I'm sorry? No. Oh! Oh, no. He's not. He's a very lovely halfling, like me. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: Yeah, he's very sweet. 
LIAM: (Caleb) He's a very good fellow. 
SAM: Very good. Very good. Sweet. I'm starting to feel guilty now, actually. Yeah, he's wonderful. He's wonderful. I don't have an open relationship. 
ASHLEY: But your kid is an asshole, you said? 
SAM: Oh yes. My kid's an asshole. 
ASHLEY: You don't like your child? 
SAM: No, no. I like him. I love him. I just hate him. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Yeah. 
SAM: Just right now. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I get it. Love and hate go hand in hand. 
SAM: He's a teenager. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. God. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: Yeah. But I love him. 
ASHLEY: Can't even imagine. 
SAM: He's so great. 
LIAM: Teenage years are rough. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well-- 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Shall we? 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: If the Hells feel like leading the way. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: This way! 
MARISHA: Yes, follow Fearne! Actually, follow Orym. Orym, please. 
LIAM: Orym starts padding his way down towards the water looking for-- 
MARISHA: So we didn't eat a fancy feast? 
LAURA: Imogen floats. 
MARISHA: Why wouldn't you fix us a fancy feast? 
TALIESIN: A, I can't get everybody. And B, I think, since we plan on spending the night there, doing it at the very end of the yeah. 
LAURA: We are going to spend the night there? 
MARISHA: That's fair. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to go the tower. 
LAURA: We're going to eat again. It's our midnight snack. 
LIAM: Dessert. Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't take long. 
MARISHA: That's fair. 
MATT: Once you get back to the water's edge-- 
MARISHA: Lentils. 
MATT: -- where the number of Air Ashari tents and the guardians of this lake and this entrance have been stationed, you find Leeta, Maeve, and a number of other familiar druidic counterparts who've been keeping an eye on it. Maeve gathering the folks around, and as they all begin to set up a position about looks like there's five specific druids of fair enough power to contribute to this that all spread evenly about 10 feet from each other, facing in a direction towards the center of the lake. Maeve stops a minute and turns back to you, Orym, and is like-- 
LIAM: (Orym) Hey, I think we might be ready to go. Close to ready to go. 
MATT: "Right. Okay. Okay. Yeah! No, we can get that set up for you. All right. Gather! Gather! We're going to go ahead and, looks like we don't have time to practice. We're sending them off now. So--" 
LIAM: Is this quick? 
MATT: "We would hopefully wish you'd travel there rather quickly." 
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: "We can't hold the water back too long." 
LIAM: We're a tight group of 15. 
MATT: "Okay, just keep at a nice, solid jog." 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: As she's talking, Leeta approaches from the far end of the water and comes up and, "So you're off, brother?" 
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. This is it. 
MATT: "Well, I look forward to you coming back, and you can tell us all about this wild experience." 
LIAM: I would like nothing more than to tell you everything that happens. 
MATT: "Good." 
LIAM: Wherever you land in all of this, you be careful, too. Okay? 
MATT: "We will. At least we'll be in familiar territory." 
LIAM: I reach out and do one of these guys. 
MATT: Yep. Clasps. 
LIAM: Just like Dad taught us, one moment at a time, one day at a time. 
MATT: As she pulls back, she still clutches your forearm and takes to a full standing height. Is pulling you a little bit towards the front of your feet and, without breaking eye contact, shouts over her shoulder, "Here we see off the Savior Blade of the Tempest and his compatriots to a mighty endeavor. Keep your thoughts, keep your luck and keep your hearts with them." 
LIAM: I hold eye contact and cast Gust and a swirl of air around us and both of our short haircuts just blow in the wind. (whooshes) (laughter) (coughs) (sniffs) 
MATT: At the top, you see all the other Ashari step out of their tents and everyone just takes a stoic stance, watching all of you gather at the edge of the water. As Leeta releases your grip, she looks to Maeve. "Maeve?" Maeve goes and just rushes out and gives you a big hug and then lets you go. "(throat clears) All right. As we discussed, and we're about to practice. (exhales) On three. One. Two." 
LIAM: Get ready to run. 
MATT: "Three." They all begin to mutter beneath their breath, in semi-unison, this incantations that call out to the spirits of the land. Some meander in different incantations, drawing from inspiration of the Wildmother, the others calling to the bound nature of this lake and asking permission to pass through the waters. As they all culminate together, just a few seconds behind each other, you watch as this faint, bluish-green energy emit from their fingers and the edges of the water begin to curl back, like reverse waves crashing into nothing. (intensifying whooshes) As it pulls away, you can see all manner of small crustaceans and various lake bottom creatures skittering back to catch up to the water. But slowly, it begins to split and divide to about a 10 foot wide pillar of open, waterless lake. It is a very muddy, thick muck that greets you there, as most lake bottoms are. But you have a path ahead in which water is not a concern. 
MARISHA: You see Beau dart ahead and, even though it's muddy, she's just gliding along top of it. 
MATT: Heck yeah. All of you begin to gather up quickly. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: And head into the lake. 
ASHLEY: Yasha's going to go over and pick up Veth. Come on. 
SAM: (Veth) Oh! Thank you! Although, I'd rather ride him. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yasha goes up to Braius. Here. 
SAM: (Braius) Oh! 
ASHLEY: Slaps him on the ass. 
SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Ya! 
SAM: (grunts) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Did you just h'yah me? (laughter) 
MATT: As you all trek rapidly through the sound of the rushing waters nearby and the instinct to expect them to come crashing in any moment, that anxiety building within. As you follow the path here into the dark shadow of the center of this lake, if somebody has some means of bringing some light to it, that might aid you in this journey. 
SAM: None of us have the Light spell. 
TRAVIS: I'll summon the Star Razor and use the word: Galas'var! 
LAURA: That works. 
TRAVIS: And the sword (pulsation) emits this glowing light. 
MATT: This beautiful elvish blade, this long sword of incredible runes suddenly apparates in this half-orc's hand and gives off this bright, vibrant, divine light that lights up the space, like the golden glow of a torch. You can see in this-- another example of the strange troop among you carrying with them truth to their words and a very immediate reason as to why they've also been chosen with such a dangerous task. It doesn't take too long before you come towards the deepest parts of the lake, sloshing through bits of the undergrowth. Oh my god, Sam! (laughter) 
LAURA: Jesus! 
LIAM: It took about a minute for him to see it. 
MATT: Sorry, I was in the story! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Still alive. 
MARISHA: Was that-- Oh no! 
ROBBIE: Oh, that's a good one! 
MARISHA: Was that from Candela? 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: I don't know what that's from. 
MATT: It's from the Candela live show. Anyway. Having to leap past all the various underwater heavy plant life and stuff. Eventually, since there is no real swirling portal, instead you come to elements of rock, deeper red rock than the rest of the surrounding stone. There, just past a space that's barely wide enough for the largest of your troop to pass through is just a black tunnel beyond. 
LAURA: (Imogen) This is it. 
LIAM: (Orym) Well, we got to use it or lose it. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) See you all on the other side. I'm going, Caduceus is going to head down that way. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Why don't y'all go first? 
LIAM: But it's instant swim, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Right? Don't we have to swim up at the gap? 
LAURA: I don't think so. 
MATT: You leap in. As you leap in, you hit wet rock. The source of the water that normally flows through here is being held back by the druids. So right now, what normally is an underwater river that has been cut off from its source. So it is freshly dripping, like (plops)-- 
LAURA: Cool! 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- all around. 
TALIESIN: Is there anything interesting on the walls? I know it's natural cavern, it's natural rock, but does it seem like any signs of unusual activity of magical essence of carvings, anything? 
MATT: Well, as you come to the portal itself, the entry that you step into, you can feel that permanently set carving in space you can feel that permanently set carving in space that connects this to somewhere else in time. These ancient portals are rare that connect two points in Exandria, or in this case, beyond. But you feel the transition as soon as you dive in through the hole. It's like (whooshes) you feel that that crossing over the threshold and then hitting the wet stone beneath. Going through with the light at your disposal, you don't see any carvings. It just looks like natural carved rock. 
LIAM: It's like that line in the Lincoln Tunnel where it says, "You are now crossing into New Jersey." (laughter) 
LAURA: Imogen follows after you and sends out her flickering Dancing Lights. 
TALIESIN: I also have a light, just in case. 
LAURA: Oh. I didn't know what was going to happen. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. Mine's a little less. I tap the crystal on the staff and it starts illuminating. But that's really-- 
LAURA: Wow! 
TALIESIN: Those are really great. Mine doesn't fly. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Those are very, very, very pretty. 
MATT: You all emerge from the edge of the very, very small, tight tunnel into the subterranean cavern bit, and where the rest of the pool continues on into a deeper cavern to the left where it has a larger roof space. Then there is, to the right, the rock wall that clambers up at a relatively steep angle and seems to be broken through. 
LAURA: In a way that it was before? 
MATT: In the way that you had left it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But you stand in this open space. After you all come into the chamber and get your bearings, only 10 seconds later, the water (whooshes) flows once more, passing a few feet to the left of where you are, and what was now this emptied river of water fills up rapidly and continues its long-set, natural state. 
SAM: As the water comes, Veth goes, (screams) and grabs onto Braius-- (laughter) 
SAM: -- for a little-- 
ROBBIE: Wait! I was your stand-in Braius? 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: Because you-- (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I'll take it! 
LIAM: Caleb is one of the last one in and globules of amber light float in with him and begin to co-mingle above everyone's heads with Imogen's crackling, pinkish colored-- 
LAURA: Ooh! Yeah! 
MARISHA: Cool. 
LIAM: -- and around Caduceus's lit up staff in the center. Disco room now. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: All right. Do you all know where to go, or? 
LAURA: Yeah. We could make our way up. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Makin our way ♪ 
LAURA: Are we doing the tower, though? 
LIAM: (Caleb) Well, how much room do we have? It's just this one chamber and then topside? 
LAURA: Pretty much. No, quite a few underground passageways-- 
TALIESIN: I think we get a little further in. 
LIAM: Well, maybe if we could get away from the wet that would be good for my friend Veth. 
LAURA: Sure. There's not a lot of solid ground from here on out. It's a lot of tunnels and whatnot. 
TALIESIN: We do hit the city at some point, though, if I recall. 
MATT: Well-- 
TALIESIN: Or no? 
MATT: No. You find a large, smooth, carved tunnel that was burrowed by some creature that you have yet to encounter, but only had visions of your first visit. Then, that tunnel eventually comes to an end point where you broke through to the surface and that got you closer to the city. But then there was an extended element of traversing the open, cracked landscape of Ruidus before you reach the mountain range that cradles the upper portion of Kreviris. 
LAURA: So the idea would be to teleport into the city, avoid all of that desert. 
TALIESIN: Would we teleport from the surface or would we teleport from here? What's easier for you? I don't know how this shit works. 
LIAM: It can be from anywhere. Here is fine. If there is a little bit more of a dry area a bit ahead, I would prefer that. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, me too. 
LAURA: Sure. Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: We can go into the tunnel. 
TALIESIN: I can get mossy if I'm not careful. 
MATT: Okay. You climb up the cliff face to the right of where you in. It's not an extreme steep climb. Most of that is on the other side of the chamber that you climbed to even find this region. But you do eventually find the larger tunnel. It is quite wide and continuous. You would think it was carved as part of the beginning of a sewage system in its size and consistency. But also having traveled in subterranean tunnels, Mighty Nein, especially those that have been dug by large worm-like creatures in the past, you recognize this as being a natural burrow of some terrifyingly gargantuan entity. 
LAURA: Can I make a suggestion? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: If we're planning on teleporting after this-- 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Wouldn't it be wise to do that tonight? 
LIAM: You are correct, but is there a safe place to-- 
LAURA: I can send a Message ahead to the owner of that shop. There's a basement level that we get a cellar that we could hide in, put the tower up. I don't know how much room you have. 
LIAM: So you have friendly-- 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Oh, that sold the weapons! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: You have friendly contacts inside? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Well, that changes everything. 
LAURA: Yeah. The Volition. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Yeah. Her name was Rashinna. 
LAURA: Yeah. Rashinna. 
MATT: Rashinna was the head of the village. 
LAURA: Right. But the owner of that shop, though-- 
MATT: The owner is Jidoh. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Jidoh. 
MATT: Zhesh was the Reiloran who helped you with that. 
LIAM: Did we buy blades there? 
LAURA: We bought blades there, and Laudna bought the little figurine. So yeah, we had-- 
LIAM: The figurine is from that shop. 
MARISHA: The figurine is from there. 
LIAM: Yeah. That's way better. 
LAURA: So we could teleport to that location. and set up your tower. 
LIAM: (Caleb) All right. All right. 
TRAVIS: In the basement. 
LAURA: In the basement. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Then, come up and out in the morning. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. Perfect. 
ROBBIE: So we're still underground, is that correct? 
MATT: You are. Yes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: We're underground where? 
TRAVIS: On the moon. 
LAURA: On the moon. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! Guess what? (clears throat) So Dorian goes-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Oh wow! This is so creepy! When do we teleport to the moon? (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh, right. We're on the moon. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Dorian. This is it. 
ROBBIE: We're on the moon? 
LAURA: This is the moon. 
ROBBIE: It happened? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: When did it happen? I missed it! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) When you jumped through. 
LAURA: When we went through that hole. 
ROBBIE: We went through the hole? 
SAM: (Braius) It didn't feel like anything. 
ROBBIE: It didn't feel like anything! Mighty Nein, we're on the moon! 
TALIESIN: Everybody! Everybody, they're fucking with you! We're not on the moon yet. 
ROBBIE: We're not on the moon? 
TALIESIN: Nah. 
ROBBIE: (sighs) Shit! 
TALIESIN: No, we are. Just fucking with you. 
LAURA: (Jester) We're not on the moon? I thought you said-- 
ROBBIE: We're on the moon! 
SAM: I don't know, I've never been here before. 
ROBBIE: We're on the moon! 
LAURA: We're on the moon? 
SAM: I've never been here before. 
ASHLEY: We're on the moon. We're on the moon. 
LAURA: We're space pirates! 
ROBBIE: We're on the moon! 
LAURA: We're space pirates! 
ASHLEY: We're on the moon! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Ah! 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Maybe could we keep it down a little bit? 
ROBBIE: Oh, sorry! 
TRAVIS: We're supposed to be stealthy. 
TALIESIN: If you're going to be loud-- 
ROBBIE: I'm just really excited! 
TALIESIN: -- this is the place to get it out of your system. 
LAURA: This is infiltration. 
TRAVIS: Clandestine. 
LAURA: (Jester) You guys, shut up! We have to be quiet. 
ROBBIE: It feels like just a regular cave! I didn't know what happened! 
LIAM: (Orym) Wait. Can we have quiet for a second? 
ROBBIE: Sorry! 
LIAM: Does Orym hear any giant monsters? (laughter) 
MATT: Make a perception check. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) I'll join in that. 
LIAM: (laughs) Natural 20. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Oh, nevermind. 
TRAVIS: Sneaky, clandestine-- 
LIAM: For a total of-- That's Caleb. He does not have great perception. (scatting) 
TALIESIN: I was going to join you in that, but. 
LIAM: 33. 
TALIESIN: That's great. Never mind. Fuck that. 
MATT: Okay. Robbie, roll a d20 for me. 
SAM: Oh shitties! 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: I'm sorry! I was excited to be on the moon! 
ASHLEY: Robbie-- 
LAURA: You dick! 
ASHLEY: You better-- 
TRAVIS: You summoned the doom. 
ROBBIE: Boom, baby! 
LAURA: Oh, is that a-- 
ROBBIE: It's not great. Maybe it's not. I don't know. It's an eight. 
SAM: Maybe it's great. 
MATT: It's an eight. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Maybe that's good. 
LIAM: I thought you were switching into Dink for a second. 
ROBBIE and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: That's accurate. 
MATT: So-- 
ROBBIE: (Dink) I don't know. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So you listen and you do hear a shifting, thrumming, bassy vibration, like a (low rumble). At first, you're worried that maybe something's rummaging through, but you pick up on it because there's also the faint whistle location that comes with it. You get the sense that, wherever this tunnel opens up at the surface, there is currently a very heavy storm blowing overhead. 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
MATT: It is causing the wind and the general interior of this tunnel to carry that vibrative sound. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Is there a problem, young man? (Orym) No. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I just think it sounds pretty stormy topside. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Oh, that is something we might have to deal with. There are a lot of storms. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, the storms are wild. 
TALIESIN: I can help with that. 
MARISHA: (Beau) What? 
LAURA: (Jester) I can, too, actually. 
TALIESIN: I said I can help with that. 
LIAM: (like Caduceus) I've got a prayer for that. 
ROBBIE: It's in my name. 
MARISHA: Well, what do you mean, Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: I've been working on a few things. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: You know, I've had a lot of time to myself. 
LAURA: That's right, you weren't with us. 
TALIESIN: With which one? I mean, I have a lot on my plate as well, but-- 
LAURA: I know, I know. 
TALIESIN: It's been a rough three weeks, I don't know. 
TRAVIS: So to the shop then? This-- 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah, let me send a message to-- 
MATT: Zhesh, or--? 
LAURA: Zhesh. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Or Jidoh? The owner, or--? 
LAURA: I'm going to send it to Zhesh. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. (sighs) We need a safe haven. Is the weapon shop clear? Just for a moment. 
MATT: Is that all? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. About 10 seconds pass before a response comes. (Zhesh) "Things are very intense around here. It's cluttered, but should serve a safe space for now." That's all. 
LAURA: It's safe. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) You know what's interesting about her voice? She can do a message and it's very precise. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It wasn't the same. 
MARISHA: To the point. 
ASHLEY: Just a little, right to the point. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It's great. 
LIAM: (Caleb) A little less fun, though. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: (Veth) Yeah, it lacks personality. 
LAURA: (Jester) What, like that's hard or something? I could do that, too, if I really wanted to. 
ASHLEY: I know, I'm just saying it's nice. 
SAM: I like the way you do it. 
ASHLEY: Precise. 
LAURA: Thank you, it's a total waste if you don't use all your words. I mean, what's the fucking point? 
SAM: That's right. 
LIAM: (Orym) I thought we had buried our grievances and we're good. Are we good? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Yeah, we're also trying to stay quiet. 
LAURA: I'm totally fine. Oh sorry, I know. 
MARISHA: We just like to talk shit. 
TALIESIN: Just general grievances. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Sorry, Laudna, may I see this little statue? 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Yes. Wait, what? 
LIAM: The statue you referred to. 
MARISHA: Oh, yes. 
ASHLEY: It does make sense. 
LIAM: Yeah, now it works. 
LAURA: Oh, and Chet will probably-- 
MATT: Dorian, you were about to say something? 
LAURA: -- need that as well, because-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Did you want to say something? 
ROBBIE: No. 
LAURA: Oh wait, do you have a--? 
TRAVIS: I have the glass, Ruidian glass. 
LAURA: Oh, perfect. 
TRAVIS: From the weapon we bought. 
LIAM: He turns it in his hand a few times, studies it and then-- 
MARISHA: Isn't it pretty? 
LIAM: -- hands it over to Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Thanks. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Are we going now? 
LIAM: This is a Martian tchotchke? 
MARISHA: Yes. It's got special properties. 
LIAM: What kind of properties? 
MARISHA: Like when people who have psychic abilities and can use their mind, it vibrates. 
LAURA: Oh, actually if they're going to the mind weaver, they should load up on that shit. I think it cancels out the psychic abilities, doesn't it? 
MARISHA: It does-- What's it do again? 
LIAM: What was that? 
MATT: Look in your-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I have two daggers that-- 
MATT: What does it say on the daggers? 
MARISHA: -- that Sashimi wields. I would really hate for-- (laughter) 
SAM: Seems like a good use. 
MATT: I think so. 
MARISHA: I would really hate for Sashimi-- 
LIAM: Yeah, I don't have mine anymore, so I don't remember. 
MARISHA: Oh wait, this is fucking Beau. Oh, I'm having-- It's the problem, but in my head. 
ROBBIE: You have two tabs. To tabs! 
SAM: Open a different tab! 
MARISHA: Oh, I do have another sheet! 
SAM: Tabs! Tabs! 
MARISHA: Wait no, I have two tabs, but that was also Beau. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Double Beau tabs?! 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
LAURA: It's just all Beau? 
TALIESIN: ♪ Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun ♪ 
ROBBIE: Double Beau tabs. 
LIAM: Oops. 
MARISHA: Wait. 
TALIESIN: Dually Beau'd. 
ROBBIE: ♪ Into the sky ♪ 
MARISHA: Hang on, it's loading. All right, so what it does is it... 
TALIESIN: That's not mine; I keep reaching for it. 
MARISHA: (mumbles item description) 
LAURA: (Jester) Hey, Fjord! 
MARISHA: -- wielding the-- 
LAURA: We're on the moon. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) We are, we're on the moon. It's pretty amazing. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Maybe we could do our honeymoon on the moon. 
LAURA: (gasps) If we don't destroy it. 
TRAVIS: Or die. Yeah, or die. 
LAURA: Yeah, or die. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Maybe we should get married before we go fight this final battle. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: Because what if we die in there? 
LIAM: Do you want to do a-- 
TRAVIS: I don't think there's a need rush for that. 
LIAM: -- simple ceremony in the tower? 
LAURA: No, I want a big, beautiful ceremony. 
SAM: (Braius) I could do a ceremony for you if that's something that you-- 
TRAVIS: Oh no, no. Jester is very particular. She needs time to plan. 
LAURA: Yeah, lots of really big-- 
TRAVIS: Lots of time. 
LAURA: A lot of dress and a lot of decorations and stuff like that. 
LIAM: Yeah, but you know sometimes people go to the courthouse. They do something brief and then they plan for a larger affair. I will stop talking now-- 
TALIESIN: Pepperbox wedding. 
LIAM: -- before she kills me. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: So this is Sashimi. 
SAM: Oh! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) You see a nightmare doll puppet with a porcelain face and a weird jester hat. 
TRAVIS: That's awful. 
MARISHA: Chetney has taken off her hands and now she has two glass blades for hands. 
LIAM: Puppet Master! 
MATT and ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It's so great. 
LAURA: It is pretty cool. 
MARISHA: Yeah, so this is Sashimi. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Function. 
MARISHA: She's very pretty, but can be very deadly. So maybe we can get you some more of these daggers because basically you have a chance, when you hit them, you have a chance to hit real good. Criticals are better, and also if you're near someone, a Ruidian-born with psychic ability, you get extra attack power and damage. It's better. 
SAM: (Veth) I don't think we have a Ruidusborn with us, but-- 
MARISHA: No, but if you're fighting them, then you'll be near them. 
LAURA: We'll be around a lot of them probably. 
SAM: Maybe they would make crossbow bolts with that. 
LAURA: (gasp) 
ROBBIE: Wait. Wait, wait. How many are there? 
MARISHA: Well, I have two on Sashimi. 
ROBBIE: Could we loan them the harness and maybe... 
TALIESIN: We are also going into-- Oh! 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LIAM: (Orym) That's right. We have to remember the next time-- 
LAURA: Oh, yeah. 
LIAM: -- we do that. 
ROBBIE: We could give Mighty Nein, I know it's a gamble, but maybe two of you that it's best suited for could absorb them and use it in your upcoming fight. 
LAURA: I don't know what this harness is. 
MARISHA: You want to absorb Sashimi? 
MATT: You would know from studying the glass, the glass doesn't carry an enchantment to it, necessarily. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
MATT: I mean, you wouldn't know this, but you would know from studying it before, it has an inherent ability because of the proximity of-- 
MARISHA: Oh, right. Okay. 
MATT: -- its creation and its origin. But it's not necessarily an enchantment that would transfer. 
ROBBIE: I tried. 
TRAVIS: If you manage to hit somebody-- 
MATT: It was a good thought, though. 
TRAVIS: -- they have disadvantage on-- 
ROBBIE: I don't know much about magic. 
SAM: ♪ I don't know much ♪ 
MARISHA: They have disadvantage on intelligence saving throws. 
LAURA: ♪ Do, do, do ♪ 
MARISHA: If you hit them. 
LIAM: I don't remember the stats anymore. There's no protective resistance versus psychic or anything like that? 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: It's just damage. 
TRAVIS: It just weakens them. if you hit them, a little. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: But yes, let's check in. Maybe Zhesh has some that can-- (gasp) Zhesh rhymes with Veth! Kind of. 
LAURA: Well... 
ROBBIE and TALIESIN: (skeptical groans) 
TRAVIS: Except not at all. 
SAM: No, it kind of does. 
TRAVIS: Weird. 
SAM: It kind of does. 
ROBBIE: It's just one similar vowel. 
TRAVIS: Are you taking all 15 of us or halfsies? 
LIAM: (Caleb) That's a little outside of my capabilities. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I was just checking. (hums cockily) 
LIAM: I mean, I could go and come back and then do it again. 
TRAVIS: You shall pass! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yay. 
TRAVIS: It's a white staff, right? It could be a white staff. 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: Fuck! (laughter) 
SAM: Are you really a Planewalker? 
TRAVIS: I am, yes. 400 years and counting. I've seen many things, but none of them as pretty as you. 
SAM: Oh, well, I mean, (laughs nervously) so many suitors today. (laughter) Right? 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: (Braius) Yes. (laughter) 
SAM: Are you single? (Veth) No. (Braius) Well, then no. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so who's doing what? 
LIAM: All right, well so Mighty Nein around me and then Bells Hells... 
ASHLEY: Around Chet? 
LIAM: Ja? 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Chet. 
MARISHA: (Beau) I wonder, does it make sense for us to do a little half and half? Just in case? 
LAURA: Just in case your wolf guy-- 
LIAM: You want to cross the streams? 
LAURA: -- fucks something up? 
MARISHA: Fucks it up? Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Excuse me? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
LAURA: Look-- 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Well, Chet, it's not a bad idea to have-- 
ROBBIE: Yes, and then you'd have to track the split party and remember who's with who at all different times. 
SAM: Yeah, let's do it. 
ASHLEY: I really, really like this idea. 
MARISHA: Ideally we won't be far. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) I can make this super easy. I can't believe you people don't know how to do this. 
ROBBIE: I think it's a great idea. 
MARISHA: I'm more concerned, it has nothing to do with you, dog-man. It has-- 
TRAVIS: Wolf! 
MARISHA: -- more to do with Caleb because we've never, yeah, we got this little trinket but we've never been to the basement that we're going into. 
LAURA: I volunteer to go with the wolf! 
LIAM: The trinket will do it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: But you are an experienced mage. Are you not, grandfather? 
TRAVIS: Very much so. Mm-hmm. 
SAM: (Veth) How about me and the minotaur, the blue boy, the dead girl-- 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Oh! 
SAM: -- the monk-- 
MARISHA: (Beau) (grunts) 
SAM: -- the old man, and the green man all travel together? 
MARISHA: And then-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: The big bitch and Fearne. 
ROBBIE: Could you say that again so I can write it down? 
MARISHA: The big bitch, the big bitch. 
TRAVIS: Yep. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Miss Jokes-a-Lot and Imogen. Orym and Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Don't you fucking dare. Don't you fucking dare. 
TRAVIS: What? 
MARISHA: Ashton. 
TRAVIS: I was going to say Ashton could go with Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MARISHA: And Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) I want a name. 
TRAVIS: Chef. 
TALIESIN: I want a name, give me a name. 
TRAVIS: Chef! 
TALIESIN: Ah, that's really nice. 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Master Chef. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait. Wait, Caduceus, you were going to say something, that you had an easy way to figure this out? 
TALIESIN: Oh, I was thinking, the immediate notion would be-- 
SAM: Reverse alphabetical order. 
TALIESIN: The reverse notion would be, (laughs). It was difficult because it was Ashton's idea. So hold on, Ashton's got it. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm sorry. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Yeah, actually no, it's no problem. It's really nice not to be the most fucked up in the group for a moment. 
TRAVIS: Right. 
TALIESIN: Both of us. One magic wielder, one healer, and one punchy person minimum in each group so that if something goes wrong, you at least have options. 
LAURA: We're all going to the same place, though. 
TALIESIN: If something goes wrong, though, because sometimes magic gets weird. 
MARISHA: I really like the idea of this group who's standing on this side of the cavern. 
SAM: We just so happened to be over here. 
MARISHA: And then we just happened to be over here, so we'll roll with Chet. 
TALIESIN: Why is it-- Why is it that I just disagree with you so much, but you're also, so far, the one I like most from the new people? 
MARISHA: No, that tracks. I get that a lot. 
LAURA: Hey! 
TALIESIN: You're pretty cool. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you're all right. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I don't know you very well, I hate new people. 
TRAVIS: Alakazam. (startled noises) 
MARISHA: I just spit. 
TRAVIS: Come on, bitch, I'm fucking with you! (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so what object are you using as your focus? 
TRAVIS: The glass from the Ruidian scythe that I purchased from the shop. 
MATT: You got it, so as you hold the staff and you feel the energy siphoning because it does a little bit of damage to you, the usage of this many charges of it, but as it does, you watch as the runes glow and the top ones fade as that magic is expended. This side of the room, suddenly, you feel this strange collapsing of the gravity around you for a moment, like you're all being pulled together before (whoosh) space seems to bow out around you and as it does, you're all standing in absolute darkness if not for the currently still glowing sword being held by Fjord Stone. You look around you and there are all manner of boxes and crates. Most of them are empty except for some raw glass, greenish-teal glass material. It looks like all the lids have been pulled off and some of them have been tipped over with some scattering bits of broken glass. You see a ladder that leads up to what looks like a closed, latched trap door. what looks like a closed, latched trap door. It's not a terribly spacious basement. Maybe 20, 25 feet on each side and with all the boxes in there, it's even more tight around you. The other half of the room. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Caleb? 
LIAM: I am using the little bit of driftwood art from Carmel that she gave me. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (snaps) 
MATT: Perfect. And with that casting of the spell, (swoosh) a different sort of experience but the same outcome as you all feel pulled forward and you catch yourself with your foot as if you're about to fall onto your face and as you catch with the other foot, you're standing in another space entirely. Here next to the rest of your compatriots in this enclosed space, all 15 of you are now pushed up around in this dark area with the one glowing sword above you. 
LIAM: This is a very small space for a meet cute. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Is this big enough for your--? 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) You're standing on my foot. 
LAURA: (Jester) Sorry. 
TALIESIN: Is that your foot? 
LIAM: Well, if everyone could back away five feet from me specifically for a moment? 
ASHLEY: Where do you think we're going to do that? 
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to cast Detect Magic in here. I want to see what pops up. Caduceus is casting-- 
MATT: Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: Detect Magic. 
MATT: Nothing pops up other than the numerous trinkets-- 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
MATT: -- and objects that you and all these new and old compatriots carry. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, also hoping that I hit the upstairs of the, if there's anything glowing through the wall. All right. 
MATT: Nothing. 
TRAVIS: I take 14 points of damage from the awesome stick. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Do your friends know that we are here? 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah. Yeah, they knew we were coming. 
ROBBIE: (chuckles) 
LIAM: All right, good. Caleb will push through the group and go to one wall. What's the floor here? 
MATT: The floor here is a rough, reddish stone ground. It's not very well-hewn or polished. It looks like the basement was carved into the rock itself, and just enough for functionality more than any aesthetics. 
LIAM: So with very little room, Caleb throws his coat behind him and takes a knee and pulls out Calianna's wand, and I put it upright and I have some pieces of granite that I use to prop it so that it stays standing and there are bits of stained glass arranged just so, and a small wooden cat, and in a few minutes, you guys are just seeing the top of my head as I'm crouched over it, and then a shimmering rectangle goes (swooshes) up one wall. 
ASHLEY: Ah. 
LIAM: And I push a door open that has come into reality. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Oh my god. 
LIAM: You start to see lights sparkling in from a larger chamber beyond. There's a lot more room in here. I'll step inside. 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Wait, where is that going? I don't understand. 
LAURA: Apparently, a tower. 
LIAM: It's a tower. It has nine sides. 
TRAVIS: Can I (sniffs) use my nose and get a whiff of what's coming from within the doorway? 
MATT: What does he smell? 
TRAVIS: Fucking-- 
LAURA: Lots of cats. 
LIAM: Very faintly, you smell pancakes. Very faint, though. 
MARISHA: Is Pancakes the name of a cat? 
LIAM: No. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's a cute name for a cat. 
MARISHA: It is. 
LIAM: I have a cat named Waffles, but I do not have a cat named Pancakes. 
TRAVIS: It smells good. 
TALIESIN: Laudna, dare me. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Dare you-- 
TALIESIN: To jump in. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. (laughter) 
SAM: (mockingly) Dare you. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Full speed. 
LIAM: Caleb is already plunking up the brass stairs to the central platform that is about 15 feet off the ground in the giant entry hall, ringed in on all nine sides with stained glass windows, each to the nine schools of magic here in Exandria and then he begins to float. Come on, come on. No need to delay. 
SAM: Clop, clop. 
LAURA: This is a bit eccentric. 
LIAM: Willkommen. 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. 
MARISHA: It's very fancy. I like it. 
TALIESIN: There's a younger me that would've been so excited to steal this silverware. (impressed laugh) This is so cool. 
ASHLEY: We didn't know that this was hidden under here in this basement. We could have stayed here last time. 
SAM: (Braius) I think he conjured it, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MARISHA: Is this tower protruding out of the floor into the city? 
LIAM: I'm already floating 60 feet above you. 
MARISHA: Oh, there he goes. 
LIAM: Well, we're technically not on the moon anymore once you have come in here. We are in another place. 
LAURA: Oh shit, how--? 
LIAM: Just go down through the door that you're-- 
SAM: We were just on the moon. 
ROBBIE: It's a little sad. Only like 30 seconds on the moon. 
LIAM: I know it's pretty meager in here, but I think the higher you go, you'll be happy. 
LAURA: (Jester) And the bonus is-- 
LIAM: He disappears into a hole. 
LAURA: -- you don't have to be quiet in here anymore, guys! As she floats up. 
TALIESIN: Is this some sort of helium wizard? Hold on. Yeah, so it's in the center, everyone is doing the floaty thing? 
LIAM: That's right, that's how it works. 
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm going to go in there. I want to Willy Wonka this. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, indeed, in the center of the chamber, you lift up as you will yourself up. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm (boom). I kick off. 
LIAM: Now, Ashton, as you fly through, there is an irised open portal in the ceiling of this giant room and once you pass through, there is another hall, not as tall, but on all nine sides, there are wooden doors that have swung open all around the room and each of them is set up a cabana bedroom on the beach where there are curtains hanging out and there's a very handsome four-poster bed in each of those rooms. I just prepared this in a rush because there's so many of us. So Bells Hells, you are free to wander anywhere in the tower, but-- 
ASHLEY: We can go anywhere? 
LIAM: Just about anywhere, yeah. 
MARISHA: (excited pants) Let's go. 
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Just about? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Laudna casts Spider Climb and starts (pattering)-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: -- climbing all over the tower. 
LIAM: Did you get out of the center? 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm sitting on the hammer for that. I click the hammer and I'm just sitting, taking it in. It's real nice. 
LIAM: As you go over the side of this chamber-- 
MARISHA: I'm a skittering roach. 
LIAM: You're above the beds, but there are grooves in the wall and a spectral cat goes (screech) (hiss) and flies up-- 
MARISHA: (scream) 
LIAM: -- out of a tunnel at the sight of you. 
MARISHA: (confused grunts) I poke my head into the tunnel. 
LIAM: I think you're skinny enough to fit in there. You climb-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: -- in like Gloamglut squeezing through a temple window and you can see a cat anus about 50 feet ahead of you glowing down a dark tunnel. 
TALIESIN: The cat anus is glowing? 
ROBBIE: Glowing? 
LIAM: Yeah, it's a spectral. 
TALIESIN and ROBBIE: Oh, oh, oh. 
ROBBIE: I missed that part. 
TRAVIS: It's a dark star. 
MATT: Yeah. The arcane butthole crack. 
LIAM: The darkest part of the cat. 
ROBBIE: Got it, got it, got it. 
MARISHA: I dislocate my shoulders to get even thinner and then use the tip of my fingers to-- 
MATT: To Bishop your way through? 
MARISHA: -- keep moving, yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's fun. 
LIAM: A polished wooden marble run in here and it splits off into three directions, and the more you travel through it, you realize that these things go through every wall of this place. 
MARISHA: (excited noise) 
MATT: Do you continue to go? 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: All right. 
ROBBIE: She's in the walls. 
TALIESIN: She's in the goddamn walls! (laughter) 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: Hell yeah. Yeah, don't even worry about making a check. You just start wandering through the walls. Okay. As you all scatter off to begin to wander and find your individual rooms and prep for an evening of hopeful rest before what is likely to be a very chaotic event in the day to come, a series of events with a very chaotic crew, we're going to take a break. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Oh! Woo! 
TALIESIN: This has been wonderful, chaotic fun. 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up from this chaos. We'll see y'all soon.

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, Bells Hells and Mighty Nein, as you've begun to wander about the inside of the Nein-Sided Tower, finding your various bed chambers or getting lost in the various tunnels of the walls, is there anything you'd like to do before the evening closes? 
LAURA: (Jester) Yeah. We should have a midnight snack. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Oh yeah, I'm going to-- 
LAURA: Just in casies. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to get the assistance of a bunch of cats. As many cats as I can get. You have baking cats, yeah. We're going to make a big midnight dessert. We're going to need two of them. 
LAURA: I'm going to help you. 
TALIESIN: So, this is just pastries, full on. 
LAURA: I'm not going to bake anything, though. I'm just going to use my magic. 
TALIESIN: I guess we can do it that way too. That's fine. (laughs) 
LAURA: I just feel like it's faster. 
TALIESIN: No, no, it's okay. 
LAURA: I'm not a very good cook Caduceus, so. 
TALIESIN: I was just going to figure you could bake some things. I could-- No, let's just get it done. Clearly. Could be our last meal. 
ROBBIE: Caleb, is there anything that makes musical noise in your home? Is there a-- 
LIAM: I mean, I can just wish for it to happen and we can have it, but it is always nice. I see the instrument you are carrying. 
ROBBIE: Oh, I thought maybe if you had a canonical piano or something in this realm that makes music. 
LIAM: Do you need a piano? 
ROBBIE: What? 
LIAM: Do you need a piano? 
ROBBIE: I don't need one, but if you had one-- 
LIAM: I have a piano if you need a piano. 
ROBBIE: Then I-- 
SAM: (Veth) Oh, just fucking play something! 
ROBBIE: Okay! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Can you make a piano? (laughter) 
LAURA: You know, Yasha plays, too. 
ROBBIE: You play, too? 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) I do. 
MARISHA: (Beau) She's a very talented harpist. 
ROBBIE: Really? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Stringed instruments are your specialty? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I can play with you, if you would like. 
LIAM: All right, so I gather everybody-- 
TALIESIN: I play a whistle, but I'm really busy cooking. 
LIAM: There is one floor. It's the third floor in here that is a large library and salon, multi-tiered with a library shelf. This is just for you, Robbie. 
ROBBIE: Yes, yeah, thanks. 
LIAM: Library shelves, and chaise lounges, and little different well-lit cubby holes where you can go have separate conversations or gather together. 
LAURA: Can go have se-- 
LIAM: There's a big fireplace. 
LAURA: -- have conversations. 
LIAM: Yes, they have soiled my tower on numerous occasions. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: I assumed. 
LIAM: I usually just leave for a couple hours. There's a giant fireplace with a stained glass window above it with the pattern of Mollymauk's coat on it. There is a harpsichord. 
LAURA: You can bone around the fireplace, too. Molly would've wanted it. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
ROBBIE: Okay. (whispering) Who's Molly? To Beau, I say. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Molly-- Kingsley-- 
TALIESIN: Please say "some asshole." 
TRAVIS: It's a... we'll get into it later. 
ROBBIE: All right, well. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: We don't really have to. 
MARISHA: He kind of died. Kind of died. Came back. Was a really big bad guy that we fought and then turned into a-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, you got into it. 
MARISHA: -- f-ally? Well, it's the TL;DR. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ROBBIE: They'll write a book about it or something, so. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I take out-- 
TALIESIN: Quintoculus. 
ASHLEY: -- my bone harp. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: The harp is made of bones. 
ROBBIE: Is it-- 
ASHLEY: Put together in an-- 
ROBBIE: Is it big, or is it a hand harp? 
ASHLEY: It's kind of a hand harp. 
ROBBIE: Oh, okay. 
LIAM: There is a stunning harpsichord right next to the fire for you to play. 
ROBBIE: Do you know this one? (tune of "Heart and Soul") ♪ Doo doo doo doo, ♪ ♪ doo doo doo doo ♪ No, just kidding. Ah! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (imitates harp, continuing "Chopsticks") (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Ah, you are very talented. I knew it. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I'll start to play some kind of pretty tune and see if we can drop it together. 
LAURA: We could set up our midnight snack in here while they play. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it only takes 10 minutes, I suppose. 
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: By the way, Laudna, when you eventually crawl out of the hole, you come into this one chamber that is almost V-shaped, and it is a kitchen, and it has got about a hundred amber-colored spectral cats in here. Most of them house cat size, but there are a few full-on tiger-sized cats walking around with trays on, and there are, funnily enough, red ribbons strewn from holes all over this room, crisscrossing and hanging, and there's bells hanging, and one of them goes (bell ringing), and you watch as a cat goes (meows) and then goes up a little tunnel and disappears out one of the marble runnels. It is like the CPU hub of the tower. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) (gasps) This is amazing! Sprinkle, look at it! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: (grunts) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I like that you're holding yourself with the fingers, though. (clicks) (laughter) 
LAURA: (Imogen) Laudna, honey. They're setting up some sort of magical snack for us. 
MARISHA: Okay. I'm not sure where I am, but there's a bunch of magical cats! 
LAURA: Come follow the music, because Dorian and Yasha are going to play. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. Make a-- 
LIAM: Are you using the tunnels? 
MATT: -- perception or a-- 
MARISHA: I don't know where the fuck I am. 
MATT: Yep, perception or a survival check. 
MARISHA: So, last game, Robbie was like, "I'm going to use my background feature," which I forgot was a thing. 
MATT: Okay. What's yours? 
MARISHA: Mine is that, being an urchin, I know the secret patterns and flow to cities and I can find passages throughout the urban sprawl that others would miss! 
LIAM: Cat city. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Then I know the fastest location. Would that count? 
TRAVIS: Apply to this magical tower? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Cat city, bitch, cat cat city, bitch ♪ 
MATT: To the tiny cat backrooms, if you will? 
MARISHA: Yeah, cat backrooms. 
MATT: Roll a perception or a survival check. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Okay. That's fucking fair. 
ROBBIE: With advantage because of the feature? I mean, I don't-- (laughs) 
MATT: I'm adjusting the DC accordingly. 
TALIESIN: If you went Form of Dread into a cat demon, would it make it better? 
MARISHA: Maybe freak out all the cats. 
TALIESIN: I don't know, you get catty stuff. 
MARISHA: That's pretty good. That's a 15, so 22. 
MATT: Oh yeah, yeah. You don't even take same path back. You hear the music at Imogen's insistence and head slither your way through a series of new passages. 
MARISHA: ♪ Pussycat, pussycat, I love you ♪ 
MATT: And pour out of one elevated hole. Just like. (slurps) (thuds) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
TALIESIN: Ugh! 
MARISHA: (huffs) 
LIAM: Did you two find the kitchen? 
TALIESIN: Oh, we decided that we're not doing it that way. 
LIAM: Not doing it. Okay. 
TALIESIN: We're just going to make it magic. 
LIAM: I looked at you, Caduceus, and then I looked over for Jester, but she wasn't there. It was Imogen. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I can see how that-- 
LAURA: I was talking to my girlfriend. 
TALIESIN: -- would be very confusing. 
LAURA: But-- (Jester) Did you need me? 
TALIESIN: Ah! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Nah. So, we're just going to magic a bunch of food. 
LAURA: Yeah. All of my food is heart-shaped. What about you, Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: All of my food is not heart-shaped. 
LAURA: Hmm. Boring. 
TALIESIN: We'll see. 
LIAM: Maybe like a human heart. 
ASHLEY: I thought your food would be shaped like a dick, Jester. A missed opportunity. 
MARISHA: (Beau) To be fair, if you take one of the hearts and then you take one of Caduceus's little and put them together, it looks like a dick. 
LAURA: I knew it would happen. 
ASHLEY: Clever. Well, anyway. 
SAM: (Veth) What is this song? What is this song called? 
ROBBIE: Oh, it's an old classic. Maybe your party's bard knew it. Did you have a bard in your party, or? 
LAURA: Oh, do all parties have bards or something? 
ROBBIE: I just sort of-- 
SAM: We have Yasha. 
LAURA: I mean, Yasha plays-- 
ASHLEY: It's me-- - but she's not a "bard-bard" bard. 
ASHLEY: I know this is classic. That's how I know it. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
SAM: What is it? 
TALIESIN: We try and keep a low profile, I feel like. 
ROBBIE: It's called the-- 
ASHLEY: I forget the name. 
ROBBIE and ASHLEY: -- Alabaster 
ROBBIE: -- Baby. 
ASHLEY: -- Bay. 
LAURA: (Imogen) "Alabaster Baby"? 
ROBBIE and ASHLEY: It's called "The Alabaster Baby." 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Insight check! 
ROBBIE: Yep. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I haven't hear it in so long. 
TALIESIN: Oh, such an insight there. 
LAURA: No, I remember my mom used to sing this as a lullaby before she left-- 
MATT: Make a-- 
ASHLEY: ♪ Alabaster-- ♪ 
LAURA: When I was a baby. 
ASHLEY: ♪ --baby ♪ 
ROBBIE: No. 
TALIESIN: No, I was Ashton. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) Oh, oh, oh, okay. 
TALIESIN: Caduceus would know it. Ashton-- 
ROBBIE: We're fine. 
TALIESIN: Caduceus don't care. 
SAM: Ahem. Ahem. Would you care to dance? (Braius) Oh, me? 
LAURA: (laughs) Uh-- (Veth) Yes, it's a lovely song, don't you think? (Braius) Well, yes. It is a classic. 
ROBBIE: I nudge Yasha. Play something kind of slow and sexy. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, okay. 
ROBBIE: I'll jump in, I'll jump in. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. 
SAM: (Veth) Yes, one dance before dinner, maybe. (Braius) I guess that couldn't hurt. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: It's just super horny harp music. 
SAM: Sure, sure, sure. 
ASHLEY: So horny. The horniest harp music you've ever heard. 
ROBBIE: Yep. 
LAURA: (Jester) Veth. 
SAM: (Veth) You look so sad. (wheezes) (Braius) Yes, well, it's been a weird day for me. Your friend freaks me out a little bit. (Veth) Yeah, she does that to everybody she meets. (Braius) So, you have a husband? (wheezes) (Veth) Yes, I do. We're actually very happy. (Braius) And yet you're trying to get with me for some reason? (Veth) Yes, well, it's a problem I have. I don't know why I'm so attracted to minotaurs. (Brauis) I mean, we're very handsome. (Veth) Yes, but, oh, I don't know. I shouldn't be doing this. 
ROBBIE: Keep playing, keep playing. I want this moment to play out. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Keep playing! 
MARISHA: I feel like this is how Sam writes scripts. (laughter) 
LAURA: It all ends with Sam boning himself. (laughter) 
SAM: (Veth) Forget it, I can't do it! I can't do this. Veth runs off. (laughter) 
LAURA: Veth, don't run too far. You need to eat something. 
SAM: Oh, you're right! She comes back. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I think at this point we have a nice table of sweets. 
LAURA: Yeah, we have a nice spread. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Well, yeah, you've got the hearts. I made little moons. Little red moons. Little red hearts. We've got little-- 
LAURA: That's so cute! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, little moon cakes. 
ASHLEY: That is cute. 
LIAM: Purple horseshoes and yellow diamonds. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's right. 
TALIESIN: Don't you-- 
LAURA: Just a couple. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) So, you all live here in this tower? 
LIAM: (Caleb) Yeah, this is a home-- 
TALIESIN: Sometimes. 
LIAM: -- home for the nine of us. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Well, I mean, when we're traveling, when we're on missions, but I actually normally live with her. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yeah, she lives with me. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Oh wow. (laughter) 
MARISHA: We have a really nice little cottage in Zadash. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you do? Do you have a garden situation? 
MARISHA: We do, yeah. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yes, I tend to it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: Yeah, we are neighbors. Not too far from, if you were in my home, it was just about a block and a half away. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Oh, really? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MARISHA: Caleb and I, we're still doing a lot of work together. 
LIAM: We're partners. 
MARISHA: We're work partners, yeah. 
SAM: (Braius) If you ever need any furniture, you know, Chetney over there is-- 
MARISHA: Oh yeah? 
SAM: -- an MC. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) (snores) 
SAM: Oh. (laughter) 
SAM: By the fire. (laughter) 
LAURA: That's an easy way out, I see. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Well, I would love to do a little exploring before bed. 
LAURA: (gasps) You're a druid, right? I can sense it on you. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I am. 
LAURA: Okay, listen. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: So, can you turn yourself into animals? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I can. 
LAURA: Me too. 
ASHLEY: You can? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Should we-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: -- go explore as animals? 
LAURA: We could turn into cats or whatever and we could go live amongst them for a little bit. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Oh boy. 
LAURA: But-- 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: We do need our rest, because it's a long busy day tomorrow. 
ASHLEY: We do need our rest. 
LAURA: But maybe just for a little bit. 
ASHLEY: Maybe just a little bit, and then maybe just for a little bit. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Then you could show me around. 
LAURA: Yeah, but shove some of this food in your face, because we need to get better. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: (scarfs food) 
ASHLEY: Om-nom-nom-nom-nom.

MATT: First off, your hit point maximum increases by 2d10. 
SAM: Who rolls? 
MATT: I'll say just one of you roll for both of you. 
TALIESIN: Actually, you roll one d10. I'll roll the other. 
MATT: Let's do that. 
LAURA: Good idea. 
ROBBIE: Fun! 
LAURA: ♪ (humming) ♪ Oh, it's because I rolled an Imogen dice. I should have rolled a Jester dice.

SAM: I am just putting it in temp. It's easier. 
ASHLEY: I'm putting it in temp. I get too confused. 
TRAVIS: (burps) 
MATT: Also-- (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Jeez. (laughs) 
MATT: He's got feelings. 
ROBBIE: This is intense. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll put it in temp. 
MATT: Also, for the next 24 hours, you are immune to poison. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
MATT: Both to status and any poison damage. 
ROBBIE: Sick. 
MATT: You're also immune to becoming frightened, so nothing can make you fearful. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Is there a-- 
MATT: And you have advantage on all wisdom saving throws. 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
LIAM: Clutch. 
MATT: Which is huge. 
LIAM: Huge here. 
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. 
LIAM: Caleb is also going to go over to Yasha. Yasha, come here. Bend down a little bit and he places his thumbs-- 
LAURA: Bend over. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LIAM: Thank you, Jester. - onto her temples, and slides one thumb right into the center-- 
LAURA: Into the butt. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Come on, Caleb. Give it a try. 
LIAM: Do you want to cast this? (laughter) 
LIAM: -- in the center of her forehead between her eyes, and then the other hand comes free and begins to trace lines through the air. I cast at 8th-level Mind Blank on you. So you for 24 hours, nobody can fuck with your brain. Let me get it up. I'm in Orym's page! 
TALIESIN: I keep clicking on the wrong one, too. 
ASHLEY: No brain fuckery. 
LIAM: Until the spell ends, you're immune to psychic damage. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
LIAM: Any effect that would sense your emotions or reach your thoughts, divination spells, charmed, don't work. 
LAURA: that's huge. 
LIAM: It foils Wish spells, effects of similar power used to affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target. 
ASHLEY: Thank you, Caleb. 
LIAM: Then I use my 9th-level slot to do it to myself. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: So, for 24 hours. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: So, we don't need a wild barbarian. 
ASHLEY: We don't need to fight me as well. 
MATT: All right, so both of you-- 
ASHLEY: Thank you, Caleb. 
MATT: -- are affected by Mind Blank. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm-- 
ROBBIE: Cool. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Pretty cool. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Pretty cool. 
ROBBIE: Pretty cool. 
LIAM: All right. Does your group have any tricks? 
SAM: (Veth) Oh. 
LIAM: Maybe? That would-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, maybe. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, no, 100%. 
LIAM: If we're having a communal table. 
MARISHA: I start making Sashimi and Pâté, now Sprinkle, do, you know, a commedia dell'arte type of style play. 
LIAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: That's really fun. I don't think that's-- 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) It's helpful. 
TALIESIN: -- what they meant. No, I mean, I'm entertained. 
LIAM: I'm a fan of the arts. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
TALIESIN: Love theater. 
LAURA: I don't know if I have anything that lasts for a day. 
SAM: Most of mine lasts for an hour. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, mine's an hour. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, same, same. 
TALIESIN: Eight hours at best. Oh. (Caduceus) Eight hours at best. 
ROBBIE: I got some good stuff. 
TALIESIN: Ah, shit. 
LAURA: (laughs) Okay. 
ASHLEY: I mean, we have things like that, but I don't know if we should use them now, because-- 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Later. Later. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Is it still the same day that Dorian sucked in a thing in the... 
LAURA: It is still the same day. 
MATT: Yup. 
LIAM: It is, so after we wake up, we can do another one. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Correct, yeah. So, that will have passed by the morning, and then you could do another one. You could do multiple ones if you wanted to. You just have to roll the dice to see if it-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah, I wonder-- 
ROBBIE: It's a gamble. 
LAURA: -- if the Mighty Nein have any things that they would be willing to suck into a harness. 
TALIESIN: Nothing super fancy. 
LIAM: Still one a day though for that device, unless we want to risk breaking it. 
LAURA: I mean, it might be smart at this point in time. 
TALIESIN: That's true. 
LAURA: You know? 
TALIESIN: I'd say one more day personally, but-- Well, no. This might be the last day. 
LAURA: This might be it. 
LIAM: This might be the last-- Do you want to use it 'til it smashes? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. Tomorrow morning we use it-- 
MARISHA: So it's, what, a 20% chance that it busts? 
ASHLEY: 20% chance or it goes down 20%? 
MATT: No-- 
TALIESIN: 20 each time. 
MATT: -- meaning each additional time it's used in a 24-hour period, there's a 20% cumulative chance. So, 20% for the second one, 40% for the third, 60% for the-- 
LIAM: You're going to break it. 
MATT: Yeah, it just-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: You can try it. 
TALIESIN: It's always a vibe. 
LIAM: You know, Caleb notices that a hundred feet away across the salon, the little halfling fellow is sitting on a chaise by himself. He's oiling his sword over there. So, I walk over and I take out sending stone, and I knock it on a wooden railing. You're awfully far away. (Orym) Oh. Yeah. Just a lot to process. (Caleb) It is indeed. You know, over the past few weeks, I tried to use this to reach out to you. (Orym) I did the same, actually. It never worked. (Caleb) Yeah, well, magic has been a little bit temperamental the last few weeks. You know, I'm tempted to ask you if you're all right, but I know that with what everybody's dealing with tomorrow, it's a silly question. You should probably be with your friends. (Orym) (sighs) Yeah. I just, yeah, I don't want to burden them. (Caleb) Hmm. You know, not that wisdom is synonymous with age, but I have been around this flat earth a few more times than you. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LIAM: And-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I can see you shouldering it, and it is harder to do if you don't tell your friends what's on your mind. (Orym) Yeah. (sighs) It's so much. They're all dealing with enough on their own. They don't need it. (Caleb) Well, that is foolish talk, Orym of the Air Ashari. Maybe you and I are not going to see another 48 hours. If not now, when? Anyway. Don't mean to talk your ear off. 
LAURA: (laughs) Come get something to eat before it goes bad. Stick to the pastries. 
MARISHA: Laudna goes up to Beau. Hey, Beau! (laughter) Beau! (Beau) No. And she walks away. (laughter) 
LAURA: Jester is feeding heart cakes to Dorian while he's playing. This way, you can still keep entertaining and you don't have to lose out on the Heroes' Feast because it's really good for you. 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. (chewing) 
TALIESIN: Ashton is going to be taking moon cakes over to Yasha and also just offering so that you can keep playing. 
ASHLEY: Get that out of my face. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'll put it in my mouth. I have a question, if you don't mind. 
ASHLEY: Well, finish your fucking food. Getting crumbs all over my harp. 
TALIESIN: (spits) How did you snag that? Because I've been trying to, I don't know. I've been trying to hook up with this girl. I've been completely off my game. I don't know what's going on in my head. I've been freaking out. But like, how? You shouldn't have enough game for that, and yet here you are, and you have so much confidence? 
ASHLEY: The fuck? 
TALIESIN: I'm asking-- 
ASHLEY: Listen. I am not the person to ask. I have zero game. 
TALIESIN: But how did that happen? 
ASHLEY: I don't fucking know. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
ROBBIE: Then Dorian plays (sad trombone on piano). 
TALIESIN: I take some of the half-chewed moon cake and I toss it at you. 
ROBBIE and MATT: (laugh) 
LAURA: You need to have some advice on how to get with a person? 
ASHLEY: Yes, she's the one to talk to. 
LAURA: Because I could give you some advice. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, I'm desperate. Okay. 
LAURA: Tell me who it is. Is it in this group? Is it in this room? 
TALIESIN: Do any of us know anybody else at this point? 
LAURA: I don't know. I don't know you. 
TALIESIN: I don't know anybody else other than these people. 
LAURA: Okay, let me guess. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: Is it the little old man? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We've already had a torrid affair. It didn't end well. 
LAURA: Okay, is it the dead woman? (laughter) 
MARISHA: "The dead woman." 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY and ROBBIE: "The dead woman." 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: (gasps) Is it the girl with the purple hair? 
TALIESIN: No! No, no, no, no. 
LAURA: What about the big furry girl? With the horns? Horns are pretty sexy. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. No. Y-y-yeah. Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay, it's her?! (gasps) 
TALIESIN: (frantic shushing) 
LAURA: Tell me everything you've done. Have you told her how you feel? 
TALIESIN: I have. I mean, I kind of fucked up some shit and there was a moment and then everything kind of fucked up. I fucked up really big. It's kind of what I do because I'm no good at actually maintaining reasonable relationships with people. I'm a self-sabotager. I'm well aware. I need more to drink. 
LAURA: Well, I think you're very charming. 
TALIESIN: I'm really not, though. But thank you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You are also crazy. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: You're welcome. I mean it as a compliment. 
LAURA: Okay, so. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: She's super hot. She's got big boobs. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair. I mean, I'm-- I like all sorts of-- 
LAURA: You're not into her boobs? 
TALIESIN: I love everything. I'm a big fan of everything. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I like hot. Definitely hot. 
LAURA: All right, she's very hot. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I wasn't going to say anything, but I noticed. 
LAURA: She's really hot. 
ASHLEY: I saw it, I saw it. 
TALIESIN: That's why I actually brought it up. It's fine. No, no, no. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Have you written her a love letter? 
TALIESIN: I mean, I'm not that kind of person. I don't know. I don't think she's that kind of person. Honestly, I just want to see where something goes, Honestly, I just want to see where something goes, but I fucked up so bad in the beginning. 
LAURA: I'm going to give you a copy of this book. 
TALIESIN: You are? 
LAURA: Listen. It's a great guide on how to woo somebody. It's called Tusk Love. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LAURA: It's got a lot of what girls like, even though they don't like to admit it, you know? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LAURA: So there's two ways you could go about this. My fiance over there, he's so romantic. 
TRAVIS: (sneezes) 
TALIESIN: Mm. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: He's hot. 
LAURA: He's super hot! 
TALIESIN: He's super hot, totally get it. 
LAURA: Okay, so he didn't used to dress like this. This is how he dresses now. 
TALIESIN: Well done. No, yeah. 
LAURA: So fucking good. 
TALIESIN: You fixed that. 
LAURA: Look at those nipples hanging out. 
TALIESIN: No, it's really-- 
LAURA: Listen. 
TALIESIN: You could cut glass with that. 
LAURA: When he first kissed me, he was super shy about it and he was like, "Jester, can I kiss you?" And I was like, "Okay." It was super romantic. Another way you could do it, though, is just go up to her, grab the back of her head, dip her over, and just plant one on her face. 
TALIESIN: She's a bit taller than me, so actually that would require some size stuff, but I get what you-- 
LAURA: You're super strong, right? 
TALIESIN: I'm very strong, I mean, yes. 
LAURA: You could go up to her and just put your face in her boobs because that's about where you are, right? 
TALIESIN: I'm a little taller, but I mean, honestly, I can just bend at the knees. 
ASHLEY: I think this is a great plan. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, again-- 
LAURA: Then say, "(gasps) You are my everything. You're my heart and my destiny. I can't imagine myself without you." 
TALIESIN: I mean, but I can. But yeah, I get it. (laughter) 
LAURA: "You light me on fire!" 
TALIESIN: That's fair. That's actually very true. She has, a couple times actually lit me literally on fire. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Then if all else fails, just tell her exactly how you feel. 
TALIESIN: Oh fuck, okay. 
LAURA: Be honest, because that usually works. 
TALIESIN: That doesn't usually work. By the way, I got to say that pamphlet was really good and I appreciate the little maze at the back. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
TALIESIN: Where you have to get from the beach all the way to the volcano and then you get the golden dick. That's pretty cool. 
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, here. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you have more? 
LAURA: Well, I have more pamphlets if you want to pass them out, I'm more than happy to give you some more. But no, this is just a little dick. You can pray on it whenever you want to think of the Traveler. 
TALIESIN: I feel like I already have a dick to pray on, but I'm into it. All right. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That went well. 
LAURA: Fjord, you light me on fire! And I dip him and I kiss his face. Then I lift up and I shove my head in his chest. 
TRAVIS: Ah! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I told you these shirts aren't big enough. 
TALIESIN: Woo, yeah! 
LAURA: You're so sexy. 
TALIESIN: Hot! Love it! 
MARISHA: Somewhere, a patch of Henry Crabgrass just died. (laughter) 
MATT: 132nd generation. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Fearne has been in the other room and I have turned into a cat, just a white fluffy cat, but also a Scottish fold. So they have little teeny ears. 
LAURA: Oh, so cute. 
ASHLEY: So I come in the room. 
LIAM: Caleb clocks the real cat immediately. 
ASHLEY: Looks for Jes-- goes in between Jester's legs and goes out the door. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LAURA: Oh, oh my gosh! Caleb! Fjord, my darling. Poof! I turn into a little blue cat and follow her up. 
TRAVIS: Not that, not that! Oh fuck! 
ASHLEY: (meows) 
TALIESIN: I can't turn into a cat. I'm going to-- yeah, they're adorable. 
ASHLEY: I want to go to where we're not allowed. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: And I feel like-- 
LIAM: I mean, that does exist here. 
ASHLEY: Yes, and I feel like Jester will take me there. 
LAURA: I twitch my tail. 
ASHLEY: We wrap our tails around each other. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, and the two of you go wandering off in your cat forms. Caleb, do you care to let them wander? 
LIAM: Well, they could go anywhere they want in the tower, but eventually they would reach a floor-- So each of the different floors of the tower, there's a brass irising open and closed shutter. And you reach a floor where that shutter is closed. 
ASHLEY: (meows) 
LAURA: (mews) (laughter) 
LAURA: We're going to try to figure out a way to get up into it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: How? 
LAURA: Well, we're cats. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: We're going to look for little doors that go into the wall to see if I can find a cat door that opens up higher than where we are. 
ASHLEY: (meows) 
MATT: Okay. Roll a perception or survival check for me, if you don't mind. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Can I assist her? 
MATT: Sure, yeah. So you can roll with advantage. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay, 19. 
MATT: 19, pretty dang good roll. Caleb, are there any pathways? 
LIAM: They-- sealing off on this floor. 
ASHLEY: Damn. I was going to-- 
LAURA: I know. 
ASHLEY: (meows) 
LAURA: (I-don't-know meow) (laughter) 
LAURA: We can't talk to each other when we're polymorphed, right? You can't use your voice. 
LIAM: You do find-- You can get into, well, you can't get into bedrooms because the bedrooms all have little latched doorways so that the cats can't just invade uninvited and Scanlan can't crawl through them. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LIAM: I'm thinking in advance. (laughter) 
SAM: (Scanlan) Our son. 
ASHLEY: Your son? 
LIAM: You can get into Caleb and Veth's laboratory. They have a shared laboratory. 
LAURA: Okay, we'll do that. 
LIAM: All the kitchens, yeah. There's like a magic workshop and laboratory to fuck with if you want. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I feel like we would go into the laboratory and just knock things over. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. (laughter) 
MATT: Just 30 minutes of (shattering). (laughter) 
MATT: (clanging) 
TALIESIN: Nothing but eye contact from you two. 
MATT: (objects rolling) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, let me fuck around. Beau goes and finds Fjord after they've left. Yo. 
TRAVIS: (sniffling) Huh? 
MARISHA: You doing all right? 
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking cats. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. 
TRAVIS: Every time. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TRAVIS: I always think we'll come back and it'll be Schnauzers, or I don't know, little weasels. 
MARISHA: Well, there was that one time that Caleb let me turn them all into dogs for Yasha. Don't tell him that, don't tell him this, but I kind of preferred it when it was dogs. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I would also throw my hat in that ring. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he was very stubborn about it, to be fair. 
LIAM: A tiger walks by. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
TRAVIS: What is the function of that? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It sure feels unnecessary. 
TRAVIS: It does. (sneezes) 
MARISHA: Ah! (laughter) 
MARISHA: I give him a little bit of whiskey, kind of like a hot toddy, warmed up whiskey. Here. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. Very considerate. 
MARISHA: What do you think about these kids? 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: You think they're going to make it? 
TRAVIS: No. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I think that this is the definition of cannon fodder. 
ASHLEY: "No." 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yes. I mean, obviously they're meant to break the way as a diversion and then we do our thing. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I was wondering that. You think they're literally being put forth as bait? 
TRAVIS: I mean, it seems like they were drawn at random. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: The one old one, the guy made of rocks, the big lady. I mean, you know. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: One, she has pink hair and purple lightning going up her arms. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Purple hair. 
TRAVIS: Where is the-- 
LAURA: Purple hair. 
MARISHA: Cohesion? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: He's color blind. 
MARISHA: No, that's fair. Yeah, I kind of think they all might die. 
TRAVIS: Purple hair. 
MARISHA: I don't know. If they die, what happens to us? Are we supposed to go in and fucking back them up? What the hell happens? 
TRAVIS: That was not part of the arrangement. No, I don't think so. I mean, I have to admit, they do have a nice vibe. But I think our task is different from theirs. I don't know how we can be focused on ours and then keeping an eye on them as well. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Well, we're top brass. They're a fucking grab bag that you can get at Taste of Tal'Dorei. 
TRAVIS: Chumps, yes, chumps. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I've never been there, by the way. 
MARISHA: You've never been there? 
TRAVIS: No, you keep saying how good it is. 
MARISHA: They just opened one in Zadash. 
TRAVIS: I know. 
MARISHA: You've been on the river, or fucking the ocean for too long. 
TRAVIS: That's true. They don't have any out there-- 
MARISHA: They don't have any. 
TRAVIS: -- in the open sea, no. 
MARISHA: Well, next time you come by, we'll go. It's real dumb. 
TRAVIS: Do you think we need to buff them in some way or give them a handout? 
MARISHA: I don't got shit. I don't think, besides what Caduceus did, I don't know if we can. 
TRAVIS: You can't teach them some moves like a fucking hook kick or some shit? 
MARISHA: Over fucking night? If they tried to get into hand-to-hand combat, the best thing they should do is just go fetal. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You'd be frankly irresponsible to try and put false hope in their head. 
TRAVIS: That's true. The little one with the sleeve, though. I mean, he looks like he could hang. 
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, yeah. No, he's cool. He's all right. Anyway, well. I just think we're aware, if anything, I care about us, I care about Mighty Nein, and they're a fucking liability. So if shit goes wrong-- Oh god, I'm such an asshole. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, yeah, but it's a fair point. I mean, are we here to babysit or are we here to take care of our job? 
MARISHA: It feels like babysitting up until a certain point. 
TRAVIS: Well maybe they've done something to earn this sort of trust. I don't know. I can't imagine what. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Maybe it should be us fighting Predathos, you know? Why isn't it us? 
TRAVIS: I hadn't thought of that. Why isn't it us? 
MARISHA: I think because we don't have a Ruidusborn. Are you Rudiusborn? 
TRAVIS: Shit! No, were you born under a moon? 
MARISHA: No. (snickering) 
TRAVIS: Fuck. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TRAVIS: Maybe we-- Hmm. Maybe we should keep an eye on them, or we could bribe one of them to join our side. 
MARISHA: You know, the one that's like a deer, she's seems pretty pliable. 
TRAVIS: With the hooves? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Eager, almost. 
MARISHA: I feel like I could give her a sucker and she would come over with us. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's true. 
MARISHA: All right. Well, ultimately if things go tits up, I just want to make sure that we are aligned. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we're team focused. 
MARISHA: We're team focused on us first. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: If things go bad, our own people first, and then if we can help them, fine. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, we take care of our part of the puzzle. Then if we have to clean up their part, we do that. 
MARISHA: We'll assess. All right. I just wanted to make sure. Really hope they don't die. 
MARISHA: Do you have any more of that hot toddy? 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, here. Let me go get some honey. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
MARISHA: I'll be right back. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: (Caleb) Excuse me, Mr. Pock O'Pea. Are are you sleeping? Grandfather? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) I'm so allergic to cats. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I can barely breathe in front of this fire. (raspy breath) 
LIAM: Is is there anything that I can get for you, anything? 
TRAVIS: An EpiPen. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Like a quill? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Well, your cat came by. It was making biscuits in my ass. 
LIAM: Listen, this is a little embarrassing. I didn't want to lead with it, but I am very honored to have you here. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: He just cracks one eye open. (laughter) 
MARISHA: What?! 
TRAVIS: What do you, what do you mean? 
LIAM: I didn't want to be too forward about it, but when I was a child-- 
ROBBIE: No. 
LIAM: -- in Wildemount, my parents used to take me once or twice a year into Rexxentrum, the big city, and we could never afford to buy them ourselves. But I used to stand in the windows of the toy shops of Rexxentrum and look at your work and dreamed what it would be like someday to own a Pock O'Pea original. I was never able to as a child. But now I'm not a child. I have several of your pieces upstairs in my personal chambers, and it is just a great honor for me to meet you and to work with you in this way. 
TRAVIS: You do not. You have some of my-- Tell me your name again. 
LIAM: My name is-- (laughter) (laughter) 
LIAM: -- Caleb Widogast. 
TRAVIS: Caleb Widogast. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It is a pleasure to meet you. You have a keen eye for craftsmanship, I can tell. This is your place? 
LIAM: It is my place. I can honestly say that-- 
ASHLEY: [inaudible] 
LIAM: -- when I was a child, you lit a little spark of imagination in me that I don't think was quite there that has grown into such as this. 
TRAVIS: That means more than I can say. 
LIAM: Vielen Dank. 
TRAVIS: Vielen Dank. 
LIAM: (Caleb) I had an idea to commemorate this evening. He pulls out this large wooden shield, like this big. It looks just like a shield, but it is carved just out of wood. I happened to have this in my workshop, and I would, if we could commemorate this evening, if we all live past this. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Hm. 
LIAM: Wouldn't that be something? I thought perhaps you could emblazon it with the words "Nein Hells." 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes. 
LIAM: But one thing's very important. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LIAM: You spell it the right way so not the-- Our name is a bit of wordplay. 
TRAVIS: I take out the chisel. 
LIAM: Not the number. 
TRAVIS: I start to carve a-- 
LIAM: N-E-I-N. 
TRAVIS: N-E-I-N. Got it, Hells. 
LIAM: Which is Zemnian for no, so Nein Hells so it's our group. 
TRAVIS: With an S or a Z? 
LIAM: In your group? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LIAM: You have to tell me. 
TRAVIS: I just figured Zemnian would be wiggidy. 
LIAM: Wiggidy? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Bells. Bells, Chet, Bells. Bells. 
TRAVIS: Nein Hellz. 
LAURA: Hells with an S. We're Hells. 
TRAVIS: I mean, if you want to be boring about it. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Technically-- 
TRAVIS: Nein Hellz-- 
TALIESIN: Technically we're Bells-- 
TRAVIS: -- could be very Zemnian. 
TALIESIN: because Hells is the possessive, so we would be the Bells because Hell's Bells, the Bells that belong to Hell. Zz. 
TRAVIS: It will be done with the greatest of filigree and care. 
TALIESIN: What? 
TRAVIS: And if you wouldn't mind? 
LIAM: Ja? 
TRAVIS: Maybe even some representations of our group. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: That is too much, but please do so. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What would you do-- 
TRAVIS: Nein Hellz with a Z! 
MARISHA: (Laudna) So wait. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MARISHA: Does Hells have an apostrophe? Have we never synced up on this as a crew? 
LAURA: No, Bell's was a-- 
MARISHA: Yes, Bell's has the apostrophe. I thought we'd go with Hells. 
LAURA: But it's just such a bitch to write the apostrophe. 
LIAM: (Orym) We never had it printed on jackets. 
LAURA: We never had to write it down. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. 
MARISHA: We never write it-- 
TALIESIN: Nevermind. Scratch that. Yeah, we never did write it down, did we? 
MARISHA: No, we just say it. 
TALIESIN: Or someone else wrote it down. 
LAURA: Did we ever write it on any of those-- 
MARISHA: The contracts. 
TALIESIN: Maybe that's why no one ever calls back. 
MARISHA: Hm. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: (chuckles) 
TRAVIS: I'm already starting to (chisels frantically) like a fucking 3D printer just going apeshit. 
TALIESIN: Imogen. 
LAURA: Huh? 
TALIESIN: 10 bucks he's dead by morning because of this. 
LAURA: Oh, this might just be the last thing he can do. 
TALIESIN: The irony would be just too heavy. 
TRAVIS: I never leave an invoice unfulfilled. Oh shit! No, no. (laughter) 
MARISHA: But-- 
LAURA: Chet is real old. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Ja. 
LAURA: Real old. 
LIAM: Many years of bringing joy to children of Exandria. 
TRAVIS: That's right! I made many cat pieces. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: If he dies early enough, the cats can start feasting on him, and he bring a lot of joy to cats too. 
TRAVIS: I can hear you, Ashton! 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) What? So you make toys or furniture or something? 
LAURA: All sorts of things. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Anything with the greatest substance known to Exandria. Wood. 
LAURA: Are you a C-Popper, Caleb Widogast? 
LIAM: I'm unfamiliar with the term C-Popper. 
LAURA: They are a fan group of Chet's-- 
LIAM: Oh, no. 
LAURA: -- that we've recently discovered. 
SAM: (Braius) Collectors, yeah. 
LIAM: I didn't know there was a group. 
ASHLEY: But you have some of his pieces? I did not know this. 
LIAM: Caleb disappears up a hole in the ceiling. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Caduceus walks away. That's funny, I've heard you say "C-POP," but, hello? (laughter) Caleb, Caleb, you-- 
ASHLEY: Caleb has the fifth egg. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Wow! 
ROBBIE: Oh! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: There are some eggs up there. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh. Flying one right now. 
LIAM: And he returns. He's got a small wicker basket with things and a blanket inside with things gingerly placed, and he says these-- 
LAURA: Wow! 
LIAM: I don't have many because they're hard to come by. But I have this. He puts out a little wooden cat and he touches its tail and the paw goes like this on it. Then he puts out what looks like a big on two legs lizard with a huge tail and a big, open mouth roaring. Then he places out a big, wooden gorilla, and that one goes like this with some sort of latch on the back. Then he places out a wooden egg. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: You know those are really rare. 
TALIESIN: Holy shit! 
LIAM: I am very aware. 
LAURA: The last guy we met with one of those kept it locked away in a big, magical safe. 
LIAM: I keep mine in an extradimensional space. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: (claps) 
TRAVIS: That is incredible. I reach for the lizard. I remember this very well. I reach into the bag of holding, and I take out an alligator that has a very flexible tail and a mouth that hinges. There's a whole evolution of these. Would you mind if you took the new one and I took a little bit of the old? It's history for me. 
LIAM: Of course. Natürlich. 
TRAVIS: (exhales softly) Whew! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Whew! 
LAURA: Whew! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Hm. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Wait, I feel like Fearne wants to-- Did we come back in or did you want to do something? 
LAURA: Sure, we batted around things enough. 
ASHLEY: We batted around. 
LAURA: Yeah. (Jester) I mean, we've batted around things enough. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Is that strike two? That was strike two. 
LAURA: Huh? What? 
TRAVIS: Hm? 
LAURA: Huh? 
MATT: Strike two. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Oh, also, just a general announcement. You're welcome to travel the tower, but if you go into my study, please, someone has been up there and knocked things all over the place. 
ASHLEY: What? 
LIAM: There's very expensive materials in there and very fine paper. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Oh no! Such a-- 
LAURA: Who would do such a thing? Maybe, you know what it is, Caleb? It's probably every time you build this place, it shakes a little bit, and you need to lock things down-- 
ASHLEY: Probably. 
LAURA: -- a little bit better. 
ASHLEY: Also, you have so many cats walking around so I'm sure they just-- 
LAURA: Cats like to do that sort of stuff. 
ASHLEY: -- fuck it all up. 
LIAM: Yes, that is how it works. 
ASHLEY: You have an egg? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Ja. Are you familiar? 
ASHLEY: I can ask-- 
LIAM: Are you a-- 
ASHLEY: A C-Popper? Yes. 
LIAM: C-Popper? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I am. May I see it? 
LIAM: Yes, but please be very ginger with it. 
ASHLEY: I'll be so ginger. 
LIAM: Please. 
ASHLEY: So ginger. 
TALIESIN: (snorts) 
LIAM: Something tells me you might not be ginger. I have not given it to you yet. I'm still holding it, Fearne. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh, I'll just, I'll hold it. 
LAURA: (laughs) Thank you. 
LIAM: Please enjoy. 
ASHLEY: Thank you very much. 
LAURA: (Imogen) In your head, you're going to hear: Now, if that's important to you, keep your keen eyes open. 
LIAM: I am using my Ring of Telekinesis and saying: I am already holding it with Telekinesis should anything go amiss. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to steal it. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, okay. (laughs) (laughter) Okay, first make a sleight of hand check. 
ASHLEY: Wow, this is so cool-looking. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh no. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: 10. 
LIAM: She'll also have to make a strength-- 
MATT: That was the next bit. 
LIAM: -- contest. Now, okay, so make a strength check for me, and you go ahead and roll and add your spell modifier. 
LIAM: Right. Right, right, right, right. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LIAM: Okay. It's the modifier, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Yeah. Oh, not good. 
MATT: What'd you get? 
ASHLEY: 16. 
LIAM: 14. 
MATT: 14. So Fearne, describe how you very poorly steal this with nobody noticing. 
TRAVIS: As they stare at you. 
LIAM: Yeah, as I stare at you. 
MATT: Yeah, as he stares right at you, and it puts up resistance as it is being psychically held, but you still manage to muscle it free from its spot in space. 
ASHLEY: I just, I'm like: I have to go to the bathroom. Where's the bathroom? Where is the restroom? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: As you do, it's like, "Where's the restroom?" (grunts) (laughter) 
LIAM: I pull the egg toward me. (laughter) I couldn't help but notice that you put my very priceless Pock O'Pea heirloom into your bosom. 
ASHLEY: Shit! 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: I would very much like to keep it, if that is okay. 
ASHLEY: I would too! 
TALIESIN: It's where she keeps all her favorite things. 
ASHLEY: What if we die? It's all I want. 
MARISHA: (Beau) I mean, you're probably going to die. 
ASHLEY: But-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay, here. Here's your egg. 
TRAVIS: Fearne, if it means so much to you, I could make you your-- 
ASHLEY: I want one of the five! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: (claps) 
ASHLEY: They're collectors, clearly. (laughter) But you can, if you want to make me one, you can. 
TRAVIS: No, fuck that. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I want the OG. It's fine. 
SAM: Maybe there's a way to find one of the other three that we haven't found yet. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's true. That's true. 
LIAM: It is also highly likely that this is a forgery. Caleb flies up into the top of the tower. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Hm. 
ASHLEY: Fine. Fine. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
TALIESIN: Well, yeah, I was-- Caduceus is going to-- 
SAM: Yes? (laughter) Okay, I'll do Caduceus now. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Go ahead, go ahead. I want to see this shit. 
SAM: (as Caduceus) Oh, hello. 
TALIESIN: That's actually not bad. 
MATT: That's not bad. 
TALIESIN: That's not bad. 
LIAM: This game is the gift that keeps on giving. 
TALIESIN: I know. I can't help it. (laughter) Caduceus wanders over to-- (Caduceus) Braius, is it, right? 
SAM: Oh, that makes more sense. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Moo. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Sure. (laughter) (laughter) I get the sense that you are probably, possibly the token man of faith in your group. 
SAM: We've all been wrestling with faith. Well, not all, but some of us have been wrestling with various forms of faith. 
TALIESIN: If you don't mind me saying so, I've been observing you and your group of friends, and I can feel your conflict, and-- 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: I can see that you are clearly wrestling with a few things and (inhales softly) well, I've always found that consulting with another person of faith when one's faith is in question is a very good way of settling things and getting a clearer insight. Especially considering what we're about to do, this is a poor time to be conflicted. 
SAM: I agree. The gods don't make things easy, do they? 
TALIESIN: Hm. We don't make things easy. 
SAM: True. I guess the thing that I've been wondering, trying to figure out for myself is, if you're not given a clear sign, how do you know, how do you know that your faith is, is directed in the right direction, I suppose. 
TALIESIN: I've found that people come to faith in a variety of ways. And sometimes it's because they have a question and sometimes it's because they've found an answer. What brought you to yours? What is the thing that-- What is the place where your fulfillment is found? Do you still worship the Platinum Dragon, or--? 
SAM: Yes, I do, in a sense. 
TALIESIN: Hm, in a sense? 
SAM: Yes, well I-- I felt betrayed by the Platinum Dragon and found solace in my grief and anger in another. In another force. 
TALIESIN: Well, there's no judgment here, so. 
SAM: But now I've meet these people, beings, and everything that they have shown me about themselves and their hearts is pointing me back to the Dragon. It's almost like what I thought was-- What I was so certain of and what I was so sure of is coming into conflict with reality and the people that I've met. 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
SAM: I guess I don't know whether to believe my heart or to believe my friends. 
TALIESIN: I'm surprised they're two different things. That is conflict. I'd say sometimes we can get caught up in the question and stop looking for the answer. And "Why me?" is a very common question that most people don't want the answer to. 
SAM: Hm. 
TALIESIN: Because sometimes that answer is because we made the wrong choice or the right choice at the right time, and sometimes that answer is because we are at the mercy of the winds even more than the gods themselves. Maybe it isn't the Platinum Dragon that failed you. Maybe it was people, and that's, I think, much harder to get comfortable with. 
SAM: That's very wise. 
TALIESIN: Well, I have my moments. 
SAM: Unrelated. 
TALIESIN: Hm. 
SAM: You seem like someone who would know the answer to this. 
TALIESIN: I might. 
SAM: Is fusaka good? 
TRAVIS: (chuckles) 
MATT: Make a history check. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: All right. Hm! 18. 
MATT: 18? You know exactly what fusaka is. 
TALIESIN: Well, there's certainly an argument for it. I think so, but I am often told that I'm incorrect about this. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Just, we've been undergoing a lot of stress lately. It seems like it could relieve that in some small way. 
TALIESIN: Who are you pledged to? 
SAM: I don't know anymore. 
TALIESIN: What are the options? 
SAM: The options are good and bad, I think. 
TALIESIN: (scoffs) Good, bad. The options are what you need. What did you think you need? Why'd you think? Try some honesty. I can help, if you like. Do you want to try some honesty? 
SAM: That's so new. I guess I found my path to (clears throat) Asmodeus. 
ROBBIE: Oof. 
TALIESIN: I've heard worse. 
SAM: I was in a place where I was tossed aside and devalued and, well, he gave me strength. Purpose. Power. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: That felt good. 
TALIESIN: That's a good place to heal sometimes. You just don't want to get stuck there. I mean-- 
SAM: How do you know when you've healed? 
TALIESIN: When you realize it's time to leave. Is it time to leave? 
SAM: Oof. I don't know. I've been in four different planes of existence and two different planets in the last four days. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: When I first met these people, my people, I was a new addition, and it was vertigo-inducing. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: I nearly threw up several times. Panicked, thought about going home, panicked. But eventually, I figured out I was just what they needed. 
SAM: You were what they needed? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. And honestly, they were what I needed, too. 
SAM: You think that maybe there's a chance I'm what they needed? 
TALIESIN: I do. Quite a bit. In fact, I have quite a bit of faith in it. 
SAM: Hm. That's interesting to think about. 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
SAM: You smell nice. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. This is actually, I grow this at home and press it into an oil. I've got a bottle of it. It's really-- 
SAM: I'll take a drop. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, please. 
SAM: Just behind the ears a little bit. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I do just a little. I do a little wrists, too. 
SAM: Wrists? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: All right. 
TALIESIN: It's a pleasure to be fighting alongside you. 
SAM: You too, Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: I will say for now, paladin of the Bells Hells. 
TALIESIN: I will say for now, paladin of the Bells Hells. You can figure the rest out later. 
SAM: Paladin of the Hells sounds great. Which one remains to be seen. 
TALIESIN: Well, there's quite a few. Cheers to that. All right. 
SAM: Lechaim. (laughter) 
MARISHA: All right, fuckers. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Sorry. Thank you. 
MARISHA: Got a busy fucking day tomorrow. 
SAM: Dorian, you can stop playing now. 
ROBBIE: I'm sorry. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I was startled by the profanity. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I wasn't going to stop until you stopped, so. 
SAM: Oh yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Thank god. 
ROBBIE: We'll end it on a strong note, and three, two, one. 
SAM and ROBBIE: (one pitch) 
ASHLEY: (a different pitch) 
ROBBIE: Aw, fuck. (laughter) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Everyone should get some sleep. You guys are fighting Ludinus Da'leth. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) It wouldn't be the first time. (laughs) We just see him all the time now. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Kind of obsessed. 
ASHLEY: Yeah 
TALIESIN: It's weird. 
LIAM: (Caleb) He's a bit of a prick. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah, we've noticed. A powerful prick. 
MARISHA: Just watch out for him. He's been around a long time. 
LAURA: Yeah. We've done a little research. 
MARISHA: Caleb and I have been watching him for-- 
LIAM: (Caleb) Decades. 
MARISHA: -- decades at this point. 
LAURA: You didn't catch on that he was trying to unleash a moon god? 
ROBBIE: Be nice. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
MARISHA: Oh, we caught on. It wasn't the what of what he was doing. We knew he was doing something, just didn't have all the context. 
LIAM: That's what several centuries of planning will do for you. 
MARISHA: If anything it should just go to show you how tricky he is. Just watch yourself. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: (Orym) Well, we'll do what it takes. 
LAURA: Whatever it takes. 
MARISHA: She's really cute. All right. I'm going to go to bed. Come on, babe. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Where are you sleeping? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah, we saw you from across the tower. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Like your vibe. 
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. 
LIAM: We saw you from over in Campaign 2 and we liked your vibe. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I mean, last night in the world, I'm just saying. That's fine. Good night. But seriously, though? 
LAURA: No, yeah, I'm busy. (laughter) 
MARISHA: We're on the seventh floor. All right, goodnight. 
TRAVIS: (Chet) Is she trying to make a move on your girl? 
MARISHA: (Laudna) I think she is, and why am I not included? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
ASHLEY: You are too! (laughter) 
LIAM: (Caleb) If you knew how many taverns I had seen that little scene play out in. 
TALIESIN: They have the vibe. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Fearne, sorry about your egg. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Fucking shit. I just want to start my collection. I want the real collection. I want all five. 
ROBBIE and MARISHA: All five? 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Fucking Thanos over here. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I am a collector. Like, you tell me there's a collection of something, obviously I'm going to try to get every single piece. 
LAURA: If you get all five you can instantly kill Ludinus. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, probably. There's probably power in having all five eggs. We don't know. 
TRAVIS: Earliest egg commissions was for the Unseelie Court. 
ASHLEY: Was it? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Shit, we should have fucked them up over it. 
ASHLEY: Shit, we were just there. 
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, for later. 
TALIESIN: At least they're local to grandma. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to write that down. "Earliest egg was commissioned for Unseelie," okay. 
MARISHA: There's a future Bells Hells one-shot that's just, "The Search for Eggs." 
ROBBIE: "The Quest for Chetney's Eggs," yeah. 
LAURA: You know what you should do, you should check with your dad tapestry and see if maybe he commissioned an egg for you. What if your dad commissioned an egg for you, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: What if he did? 
MATT: I think you have to GM that one. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that could be the start. 
LAURA: What if one of the eggs is yours already and you don't even know it? 
ASHLEY: (gasps) That could be the start of our healing. 
LAURA: Was it Lord Zathuda that commissioned it? Do you know? 
TRAVIS: No. 
ASHLEY: Who commissioned it? 
TRAVIS: It was a while ago. I'd have to check my records. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. Well, I mean, it's fine, I just really-- I like the eggs. I don't know what to tell you. 
TALIESIN: You want to go work off some frustration? 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
TRAVIS: They're in the Umbra Hills. 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
LIAM: Ah. 
TALIESIN: All right. Night y'all. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) We forgot to fight. 
SAM: (Braius) Oh, we didn't forget. 
TALIESIN: Hot. 
SAM: But it seems like everyone's going to sleep, so. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, well, I'll see you-- 
SAM: I call this a forfeit. 
ASHLEY: Excuse me? 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I don't need to go to bed. 
SAM: Oh, I don't need to go to bed. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
LIAM: (Caleb) The room that I outfitted for the Hells to sleep in can be used as a fighting arena as well, so. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
LIAM: You hear doors slam one level below us and then open again. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Babe, come on. 
SAM: (Veth) Babe, come on. (laughter) 
LAURA: (Jester) Veth, no. 
SAM: Oh, sorry. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: There's always time for tomorrow. 
ASHLEY: There's always, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
SAM: (Braius) Tomorrow. 
ASHLEY: Tomorrow. 
MARISHA: Tomorrow. 
LIAM: So, nein? 
ROBBIE: You can't heal more. 
LIAM: The doors slam again. 
ASHLEY: Tomorrow. 
SAM: Forfeit. 
ASHLEY: No. No, tomorrow. No. 
SAM: Forfeit. Forfeit. (laughter) 
SAM: Forfeit. (laughter) 
SAM: You better go. 
TRAVIS: (as Braius and Yasha) "No." "Forfeit." "No." 
ASHLEY: You better go. You better leave. 
SAM: You better go, your wife's calling you. 
ASHLEY: You better leave the room first. 
SAM: Go on. 
MARISHA: Babe, sex. 
ASHLEY: You better walk out right now. 
MARISHA: Babe! 
SAM: Your wife's calling, you better go. 
MARISHA: Babe, sex! 
SAM: You better forfeit. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right, all right. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
SAM: Yes! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (Imogen) Is that all I got to do? Just-- 
TALIESIN: You're still winning this fight, by the way. 
LAURA: -- "Babe, sex, babe, sex"? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) I mean, yes, that's usually all it takes. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) I mean, I like a little bit more, like a gentler approach, you know. 
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think that works for us. 
MARISHA: Could you imagine? Me, "Babe, sex!" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's not good. 
LIAM: (crazy growl) (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's not befitting, you know. (laughter) (lingering laughter) 
LAURA: So anyway, you want to? 
MARISHA: Yeah, 100%. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: We might die. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: One by one, you all begin to scatter off to your rooms for the evening, what could possibly be the last evening of the world. 
LIAM: I'm interrupting. I knock on the side of the door that Laudna and Imogen are in. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: (Caleb) I'm so sorry, I don't mean to intrude. I was wondering if just for a moment I could borrow Ms. Temult. 
MARISHA: What? Why? What? Why not me? Is this a moon thing? 
LIAM: Ja it is a moon thing. 
MARISHA: Can I come? 
LIAM: Ja. 
MARISHA: Babe, you don't have to go with him if you don't want to. 
LIAM: No, she does not have to go with me-- 
LAURA: No, I do-- 
LIAM: -- if she doesn't want to. 
LAURA: -- actually want to hear what he has to say. 
MARISHA: All right. Can I come? 
LIAM: Ja. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: All right. So I walk to the center of this big room with all these, again, it looks like bungalows in a ring in this sort of procurement room. I begin to float up, up, up, up through the tower, past floor, after floor, after floor. Eventually, we reach a small room with a sealed iris above it and Caleb looks up at it and says, Weg aber nicht vergessen, and it goes, (shifting) and it opens. He floats up past another room with nine doors all in a ring inside it in a very small vestibule and-- 
LAURA: Do you come up with all this yourself? 
LIAM: Yeah, I had a lot of time to think on my own. The final iris opens and I float up in there. You follow? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: We enter, it is like we have left the building. We are floating, the three of us, in an infinite dark space with wafts of galaxy and star and motes of light moving all around us. You-- Make a perception check, both of you. 
MARISHA: Okay, Dungeon Master. 
MATT: I'm allowing it. 
LIAM: I don't know how to do this otherwise. 
MARISHA: Okay. Perception? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: 20... Wait, so 21. 
LAURA: Oh! No, that's Imogen. 
LAURA: 15. 
LIAM: 15. Laudna, Laut-na, you only can just barely see the thin outline of a nine-sided wall around us. and this sky is an illusion stretching out in what looks like infinity, but you can just barely make out the geometric shape of the actual room that we are in. As each of you turn, and Caleb as well, you see 50 of your arm and hand moving and you see multiple-- 
LAURA: Shit. 
LIAM: -- Imogen Temults. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
LIAM: And 100 Laudnas. 
LAURA: That kind of makes me nauseous. 
LIAM: Tomorrow-- 
LAURA: Hmm? 
LIAM: -- there are many possibilities. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: I know about you, Ms. Temult. 
LAURA: What about me? 
LIAM: I know who you are. I know about your mother. I'm aware how close you are to all this. I have spoken to the Voice of the Tempest, Lady Vysoren, others. We know how on the edge you are in this moment in time. A little bit I can understand your position, just a little. It is probably impossible to know which of these 50 different directions you will take tomorrow. But when the splendor of reality is before you But when the splendor of reality is before you and so dizzying, all you can do is focus on your own heart all you can do is focus on your own heart and the ones around you. Verstehen? 
LAURA: Da. 
LIAM: I don't pretend to know what is the right thing to do tomorrow, this is unprecedented. These are unprecedented times, and I have lived through unprecedented times, and this wipes that board clean. Follow your heart. Power is an illusion. 
LAURA: Says one of the most powerful guys I've ever met. 
LIAM: I have very strong limitations. I try to earn, earn the gifts I have. Anyway, you are not just fighting for yourselves or your friends or the people you know, you are fighting for a great many people. 
LAURA: Believe me, we're aware. 
LIAM: Good. 
LAURA: I know we seem like a bunch of slap dicks to y'all. We know what's at stake. 
LIAM: I recognize raw talent when I see it. 
MARISHA: She's very capable. 
LIAM: Ja, very capable. It radiates from her. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Sometimes literally. 
LIAM: I'm sorry I will not be there to see it. 
MARISHA: You could come with us. 
LIAM: Well, I have my personal friends and loves who are dear to me. I see your potential. A row of Calebs extends out as he says those words. I have made my point. You know already the seriousness of this point we are in in history. Choose well, choose wisely. I am grateful that you are here. 
LAURA: What would you do? 
LIAM: It's hard to make that call in advance, isn't it? We're on the moon, adjacent. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: The gods were never my specialty. I know very little about them. You talk about power, far more power in their hands than mine. 
LAURA: You know about Ludinus, though. 
LIAM: Ja. 
LAURA: In all your time studying him, did you find any special ways to get under his skin? Something to distract him, throw him off his balance? 
LIAM: Well, I've always found with powerful men that mockery is a pretty solid way to get them off their game. But-- Centuries old mage, you have your work cut out for you. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
LIAM: Let me see. (sighs) I am going to give you something. You'll probably not be able to use this. I don't think we will, but I'm going to give it to you all the same. He pulls out a small, metallic pyramid shape. The three of us have been to the same place, the city in the frozen north. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: This came from that place. 
MARISHA: Aeor? 
LIAM: This is called an intuit charge. 
LAURA: Mm. 
LIAM: I have held onto this for a very long time. 
LAURA: Do they expire? 
LIAM: I hope not. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: But I am giving it to you. I will write down how it works for you so you don't forget, because Liam doesn't remember. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: It's a long read. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: It goes boom. But maybe it will come in handy, maybe not. But I don't think what we are doing-- I think it'll be better used in your hands. Anyway, here you go. 
LAURA: I Mage Hand that over to you. 
MARISHA: Mage Hand it. 
LIAM: My friend is right, we probably all should get some shuteye. Thank you for giving me these few moments. I know we haven't known each other much at all. 
LAURA: Thank you, Caleb. Wow, you and Essek, I see why you work. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: It took us some time to get there, but we found our rhythm. 
LAURA: When we were with the Matron, she made us fight... She made us fight a vision of what could be. We were fighting my mother, and and in the moment that it really counted, I trusted in her, and it ended up being a really bad call. and it ended up being a really bad call. 
LIAM: Was it your mother? 
LAURA: No. But I don't know how much the Matron sees, you know? Can she guess people's real intentions? Does she know people's real intentions? 
LIAM: I could not say, Imogen. You are going to have to find that answer inside yourself. 
LAURA: Maybe one of these echoes has a mother that she can't trust. And maybe this one does. 
MARISHA: Trust your instinct. I think you'll know in the moment. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
LIAM: Of course. I hope we can have a more relaxed dinner here sometime in the days ahead. 
LAURA: I would like that. 
LIAM: Ja. 
MARISHA: There's been talk about maybe a celebratory party at Taste of Tal'Dorei. 
LIAM: I have been there. 
MARISHA: Oh! Really? 
LIAM: It's a little tacky. 
MARISHA: It is, yeah. 
LIAM: But also fun. 
LAURA: I don't know if it's just the one we went to. It seemed super tacky. 
MARISHA: It was a little run-down, honestly. 
LIAM: I've only been the one time. 
LAURA: Bassuras? 
LIAM: It was in Bassuras. 
LAURA: Super tacky! 
LIAM: Super tacky. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: The drinks are okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They get you drunk. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
LIAM: Serviceable. 
MARISHA: I think it's important to have something to look forward to. 
LIAM: All right. To the Taste of Tal'Dorei, then. 
MARISHA: As Lady Vysoren said, not goodbye. 
LIAM: Bis später. 
MARISHA: Fish baiter. 
LIAM: Well, shall we? 
MARISHA: Yes. Real quick, real quick-- 
LAURA: In your head, you hear: Why fish baiter? Why did he say fish baiter to us? 
MARISHA: Maybe it's a cultural thing. 
LAURA: Maybe. 
MARISHA: Yeah. ♪ Can I do one quick ♪ retroactive thing ♪ ♪ That we don't ♪ have to roleplay ♪ 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: ♪ Fearney-pants ♪ ♪ Can you identify that raven ♪ mask before we go to bed ♪ 
SAM: You don't have it. 
MATT: You don't have it. You gave it to Braius. 
MARISHA: I know, but can we pretend that I went: Hey Braius, hand Fearne the raven mask so Fearne can Identify it? 
MATT: Braius, do you want to? 
SAM: You can, sure. Sure, yeah, if that's something that you guys want. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let me check it out. 
MARISHA: We did this over dinner. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: Sure, okay. If any of you want to, you can pull up in your inventory the Mask of the Matron. 
MARISHA: Oh, wait. It's in here? 
MATT: It's in D&D Beyond, yeah. 
MARISHA: It's in D&D Beyond? 
LIAM: (coughs) Excuse me. 
TALIESIN: Bless you. 
LAURA: Bless you! 
MARISHA: Okay, great. The Mask of the Matron. 
TALIESIN: How did we both do that? 
MARISHA: Okay, never mind. We got it. 
ASHLEY: We got it. 
TALIESIN: Are you going to say it out loud, or no? 
MARISHA: Well, I don't know. 
SAM: Anyone can look at it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, weird! 
ASHLEY: What is it? 
LAURA: Now I want to look at it. 
TALIESIN: You're making weird faces. You've got to say it out loud. 
MARISHA: You have to look at it. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: You have to look at it. 
TALIESIN: All right, Mask of the Matron? 
TRAVIS: You have to see it. 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: It's very cool. 
LAURA: Wait! Say it out loud so the audience knows. 
MARISHA: You can't! 
TRAVIS: You can't say it. 
LAURA: What?! 
TRAVIS: I'll tell you what it says. 
SAM: It says, "When you place this mask upon your face..." (mumbling) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's unreadable. 
LAURA: How do I get it? 
SAM: Cool, Matt! 
MARISHA: That is super cool. 
SAM: Even your item descriptions are cool. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
SAM: Just look up Matron. 
LAURA: Mask of the Matron, okay. 
SAM: Just anything Matron. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: What? 
LAURA: That's so cool. Cool, Matt. 
TALIESIN: What? What? This is really cruel. 
ASHLEY: All right, we'll see. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's really fun. 
SAM: Before bed: Hey, I'm going to work on my Orym painting. Can you give me a little inspiration? Just a little hit? 
ROBBIE: Braius? Is that you? 
SAM: Yes, this is me. 
ROBBIE: Okay, just making sure. (laughter) 
MATT: Have to double check. 
TALIESIN: Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice! 
ROBBIE: You want inspiration? 
SAM: Just a little hit. 
ROBBIE: Okay. (grunts) 
SAM: (humming throbs) Okay, I'm going to paint. 
ROBBIE: You're going to do great! 
MATT: All right. Take a d10. 
ROBBIE: I think actually, we just leveled up. I think it's a 12 now. 
ALL: Ooh! 
ROBBIE: Let me make sure. 
LAURA: (Jester) Do you want Guidance? 
ROBBIE: Let me make sure. 
SAM: From who? 
LAURA: Me! Jester. 
SAM: You would do that for me? 
LAURA: Of course I would. Artist to artist, I understand. 
SAM: Wow. 
ROBBIE: 12. Yeah. 
SAM: That's very kind of you. I'll take it. 
LAURA: All right, I Guide you as well. 
SAM: What does that do, d4? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: All right, I'm going to do art. 
MATT: All right, so a performance or dexterity check. 
SAM: Okay. Oh my god, insane. 16 plus 11, already 27, plus two, 29, plus six, 35. 
MATT: An incredible job on this piece of art. 
SAM: Yes, thank you. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: I feel good. 
MATT: As everyone else is going to bed for the evening, any last conversations here on the dusk before the end? 
LAURA: You didn't want anyone to give us just a little side marriage before we do our real marriage? 
TRAVIS: A side marriage? No, I mean, what-- why? 
LAURA: I don't know, it seemed like maybe you were regretting the fact that you proposed or something. 
TRAVIS: No! Regretting? Never, of course not. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I just want you to have the real thing. 
LAURA: I do too. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, and plus, it's a vote of confidence in us. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Don't want to rush it with something small. I mean, don't get me wrong, I would be thrilled, but you deserve all the finest things, and I can only imagine what your imagination has in store. I wouldn't want to short you. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. It's going to be so beautiful, Fjord. 
TRAVIS: Just do me a favor. 
LAURA: Mm. 
TALIESIN: No cats. 
LAURA: Of course not! What about a weasel? (gasps) Sprinkle! (laughter) 
MATT: (Pâté) "Don't worry, we're friends now! (laughs)" 
LAURA: I didn't even know if you were still here! 
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast! (laughter) 
MATT: Boom! He scatters into nothing. 
TRAVIS: What was that? 
MATT: Just dust and gore. 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: Do you actually fry Pâté? 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: We were almost assassinated in this tower! 
LAURA: That was-- 
TRAVIS: Where is that wizard? 
LAURA: No, that was the dead woman's pet. You just killed it. 
TRAVIS: Oh. You know... Are there any bits left behind, or did it just disintegrate? 
LAURA: I think it just poofed away. 
TRAVIS: I don't think anyone will know. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Don't tell her. But we have to, because she still has Sprinkle! How am I going to get Sprinkle back? 
TRAVIS: I'll take care of it. We'll treat it like a hostage situation. It'll be fine. 
LAURA: In the morning. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA: I guess tonight, he'll just sleep with her. She doesn't know it's actually Artie, though. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: I just don't want Artie to do anything weird to her in the middle of the night. 
TRAVIS: I thought that's why you handed him off to her. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Imogen! 
LAURA: Maybe he'll have some fun. 
MARISHA: Imogen, we have to make room between us for the weasel. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Oh. Oh, creepy thing. 
MARISHA: No, he's got to sleep with us! 
LIAM: (Sprinkle) (coughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, it's okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Scritch, scritch, scritch, scritch, scritch. This poor guy. I think she feeds him really poorly. You can see his ribs. 
MARISHA: You can. 
LAURA: I need to teach her about animal care. 
MATT: It backs up, and Sprinkle darts off the bed and-- 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: Well. 
MATT: --jumps underneath part of the furniture. 
MARISHA: No! Come back! 
LAURA: You know-- 
MARISHA: Mage Hand him. 
MATT: (squeaking, claws grinding) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Can't lose you in this tower! 
LAURA: I think you're going to have to give him back eventually. 
MARISHA: Well, yes. He's just on loan. She's with Pâté. It's fine. I'm sure he's keeping her such great company right now. 
LAURA: Go to sleep. Go to sleep. 
MARISHA: Go to sleep, go to sleep. Go in your house. 
MATT: (squeaks) 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) I'm probably the last one to go to sleep, and I will stop short of exhaustion, but there's work to be done, and I have a canvas that needs my utmost attention. 
MATT: You do. 
TRAVIS: And so in front of a fireplace, I whittle away. 
TALIESIN: Naked as the day I was born. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm fully fucking naked. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I send a cat away for a shot of ayahuasca, and I just fucking let it roll. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. 
MATT: Make a dexterity or performance check, and I'll give you advantage on this, because you are... This situation inspires you. 
TALIESIN: I feel inspired. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MATT: 17. Pretty well done. You're pretty happy with your work by the time it comes to a close. You wouldn't know that, though, because you pass out before you finish. But you do wake up in the morning before anybody else does and still manage to finish before anybody else notices. 
LAURA: Like old people always do. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: The early, early morning. 
SAM: Did you live? 
LAURA: Four in the morning. 
TALIESIN: A little bit of puke from the ayahuasca. 
TRAVIS: This is rudimentary, at this point. I lived. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: That would've been amazing. 
MARISHA: I feel like he's getting closer. 
LIAM: What's the limbo stick that you don't want to go under? 
TRAVIS: I'm tempted to do it to half my level. 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: No! 
LAURA: There's only one more-- 
TRAVIS: Maybe using the staff-- 
LAURA: -- potentially. 
TRAVIS: --hurts me more. 
ROBBIE: As Chetney's nodding off, you hear on Orym's door, just a gentle... (knocks) 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: (knocks) 
LIAM: (Orym) Come in. 
ROBBIE: You're awake. 
LIAM: That's... I've been trying to walk over to your place for 20 minutes. 
ROBBIE: May I sit down? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: I'll sit on the edge of the bed. You've been quiet lately. 
LIAM: I haven't been honest with you. I have feelings for you, I think almost from the day I met you. And I'm way out of practice, and always worried about being a burden. But I'm so happy that we got to see each other again before whatever the hell happens tomorrow. 
ROBBIE: Sure feels like in the face of this, some things get swept to the side, eh? Rightfully so. 
LIAM: No time. 
ROBBIE: No time. I feel like... Well, I feel like the worlds have kept us apart ever since I've been back, and I've just wanted the tiniest moment with you, and I couldn't sleep either. You are the reason I'm here. You've always been the reason I'm here. And I've known it, and I've been grateful. You held us together in the past, and you made me feel like I was a part of this group. You. And if it were up to me, there would be no responsibilities. 
LIAM: Boy, wouldn't that be something? 
ROBBIE: Wouldn't it? I don't know what this is. I've never felt anything like this. I've been closed off for so long, and who knows? Maybe you're just the first beautiful, kind face that I have ever seen. But I don't care. I could never ask anything of you. But tonight, may I simply hold you? I want nothing more. Just let me comfort you, for once. Please. And I'll awkwardly scooch myself onto the bed, the pillows, and kind of just put out an open arm by the pillows, and ask if Orym wants to come. 
LIAM: He curls over and curls in. 
ROBBIE: And Dorian feels flushed. He feels a rush of emotions. He feels passion, and he feels confusion, and he's red and hot in the face, and he feels the feelings of lust and burden and guilt, and he lets them all go and he just pulls you in so close tight to his ribs, and sort of cups his hand over your head, and holds you there. 
LIAM: I don't say anything, as I am terrified to spoil the moment. I just appreciate it. 
ROBBIE: I just think about the time we've spent together, and I start to fantasize about the way things could've been, about different choices and every little thing that's come our way, and those thoughts fade into a dream as I slip off to sleep to the sound of your breathing. 
LIAM: I think I'm up a little longer, with fingers curled into yours. Just thinking. This is okay. And I pass out. 
MATT: And the night carries on, restful for some, anxious, quiet, and at moments, joyful, to just appreciate a brief moment where all that responsibility can wash away before sleep takes you. Here, in this space between spaces, a place built out of love for friend and family, along new friends and old, bonds of kinship, love of many kinds, a little time away from it all. For tomorrow, you march for everything. That's where we'll end tonight's episode. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: Could've gone longer, but there's no perfect moment to stop than right there. 
TALIESIN: Perfection. 
MARISHA: Ay yi yi. 
SAM: (Braius) Dorian, are you here? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You bastard! 
SAM: Dorian? (laughter) 
ROBBIE: No! 
SAM: Dorian! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Oh, Braius! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: A bed of sawdust awaits. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) I made coffee. Does no one... Okay, fine. Fuck me, then. 
LIAM: So much happened! 
MATT: Oh my goodness. 
LIAM: Oh wow. 
MATT: I love my friends. That was crazy. We'll pick up from there next time, into what comes next, holy shit. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: But yeah, thank you all so much for joining us. We love you all very much, and is it Thursday yet? Goodnight. (cheering)	

Cooldown[]
MARISHA: Wowsers.
TRAVIS: As I close three tabs of D&D Beyond character sheets.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MATT: Don't close them. You'll need them again.
TRAVIS: I know, shit.
SAM: You know you need 'em.
LIAM: Guys, we can do it.
TALIESIN: That actually got doable.
LIAM: Three TPKs.
MATT: Let's go!
LIAM: Three-PK.
MATT: Let's go!
SAM: It was pretty doable. It was pretty great.
TALIESIN: It took a minute, but once it was going, it was going really well.
MATT: I trusted you guys.
SAM: It's actually pretty great, because for every situation, if your character's like "I don't really have anything to say here," your other character is like, "Actually, I think I have something to say."
MARISHA: It's true.
ROBBIE: I mean, outside looking in-- I told you guys this on break. I mean, it's just seamless. You laugh, and it probably feels deranged to you, but watching it was-- You guys are these, these are you, they're so dialed in. It was so fun to watch. I don't know. I know you guys were nervous about it, but it was really joyful to behold. It was awesome.
TALIESIN: It helps that these are two teams of very different people.
LAURA: Yeah.
ROBBIE: Oh my god, yes.
TALIESIN: That definitely was like-- there was real swing for a lot of us.
MARISHA: That is true.
ASHLEY: Caduceus! I missed Caduceus.
TALIESIN: I missed my boy.
ASHLEY: He was such a good guy.
TALIESIN: He was so excited to meet you.
SAM: He was so great.
MATT: I know! That conversation--
TALIESIN: That's my boy.
ROBBIE: That was awesome.
MATT: So many conversations.
TALIESIN: Nine more conversations.
MATT: It's funny because in my head I was like, all right, plotting out what you guys had going on and the math, the puzzle of how this would make sense logically for building towards this crescendo, I was like: Okay, yeah, we'll need them-- They're the most outfitted for the Weave Mind, so they're probably going to have to go in together, since you guys don't know how to get there, and they can help distract with that. In no point during that time did I realize that you guys would have to interact as both parties for a period of that version, and the minute I realized, I was like--
SAM: Uh oh.
LAURA: Oh, no.
MATT: No, not uh oh! This is going to be great!
LIAM: It was so much fun.
LAURA: It was so cool to know which characters would pair up when they start talking.
SAM, MATT, ASHLEY, and ROBBIE: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I want everyone to talk to everybody so much.
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too.
LIAM: That's kind of why I kept pushing us towards the tower, because I knew if we had space from the world, we could quietly go about it.
MATT: It was perfect.
TALIESIN: It was such a good call.
SAM: I texted Matt before the game and I was like: Listen, man, I know you have a story to tell, but I think I have to kill Jester. (laughter)
MATT: I prepped!
SAM: He just wrote back: Ha-ha-ha-ha, I love it! (laughter)
LIAM: And how amazing to watch Jester defuse the Braius bomb.
TALIESIN: You told her more backstory than any of us!
MATT: That was crazy.
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was so great.
SAM: She was very charming.
TRAVIS: Angel eyes activated.
MARISHA: While you're saying things like: (Jester) "No, of course I'll do you this favor, I've ruined your life." Having "I ruined your life" as the--
TRAVIS: Full ownership.
LIAM: (Jester) "She's got really big titties."
SAM: She sounds like--
MATT: Having the Ashton pep talk--
TALIESIN: Oh, the Ashton pep talk was amazing. It was everything I needed.
ASHLEY: Oh, man, so much fun.
MATT: The Caleb pep talk to Imogen at the top of the tower was incredible.
TALIESIN: You two have a weird amount in common.
LAURA: I know! Yeah, I thought about it as soon as they stood next to each other, mentally. I was like: Oh, yeah, they're so similar.
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: And like watching this subtle, almost unspoken B-story of Dorian and Yasha as musicians bonding over in the corner this whole time was incredible.
ROBBIE: I'm sorry I locked you into miming that for so long. It just felt right.
ASHLEY: You should not be sorry.
MATT: It was great.
ASHLEY: You give me a mime bit and I'll do it for hours.
LAURA: I love how if anybody were to talk to either of you, you both were part of the conversation because you were so close.
ROBBIE: Everybody congregates around music.
LIAM: There was definitely a tip jar.
MATT: The Beau and Fjord talk, Bells Hells, dressing them down, getting-- A lot of this was you guys getting to roast your other characters in each campaign in an awesome way.
MARISHA: Correct.
ASHLEY: Yes.
ROBBIE: There was a cool experience, like a familial-- it felt like the Nein had a parent-type vibe, you know? "Oh, we're going to get you there."
MARISHA: (Beau) Look, we've seen some shit.
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: "Oh, you've been to Aeor! That's so cute. Look at you going to Aeor."
LIAM: With the exception of Chetney, we're older.
ROBBIE and MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Overall.
TRAVIS: That's true.
MATT: Speaking of Chetney-- Caleb?
LAURA: Oh, I love it!
MATT: Being a fan of Chetney?
LAURA: It's so good!
MARISHA: Did you think of that in the moment?
LAURA: Caleb is a C-Popper.
TRAVIS: I was so happy to be sleeping by the fire. That was the best.
TALIESIN: The C-Popper was amazing.
LAURA: And then Dorian finally making a move.
ASHLEY: Yes!
SAM: What is this shit? What is this "I'm just going to lie there and fall asleep?" What?! I want to see some fucking!
ROBBIE: Dorian is inexperienced.
ALL: Aww!
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: (Laudna) Is that true?
ROBBIE: He was cloistered in his family home up until a couple of months ago.
MARISHA: That's fair.
ROBBIE: So he's just now seeing the world. Yeah, and he was confused.
ASHLEY: (Fearne) I mean, I can come in there and help you both. (laughter)
TALIESIN: We are not done!
ASHLEY: I don't have to be involved. I'll just--
TALIESIN: We are not done. We have shit to do.
LIAM: It was kind of a game of chicken because the way I've steered Orym is that he's too shy and too-- he was never going to say anything, so that's why I used Caleb to kick him in the ass and say: "You got one day left, kid. What are you waiting for?" And so, I was going to initiate the same moment.
ROBBIE: Were you going to do it?
LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: That was so lovely.
MATT: So nice.
ROBBIE: I knew you were across there, in the other cabin in camp, just waiting. (laughter) Just laying awake, staring at the ceiling.
TRAVIS: Like, "Oh, the bed will make so much noise! Plus the spring in the door."
TALIESIN: Ashton just wanted anybody in the Mighty Nein to like him, and slowly went down and was like, "Oh, it's only the weird kid. Well, I'll take it."
MATT: Have Ashton be careful about spending a rage, whatever you're doing.
TALIESIN: Persistent, before sleep. Yeah.
MATT: Oh, okay. I was going to say otherwise, she could Colossus your Kitty, so--
TRAVIS: Was that "Colossus your Kitty?"
MATT: Sorry, I think in one of the series, I think Colossus and Kitty Pryde are sleeping together and he makes her phase.
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.
MATT: She drops through the floor into the next room and has to grab the pillows and be like this. Such a great moment.
TALIESIN: I do know what I rolled. I had a Zone of Truth, by the way, and a Bane ready for you, if you had been cagey with Caduceus, he would have been like, "No, we need to have a real talk."
LAURA: Oh, to be honest with each other.
TALIESIN: I was like, "No, we're having an honest conversation." I was prepared.
SAM: Travis, you might have to figure out where these other three eggs are in the world.
LAURA: You already know, don't you?
TRAVIS: Might have to?
SAM: Ohh.
LAURA: One of them is up his butt.
SAM: Is that true?
ROBBIE and LAURA: That's canon.
MATT: No, it's his cannon. Jut got to light the fuse!
MARISHA: It's why he's still alive.
LAURA: Come on, it's Chet's. Of course it's real.
TALIESIN: This is the "Dragonball Z" story we've been waiting for.
LIAM: He's like a gnomish t-shirt cannon.
MATT: If you get all five eggs together, it summons Chetney.
ROBBIE: Even if he's dead.
TRAVIS: The dragon balls.
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: "I am the great Chetney!"
LIAM: Did you say, "We know he doesn't have his egg?" I think you said that? Talking about Chetney's wooden things. His toys?
SAM: Oh, yeah. About Caleb.
MATT and LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: About Caleb?
LIAM: Yeah, you were like, "Well, he doesn't have his egg!" And I was like, "I do now, bitch."
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was like, "I have to say it because if he has the egg I'm going to try to steal it tonight."
MATT: That was some rough rolls.
ASHLEY: That was some rough rolls!
MATT: But also an incredible visual of like, "Oh, no, I just need to go over here!" (grunts, miming putting the egg in his bosom) Full on like, "I think you should leave," trying to force the door in the wrong direction, spit down her chin, she's like (grunts).
ASHLEY: The door closes this way.
TRAVIS: Spittle flying.
TALIESIN: Every sentence of that conversation was just magic.
LIAM: Good game.
TRAVIS: Jester unleashed again. Just open the floodgates.
MARISHA: So good, dude.
ASHLEY: Oh, I love her so.
TALIESIN: I miss Pirate Captain Jester.
MATT: I could watch these groups interact for the rest of my life.
MARISHA: They have great interactions.
ROBBIE: Good chemistry.
LIAM: Jester and Imogen couldn't be more different.
LAURA: I know.
ROBBIE: I didn't even feel so out of the loop in your tower, either, because of your great book that you guys wrote.
SAM: That you read?
ROBBIE: In "The Eyes of Lucien" there's a really vivid description of what it's like in Caleb's tower.
SAM: You've done the research.
ROBBIE: Of course I have! You made me. (laughter)
MATT: That's valid. We actually paid you to do it, yeah.
ROBBIE: I had a really good mental image of where we are, so I didn't feel so displaced, because you all know that place like the back of your hands.
TALIESIN: And a little bit of those characters, too, which is-- although I liked that nobody quite knew anybody. So it gave you a little bit more even footing.
ROBBIE: The cat tunnels.
LAURA: The cat tunnels.
SAM: That was an amazing visual. I could see you as a Beetlejuice worm version--
ASHLEY: No, but using her fingers to go forward.
MARISHA: That's all I have.
MATT: The whole visual I had was Bishop in "Aliens", when he gets in the small tunnel trying to move with his shoulders. You're like, I hate this.
TALIESIN: All I could think of was, "Stop it, this is how we met. Goopy people in air ducts."
LIAM: There was never any reason--
TALIESIN: Don't do that.
MARISHA: Goopy people in air ducts!
TALIESIN: We all agree that's bad.
MARISHA: That's how we all met.
LIAM: There was never a reason to go there, but the dining room floor of this tower is-- so everything's like a nine-sided pie and there's a big two-thirds pie that is a dining area, and then one-third that is the kitchen, and it is what I think of as the CPU. The tunnels lead out from that kitchen to every bedchamber and every room, and they hear-- you pull a rope pull in any room where you're like, "I want tea right now." And a cat races through the marble run to get to your room. At the bedrooms there's a little door that they have to paw at so that you--
ASHLEY: Oh!
LIAM: Allow them admittance and then lock it up again.
LAURA: There's one cat named Ad-mittens.
ROBBIE: For some reason I pictured you moving quickly through the tunnels. It wasn't slow. You were moving through those things!
MARISHA: Because I still had Spider Climb.
MATT: That's terrifying. Almost as terrifying as the prospect that Imogen and Laudna brought Sprinkle into their room before they slept together. That means that Sprinkle curled off to the side and went, "Hmm!"
ROBBIE: That one you have to explain. That one somebody--
MATT: Artagan is like, "So that's how that works."
SAM: (to Robbie) Sprinkle is actually the Traveler, her god.
LAURA: "Well, I can hang here."
MATT: I wasn't sure the undead girl could be so limber."
ROBBIE: Oh, it really-- oh, okay. Oh, I get it now.
MATT: "She uses lightning. How curious!"
MARISHA: But she got him originally at a traveling pet merchant, and then The Traveler basically used him as like--
TRAVIS: A vessel.
LAURA: His proxy.
MARISHA: Yeah, a vessel. Like a proxy to watch--
ROBBIE: So there's a dude in there?
LAURA: Yeah, my god.
SAM: And her companion.
MATT: Well, he can jump in.
ROBBIE: He can jump in.
MARISHA: He jumps in and out.
LAURA: He probably is in there.
LIAM: A powerful faerie prince, essentially.
ROBBIE: Okay.
LAURA: The night before we all go into battle? He's probably in there. What else is he doing? He wants to see the moon.
ROBBIE: Awesome.
MATT: He's watching Imogen-- oh, wow, what's it called? The purple little electric toy thing that you shock people--
ROBBIE: Oh, that's not where I thought that was going.
LAURA and MARISHA: I know!
MATT: The violet wand, that's what it's called.
LAURA: The rabbit?
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought.
MATT: Or both, I guess, if you want to.
TALIESIN: I have an old stack of Traveler pamphlets, too, and a copy of Tusk Love.
ASHLEY: He can hop into Sprinkle at will?
MARISHA: He's a little rabbit!
SAM: Wasn't he punished, though, by the Moonweaver?
LAURA: Yeah, he came back.
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: They all sorted it out.
SAM: He can still do his thing?
MATT: I mean, more or less.
LIAM: Can't keep a bad fey down.
MATT: He's nowhere near the scale that he might have been at the height of his worship, because he kind of rescinded that as part of Traveler Con, and then the Moonweaver punished him, but he's still an archfey.
LAURA: Jester wants some power back, though, so she's trying to build him up again.
MARISHA: We're having Traveler Con--
TALIESIN: I love the pamphlets. I'm so excited.
MARISHA: --on a volcanic island, and then the Moonweaver came down and was like, "Fuck you for trying to pretend you're a god." And scolded him.
MATT: Yeah, he also didn't want to be a god anymore.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: He wasn't digging all the upkeep.
LAURA: It's a lot of work.
ASHLEY: I actually can't wait to do this again.
MATT: Yeah, he was like, "Ooh, I like being a god. I get power." And then the more people were praying to him and asking for stuff, he's like, "I hate this!"
ROBBIE: A lot of emails.
MATT: Yeah, exactly.
TALIESIN: Did you hand me a little rock dick, by the way?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: It is a little stone dick.
LAURA: It's a little jade dick.
LIAM: A little dick.
TALIESIN: It's a little jade dick? Thank you.
LAURA: I know, because I get them at a ton of conventions. I always get little dicks as a present. And they're little stone dicks. I have a collection of them now.
MATT: Incredible. Do you pray to them every morning when you get your work done?
LAURA: Of course. It's all different precious stones. So it's very colorful.
MATT: That's a good retirement plan. All righty, guys, let's pick this up next week. I'm excited to see where we go from here.
