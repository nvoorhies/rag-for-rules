BRIAN: "Um so for if this is your first time watching, our last year's episode where we opened up all the gifts is on YouTube, so you can find that for free. If this is your fist time watching what we do for Critmas is the Critters send in a lot of incredible stuff, much of it homemade. A lot of letters, a lot of fun and interesting and weird things that they think the cast will love, and for Critmas we try to open as much of those as we can on the air and say thank you to everyone for sending those in and for thinking of everybody and so that's basically it. It's gonna be chill, it's gonna be fun. We're all gonna get a little tipsy and at the end of this probably crash at Denny's."
TRAVIS: "Cronked up."
LAURA: "Woah."
TRAVIS: "Cronked up."
LIAM: "Uh, Dani's or Denny's?"
