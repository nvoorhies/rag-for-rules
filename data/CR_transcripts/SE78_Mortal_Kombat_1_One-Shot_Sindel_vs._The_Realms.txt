MARISHA: Hello, and welcome to this very special one-shot where we will be playing in the Mortal Kombat universe. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MARISHA: As a little treat tonight, we will actually be utilizing the rules for Till the Last Gasp as our system. 
SAM: Yeah! 
MARISHA: It's going to be a lot of fun, but first, let's meet our players, starting with you, Sam Riegel. 
SAM: I'm Sam Riegel, and tonight I'll be portraying the role of Johnny Cage. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Can you close that jacket at all? (laughter) 
SAM: I'm sorry. 
NOSHIR: Don't you dare. Yeah! 
SAM: I give the people what they want. 
NOSHIR: That's right. 
MARISHA: You've got the cutest little baby hair chest hair. It's so cute. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: I grew them just for tonight. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh, right! 
GINA: I think Johnny Cage would've gotten waxed, don't you think? 
TRAVIS: I do too, yeah. Yeah. 
GINA: He would be smooth as a dolphin. 
TRAVIS: He's laxing out here. (laughter) 
MARISHA: He doesn't have his groomer. He was busy, you know, doing something else. 
SAM: No. There's a strike. 
MARISHA: There's a strike, yes, exactly. (laughs) 
NOSHIR: Oh god. 
MARISHA: And Noshir, tell us who you are. 
NOSHIR: I'm Noshir Dalal, here as the wizard Rain. 
MARISHA and SAM: Yes! 
NOSHIR: Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
SAM: He's such a badass with ribbons. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: They're wraps, damn it! 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: You don't have to call the secret out! (laughter) 
MARISHA: We are not even started, and you're breaking the illusion! 
TRAVIS: No chill. No chill. 
NOSHIR: New teams. New teams. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Let's jump over to this side of the table. Gina! 
GINA: Hi, I am Gina Darling, and I'll be playing the fan favorite Kitana. 
SAM: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Oh boy! Watch out! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
GINA: I'm filled with those. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Amazing. 
MARISHA: And Travis. 
TRAVIS: Oh yes, I am Travis Willingham, and I will be playing Raiden, the old classic voice of Raiden. 
MARISHA: (laughs) And tonight, your master of ceremonies will be Sindel. 
SAM: Mm. 
MARISHA: If it was not obvious. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
SAM: It wasn't to me. 
MARISHA: Queen Sindel. Yes. 
GINA: Cool. 
MARISHA: As always, Sam is a new initiate to Mortal Kombat, because he's a new initiate to most things. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) So if he says something that doesn't make sense, that's why. And on that note-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Michelangelo is not a character in Mortal Kombat. 
MARISHA: While you may recognize the places explored and the characters fighting tonight, the story of this one shot and the interpretations of our characters are entirely our own creations and not official Kombat, official content, from the Mortal Kombat series. This is all made up. 
SAM: Yes. Totally. 
MARISHA: This is not canon. 
SAM: When we screw it up, it's not real. 
MARISHA: Yeah, not canon. 
TRAVIS: I'm sure we will! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Thank you so much to Warner Bros. Games for letting us play around in Outworld, and of course, for sponsoring this one-shot. 
SAM: Yeah! 
GINA: Woo! 
MARISHA: I think that's it. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy, oh boy! 
MARISHA: Let's jump into tonight's episode of (screaming) Mortal Kombat! 
SAM and GINA: ♪ (Mortal Kombat theme) ♪ 

Part I[]
MARISHA: There's a high-pitched ringing in your ears. Your heads are all throbbing with a familiar sensation. You slowly blink your eyes open to blinding light. As the ring in your ears begins to fade, it is slowly replaced with a familiar sound. 
TRAVIS: (excited laughs) 
MARISHA: A sound of cheering. Golf claps abound. Mild whoops and hollers. You get to your feet, and much to your chagrin, you appear to be in the middle of a palace, and there's a party happening. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby! Sorry. 
MARISHA: You all are the main entertainment. The palace is adorned with decorations. You see topiary plants and garland, a nice little bubbling champagne fountain in the middle. The surrounding area is lush, beautiful greenery, domed buildings that you can see outside of this palace entryway. Everything is decorated with a gold filigree leafing. As you start to analyze the scene after a moment more, you look across the room and notice that there is a buffet. 
SAM: Oh! 
GINA: Oh! 
MARISHA: A nice charcuterie board laid upon it. But the buffet table appears to be a man? 
SAM: Hmm? 
MARISHA: A very large, buff man with bulging muscles, a horned helmet upon him, pauldrons that curl up and are spiked, and all of his limbs are broken and cracked backwards-- 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: -- attached to table legs. Then you look even closer and see that the table decorations of little topiary plants and bonsai trees aren't placed upon him. They are growing through him. 
SAM: Ew! 
GINA: Ooh! 
MARISHA: One through the center, coming out the back of his neck, growing into and out of his mouth, with the other one just below his pelvic bone, growing outwards. 
TRAVIS: I'm sure he's fine. 
MARISHA: Blood dripping down. 
SAM: Ugh! 
GINA: He seems great. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MARISHA: You see tears, bloodstained tears trickling out of the corners of his eyes. He's still alive. 
TRAVIS: Come on! That's-- (disgusted, surprised exclaiming) 
MARISHA: You all recognize him. This is Sindel's husband, Shao Kahn. 
GINA: Daddy? 
TRAVIS: Damn! I thought it might be! 
MARISHA: (laughs) As you look past the buffet table, you see, sitting at a throne at the end of the room, a beautiful woman with long, flowing white hair, a shock of black down the middle. She wears lavender armor that appears to be decorative in nature. This is Sindel. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: She's holding coupe glass of champagne. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: "Ah! Hello, champions!" 
GINA: Hi, Mom. 
MARISHA: "Hello, daughter. (kiss) I've missed you so." 
GINA: Missed you, too. 
TRAVIS: This family's fucked up. (laughter) 
MARISHA: "Welcome to Edenia." 
SAM: (whispering) Edenia. 
MARISHA: "I apologize for the rude awakening, the abrupt summoning of you here. However, it seems I never got your RSVPs for my little celebration. I'll just assume that they got lost in the mail. (pompous laugh) You see, we have much to celebrate. For starters, my reclamation of the throne, my divine right to rule Edenia. You see, my beloved realm has been subjected to so many intruders. It has been a stomping ground for invaders and traitors alike. For centuries, my people have been subjected to brutality. But that ends now. In addition, we are also celebrating my divorce--" 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: "-- from my wretched husband!" She gestures to the Shao Kahn table. "Isn't that right, my darling?" He just gags and tries to squirm, but it is fruitless. 
TRAVIS: Got a mouth full of tree, man. I mean, what do you want from the guy? 
GINA: This is how I find out? You couldn't-- All right, I mean. 
TRAVIS: That's true! 
MARISHA: "Sorry, love." 
GINA: Hi, Dad. 
MARISHA: "We couldn't get ahold of you!" 
TRAVIS: (Shao Kahn's muffled speech) 
GINA: I got it. It's fine. It's fine. 
MARISHA: "Now, to celebrate this wondrous occasion, I thought I would throw a tournament! Please, champions, why don't you introduce yourselves to my esteemed party guests? Let's start with you, Johnny Cage." 
SAM: Well, hold on just a second, lady. Did Skidoo set this up? 
MARISHA: "Who's Skidoo?" 
SAM: Skidoo Finkelstein, my agent? Because times have been a little tough. Obviously, there's strikes going on. I haven't worked in a couple months, but that's not on me! That's on the industry! The industry has slowed down! I still got it! I'm still at the top of my game, and don't let anyone tell you any differently. Now, if he set up some personal appearances so I can keep the cash flow going, I get it, but how much are we talking here? $50,000, $100,000? What am I getting for this? 
MARISHA: "The affairs of Earthrealm are not of my concern, and I would hope that it is apparent, I'm pretty anti-union." (laughter) 
GINA: As Sindel famously is. 
SAM: Listen, listen, we need those protections. There's all sorts of-- The producers are trying to screw us left and right! Listen, I'm not going to get into that right now. 
MARISHA: "Rain." 
SAM: Wait! I didn't even get to strut! Aw, fine. 
NOSHIR: Earthrealmers. (groans) 
MARISHA: "It is good to see you again. Please, tell my guests whom you are." 
NOSHIR: My name is Rain. A near god with wizard powers, I control the water, elements, and lightning, and I am not here for your entertainment. 
MARISHA: "Hmm. I hate to inform you, today you actually are here for my entertainment. (laughs haughtily)" 
SAM: Being an entertainer is not such a bad thing. By the way, I feel like I messed up on my intro. Can I just get one more shot? 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: "Fine." 
SAM: Johnny Cage, six foot one. I'm represented by Finkelstein and Finkelstein. I'll be reading for the role of Champion tonight. All right, good. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: That's my slate. Keep going. (laughter) 
GINA: I hate him so much. 
TRAVIS: You got to be taped for a slate. 
MARISHA: "Lovely daughter, Kitana Kahn." 
GINA: Mother. 
MARISHA: "Welcome home, sweetheart." 
GINA: This is not how I wanted to see you again, but I guess this'll do. I hope you've been doing well. 
MARISHA: "I've been doing all right." 
GINA: I bet. 
MARISHA: "Nothing like learning you've been brainwashed by your husband for, like, the third time. What a good day for clarity." 
GINA: Yeah, excellent. This is exactly how I wanted to find out. So good seeing you, and Dad has looked better, but-- 
MARISHA: "Oh, I don't know. I think he looks quite well, actually." 
GINA: I am Kitana. As you can tell, I'm clearly related to them. I haven't been home in a while, and I see you've done some redecorating with your topiaries. 
MARISHA: "Mm-hmm. Yes." 
GINA: I'm happy to be here, Mother. You look wonderful. Not a day over-- I don't-- Okay. I'm going to stay away from that. 
MARISHA: "Just a little, a thousand plus. But it's fine. Not a day under a millennia." 
SAM: Do you use fillers and stuff? Is that what you do? 
MARISHA: "(scoffs)" 
SAM: Because I do, too. There's nothing wrong with it. 
MARISHA: "This is a realm with magic and sorcerers. Abso-fucking-lutely." 
SAM: Okay. 
GINA: As you can tell, my mother has a very eclectic way of celebrating things. Happy divorce, Mom. 
MARISHA: "Thank you. Honestly, it's nice to have your father serve me for once." 
GINA: Ew. 
MARISHA: (blows kiss) 
GINA: Gross. 
MARISHA: "Raiden. Protector of the Earthrealm." 
TRAVIS: Always a pleasure. God of thunder and lightning, also. 
MARISHA: "Yes." 
TRAVIS: Important to add. Not to pull out any quick minute critiques, but really, no purple carpet? No step and repeat? Johnny Cage isn't the only one that's disappointed. I mean, this form needs to be documented. I have so many different skins. 
MARISHA: "Don't worry." 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: "You'll all be getting quite the tour later on." 
TRAVIS: Fair enough. 
MARISHA: "I'm sure you'll be impressed." 
TRAVIS: I've seen Shao Kahn look worse, but not much worse. 
MARISHA: "Well, without further ado, why don't we get the celebration going?" 
GINA: (weakly) Hooray. 
MARISHA: "Now, what is a party if you cannot celebrate it with friends? Johnny, Raiden." 
SAM: Yeah? 
MARISHA: "I'm sure you remember your old pal, Nightwolf?" 
SAM: You know I do! Sorry, who's Nightwolf? 
TRAVIS: Okay, you've met him multiple times. You signed something for him in 1996. 
SAM: Oh, I did, yeah. I never forget a fan. 
MARISHA: "Sheeva!" Sindel signals to her right hand woman, Sheeva, a buff woman with multiple arms. She goes and she reaches behind the throne and pulls out Nightwolf, who is bound in chains and looks severely beaten already. Nightwolf is a Native American with dark black hair that hits his shoulders and red face paint that drips. You can see it is streaming, and you can't exactly tell where the face paint begins and the blood ends. He is tossed into the middle of the floor. All the guests just clap. Sheeva detaches him from his chains. "You see, Nightwolf once sacrificed himself to kill me, taking me down with him. (humorless laugh) So brave, so heroic, so noble. I would like to recreate that moment tonight. Just a little sacrifice on his part. But this time, I'm staying right here. Johnny Cage?" 
SAM: Yeah? 
MARISHA: "Introduce Nightwolf to his sacrifice." 
SAM: Introduce him to his sacrifice? What does that mean? You want me to fight him or something? 
MARISHA: "Absolutely." 
ANNOUNCER: Round one. Fight! 
SAM: What? Hey, listen, lady, I didn't sign up for this. I've got to call my car service and go home. I've got to get my beauty sleep tonight! What-- 
MARISHA: "(shrieks)" A Banshee Scream comes your direction from Sindel. Chunks of your face begin to peel away. Your ears immediately rupture, and blood pours out from them. 
TRAVIS: That was a good scream. 
MARISHA: Her eyes turn white for a flash and begin to fade. "Fight!" 
SAM: This is not an optional thing? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Fine, fine. You brought us here for a show and I'm a showman. 
MARISHA: Delirious, Nightwolf, knowing that he is about to fight for his life, charges at you. 
SAM: Oh god! 
MARISHA: He summons, out of his hand, a tomahawk made of pure spirit energy and lunges in your direction. 
SAM: Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
MARISHA: What do you do? 
SAM: I-I-I attack! I'm going to drop into the splits to dodge his tomahawk strike, and I'm going to go straight for the nut punch, right away, first thing out of the gate. 
MARISHA: He comes and he does a wide swing, aiming directly for your neck, but as you immediately drop into the splits, he is not seeing it coming, and (grunts) right in the testes. 
SAM: I'm sorry, bro. It's nothing personal. 
MARISHA: He's coming at you again with another swing with the opposite hand. 
SAM: I will try to lift his ankle from under him and get him on the ground. 
MARISHA: It succeeds. You successfully trip him. He lands hard on his back. He's already incredibly weak and delirious, but he does a little fan kick and stands back up quite quickly. 
SAM: I will cartwheel over to the buffet table. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Grab a skewer of roast beef. 
MARISHA: Incredible. 
SAM: Not even shaking the roast beef off, I'm going to toss it back and forth between my hands, do one of these things. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: And be like: Sorry, bro! It's nothing personal! I've just got to put on a show for the lady! It's all show business! I'll go for the stab right into the head. 
MARISHA: Fantastic. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) With the meat on there? 
MARISHA: The audience sees a few chunks of beef. It's impressive. You hit his temple with such force that it instantly shatters his skull and the beef stays on and goes all the way through his cranium and out the other side. A few carrots and potatoes tumble off. 
TRAVIS: Ugh! 
MARISHA: He is instantly skewered and falls backwards, joining the buffet table, dead. You see very similar soul energy that he started with starts to be yanked from his body, and it's siphoned right into Sindel's cocktail. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MARISHA: "Mm." 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
MARISHA: "Oh, oh, that was good. And we're just getting started. Kitana, my love." 
GINA: Yes. Yes, Mother? Kitana is standing at the buffet table, slicing a piece of butter off with her fan. (laughter) 
GINA: Buttering a biscuit. Yes, Mother? 
MARISHA: "Mm. You know, I thought for such a wondrous occasion we could also make this a little bit of a family reunion." 
GINA: There's a reason why I don't go to these. 
MARISHA: "Mileena, my darling." 
GINA: Ugh! Huh-- Wha-- Well. 
MARISHA: Coming from the back, you see your twin sister, Mileena. 
SAM: This family's fucked up. 
MARISHA: Yeah. She looks strikingly like you, almost identical, if it weren't for the tears in the corners of her cheeks, which is obscured by a maroon, fuchsia face mask. It matches her maroon armor. As she immediately draws her two sais, Mileena looks over at Sindel. "You know I've always wanted to impress you, Mother." Without hesitating, "(shouts)" she launches towards you. 
GINA: Ugh. I drop my fan, butter comes flying out. 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It makes the floor slippery. 
GINA: Yeah. I immediately block her hits with my two fans. I look at her and I say: Sister, it's been a long time. I see you haven't gotten any stronger. Then push her off. 
MARISHA: Enraged by this, she rips off her mask and spews black acid vile right to your face. Bile, not vile, right into your face. It splashes up across to you and it starts to burn and singe your neck and into your forehead. 
GINA: (shouts) Ah! (gasps) Ah! 
MARISHA: She immediately pulls up her sais and comes with a double attack. 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
GINA: Kitana starts blocking her attacks. And, you know, no matter what you do, I'll never be as ugly as you. 
SAM: Oof! 
GINA: Keeps blocking her attacks, pushes her off, and uses her back of her hand to wipe off the acid to stop whatever burning else to keep going. 
MARISHA: Mileena knows that she has you on her back foot, and so she's continuing to pummel you and is getting you backed into a corner before she leaps and does a spinning fan kick, aiming right for your temple. 
GINA: I put one hand up, ready my blades, and slice her right in her Achilles' heel. (oohing) 
MARISHA: Incredible. It lands, and you see it slices almost perfectly through with your bladed fan tip. She lands, but she doesn't realize at first that she is been hit in her Achilles. She takes another step back and her entire foot begins to rip off of her leg. She screams in agony, but cannot and will not be stopped with Mommy and Daddy watching, so she's lunging towards you again. 
GINA: Kitana starts walking towards her, closes her fan so they're two big blades, jumps on her, wraps her legs around her waist, looks at Sindel, and goes: You know, Mother, I have always been so tired of playing for your entertainment. And starts stabbing at her. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
GINA: Next time you want me around, maybe send a message first so I'm dressed for the occasion. But also, give me a better opponent. 
SAM: Oh! 
GINA: And stabs her right in the neck. 
TRAVIS: I take my plate-- 
GINA: Both sides. 
TRAVIS: -- and move it out of the way. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You are carving away at her collarbone to where you can start to see chunks of bone flying out like shrapnel, you do a massive sink of this killing blow, and it goes all the way through and ruptures out of her chest on the opposite side. As you rip away your fans, it's like an autopsy, like a surgeon's cut. As her skin is flayed open, exposing her ribcage, she stumbles backwards and collapses. "Hmm, you were always my favorite daughter," Sindel says,  "plus, she forgot my birthday seven years ago and I will never forgive her for it." 
GINA: Kitana looks at Mileena, knowing that she can still hear with whatever life she has left and goes: Did you hear that? I'm the favorite. Then saunters off. 
MARISHA: Once again, Sindel's eyes widen, and you see her start to become sallowed in her expression as she reaches out and siphons the soul from her adopted daughter and pours it into her glass. "(sighs) Family really does come first, doesn't it?" 
GINA: Truly. 
MARISHA: "Mm-hmm." 
GINA: Then turns around and goes: Ugh. And then back to the buffet table. 
MARISHA: "Rain, (sweetly) I have a favor to ask you. (fiercely) "You!" 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Sindel points at one of her guests. He is currently eating a big piece of sausage from the Shao Kahn charcuterie. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
GINA: Sponsored. 
MARISHA: He looks incredibly taken aback (laughs) by the fact that he is just called out by the queen. Come to the center!" As he walks forward, (laughs) Sindel begins to describe a dream. "You see, I was awoken last night with this terrible feeling like this man, he must be Noob Saibot. He was the one who partnered me with Shao Kahn, and even when I tried to kill myself to get away from it, I was resurrected. And then I died and I was resurrected again. And then I was dead and then I was resurrected again. And then I was turned into a revenant at one point, and then I was dead again. I just can't help but feel this man is responsible. (yells) I know it's you, Noob Saibot. Kill him!" 
ANNOUNCER: Round one. (laughter) Fight! 
NOSHIR: The audacity of these mortals. Let's see what happens, Noob, when you can't see your way. I reach into the aqueous humor of his eyes and pull the water out of the front of his face. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
SAM: Oh jeez! 
TRAVIS: What was the name of that location? (laughter) 
MARISHA: This man does not understand why he is here. He has his mouth still filled with sausages. He goes, "No, no, no, no, no, no!" Ill-equipped to face any of the power and the might from anyone in this room, you suddenly see as the entire moisture and the body of his cheekbones begins to be sucked dry, as his eyes are ripped from their sockets and every fluid imaginable gushes from his orifices. He is instantly dehydrated within a moment, and collapses face down in the center of the room. 
NOSHIR: Allow me, my queen, to make you a cocktail fitting of the occasion. 
TRAVIS: Oh god. 
NOSHIR: I pull the water from the fountain and I pour it all into the body and bloat him like a balloon. 
TRAVIS: Ugh! (laughs) 
MARISHA: "Ah." 
NOSHIR: I pull that mixture out of every pore and dump it in a glass. 
MARISHA: "(sighs) Mm." 
NOSHIR: Congratulations. 
MARISHA: "I see someone here knows how to treat a lady." 
SAM: I mean, I would just-- Aperol Spritzes are good, too. (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Aperol Spritzes! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Sindel relishes in the moment. "Mm. Well, now, I think it's time to finalize my divorce. Raiden?" 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MARISHA: "It would be my honor if you were the officiant. The closer of this ill-fated clause." She walks over to the table of her husband and immediately grabs the bonsai tree that is growing out of his throat and rips it forward, standing him forth onto his limbs. She reaches through and removes the skewer from his mouth. You can see he's still conscious, as you can peer through his face to Sindel on the other side. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: She snaps him around and shoves him forward, sinking her claws into his shoulders, piercing until they bleed even further. She whispers in his ear, "It's been a pleasure, my love," and tosses him in your direction. 
TRAVIS: I was ordained decades ago, but I'm sure my certificate has expired since then. 
MARISHA and NOSHIR: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: But I'll do my best. Dearly hated, we are gathered here today to witness the separation-- 
MARISHA: "Ugh!" 
TRAVIS: -- of Sindel and Shao Kahn. I start to form a little raincloud above Shao Kahn that starts to drizzle dramatically. 
MARISHA: This man, you will recognize him. He's the conquer of realms, one of the most feared men in history. He is mere fraction of himself. All of his limbs battered and broken, he has no use of any of them. His hammer that he normally wields is mounted behind Sindel, a trophy that she has already procured. He is dazed and standing in nothing more than an idle wobble. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The classic. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You see a little blue glow start to form in my hand as my eyes flash white. I say: Shao Kahn, do you know what happens to a man when he's struck by lightning? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'll sink into the floor and rise up right in front of him and go: They die. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'll put my hand in his chest. You see this arc of lightning, and start to rock his body. 
MARISHA: For a second, the lightning is so strong that from everyone else's glance, it appears as if you can see the entire inner working of his skeletal structure-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: -- as his skin flashes. It's as if you have x-ray vision. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: You can see as these moments where you can see past his corporeal form, every organ in his body that is still intact slowly ruptures, one by one, as the bolt completes its arc and emanates out from all of his organs and he falls, merely a fried crisp, into the middle of the room. "(sighs) I'm a free woman. (laughs) It feels good to be single again. Mm. Well, thank you all for your services. Now that we have a little of that housekeeping done, why don't we get into what we're all really here for?" 
GINA: That wasn't it? 
MARISHA: "Let the tournaments begin!" 
GINA: Ugh! 
TRAVIS: I thought it was also it, too. 
GINA: Ugh, I didn't block out the time for this. Okay, well. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Everyone in the ballroom immediately clears backwards. Sindel begins to reach, and with her powers, an arena forms. Stadium seating bursts from the palace floors around her. Everyone who was there gathering begins to take their seats in a haste. "All right, I would like you to pair off. Teams. We're going to do a little 2v2 action. Choose your battlemates." 
SAM: Wait, wait, wait, before we choose, sorry, sorry, but if this is being broadcast on pay per view-- 
TRAVIS: I knew it. 
SAM: Or an SVOD service or something, I'm going to need a cut. I'm going to need the rights-- 
TRAVIS: Ticket sales? 
SAM: Ticket sales. If there's spinoffs, if there's merch, I mean, we're going to get cut in on this, right? 
MARISHA: "I will cut you in when I have your soul in my hands." 
SAM: Well, that's not going to happen, lady. My soul is, I don't think you could afford it, frankly. 
MARISHA: "Well then, you'd better win." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Not a problem. (sighs) 
GINA: Do you want-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's team up. 
GINA: Yeah, let's do it together. 
TRAVIS: Your family's fucked up. I like the way you work. 
GINA: Thank you. Thank you so much. 
SAM: Yeah. 
NOSHIR: You're either very capable or very stupid. 
SAM: A little column A. 
NOSHIR: Lead the way. (laughter) 
SAM: A little column B. I'm an actor. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: I'm both of those things all the time. 
NOSHIR: I'm going to be doing some heavy lifting. 
SAM: Oh, we're a team, then? Because, you know, I had my eye on Kitana over there. I mean-- 
TRAVIS: No. She's spoken for, Cage. These rights have been purchased. 
SAM: Ah. 
GINA: I would cut you in two, and I mean in two. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: All right, fine. Rain, was it? 
TRAVIS: That's good. That's good. 
NOSHIR: That's right. 
SAM: You know, a lot of excessive humidity does bad things to my hair. So if you can focus the moisture away from me, that would be ideal. 
TRAVIS: I summon another raincloud. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Over Johnny. (laughter) 
GINA: You know what? Why don't you let me take him? 
NOSHIR: I'll do my best. 
MARISHA: "Let's see how these pairs of champions fare. Don't worry if you lose. Death is not final. Now!" Doing it again. 
ANNOUNCER: Round one. Fight! (laughter) 
GINA: It's good. It is good. 
TRAVIS: Doing it again! 
GINA: I don't blame you. I don't blame you at all. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: We're going. 
MARISHA: We're going. 
SAM: We're in combat. 
MARISHA: We are going to start our first official game of Till the Last Gasp. I would love to give a shout out really quick to the Darrington Press team who built special rules. 
TRAVIS: (whistles) 
GINA: Woo-hoo! 
MARISHA: A little bit homebrew here to really give us the Mortal Kombat experience, first and foremost being 2v2 battle. Normally, this is a 1v1 game. But this is going to be a 2v2 match. We got our faces on this side, Kitana and Raiden. You guys will be our faces for the sake of clarity. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Johnny Cage and Rain, you will be our heels. 
SAM: We got this. 
MARISHA: Let's everybody roll for action points and initiative. 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
GINA: Are you serious? 
TRAVIS: Come on. 
GINA: Are you serious right now? Okay. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I do another d6. 
GINA: I rolled a one. 
TRAVIS: No way! 
GINA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: You rolled a one? 
TRAVIS: We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. 
SAM: We got this in the bag. Do we choose our stance? Is that how we do this? 
MARISHA: Yes, everyone choose your stance. 
SAM: Okay. Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Wow, these are the worst rolls. All the other sessions. Well, it'll be-- (laughs) It'll be a quick death. 
SAM: Let's spend a couple edge dice. Ooh yeah, baby. 
SAM: Everything's in my favor today. 
GINA: This is how we start, huh? This is how we start? 
TRAVIS: This is real bad. 
GINA: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: Real bad. Real bad. 
GINA: What'd you get? 
TRAVIS: Four. I only have four action points. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm bad. 
SAM: (laughs) 
GINA: Oh no. 
SAM: We got this. 
MARISHA: Now we're going to do popcorn initiative here. We will start-- Who had the highest roll on their d20? 
SAM: 15. 
MARISHA: 15? 
TRAVIS: Eight. 
MARISHA: Okay, it looks like-- 
NOSHIR: Eight. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: We'll be starting with Johnny Cage. 
GINA: I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it, man. 
TRAVIS: Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. 
GINA: I'm back in my home, and I do not like it here. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We're shaking them out. We're shaking out the cobwebs. We're getting the bad ones out first. 
MARISHA: Johnny Cage will be starting us off, and then how we're going to do this back-and-forth between the two teams, Johnny, you will basically be electing the person that you're going to be squaring off against. Then, the person on the team face that will be going next after you. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: But first and foremost, let's start this off. Sindel sits back down on her throne, has now two cocktails thanks to Rain that she is double fisting. (laughter) She's been day drinking all day. This is her fucking party, and she is incredibly excited to watch this fight. 
SAM: All right. I did that once already. Okay. Ready at least-- (mumbling description). 
TRAVIS: We're going to cramp your style. 
SAM: Okay. I did that already. Okay. Okay. So (mumbling description) Okay! I'll just do that one. It's easy. I'm going to land a hit on my foe.  I am going to rattle my foe into the defensive stance. Does that count as landing a hit on my foe? No. That's just rattling. 
MARISHA: No. Rattling is a specific action. 
SAM: Then I'm not going to do that. Instead, I'm going to compel my foe to draw one drama. I'm going to head over to Kitana. I'm going to lower my shades and be like: Let's dance, baby. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Then you have to draw a drama card. 
GINA: Oh god. Jeez. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
GINA: Kitana looks at him and goes: I can see why I've never heard of any of your movies before. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It says here, "Lament what might've been if things had been different in this life." 
GINA: Oh, okay. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
GINA: If things had been-- Well, sometimes I wish I had real parents, but here I am doing this bull, ooh, I don't know if I can, this bull just to entertain my mother. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: What is this, your fourth divorce? 
MARISHA: "Mm, depending on which universe, yes." 
GINA: Jeez. I still have some stuff that I left in my room I need to go pick up. 
MARISHA: "You know, maybe one day, my love, you can meet your first father, the man that I originally married, the man that I chose, whose name, this is a true story, was Jerrod." 
TRAVIS: What? 
MARISHA: "Yes." (laughs) 
GINA: My dad's name is Jerrod? 
MARISHA: "Yes, darling." 
GINA: No. 
MARISHA: "Your dad's name was Jerrod." 
GINA: Jerrod. 
MARISHA: "(laughs)" 
GINA: Ugh. 
TRAVIS: This is why you don't ask questions. You don't want to know the truth. 
SAM: Is it still my turn? I keep going 'til I'm out of action points? 
MARISHA: No, you did one action, correct? 
SAM: I did an action, yes. 
MARISHA: Now you pick who on the other side-- 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: -- you would like to see go next. 
SAM: I mean, I'll say to Kitana: I just wanted to fight you. I didn't need the whole therapy dump. But, you know, that's cool, too. I guess my presence makes you feel like that. But why don't you go next? I'm ready for you. 
GINA: (scoffs) Men. All right. Kitana readies her fans and says, let's see-- (mumbling description) 
TRAVIS: I've seen what those do to butter. (laughter) 
GINA: Okay. She looks at Johnny and goes: Johnny, why don't we move to somewhere more comfortable? 
SAM: Yeah, baby. 
GINA: She takes her fans and she punches him in the throat with it, knocking him through the windows of the main hall here to the backyard-- 
MARISHA: To the courtyard? 
GINA: To the courtyard. 
MARISHA: Incredible. 
GINA: Where he crashes onto the ground, and she steps out of the window. You want to get to know me a little bit better, sweetheart? 
SAM: (choked) I do. (coughing) 
NOSHIR and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: So we will have a second marker tracker for you guys. As you ricochet, you take out several pillars of the palace in your process, Johnny. You have the wind knocked the fuck out of you as you land smack dab through some very well-carved sculpted bushes and right smack dab in the middle of an incredibly gorgeous courtyard. You hear the audience cheer and clap. 
SAM: (strained) Thank you, thank you. I'll be here all night. 
MARISHA: From the distance, you hear Sindel laugh with glee. 
SAM: Then, whose go is it next? 
MARISHA: Now, you did your action, you so you get to-- Then once again, if any of these count towards your objectives, make sure you mark your objectives as you complete them. Then, Kitana, you make a choice as to who you would like to see go next. 
GINA: Okay. She knows that Sindel's, her topiaries and her carved bushes are her most favorite things in the whole entire property, so she starts slicing away at it, like: You know what, why don't you take a little while to get up, wipe yourself off. You're bleeding. She takes a little break. Then, Rain can go. Just doing some slicing over here. 
MARISHA: "Not my peacock bush!" 
SAM and NOSHIR: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Peacock. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: So, in the great hall. 
SAM: ♪ (background battle music) ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: It's just you and me, Raiden, supposed god of thunder. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
NOSHIR: Earthrealm has been a thorn in my side, and you stand between me and my destiny. That is why my realm will reign supreme. Draw a drama card. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Yes, draw one from the ones next to you first, the one that-- 
NOSHIR: So the foe draws a drama card. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I got you. 
SAM: Oh, he's using a courtyard action. 
MARISHA: Oh, the foe draws it? Okay. 
NOSHIR: Yeah. 
SAM: Describe-- 
MARISHA: Oh, yes. 
SAM: Describe-- 
MARISHA: The Great Hall action? 
SAM: Oh, it is the Great Hall action. That's right. Why your realm is the best. 
TRAVIS: (mumbling description) "Declare your realm shall triumph, and then a foe draws one drama. Offer to help your foe redeem themselves if they survive the duel." Oh nice. 
MARISHA: Mm! That's very Raiden-tastic. 
TRAVIS: I understand why you think your realm is the best, but I promise you, if you survive this, you can redeem yourself by picking another color palette other than one that sucks up to Sindel. A little originality might help. And-- 
MARISHA: "I do love purple." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It runs in the family. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is that the action for Rain? 
MARISHA: That is the action for Rain. 
NOSHIR: So if that takes zero action points, does that still count as my action? 
MARISHA: I believe-- "Each combatant can do this once on their turn." I don't think so. I'm going to say that that's actually a free action. 
SAM: Free action? 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Let me check if that is correct. 
SAM: Eh. You're the GM. 
MARISHA: But I'll say I'm the GM, and you can do your action. 
NOSHIR: Okay. Great. I'm going to spend two action points. I need neither your lip nor your mercy! Rain will fall like daggers from the sky! I pull down water droplets that turn into blades. 
TRAVIS: What?! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That is incredible. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That's pretty cool. 
NOSHIR and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: I feel a little bad I didn't think of that first. (laughter) 
MARISHA: With that, you start to hear the slight sound of rain that begins to ricochet around us. 
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh, oh, oh. 
SAM: Oh, oh. 
GINA: Ooh, wow. 
TRAVIS: Normally that would be cool, but ow, ow! Oh god, shit. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Shit! Oh, there's so many! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: That's really cool. 
MARISHA: Okay. Then, Noshir, or Rain. Who would you like to see go next? 
NOSHIR: So in this round, Raiden, I believe, is the only one who hasn't gone, right? 
SAM: That's right. 
NOSHIR: Bring it. 
TRAVIS: So as I stand there in the dagger rain-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: -- getting absolutely annihilated, I'll say: Let's take this outside! I will push forward and levitate off the ground and fly straight for you and put both my hands in the middle of your chest, and we explode out towards the courtyard, driving us to our comrades. I'll spend-- 
MARISHA: Fantastic. 
TRAVIS: -- two action points to land a hit on my foe. 
NOSHIR: Awesome. 
MARISHA: Amazing. In full classic Raiden fashion, you see him go from vertical to horizontal as he slams into your chest, and you are jettisoned once again, smashing through what pillars weren't already broken, thanks to Johnny Cage and Kitana, and find yourself smacked right next to your partner. 
TRAVIS: It does destroy the peacock bush, though, unfortunately, which means you also get some fan chops as you go through it. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Sindel looks at her now destroyed bush and goes, "(pouts) Flawless victory." (laughter) As a little tear falls into her champagne coupe. 
TRAVIS: Next, I'll turn my head to see what Johnny Cage is doing as he looks at himself in his sunglasses. 
SAM: Yeah, I'm wiping off my sunglasses. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Getting back into it. I've recovered, and I'm going to use the Courtyard action, spending two action points to "describe how you impress or intimidate onlookers. A foe must draw one drama card or become rattled." So I will say: Earlier, Kitana, you said you hadn't heard of my movies. Well, let me tell you what you're missing. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Perhaps you've heard of the film "Caged Rage"? 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Jeez. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
SAM: It earned over $10 million at the box office. Yes, it cost $100 million to make, but we're going to make it up in streaming. I also made a great film about 10 years called "Uncaged Beast." Then, I've got a comedy coming out called "Kindergarten Cage." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
SAM: It's a little departure for me, but if you've got nieces or nephews, you can bring them to that. Anyway, I'm just saying, I've got a very deep resume. Maybe you should look me up on IMDb, and that will impress you. Draw one drama card. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Earthrealm stuff. Do we do something at the top of the round, by the way? 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: A new round? 
SAM: It's not a new round yet because we haven't spent our action points. 
MARISHA: It's not a new round yet. Yes, you all have to-- 
TRAVIS: Right. That's right. 
MARISHA: Once everyone has depleted all of their action points, then we will move into the next round. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful, beautiful. That's right. 
GINA: Oh, okay. 
SAM: I have completed one of my four objectives already. 
TRAVIS: Dang. Dang! 
MARISHA: Ooh, wow! Wowsers. 
GINA: All right. My drama card says, "Call upon a power greater than your own for strength or guidance," and the effect is ready an edge die. 
GINA: Cool. 
MARISHA: Ooh. Okay, great. So yes, you get to pick one of those. Yes. 
GINA: I can put that anywhere? 
MARISHA: Correct. 
GINA: Okay. Cool. Kitana stops with the topiary terrorism and-- (laughter) 
GINA: Looks over at Raiden and goes: Raiden, do you mind helping me out a little bit? Raises her fans into the sky. Like, you know that lightning thing that you do? 
TRAVIS: Oh, no problem. 
GINA: Grant me power! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (lightning strike) 
GINA: The lightning strikes hits the metals of my blade on my fan. 
SAM: Cool. 
GINA: And goes: Sorry. Never heard of those. Never want to. 
SAM: I'm going to win you over, babe. (laughter) 
SAM: And that'll be the sweetest victory yet. (laughter) 
GINA: Then I ready an edge die. 
TRAVIS: "Kindergarten Cage." 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (Arnold Schwarzenegger) It's not a tumor. (laughter) 
SAM: That was copyrighted. We had to do, "It's not a boil." 
TRAVIS: Oh got it. 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: "It's not a boil." (laughs) 
GINA: At this point, there is electric currents coursing through her fan, all the blades in her fan like: Oh, I like how this looks. 
SAM: Mm, I like the lighting on me, too. Nice. 
GINA: Do you want to switch? 
MARISHA: (laughs) Fantastic. Then, that was your turn, correct? 
SAM: That's my turn. 
MARISHA: So who do you want to see go next? 
SAM: Oh, let's go over to Raiden. 
TRAVIS: My turn. I am going to spend two action points, and I'm going to change my stance to wary. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Seems like a very weak move. 
TRAVIS: Well, look, I'm going to call out to-- 
SAM: For a weak old man. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to call out to Rain, who's got, you know, bush shit in his hair. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: (spits) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Hey, bro, bro. Come on. Let's get it together. The party's on. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I will motion to Rain. 
NOSHIR: I've been waiting for this. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
NOSHIR: So-- 
NOSHIR: ♪ Dun dun dun dun dun ♪ 
MARISHA: Storm god versus storm god. Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
NOSHIR: All right. I'm going to-- (sighs) I think this courtyard could use a little redecorating. I summon the clouds, I draw down the water, and then I blast the entire courtyard with lightning. I scorch all the bushes. I char everything around into black ash. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. Amazing. 
SAM: I just read my resume. 
NOSHIR: Most fitting. (laughter) 
SAM: Your move is slightly cooler. 
TRAVIS: I went to Kinko's before this. Stapled some head shots. 
MARISHA: The lightning ricochets throughout the courtyard and ends up arcing all the way to the palace walls, as it goes inside where the audience is watching and creates this arc lightning almost in the top of the palace for a second as a giant kaboom cracks, causing the entire arena to shudder for a minute. Very impressive. All right, and how's everyone doing on action points? 
TRAVIS: I'm out. 
GINA: Got three. 
MARISHA: You're out. You got three. 
SAM: I have three left. 
MARISHA: Okay, so it's still-- 
NOSHIR: Whoa! 
SAM: Let's go. 
MARISHA: -- between the two of you. Kitana. 
GINA: Okay. Kitana notices everything is burnt to an ash and says: Ugh, mother's pissed. You know what? Let's make some more destruction happen in this house. Then she looks over at Johnny Cage, and says: Johnny, remember how earlier I just threw you around and thrashed you around a little bit? 
SAM: I liked it, baby. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
GINA: (disgusted scoff) 
MARISHA: "Ugh." 
GINA: What do you say we recreate that scene? She shoves her two fans into his ribcage and tosses him over to spend two hit points to move him to the Sky Bridge. 
MARISHA: All right. 
NOSHIR: Oh man. 
TRAVIS: We are traveling. 
NOSHIR: Thrown around! (laughs) 
GINA: Moves him over to the skybridge. She's like: Let's make some more trouble. And drags, or she tosses him over by his ribs and walks over to join him. 
MARISHA: Beyond just tossing him over, the skybridge is actually elevated a little bit above the courtyard on what would be more or less the second story. So as you jettison him out from your fans, Johnny, you end up crashing upwards into this top level of the sky bridge. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
GINA: She looks over at Johnny and says: You know, terrible actor, but maybe great stunt double. 
MARISHA: (laughs) He ain't got a comeback for that one! 
SAM: You ain't seen nothing yet, babe. I'm going to show you. I do my own stunts when they're safe enough to perform. (laughter) 
SAM: Nothing car related or jumping off of anything. (laughter) 
SAM: All right. Can't do much here that can help my goals here. Destroy scenery. Land a hit on your foe. I can't do any of those things, so I'm just going to rattle her. I'm going to spend the rest of my action points, and I'm going to rattle her. So I'll hang down. Where am I? I'm up on the skybridge? 
GINA: Skybridge. 
SAM: Where are you? 
GINA: I'm standing, I'm walking up right next to you on the elevated skybridge. 
SAM: Okay. I pull myself up, shake all the shit and dust off of myself, and I'm going to rattle you to a defensive stance. I'm going to do it in the most shocking way possible. I'm going to be like: Listen, if you don't know me, that's fine, but this is going to be worth something someday. I'm going to pull out one of my many-- (laughter) 
SAM: One of my many pictures. That's an autographed photo of Johnny Cage. That's going to be worth a lot one day, babe. So hang onto that. Put it up. 
GINA: To my greatest fan. Is that a joke? 
SAM: You're my greatest fan. No, that's you. It's going to be soon. It's going to be true. 
GINA: Seriously? 
SAM: Yeah, you've got fans, and now I've got fans. 
NOSHIR: (groans) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: She picks it up with two fingers, just: Ugh. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
SAM: You're now rattled to any, oh, to the defensive stance. 
GINA: It's really good. Really good. I'll give you that one. (laughs) She replies by grabbing it with two fingers, disgusted look on her face. Like, huh, must be a very, very, very, very old picture. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
GINA: It's just, ugh. Just drops it on the side there. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: That's mean. 
TRAVIS: Slides it into a protective binder (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Nobody can see it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm out of action points. It's all you. 
GINA: Same. 
SAM: Oh. 
GINA: I'm all out. 
MARISHA: You are all out of action points. All right. We are moving into-- 
ANNOUNCER: Round two. 
NOSHIR: Whoa! 
ANNOUNCER: Fight. 
SAM: So we get to replenish one-- 
MARISHA: You all automatically replenish one edge die. 
GINA: Oh, I almost reached into my water. (laughs) 
SAM: We can't change stances, right? 
MARISHA: You cannot change stances. Or no, you can change stances at the top of the round. 
SAM: Oh, then I'm going to change to bold. 
NOSHIR: So we change our stance before we choose where our edge die goes, I'm assuming? 
MARISHA: You can ready your edge die anywhere, I believe, but whatever stance that you want to choose, you can only roll edge dice from that pool. 
NOSHIR: From that pool. Got you, got you. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
NOSHIR: Thank you. 
SAM: Okay, I rolled a five. That gives me two action points, and I'm going to do all of my edge dice to add on. Five, two, one. Awesome. 
TRAVIS: Better, better, better. 
SAM: You're going down, faces. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Okay, who has the highest initiative? 
SAM: I rolled a five. 
GINA: I rolled a five. 
TRAVIS: 16. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
SAM: Oh, looks like Raiden. Yeah, because Noshir got an eight. 
NOSHIR: Yep. (blows raspberry) 
MARISHA: All right. Raiden, you are kicking us off for round two. 
TRAVIS: Round two. 
NOSHIR: d20s, right? 
TRAVIS: I am only going to spend-- 
NOSHIR: Oh! 
SAM: Still lower than me. 
NOSHIR: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm going to spend two action points, and I am going to drop into the floor and appear right next to Johnny Cage and reach up for the sunglasses. At the last minute-- 
SAM: Don't you dare! 
TRAVIS: I wouldn't. I slipped my fingers, my thumbs behind the sunglasses and into his eyes-- 
SAM: (shouts) 
TRAVIS: -- and start pumping him full of lightning. 
MARISHA: (shouts) 
TRAVIS: (lightning buzzing) Then I front kick him, boom! Sending him backwards. 
MARISHA: Not only does he lightning blast your eye holes, it reverberates through your skull. Johnny, you can feel fractures begin to crack and form in your cranium as he shatters the inside of your head. 
SAM: (laughs) (groans) 
GINA: Oh my gosh. 
SAM: (groans) This feels like the time I got a second callback for-- (laughter) 
SAM: -- for "Hurt Locker"-- (laughter) 
SAM: -- but they gave it to that asshole instead. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) "Hurt Locker." 
SAM: (groans) But I recovered then, and I can recover now. 
MARISHA: You do. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh man! (laughs) Great. I'll give the floor to Mr. Cage for rebuttal. 
SAM: All right, I'm coming for you. I'm going to attack. I'm going to land a hit on your foe and let them describe, oh, they describe the injury. So I'll say that I run up and say: I haven't gotten to fight yet. So it's time to show you bozos how we do it down in Hollywood. I'm going to run up the side of the wall, if there is one. I guess we're on a bridge. 
MARISHA: Yes, you all are both, so that would've meant you, because you were fighting Johnny Cage, you both move. 
SAM: Oh, you've moved to the bridge. 
TRAVIS: Oh yes, okay. 
MARISHA: Causing Rain to have to chase after you as well. So you all are both on this bridge with all of the rain and lightning gods in full force. You are completely exposed as a battering rain cloud-- 
SAM: Oh, great. 
MARISHA: -- is pelting you from above. 
SAM: Well, then if the bridge is slick, I'm going to run up to get closer to Raiden. I'm going to jump up and slide across the wet rail, or along the wet rail, and as I get close to him, I'm going to jump off the rail and go in for a flying punch. But as you, it's tricky. It's like a visual trick. When I'm in the air, you think for a second, is that him anymore? And no, it's not. It's like my stunt double. He's in the air. 
GINA: Wow! 
SAM: Just for when I'm in the air, and then I connect, and then it's me again. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm like (breathes heavy). 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Amazing. 
TRAVIS: It's an incredible trick. I'm overtaken by the stunt double person imposing, and then because of the recent damage to your eyes, your targeting is also a little low, so you react to your favorite target, which is, again, my groin. Your fist slams into my crotch. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: As you hear the impact, the sky thunders. 
GINA: (laughs) 
SAM: I didn't realize how tall you were. 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched groans) (groans) That was awesome. (laughter) 
GINA: Oh. Oh dear. (laughter) 
SAM: I'll kick it to Kitana next. 
GINA: Okay. Kitana turns around and sees that you two have joined us on the bridge, and she looks over at Rain and says: Neat little trick you had there. I just want to let you know, though, you're really not her type, and I'm not looking for a new daddy. That's three hit points to rattle your foe into a reckless stance. 
NOSHIR: Dang. 
GINA: One, two, three. There you go. 
SAM: I've completed two of my objectives. 
NOSHIR: Dang. 
GINA: Same. 
SAM: Oh! You're going down. 
MARISHA: At this point, in order to make sure she has a front row seat to all the action, you all catch out, of the periphery of your vision, Sindel still appears to be seated as she was on the throne, but she is levitating as she holds her coupe and watches on the edge of the bridge. 
GINA: With that, she looks over at Rain and just: Weak. And looks off. 
NOSHIR: Hmm. 
MARISHA: All right. Tossing it to Rain. 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
SAM: Come on, Rain! 
NOSHIR: Dun, dun, dun! 
SAM: Finish him! 
NOSHIR: Let's see what we can do here. Okay. I smirk, draw the water onto the sky bridge, and using that water like a wave, I ride it into a shoulder check into Kitana and knock her straight into the living quarters. 
MARISHA: Oh, amazing. Kitana, you go flying once again. You get blasted through a wall. You're not even entirely sure how far you have just been flung as you smash into a very lush living room, like a lounge. There's nice throw pillows and floor pillows of jewel tones and amazing beading and curtains that make this really a lovely oasis under literally any other conditions. 
GINA: Kitana flies through the wall. (grunts) Lands onto a bunch of very tacky, gaudy throw pillows. Gets up and dust herself off and says: I've always hated this room. Nobody needs that many pillows. 
NOSHIR: Don't worry. Once I move in, daddy's going to redecorate. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MARISHA: (laughs) Ooh! This is so personal. (laughter) 
GINA: All right. 
MARISHA: That finishes your turn. Yes, Rain? 
NOSHIR: Yes. 
MARISHA: Who are you tossing it over to? Then, Rain, that would be you following Kitana, I believe, into the living quarters. 
NOSHIR: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Who would you like to have on Team Face go next? 
NOSHIR: My less competent older version, my predecessor. 
TRAVIS: That's fine. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. That's okay. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I will, Johnny and I are still out in the skybridge. 
SAM: Just you and me. 
TRAVIS: I will spend one action point to draw a drama. Compliment your foe. (laughter) 
MARISHA: No! 
TRAVIS: For someone who does their own stunts, you look surprisingly handsome? Ugh. No, wait. For someone who does their own stunts, you're ugly. Ugh, no. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I hate you! (laughter) 
SAM: I'll take that as a compliment. (laughter) 
SAM: You know, they say no press is bad press. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I was waiting for it. I knew you were going to say that. 
SAM: I'll take it. 
TRAVIS: I can change my stance to any protective stance by spending an additional action point. 
SAM: You're going into the protective stance? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: I knew it. Can't hang. 
TRAVIS: I'll send it back to Mr. Cage. 
SAM: Mr. Cage, all right. Mr. Cage, enjoying the compliment, wants to make sure that his hair is intact. So he's going to reach out and smash the glass of the skybridge. I'm assuming there's glass. 
TRAVIS: Sure. 
SAM: With my bare hand. Be like: Ah, god, that hurt. I'm going to take a piece of glass and admire myself in the mirror for a second and fix my hair that's destroying scenery I mark off a thing. 
MARISHA: Oh, fantastic. Okay. 
SAM: Then I'm going to hold out the shard of glass as a weapon on my next attack. I'm going to kick it to you, Kitana. You're up. 
GINA: All right. So Kitana gets up and she's dusting herself off with her fans, making sure to slice any pillows on the way, just in case, oops. 
MARISHA: Just fluff and down feathers start to around you. 
GINA: I'm using two action points to, or you and your foe each draw one drama card. Here we go. 
SAM: Who's your foe? 
GINA: It's going to be Rain. Let's see. I'm going to pick one. 
SAM: This is a drama card. 
NOSHIR: Grazie. 
GINA: Oh. Ugh. Compliment your foe sincerely. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? 
SAM: These are the hardest ones. 
GINA: These are so hard. Ugh, just the words, you can tell it's like poison dripping out of her mouth. She hates every second of this and goes: At least you have the color scheme down correct, ugh. Hides away behind her fans. 
TRAVIS: The purple loyalty in this family. It's unbelievable. 
MARISHA: There's so much purple loyalty. 
SAM: What's your drama card? 
NOSHIR: Tell your foe about something terrible that could happen if they die today. 
SAM: Oh. 
GINA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Brutal. 
NOSHIR: Shao Kahn's unfortunate end leaves a power vacuum in this house. If I move in and you aren't here to protect her, Mileena will fall to my influence. Then what do you think happens to this realm? 
GINA: She wasn't always the brightest. Fine. Then I shall fight my hardest. And looks at you and raises her fans. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
NOSHIR and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Heel team is really leaning into it, man. This is brutal. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: How are we doing on action points? 
GINA: I have one left. 
TRAVIS: Three more left. 
MARISHA: Three left. 
SAM: Three over here. 
NOSHIR: Four. 
MARISHA: Okay. So we are still going, we are still thick in this round. 
SAM: Thick! 
MARISHA: Thick! 
SAM: That was Mileena's turn? 
NOSHIR: That's Kitana's turn. 
GINA: Yes, that was Kitana's turn. 
SAM: Kitana, sorry. 
GINA: Yeah, yeah. Then I will-- Kitana looks over out the window. The fight on the sky bridge catches her eye and she kicks it over to Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Johnny Cage says: I want to be where the people are. (laughter) 
SAM: So I'm going to use the action of the lair, the lair action. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to spend two action points to move the duel to an adjacent area and change your stance to quick, if you wish. Sure, I wish. Do I wish? Let me see. What can quick give me? (mumbling description) Sure. I'll change my stance. 
TRAVIS: (bass drop) 
SAM: I'll grab Raiden. 
TRAVIS: Wha? 
SAM: (laughs) Let's-- 
TRAVIS: (goofily) Wha? (laughter) 
SAM: I can't be in this much rain. It's going to ruin my outfit. 
TRAVIS: Your makeup's starting to go. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
SAM: That's just a foundation. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
SAM: I don't need it. 
TRAVIS: They should really set it better. 
SAM: I had a photo shoot earlier today, all right? 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: So I'm going to grab him and slide him on the slick floor over the skybridge into the living quarters. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: I'll strut my way over there, kicking through the door. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
SAM: Looking awesome as I go. 
MARISHA: Awesome. You join your partners. 
SAM: Raiden, it's your turn. Go! 
TRAVIS: Amazing. When you throw me, I glide on my heels in the back and then I start break dancing in the water. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I reach my place and I'll use three action points to rattle Johnny Cage with my smooth moves into a defensive stance. Go ahead, brother! I start popping and locking in the water. Come and face me if you dare! I'll throw it to Rain for the next turn. 
SAM: Oh my god, I've never seen-- 
MARISHA: ♪ You can stand ♪ ♪ Under my umbrella ♪ 
SAM: -- an old man move like that! 
MARISHA: ♪ Ella, ella ♪ 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: ♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ 
SAM: I'm rattled. 
MARISHA: I'm rat-- (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Super rattled! 
SAM: I'm rattled. I drop to one knee. I'm just mesmerized by the dance. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Have you ever done any acting? Any performing? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: You're a natural. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I never thought about it. Could you introduce me to somebody? 
SAM: No! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: You son of a bitch! (laughter) 
MARISHA: That was your turn? 
SAM: That was my turn. 
MARISHA: Yes. Yes. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. My turn was to rattle and I threw it to Rain. 
MARISHA: Oh, you rattled, and throwing it back to Rain. All right. 
NOSHIR: Okay. Ah... 
SAM: Shit. I can't complete my objectives now because you rattled me! 
NOSHIR and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Oh! It's a tactic! 
TRAVIS: I was wondering. 
MARISHA: That's great! 
MARISHA: I was wondering! 
SAM: Shit. 
MARISHA: Johnny, to add insult to injury, because you were coated in rain and you just got flung into this living quarters where there was a bunch of down feathers and fluff, you now have all these goose feathers that are starting to stick to your skin. 
NOSHIR: All right. 
TRAVIS: I'm out of action points, too. 
MARISHA: What you got? You're out as well? All right. What you got, Rain? 
NOSHIR: So-- I tire of teenage angst. It's about time that you and I had a face off. As Raiden gets up from his break dancing B-Boy moves, I come in with a flying lariat and slam right into his throat and knock both of us back into the skybridge. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MARISHA: Ooh! Raiden, you can feel your jaw crack as three molars explode from the side of your face and that punch launches you back onto the skybridge. 
SAM: Oh shit! 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
MARISHA: You land hard on a pile of glass that was left behind by Johnny Cage, furthering your injuries. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MARISHA: Okay. Then who do you-- 
NOSHIR: Who has action points for you guys? 
GINA: I have one left. 
SAM: They both do. 
NOSHIR: They do? Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm out. 
NOSHIR: Kitana, take it away. 
MARISHA: Oh, you're out? All right, back to Kitana. 
TRAVIS: I'm out. I'm out. 
GINA: Okay. I have one action point left, so I'm going to expend it to destroy scenery. Kitana gets up and she says: I am sick of this place. You know what? Let's make this more fun. Oh, Mother! 
MARISHA: "Yes, darling?" 
GINA: Isn't that your favorite painting of you, where I looked so fat and you hung it up anyways? 
MARISHA: "(gasps)" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
GINA: Then she runs over. Or no, she stands back and she starts throwing her fans and it's spinning in a Frisbee and it keeps on, it spins, it comes back. Just-- (slicing) Just shredding the painting apart. I told you not to-- Or, I told you to delete that! It's just flying and the painting's getting shredded. 
MARISHA: "Remember darling, mothers are just a sign of where you are headed!" 
TRAVIS: Oh jeez! 
SAM: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: The darkest timeline. 
GINA: (scoffs) (laughter) 
GINA: Spending my last point. 
SAM: I was going to use my last action point to ready an edge dice. So that's it. 
MARISHA: Ready an edge dice. 
SAM: Super easy. What you got, Noshir? 
MARISHA: All right. 
NOSHIR: All right, I got two points left. 
MARISHA: Oh, you got two points? All right, Rain is going to close us out. 
NOSHIR: So we landed on the skybridge. Only one of us can carry this pantheon. I jump and double foot land on his chest. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
NOSHIR: Kick him and use that aerial launch to basically pull lightning onto the skybridge and electrocute the whole circuit while I'm in the air. 
TRAVIS: (electricity charging) 
MARISHA: Oh! Raiden, you feel your sternum collapse under the weight of his knee and it is pushing you into this electrical circuit that vibrates around you. However, you are god of thunder yourself, so it doesn't kill you. But man, it sucks. 
TRAVIS: (vibrating electrocution groan) That's pretty good. (electrocution continues) (laughter) 
MARISHA: What little glass was left from Johnny Cage, the rest of it is shattered, as glass is flying through the air past all of your all's vision. The skybridge is almost entirely destroyed. 
TRAVIS: Damn. Anybody else have action points? 
SAM: No, that's it. 
GINA: Mm-mm. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's it. All right. Then we move into round three. 
SAM: (like announcer) Round three! 
NOSHIR: ♪ Bum bum bum ♪ 
NOSHIR: (like announcer) Fight! 
MARISHA: Everyone refresh an edge die and roll for action points-- 
TRAVIS: (frustrated exclamation) 
MARISHA: -- and choose your stance. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
GINA: Come on, baby! All right, okay. All right. 
SAM: We're in round three, yeah? 
MARISHA: Correct. 
SAM: All right, I got a seven. 
TRAVIS: That is unfortunate. 
SAM: That's two points. I'm going to-- 
GINA: Are you kidding me? 
SAM: -- a quick stance. 
GINA: Christ. 
TRAVIS: Helps. Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Okay. Fuck. I'm going to spend all of them. 
NOSHIR: Yep. (laughs) 
SAM: Oh wow. Great rolls. 
TRAVIS: You-- 
GINA: I'm all out. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Six, five, and five. 
TRAVIS: We're going to have a conversation. We're going to have a conversation. 
GINA: I want a new d20. 
MARISHA: How are you looking on objectives? Ooh, you look really close. 
SAM: I'm almost done with my third objective. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
GINA: Same. 
SAM: I rolled a seven. 
MARISHA: Okay. All right, we're getting close here. Seven? Who rolled the highest? 
TRAVIS: Eight. 
NOSHIR: 12. 
GINA: Seven. 
MARISHA: Eight and 12? All right Rain, you are kicking us off. 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
SAM: ♪ It's like rain ♪ (laughter) ♪ On your wedding day ♪ (laughter) 
NOSHIR: So it's Raiden and I on the skybridge. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
NOSHIR: What's left of the skybridge. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
SAM: Rain, if I may. 
GINA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: When you do this next move, whatever it is, just cheat out a little bit. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy! 
GINA: Oh god! 
SAM: I think the cameras are over there. I can't be sure. The cameras are out there, so cheat out a little bit when you do it. 
NOSHIR: The mask doesn't help, but this is my good side. 
SAM: Oh. I can tell. (laughter) 
SAM: You don't have to tell me. 
TRAVIS: Find your light, ladies. 
NOSHIR: I don't think that was nice. I'm going to-- I'm so tired of this stupid skybridge. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: I channel the water that's already on the bridge and I surge the water that's on the ground from all this rain and I meld it to the bridge and I basically try to tear the bridge off the moorings, Raiden, me, everyone, and bring it crashing to the ground. 
MARISHA: This bridge is already so weak and structurally destroyed that as the lightning bolts hit the remaining corners, the entire bridge shakes, and as still one solid piece that you are standing on the whole bridge plummets out from under you. The two of you going with it. It lands with a heavy impact right next to the courtyard below. So still on the bridge-ish, but it is demolished. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
NOSHIR: Give me your best, old god. 
TRAVIS: My turn? 
SAM: Yo. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! Well, (laughs) Raiden's going to stand after having had a bridge dropped on his ass. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: He's going to stand up and say: Yeah, it's been a millennia since I broke a bridge. I'm going to spend one action point to destroy scenery. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm going to kick a planter. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You're going to wish you hadn't done that. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Throw it to Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Johnny Cage. I'm in the living quarters with Kitana, right? 
TRAVIS: You're back on top, I think so. 
MARISHA: I will say with that, you guys, because it is just so destroyed, you guys are now going to, you basically fell back into the courtyard-- 
TRAVIS: Here I come! 
MARISHA: -- which is where the two of you are. As Rain, you narrowly avoid a flying terracotta pot directly towards the side of your head. 
SAM: I'm in the living quarters with Kitana, yeah? 
MARISHA: Yes, you are. 
SAM: Can you-- Where are we? Are we in a bedroom? A living room? What is a living quarters? 
MARISHA: It's like a living room, lounge, so there's a lot of really chic throw pillows, floor pillows. 
GINA: "Chic." 
MARISHA: Elaborate curtains. It's got some almost Moroccan style lanterns hanging from the ceilings. 
SAM: Gotcha. 
GINA: She goes to Morocco once and this is how our house looks. 
TRAVIS: Three times in one round? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: Ugh. You're from Atlanta, okay! 
MARISHA: That one person who goes to Barcelona. 
GINA: Yeah! (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: I'm going to just take a second and be like: Wow, it's really classy in here. (laughter) 
SAM: I like it. It's like really fancy. Do you mind if I snap some pics for my house? 
GINA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Oh jeez! 
MARISHA: Oh god! 
SAM: Nice. It's like World Market stuff. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughter) 
SAM: It's good. 
MARISHA: White woman who thinks she's cultured. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I visited Greece in a tin painting. 
SAM: Anyway, I'll just turn to Kitana and be like: We're alone, babe. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: I'm going to spend-- I can do a flex action to destroy scenery. There's lots of scenery destroying in this game. I'm going to-- I'm going to run up to the velvet curtains and rip them down and rip off my shirt and wrap myself in the velvet curtains like a robe. I'm going to lie down on the lounge chair and beckon you forward. Come on, baby. Let's see what you got. I'll throw it to you, Kitana. 
MARISHA: That's so Carol Burnett of you. 
GINA: Kitana, upon seeing this goes pale and just-- (retches) (laughter) 
GINA: I would like to spend two action points to compel your foe to draw-- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. "You and your foe each draw one drama card." 
SAM: Drawing the drama. 
GINA: (chuckling) I got, "Question your foe's moral character." 
SAM: Go for it. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
GINA: Oh god. Okay. Question the moral character. She looks at Johnny and says: You know, you don't seem too bad. I bet sometimes you sit at home by yourself and you wonder to yourself, "Is this what I really want people to think of me as? Are my movies that great? Why do I act this way? When's the last time I talked to my therapist? Do I do acting because--" 
SAM: Stop. 
GINA: "-- I just want to pretend--" 
SAM: Just stop. 
GINA: "-- to be someone else and not my myself for once?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Stop it! (laughter) 
SAM: You're really killing the vibe in here. (laughter) 
MARISHA: "Why do I act this way?" (laughter) 
SAM: Stop, okay? I'm supposed to express disappointment in your choices. 
GINA: Oh, okay! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: So I will say back to you: Listen, I don't need this brutal honesty from you. I pay people to shield me from that kind of stuff. (laughter) 
SAM: Just less talking, more more fighting, okay? (laughter) 
SAM: Man, you're really bumming me out. Here, I'm going to go on IMDb and see what my star meter says. (laughter) 
SAM: Okay, I'm still in top 5,000. I'm okay. I'm okay! You're okay, Johnny Cage. You're okay. 
GINA: Okay, so I still, I have four action points and I've completed all three. So what does that mean I can do? 
SAM: Nothing this round. 
GINA: Oh no, it's third round! 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Third round. 
SAM: I've also completed three objectives. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. 
GINA: Oh, that's right! 
SAM: But we got to wait 'til the fourth round. 
TRAVIS: You need four action points, right? 
SAM: Yeah. 
GINA: She-- With a terracotta-- Or when she's done doing that, a terracotta pot flies past her, crashing into the wall-- 
TRAVIS: I'm still kicking shit. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm kicking planters. 
GINA: She looks at it and goes: What the hell was that? Then looks out to the skybridge, kicking it over to Rain. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
NOSHIR: All right. 
TRAVIS: I'm so behind on these objectives. 
MARISHA: I know. Man, next round is going to be a race for-- 
SAM: We're power gamers. Anyways, it just depends on who rolls better, right? 
MARISHA: Pretty much. Yeah. 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: I'm way behind. (laughs) 
GINA: I've been rolling terribly. 
SAM: What's the stakes? The stakes are just to defeat? 
NOSHIR: Oh, right. 
MARISHA: Currently, the stakes have not been risen in any way. 
SAM: Raised. 
MARISHA: So yeah, it's just to defeat at this moment. 
GINA: How does one raise the stakes? 
SAM: How does one raise stakes? 
NOSHIR: Is that a drama? 
MARISHA: I believe there are drama cards that indicate that. 
GINA: Oh, got it. Okay. 
SAM: Wait, who's going? 
TRAVIS: Rain. 
NOSHIR: I think it's my turn, and it's me and Raiden in the courtyard. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
NOSHIR: We're more similar than I care to admit, but the one thing I hate about you is your prattling on and on about the forces of good and these mortals. It's about time you stopped talking. I start to take the water in his lungs and fill it. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: (gargled grunts) 
MARISHA: Like a terrible case of pneumonia, you start to feel your body drowning on its own bodily fluids. 
TRAVIS: (gargled breathing) 
SAM: Gross. 
TRAVIS: In an effort to get away from my aqua lung, I'll spend two action points to change my stance to quick. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: And achieve an objective, even though I'm woefully behind! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'll pop up behind Raiden. I'm like: (burbling) (garbled) Good people are the way forward in this world! I won't hear it any other way! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: One more time. One more time, Raiden. 
TRAVIS: (garbled speech) 
NOSHIR: Enunciate, my friend! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: All right. I'll throw it to (deeply) Luke Cage. 
SAM: Luke Cage, Luke Cage, Luke Cage? No-- 
SAM and TRAVIS: Johnny Cage! (laughter) 
SAM: Johnny Cage is going to step gracefully, moving the duel to an adjacent area. Come with me, lady. Let's go outside. I'm going to take her hand, and I'm going to jump out the window all the way to the courtyard, but as soon as we hit the air-- 
TRAVIS: That's a long jump. 
SAM: I know it's a long jump, but I've got special effects to help me. 
NOSHIR, GINA, TRAVIS: Aah! 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
NOSHIR: Airbag! 
MARISHA: I'll allow it. 
SAM: As soon as we get outside, you realize wires are suddenly attached to you. 
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch! 
SAM: We gracefully, slow motion. 
TRAVIS: (slow motion buzz) 
SAM: They'll speed this up in post. It'll look amazing. It's very slow, and we land, and I'll be like: Do a three-point landing when we hit the ground. Trust me, it'll be awesome. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: I land, three-point landing. 
MARISHA: With the skybridge being destroyed, and you describing it in an amazing way, you do float all the way from the skybridge back to the courtyard, and then for no reason, a massive explosion pops off from the living room quarters. 
SAM: Don't look back! Don't even register it! 
NOSHIR: Don't flinch. 
SAM: It just happens behind us. 
TRAVIS: Not the pillows! 
GINA: As we're flying through the air, Kitana looks over at a PA and says: Who the fuck is that? (laughter) 
SAM: Get out of her eye line. Damn it, these guys. 
NOSHIR: They're in the shot! 
MARISHA: You see a guy in all black and a baseball cap who's holding a boom mic, and he's like-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: He's been there the whole time, and you don't know why. 
SAM: It's these non-union guys! Sindel doesn't hire union guys! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh my god, those busters. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Also, in addition to any type of drama cards that can and do raise the stakes, you all can elect to raise the stakes on your own whenever you wish. 
SAM: Do we spend any action points to do so? 
MARISHA: I believe it just happens. 
SAM: We just do it. Okay. 
GINA: What does "to exile" mean again? 
SAM: They're banished. 
MARISHA: You're banished! 
GINA: Oh, banished. I see, I see. 
SAM: At least, that would be very hard to do during this game, though. (laughter) 
MARISHA: We can justify anything. 
SAM: Sure. 
GINA: Okay, so Kitana lands with Johnny Cage. I would like to spend two hit points or two action points to land a hit on your foe, and they describe the injury. She lands with Johnny Cage, rips her hand out of his hand and goes: Don't touch me with your filthy hands. Then she reaches into somewhere behind her and holds up-- 
MARISHA: Your video game pocket. 
NOSHIR: Magic pocket. 
GINA: Yeah, my video game pocket. My Bag of Holding. Holds up his headshot and goes: You call this a headshot? It's an inch away from his face, and as he's focusing on it, her fan goes right through it-- 
SAM: (shouts) Oh! 
GINA: -- right through his mouth in the photo and into his mouth, with the blade sticking out behind his head. (oohing) 
GINA: Blood is spurting out, and then she yanks it out with a hole in the picture now and says: You should probably update this. You're lying to the people. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: (groans) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: That hurt! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Do you have any other descriptors you want to add to that? 
SAM: I mean, I'm clearly bleeding from lots of places, but I take out, from my video game pocket, I take out a bandage and some makeup, and I tidy up-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah! 
SAM: -- so that no one can see it, and I get one of those cold things that actors put under their eyes for the swelling. 
GINA: Eye patches! 
SAM: I put those on there to cool it down. This is going to swell a lot! 
TRAVIS: There's inflammation, baby. 
MARISHA: Fantastic. 
GINA: Then she flicks the blood off of her fan, fixes her hair, and she looks over to Rain. 
NOSHIR: I have zero action points. 
SAM: Then you are done. It's up to I guess me, because I have action points. 
GINA: You have action points? 
MARISHA: All right. Raiden, do you have any left? 
TRAVIS: I do. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: I'm so close to my goals. I'm going to burn through my action points here. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: And use them all to change to a bold stance, and look at the two of you remaining and be like: Bring it on, guys. I think I've got something really special for you cooked up in the next round. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'll take inspiration from that invitation, and from Rain's previous attack, and I'll walk over to my smited planter that I kicked earlier and I'll step on it and crush the porcelain pieces into little bits and I'll pick it up and go: Here's some daggers in return! You'll see a burst of air, and all the planter shards go-- 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: -- they shoot out towards you. You get to describe the injury. 
NOSHIR: Terracotta shards go flying through the air, punching through my robe. I try to defend them by putting my wand between myself and Raiden, and it's not working. They go through my arm, through my body, out the other side, and I fall to my knees as blood starts pouring from these small holes that are slowly widening and turning into a sea of red. 
MARISHA: Since you're already soaked from the rain, it starts to bleed and wick through your robe even more as it almost looks like you got hit by a shotgun blast propelled by thunder. 
TRAVIS: That expends my action points. 
MARISHA: All right. 
GINA: I have three left. 
MARISHA: Ooh, back to Kitana. 
TRAVIS: You're the only one, yeah. 
GINA: I would like to expend all my action points, my remaining three, to destroy scenery. At this point, Kitana knows what Johnny Cage's powers and weakness is, and realizes without his cast and crew, he's nothing, and she throws both fans, and they are spinning blades, and decapitates the whole entire crew as it's flying, and then-- (screaming) 
TRAVIS: Unnecessary! 
GINA: Especially his agent, and it comes back to her hand, and she says: So much for that martini shot. We're done here. 
TRAVIS: Even the OSHA guy. 
SAM: You killed my agent? Joke's on you. You just saved me 10%. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! (laughter) 
MARISHA: As we hear the thud of a bunch of poor teamsters that didn't want to be there-- Shout out to all of our friends in IATSE! 
GINA: Sorry! 
MARISHA: We love you! We are now moving into-- 
ANNOUNCER: Final round. Fight! 
SAM: Final round! Okay, it's all up to this dice roll. 
MARISHA: It's all up to the dice roll. 
SAM: We get to replenish one dice. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: Oh, and you can replace-- 
TRAVIS: What? Augh! 
SAM: You can replace-- 
TRAVIS: This is so bad! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: Oh god, oh please. 
TRAVIS: I've only rolled above a 10 once! These pumpkin dice are killing me! 
GINA: Thank god! 
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry) 
MARISHA: You can reset your stance, if you'd like. 
SAM: This is it. It all comes down to this die roll. 
TRAVIS: Can I just choose to be rattled? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Rattled from shit dice roll. 
TRAVIS: Instantly. 
MARISHA: Who rolled the highest? 
SAM: I got an 11. 
TRAVIS: Four. 
NOSHIR: 18. 
GINA: Argh! 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
GINA: 15. 
MARISHA: Ooh, all right! Team Heel is going to be kicking us off with Rain. Remember, as part of this as well, you can, you've all already readied your dice, but you can also elect to hand your readied dice to your teammate if you like, as well. 
SAM: How do we do this? Because he got higher than me. 
MARISHA: He did. 
SAM: But I'm the one who can finish. Oh, wait! 
NOSHIR: I can also-- 
SAM: You can finish this, too! Amazing! 
TRAVIS: Damn, for a teammate, I've been sleeping on you! 
NOSHIR: We need four action points. 
MARISHA: You need four action points to elect. 
NOSHIR: Oh yeah. 
SAM: Okay. Do it, man. 
MARISHA: All right. 
NOSHIR: They call this spectator sport for a reason. I reach out and I pull the water through the blood of every single onlooker in the crowd. It turns into an audience of raisins, and I take that blood, I turn it into a massive swimming pool sized volume, and then I drop it on top of them, and there's nowhere for them to go, and then I crush that blood so that that water takes on density, and they're starting to crush smaller and smaller as that weight gets heavier and heavier. 
MARISHA: You hear the audible screams of the audience in a cacophonous roar as they slowly start to drop dead one by one. Sindel smirks, very pleased with your action. You all feel this density of intense pressure, like you're under 3,000 feet of water as every bone and organ in your body begins to crack until essentially, the pressure becomes too much, and you are more or less vaporized. 
TRAVIS: No wait, not that (high pitched babbles) (explosion) 
ANNOUNCER: Fatality! (oohing) 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs) 
SAM: Nicely done, Rain. Maybe we should do a buddy cop movie. 
TRAVIS: Wrapped hands for the win. (laughter) 
SAM: Rain and Cage, Cage and Rain. Caged Rain! Cajun Rain. 
TRAVIS: Cajun Rain. Takes place in Shreveport. 
SAM: Ooh, do you do any accents? 
NOSHIR: I'll learn, I'll learn. 
SAM: Yeah. (southern accent) I do declare. 
TRAVIS: On the bayou. 
SAM: On the bayou. 
MARISHA: You hear the sound of stiletto heels clacking on porcelain, on tile, as Sindel walks into her beloved courtyard, completely marred and destroyed by this battle. (claps) "That was quite entertaining, gentlemen." She looks over at the smeared bloodstains of the thunder god and her daughter. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: She takes a deep breath in. Her nostrils flare as you see her sallowed face fill as the souls once again lift and emanate from the blood puddle and pour into her glass. "(sighs) I feel so refreshed. Well, you know, the part and the point of these tournaments is really to have one man standing. The two of you are up next in a 1v1 battle. Shake hands now, boys." 
SAM: I'm sorry I'm going to have to end your "reign." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh...boy. 
NOSHIR: I guess you'll die onscreen for the first time. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
SAM: I'll probably get an Oscar for it. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: Damn it! 
MARISHA: "Now, because I am such a generous hostess, I will allow you a summon, a Kameo." 
SAM: Cameo? Do I get money to record messages for people? 
MARISHA: "It's an under five." (laughter) 
MARISHA: "Fortunately, not up for a voucher. But you will each be able to choose whom tag teams in from your fellow comrades." 
SAM: You mean the dead ones? 
MARISHA: "The dead ones." 
GINA: From Sindel's cup, you hear me go: Bloop. 
MARISHA: Yes. She swirls it. Gives it a little sniff. 
GINA: Bloop, bloop, bloop. 
SAM: I guess you're probably going to want the thunder rain guy, because you're the thunder rain guy, too. I don't know, is that how that works? Or you want something different? 
NOSHIR: I think the idea of mother fighting on my side, or rather daughter fighting on my side, is rather poetic. 
SAM: All right, I'll take Raiden. That makes sense. I don't like to work with anyone who's better looking than me. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
GINA: You hear another bloop, and she's saying: Oh, thank god. (laughter) 
MARISHA: "The choice has been made. Follow me." She turns heel and begins to walk out of the courtyard to what will be your next battleground, which we will pick up on after this break.

Break[]
It has begun. [sword unsheathes] [kiss] [shrieks] ♪♪♪ Inferior clans will fall to the Lin Kuei. ♪♪♪ There will be spoils in this war. ♪♪♪ We must keep your secret. I’ve found my destiny. 
MARISHA: Thanks again to WB Games for sponsoring this episode. Now let's get back to Mortal Kombat! 

Part II[]
MARISHA: Welcome back. The Kombat Kontinues. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: Both spelled with Ks. 
TRAVIS: Kombat with a K. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yes, Kombat and Kontinue with a K. 
GINA: Don't add a third K. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: Don't do it. 
TRAVIS: Don't. Only two Ks. 
MARISHA: No. Only two Ks. This is a two-K zone. (laughter) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Camp Crystal Lake. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You continue to hear the clacking of heels against tile floor as Sindel leads the gentlemen into her hanging garden. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: "You know, I would often come here to contemplate my existence. Why? I was resurrected so many times, and I could never escape the crushing feeling that something was lingering in the back of my brain. Something that I couldn't control, something that wasn't quite mine, almost as if my soul belonged to someone else. Even in the happiest moments with Shao Kahn, it was a farce, an illusion, because deep down inside, I knew I was correct. My soul never belonged to me. It was always tightly wrapped around his finger. But now I know, by that logic, souls are simply commodities, useful to more than just the single person they're assigned to. Shang Tsung knew this, and it's always smart to learn from your enemies. Let me demonstrate." She summons her glass that has the swirling souls of Kitana and Raiden. With a flick of her finger, you see them rise and dart, like shooting stars, before (gasp of breath) the two of you have apparated again. 
GINA and TRAVIS: (heavy breathing) 
TRAVIS: Oh, the white hair is back. Yeah, baby. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: You smell like sherry. Ugh. 
TRAVIS: (shudders) 
GINA: What happened? 
MARISHA: It's hard to tell, and it's really only visible to the two of you. Ever so slightly if you squint, this faint line, this thread that seems to connect you to the summons that you chose. "Their souls are yours, at least for this battle." 
SAM: A soul tethered to me, unable to make its own decisions? (scoffs) 
MARISHA: Sounds problematic. 
SAM: Sounds familiar. (laughter) 
SAM: I made that deal when I signed on to do "Planet of the Cage." 
GINA: Oh my god. (laughs) 
SAM: My agent said it was going to be a big hit. I was going to make 30 grand on it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: But they wanted me to do all this press and all the sequels and I was tied into that contract for years. I know exactly what you feel right now, buddy. 
TRAVIS: I don't think you do. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
GINA: I look over at Rain, noticing that we are tethered together. A moment of hesitation, and then she looks over at Johnny. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
GINA: Back to Rain, and she goes: (fans unfurl) And so we fight. And readies herself. 
MARISHA: "And so we do. This garden, gifted to me by Shao Kahn." 
SAM: It's nice. You thought about putting in an infinity pool? 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: "I think--" 
SAM: I could give you my pool guy's number. 
MARISHA: "What a lovely idea. Seems it will need some demolition." 
SAM: Hmm. 
ANNOUNCER: Round one. 
SAM: Whoa! 
ANNOUNCER: Fight! 
MARISHA: "Fight!" 
GINA: (gasps) Roll your action points! 
TRAVIS: Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
SAM: Let's go, Raiden. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
SAM: Lucky 13. 
NOSHIR: Oh! Nine. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
SAM: Okay, I get three points for that. 
NOSHIR: I don't like where this is going. 
SAM: I'm going to take the quick stance, and I'm going to roll two edge dice already. Six and a one. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
SAM: Boop, boop, boop. 
GINA: Oh wow. 
SAM: I got six action points ready to go. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
MARISHA: Damn, that is a good roll. 
GINA: Ooh, okay. That's not bad. 
NOSHIR: All right. 
GINA: It's not bad. 
SAM: And we have new objectives. 
NOSHIR: One, two, and-- 
MARISHA: You have new objectives. 
NOSHIR: -- one. 
MARISHA: As an action, you can spend one action point to summon your Kameo. 
SAM: All right, Rain. 
MARISHA: You can also-- 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MARISHA: Before we get started-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: Sorry. Just as a reminder, it is not necessary, but you are also allowed to take one of your edge die and gift it to your Kameo-- 
GINA: Can I see your objectives? 
MARISHA: -- if you wish to soup them up a little bit more. 
GINA: Thank you. 
MARISHA: But as always, that would have to be done at the top of the round, so. 
TRAVIS: Do you want to do a dance, maybe sing a song for your Kameo? 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Recite some poetry? 
SAM: Happy birthday. 
MARISHA: (laughs) All right. New objectives. Sindel lounges in a lounge chair underneath some hydrangeas. "Entertain me, mortals!" 
SAM: That's what I was born to do, babe. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
SAM: I think I will summon my Kameo right away. Rain, you're going to fail, you're going to lose. I'm going to beat you like Jake Gyllenhaal beat me for that role in "End of Watch." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: What? Why? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: It was this close! 
TRAVIS: Specific! That is so specific! 
SAM: It was this close. 
TRAVIS: Oh man. 
SAM: The producers liked me a lot, but-- 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
NOSHIR: It really wasn't. 
SAM: They wanted a bigger name. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. They went a different way. 
SAM: Anyway. I'll spend one action point and summon my Kameo. Kameo! Raiden, come to me-- 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: -- and do what you do. I'm going to give you a die-- 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
SAM: -- to roll to get yourself some action points. It would really help me if you, if you use area effects or-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laugh) 
SAM: -- or if you rattled my foe. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: Yep, those are some of my objectives. Or you can move us to an adjacent area. Those are always nice. 
TRAVIS: All right. 
SAM: Or you can just punch him. That's fine, too. 
TRAVIS: Good, good, good. Okay, okay, okay. Oh, that's three action points. Not bad, not bad. I'll send this back, but I don't know if you can get it back, but I'll do it anyway. 
MARISHA: No. Not until the top. 
TRAVIS: Fine, cool. I'm going to bamf in and go: It wasn't your acting. They were worried about your extracurricular activities. (laughter) 
SAM: Oh no! Those tweets? 
TRAVIS: All your tweets, your social media. 
SAM: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: They get you in trouble every time. (laughter) 
SAM: I thought they were deleted! 
TRAVIS: Just delete the app. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Delete the app! You fool! I will turn to Rain and I will harry a foe. "The foe must spend action points or be rattled." 
NOSHIR: Oh. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
SAM: But how many action points? 
TRAVIS: Two. 
SAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
NOSHIR: Oh man! 
SAM: Or else be rattled. 
MARISHA: Also, just so the audience knows, we are now moved into custom, homebrew territory here for the specifics of this Mortal Kombat 1 show. 
SAM: Of the Till the Last Gasp system? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
SAM: He's going to take it and be rattled. 
NOSHIR: Yes. 
SAM: That helps me. 
NOSHIR: Rain stumbles back. (groans) (panting) So be it. Kitana, we have a shared goal. You either join me or I break you and make you join my cause. 
SAM: Damn! 
NOSHIR: I-- 
SAM: That's much more Mortal Kombat. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: Oh, can I do that? So can I still summon a Kameo even if I'm rattled? 
MARISHA: Yes. You can summon a Kameo in the defensive, wary, bold, or reckless stances. 
NOSHIR: Cool. 
MARISHA: So you can summon the Kameo pretty much whenever. 
NOSHIR: Okay. I whirl my staff, jump into the air to drop it down on Cage and then my body becomes water and Kitana comes flying through. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: That's sick. 
SAM: Nice. 
MARISHA: Awesome. 
GINA: Cool. Oh, so I'm already summoned? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah, with the flash. (apparating from water) 
GINA: Okay. 
MARISHA: You're rocketing towards Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Do you have to roll action points? 
GINA: I think I-- Yeah, okay. So-- 
NOSHIR: Can I still give her an edge die? 
SAM: You can. 
MARISHA: You can. Just at the top, yeah. 
NOSHIR: Wha-pow! 
MARISHA: While she rolls. 
GINA: (groans) 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
SAM: Balls and balls. 
GINA: That's one, one, two. Okay, I get, wait-- 
SAM: That's it, two. 
GINA: It's two, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
GINA: Okay. Then you need me to-- 
NOSHIR: Rattling is good. (laughter) 
GINA: Okay. 
SAM: Rattling is good. 
NOSHIR: I think that's pretty much all that is in your-- 
GINA: Okay. 
NOSHIR: -- wheelhouse. 
GINA: I come flying through this rain, fan in hand. 
TRAVIS: This rain. (laughs) 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Rain and rain. 
GINA: My fan lands right here on Johnny Cage's neck. I'm to harry a foe. 
TRAVIS: No. 
GINA: I'm going to spin. Okay. I look at him and I say: You know, in this lighting, I can see all the grays. I push-- 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: That's uncalled for! That's uncalled for. That doesn't mean anything. Shake it off. 
NOSHIR: I like you. 
TRAVIS: Shake it off, buddy. 
GINA: I push the fan into his throat, yank it out, and stand next to Rain once again. 
SAM: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: Man. 
SAM: Raiden. 
NOSHIR: We're going to get along just fine. 
SAM: You're old. How did you deal with that? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I just dye it, man. (laughter) 
SAM: Oh, really? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, but sometimes they like the silver fox look. Age equals wisdom. 
SAM: You're right, you're right. 
TRAVIS: Wisdom equals hurt joints, but it's okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: Oh wow. 
NOSHIR: I know. 
SAM: We're in the verdant plaza right now. Each combatant can ready an edge die for the first time they draw a drama here. Oh, but we're not drawing drama right now, or unless I do. Maybe I'll draw a drama! 
TRAVIS: Got costume dramas? 
SAM: I will just do a drama. I'm going to draw a drama card. 
MARISHA: Draw a drama. Draw it from the center-- 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: -- deck here. 
SAM: Oh boy. We both have to cover our-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: (laughs) 
SAM: Offer your hopes that there is a timeline where you can be allies in battle. Oh! Rain? 
NOSHIR: Hmm? 
SAM: You know, at first when I met you, I didn't really get your whole vibe. It seemed like you were typecasting yourself in this whole water thing. But now I get it. You can be ice. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: You can be mist. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: You can be steam. 
GINA: I hate this guy. 
SAM: You can be a lot of different things. And, you know, when you're parked next to fire like me-- 
TRAVIS: Oh god! 
GINA: Ugh, god! 
SAM: We might make a really good duo. 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
SAM: I'm telling you, we could star in some movies together. I've got a sequel coming up to-- To my-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: -- to "Alien Versus Predator Versus Cage." (laughter) 
SAM: Maybe it could be called "Alien Versus Predator Versus Cage With Rain." I'm just throwing it out there. 
GINA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Consider that. 
NOSHIR: Considered. You will only ever be background in my life. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
SAM: I get an edge die for that, and it's your turn. 
MARISHA: Now as your Kameos, they came in with lightning speed and then are instantly rushed back to the sidelines. 
SAM: Oh, they disappear? Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you have to re-summon them each time. 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
MARISHA: As you can still feel that little tingle of being attached to them deep in your soul. 
TRAVIS: Delete those posts! (voice fading) X is a stupid platform name! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Okay, Rain. 
NOSHIR: Tell me, Johnny, did you ever do any of your own fights, or was it always stunt doubles? Come and find me, if you dare. I disappear-- 
MARISHA: Oh! 
NOSHIR: -- and shift over to the stone pavilions. 
SAM: Oh, smack. Do I go with him, or does he just go and I got to use my turn to get there? 
NOSHIR: Oh. 
MARISHA: You chase after him. 
SAM: Oh, I do chase after him? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: He's moving the fight. 
SAM: Naruto run! (laughter) 
SAM: Now we're in the stone pavilion. 
TRAVIS: There is no other run. 
SAM: "Usable once per round, describe how you adapt your moves to the confines of the pavilion, then ready an edge die." Oh, that's interesting. Okay, wait. 
MARISHA: Let me get rid of this. 
SAM: What do I need to do? 
MARISHA: There's just two of you. 
SAM: So one of my things was move the duel to an adjacent area. I didn't do that. He did that. 
MARISHA: He did. 
SAM: So I don't get credit for that. 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: Shit. Okay. Well then, I will-- 
MARISHA: Although, you can do that again if you want to keep the chase going. 
SAM: (laughs) I could, but instead-- I'm an actor, not a fighter. I will summon my Kameo again. 
MARISHA: Perfect. 
SAM: Spending an action point. Kameo, I need you! I mean, sorry. Raiden, I need you. (laughter) 
SAM: I go up to attack Rain, but I realize this area is precarious. I might hurt myself. The things that I want to do are really hard, so I'm going to need my stunt double to come in and do it for me. (laughter) 
MARISHA: It feels like an audio pulse, like you're standing too close to a speaker in the front of the stage, as you feel bo-boof! Emanating from the front of your chest, Raiden-- 
TRAVIS: Do I get to roll-- 
MARISHA: The god of thunder. 
SAM: I will give you another-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: Edge dice. 
TRAVIS and GINA: Ooh! 
NOSHIR: Oh man! 
GINA: Jeez! 
TRAVIS: Oh baby. 
SAM: Yeah, I go to punch Rain and I freeze, and I go: Cut! Hold, hold, hold. (laughter) 
SAM: Then I move and Raiden comes right to my same position. 
TRAVIS: Raiden comes in. 
SAM: I put my sunglasses on him. 
TRAVIS: Sunglasses on, my chest is perfectly waxed. 
MARISHA: You're just getting your body double. 
TRAVIS: For some reason, my ass is out and it's glistening in the rain. Butt double as well as stunt double. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I will land a hit on a foe. They describe the injury. I'll spend three action points. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: My summoner can change to any stance that they want. 
SAM: Oh, me. 
TRAVIS: Those glistening buns turn-- 
MARISHA: That's great. 
TRAVIS: -- and just an epic hip thrust into the solar plexus of Rain. 
MARISHA: With the clap of Raiden's ass cheeks-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: -- so comes the clap of thunder, right directly towards you, Rain. How do you take it? 
NOSHIR: That hip check hits me right in the solar plexus. I slide back. Ah! The impertinence! (laughter) 
NOSHIR: I'm so mad-- 
TRAVIS: Dat ass. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: I can change state, right? Wait. 
TRAVIS: On your turn? 
NOSHIR: Oh wait. Oh, was that something in the-- 
MARISHA: That was for your summoner. 
NOSHIR: Oh, got it, got it, got it, got it. 
MARISHA: So Johnny Cage can. 
TRAVIS: Cage can change. 
NOSHIR: Great, great, great. Yeah, so I'm just livid, but I've never been butt checked by a half-naked god before. I don't know what to do! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Then it's your turn now, Rain. 
NOSHIR: Okay, now I better know what to do. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
NOSHIR: Okay. Kitana, prepare yourself. I draw from my inner strength and ready an edge die. 
GINA: Ah. 
MARISHA: Ooh, nice. Okay, so you're just prepping. 
GINA: So you're summoning me? 
NOSHIR: Not yet. 
GINA: Oh. 
NOSHIR: I wish I could. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Holding on. Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Johnny Cage. Shit, I'm not going to change my stance. I'm going to stay in my quick stance, but I will grab my foe and step gracefully (swoops) to an adjacent area. I think I'm going to take this to the twinned willows. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
NOSHIR: Twinned willows. 
MARISHA: Some fancy footwork. 
SAM: Yeah, I'll trip Rain, and as he falls, I'll grab him and body check him into the next area and say: H2 oh no, buddy. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Rain, you come thudding down. 
TRAVIS: You're horrible. 
GINA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Your back is smashed up against one of the willow trees as you are smacked into the twinned willow garden. 
SAM: That's my move. 
TRAVIS: It is. It is. 
SAM: This guy's an asshole. 
NOSHIR: I get to my feet, I'm pulling broken willow reeds out of my cowl. I don't know what's more embarrassing, that I let you lay hands on me or your stupid puns. 
GINA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
NOSHIR: I'm going to... Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
NOSHIR: Kitana, let's pay this actor a lesson. I bring her into the fray. 
TRAVIS: But not residuals. (laughter) 
GINA: A tornado forms next to Rain. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
GINA: Just her fan blades flying in a circle and you see the blades suddenly stop as she grabs it in front of her and Kitana forms in front of him, or next to him. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MARISHA: The whoosh entering in from this tornado. You get to now take your action. 
GINA: Okay. 
SAM: Here we go. 
GINA: Come on, all right, that's cool. 
SAM: Well, you get a little action. 
GINA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Watch. 
GINA: You need to draw drama is one of your objectives. 
NOSHIR: Mm-hmm. 
GINA: Yes, okay. "Compel any one fighter to draw one drama, including yourself." I compel thy Johnny Cage-- 
TRAVIS: "Thy." 
MARISHA: Compel line Johnny Cage. 
GINA: Compel thy. 
TRAVIS: Compel thine. 
SAM: Drama's my middle name. You're fighting for the wrong side, okay. Rain, you don't get it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: You're fighting for the wrong side. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes, he read the script. (laughter) 
SAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: He has a cue card. 
SAM: Yeah. You don't get it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: When I got here today-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: -- I knew that we were meant to be brothers. Can I get some of that spray to make me cry? 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the stick? Uh-huh. 
SAM: Okay, yeah. Because when I look at you, I see a younger, confused version of myself. Join me, Rain, and we can ride into the sunset together as brothers, please. (laughter) 
GINA: It's the first time I've seen his eyes. 
MARISHA: His eyes are a little bloodshot, but it's just from the menthol stick. (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's not-- 
SAM: That felt really good, guys. That felt really good. 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: In one. 
SAM: Got it in one. 
NOSHIR: I don't want to admit it, but it's oddly compelling. 
MARISHA: Sindel shouts from-- 
NOSHIR: I'm starting to question your motivations. 
MARISHA: -- from beyond. "Less talking! You're not friends!" (laughter) 
MARISHA: "Fight!" 
SAM: Your turn. 
NOSHIR: I am out of action points. 
SAM: All right, I got one more. I can only do a drama or I'm going to summon my Kameo. 
MARISHA: All right, once again, (thunder crashes) the crack of thunder. Raiden. 
TRAVIS: Amazing, with one action point. 
SAM: Can't do much, can you? 
TRAVIS: I will destroy some scenery. (laughter) 
SAM: Chew the scenery! 
TRAVIS: With the twinned willows, I'll say: This one's for number one, Johnny Cage! A lightning bolt will shoot up and strike the top of the willows, cracking a branch and falling towards him. 
SAM: Wow, Raiden, you know, earlier tonight, my agent was tragically killed. (laughter) 
SAM: If when we're done you're looking for work, I could use a new agent. I paid him less than 10%, though, so maybe you could take like five. 
TRAVIS: Five. Five. Six and we've got a deal. 
SAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) All right! 
ANNOUNCER: Round two. Fight! 
SAM: Oh, round two, here we go. 
MARISHA: Round two. 
TRAVIS: Skulls. 
MARISHA: Not my skulls. 
NOSHIR: Oh. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Roll for action points. 
SAM: I rolled a 15. Oh, we get to take one die back. 
MARISHA: Correct, get to ready an edge die. 
SAM: 15 and I'll roll. 
MARISHA: You may change stances, if you wish. 
SAM: One more, ooh, so good. 
NOSHIR: We can change stances. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
NOSHIR: Oh baby. 
SAM: My little nubbin's gone. Here it is. 
TRAVIS: Don't you reroll? 
NOSHIR: Oh yeah. 
SAM: 15. 
NOSHIR: (shouts) Come on! (oohing) 
TRAVIS: Dude! 
SAM: A six gets me two more. 
TRAVIS: You're slow playing it. You're slow playing it. Rope-a-doping. 
GINA: Oh! 
NOSHIR: Man. Man oh man. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: One, two. 
GINA: I don't know if you can afford me, sweetheart. 
NOSHIR: Yeah. 
GINA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: I'm wondering the same. Okay. 
MARISHA: All right, does that mean Johnny Cage is up first again? 
SAM: Johnny Cage is always up first. Number one on the-- 
SAM and TRAVIS: -- call sheet. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
GINA: I did this one for you, remember? 
NOSHIR: Oh, that's right! Sweet. Thank you! 
MARISHA: We all thought of it at once. 
NOSHIR: I was so enthralled, I didn't pay attention. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Okay, I will, the twinned willows is pretty cool. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: What can I do? I'm going to use two action points to step gracefully moving the duel to an adjacent area. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: We're going to go now, we're going to go a walking to the garden bridge. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Yeah, I'll just say: Rain, the lighting here is not great. I don't love the direct sunlight. I need that dappled look. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: So we're going to take it over to the bridge. 
MARISHA: It's a very beautiful bridge. They shot scenes from "Memoirs of a Geisha" here. It's gorgeous. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Johnny knows, he loves it. 
SAM: Yeah. Nice bounce light here. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: That's my turn. 
MARISHA: Rain, it's starting to get frustrating. He didn't even like, he didn't even throw you there. He's just on a running game right now. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: All right. I coat the floor with water. You want to chase? I run and dive into a slide. 
SAM: Get over here! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Not your line. 
NOSHIR: Catch him by the leg, swing him around, and launch him back into the verdant plaza. 
MARISHA: Ooh, oh my god, amazing. 
NOSHIR: I'm like riding on top of him and once we get there, I tell him: Whether you want this or not, we are fighting here. No more running. 
MARISHA: As you jettison Johnny Cage through, they go through these twin willows and you don't realize, Johnny Cage, until you land, you have been completely speared with a branch that has impaled you all the way through your spleen. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: Ah, god. 
NOSHIR and TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: It hurts. 
TRAVIS: I think you got two of those, it's okay. (laughter) 
SAM: Good old Johnny Two-Spleens. (laughter) 
SAM: That's what they call me. No, I had both my spleens taken out to drop weight for a movie. 
GINA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: You don't really need them. 
NOSHIR: Sorry. 
SAM: I had all unnecessary organs removed and a couple necessary ones. 
NOSHIR: That move from the garden bridge I think rattles Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Oh, it does? 
GINA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Well, that tracks, as he has been impaled. 
SAM: Two rattles to what? 
NOSHIR: To I think anything you choose. 
SAM: Okay, well then, shit. What is he doing? 
TRAVIS: Well then, shit. 
MARISHA and GINA: Well, shit. 
SAM: I don't have... 
MARISHA and GINA: (laugh) 
SAM: Okay, I'll go to defensive rattled stance. I back up, not looking great, and also a little scared by having wood sticking through me. 
MARISHA: Normally, you've been very used to being soaking wet from the rain from all of these thunder clouds, but this time you feel a warm sensation. You almost think you pissed yourself for a second. 
SAM: Again? 
MARISHA: But you look down (laughs)-- 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: -- and it is your own blood turning your very expensive jeans a nice crimson color. 
SAM: Oh no, these are expensive jeans. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: You know what? This reminds me of that scene in "Cage of Tomorrow." 
MARISHA: Oh my god, Jesus Christ. 
TRAVIS: "Cage of Tomorrow." 
SAM: Where I was-- 
MARISHA: Every name he's in is also named after him in-- every movie. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: It's in the contract. 
MARISHA: It's always in the contract, yeah. 
TRAVIS: And $17,000. 
MARISHA: Self-produced, yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You started your own production company. 
TRAVIS: Brought to you by Out of Cage Productions. (laughter) 
GINA: Children's special "Ice Cage." 
TRAVIS: "Cage-Out." 
NOSHIR: Oh jeez. 
SAM: But in that movie, I ended up winning in the end, not because of my will or my strength, (deeply) but because of my friends. I will bring in Raiden to fight for me again. 
NOSHIR: Oh, beautiful! (laughter) 
NOSHIR: Oh man. 
SAM: I will give him another die. Rattle this motherfucker. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay, okay, six and a one and a two. That's all I needed, that's all I needed. I will harry. Yes, no, I will harry a foe. "The foe must spend action points or be rattled." I say: Listen, whether you win or lose, I've got all of his movies on DVD and I will sit you down and peel your eyelids open and make you watch unless you die. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: You feel rattled by being threatened with the "Clockwork Orange" approach. 
SAM: Oh yeah, it doesn't say what rattled stance. 
TRAVIS: Director's cut. 
SAM: Oh no! That director's cut of "Cage of Tomorrow." 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
SAM: Its alternate title was "Cage Die Repeat." 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Cage Die Repeat. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: Rain has never actually felt terror like that before. That's a fate worse than death, and screaming. (screams) You can't do this to me! I go running and try to take shelter in the twinned willows. 
GINA: Oh, okay. 
TRAVIS: Nice, nice. 
SAM: Just moving all over the place. 
MARISHA: Yes, it is. 
NOSHIR: No! 
TRAVIS: Do we get a bonus point for activating all four areas of the map? 
SAM: Yeah, do we unlock a secret level? 
TRAVIS: We just went up the lovers' steps. 
MARISHA: Sindel getting frustrated by the amount of time she has to change position. Just goes, "Avoidance is only temporary." 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
GINA: (laughs) 
SAM: Well, shit, what round is this, two? 
TRAVIS: Everybody's sweaty. 
GINA: Two. 
SAM: Two! I'm already done with my objectives! 
NOSHIR: Holy shit! 
GINA: Oh no! 
MARISHA: Are you really? 
SAM: Yeah, he's been helping me a lot! 
MARISHA: Because he helped, yeah. 
SAM: Got to get to four. 
MARISHA: Got to get four. Do you have any more action points? 
SAM: I do, I have three. 
NOSHIR: Good lord. 
SAM: Which I will use. He's already rattled. I'll just compel you to draw a drama. Draw that drama! 
NOSHIR: So I got to draw from here. Yeah? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: You don't know who you're up against. I don't take damage like a normal man. What you got? 
MARISHA: It's all the Botox. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It pads him. 
NOSHIR: "Compliment your foe and their mentor on the quality of their training." 
MARISHA: Whoa. 
GINA: Ooh! 
SAM: I think-- 
TRAVIS: Jean-Claude Van Damme? 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: Sanford Meisner. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Sanford Meisner. 
MARISHA: No! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Who taught you? 
MARISHA: No! 
SAM: I'm a method actor. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: As much as I might hate you, I can't help but admit I'm very jealous of your hair. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
NOSHIR: Where did you learn to style it Like that? That must have come from your master, David Hasselhoff. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh! 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Nice! (snaps) 
MARISHA: (claps) 
SAM: You're right, the Hoff was a big inspiration to me and he gave me the number of the guy who put in the hair implants. (laughter) 
MARISHA: All right, Johnny Cage. 
SAM: I mean, that's it for me. It says, oh, I can spend it. I'm going to ready an edge dice. That's it for my turn. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
NOSHIR: Beautiful. 
MARISHA: Do you have any more action points? All right, round three. 
SAM: Round three! 
NOSHIR: Oh, sweet mercy. 
GINA: Oh, please roll high. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
GINA: You need this, bud. 
NOSHIR: So we can change state. 
MARISHA: You can change your stances. 
SAM: Oh, we can change our stances so I don't have to be rattled anymore. That's great. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
SAM: I'm going to go to-- Oh shit. I guess I got to go to quick and I'll spend another one of these. No, I won't, I'm not going to. I'm not going to. I'm going to go into the wary stance. I'm not going to spend any of my edge dice. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: I'm good. 
GINA: Come on! Ooh! 
NOSHIR: Okay, that's better. 
GINA: Okay! All right. Okay. 
NOSHIR: One edge. 
GINA: All right, well-- 
NOSHIR: Really? 
TRAVIS: Dude, it's unreal. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: All right. Four action points. It's cool, it's fine, it's fine. 
TRAVIS: The dice are talking. 
GINA: Oh my goodness. 
NOSHIR: Oh shoot, what did I have? 14. Okay. 
SAM: I rolled a 10 on the die. 
NOSHIR: Okay. I rolled a 14, though it didn't seem to help me that much. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: You still have the advantage. You go first, Rain. 
NOSHIR: Yes. 
MARISHA: Round three. 
SAM: Let's get wet. 
NOSHIR: Way ahead of you. Hmm... Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm hmm, hmm, hmm. Okay. I come running in at Johnny Cage. I prepare an overhand right, and just as I'm about to reach him, I use my water powers to glide out from under him and make the floor under him slick so that we both end up sliding into a new territory. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: Garden bridge. 
GINA: Nice. 
MARISHA: The garden bridge. 
SAM: He's going all over this place. 
MARISHA: Slip all the way. 
TRAVIS: "Gran Turismo." 
MARISHA: Full water slide moment. Yeah. 
SAM: (yells) 
MARISHA: Did you say "Gran Turismo?" 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Sindel's like, "Wrong game!" (laughter) 
GINA: From the spirit realm, Kitana is fanning them a little bit further so they move all the way. There we go, just project. Helping them move a little bit more. 
MARISHA: You feel the soul energy slide you on your feet. 
SAM: Okay, I will spend all three of my action points to rattle my foe into a defensive stance and I'll rattle you by saying: Do you think you could talk to Kitana for me? 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: I just feel like we had a connection and if you could just put in a good word for me, I think she would-- she respects you for some weird reason. Maybe because you're both from the Outrealms or whatever? I don't know, whatever it is, put in a good word for me. Or I'll kill you! (laughter) 
NOSHIR: I am so put off by your lack of modesty. Dude, what is wrong with you?! That is never happening! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: I use my two action points to draw a drama and rattle Johnny Cage. 
MARISHA: Ooh, draw from the center. At this point, the camera sweeps around and petals from the cherry blossom tree fall and drift slightly in the wind behind you all on this very beautiful, romantic scene we have going on. 
NOSHIR: "Accuse your foe of throwing away the potential they once had." 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
GINA: (laughs) Oh boy. 
MARISHA: I'm so excited for this. (laughter) 
MARISHA: This is perfect for Johnny. 
GINA: Great card. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: Earlier, you showed a little bit of your soul to me and it moved me in a powerful way. You could do that on the silver screen. You had the chance, but instead, you sold out for money. And now, you're an action star that no one will remember and no one will ever say changed their lives. You are nothing but a glorified prop. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
GINA: Oh! 
SAM: I had a chance to do Lear once. (laughter) 
SAM: Community theater, not a lot of money. My agent, may he rest in peace. (laughter) 
SAM: I told him I really wanted to do it. It was perfect for me, star turn. But he told me I just booked a part in "The Cage Runner." 
TRAVIS and NOSHIR: (laugh) A low-budget knockoff of the "Maze Runner." 
TRAVIS and NOSHIR: (laugh) 
SAM: It wasn't a lot of pay, just five grand, but I was attracted to the money and I never got to do another stage play again. I've regretted that day ever since. You're saying I still have it? I could still get on the stage? I could still change people's lives? 
NOSHIR: My friend, "if only" are two of the worst words you can ever have to utter, and that is all you have left. 
MARISHA: From out of nowhere, you all are so caught up in this moment, you do not notice. And suddenly-- (energy exploding) Directly in between the two of you, a giant purple, it almost feels like a flash bomb, massive strike of purple energy, flame explodes, sends you all backwards from each other. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MARISHA: It is Sindel levitating above you all. "I said no more talking!" 
SAM: Ah! 
MARISHA: She screams and goes into her Banshee Shout and you each lose one action point. 
GINA: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Aw! 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
SAM: Brutal. I don't have any. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Right. 
SAM: Do I lose one on the next round or no? 
MARISHA: No, no. 
SAM: Okay. Whew! 
MARISHA: Did you have any? 
NOSHIR: Zero. 
MARISHA: Oh. Well then, there you go. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: But it still hurts like crazy! 
SAM: I was already at my lowest moment. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Like a loud THX from "Jurassic Cage." 
SAM: (laughs) "Jurassic Cage." 
GINA and NOSHIR: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Nobody came out of that viewing. 
SAM: (sighs) 
MARISHA: "Fine. It is time to finish this." 
ANNOUNCER: Final round. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
ANNOUNCER: Fight! 
GINA: All right! 
NOSHIR: Oh man! 
GINA: Aw! 
MARISHA: "Do not disappoint me, gentlemen." 
SAM: Bad roll. Bad roll. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) So, let's see. 
TRAVIS: Spend them. 
SAM: I got to. Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Ugh. 
SAM: Bloop, bloop. 
TRAVIS: That's all you need, right? 
SAM: That's all I need. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
NOSHIR: Hmm. 
GINA: Spend them all. 
NOSHIR: Yep. 
GINA: Oof. Okay, okay. 
NOSHIR: All right. So, one, two, three. Then one, two. 
SAM: Where are we? We're on the garden bridge. 
MARISHA: Currently on the bridge. 
GINA: This is fourth round? 
MARISHA: All right, is Rain up top? 
SAM: I got five. 
NOSHIR: Oh, I got 10. Yep, I guess so. 
SAM: Yep, you're going. 
MARISHA: Rain. 
GINA: Wait, is this fourth round? 
SAM: Fourth round. 
MARISHA: Fourth round. 
SAM: Here we go. 
GINA: Are you sure you don't want to spend all those? Actually, no. Eh, yeah. 
SAM: Come on, Rain. 
NOSHIR: Oh, nice, nice. 
SAM: What are you waiting for? 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
MARISHA: There is a purple energy that is starting to emanate off of Sindel. 
NOSHIR: You see what I need, yeah. 
GINA: Yep. 
MARISHA: It's her rage. 
NOSHIR: We can do this, Kitana. We can finish this here and now. (summoning explosion) 
GINA: Kitana-- A flash of lightning comes down from the skies and Kitana appears next to Rain. Fans in the skies, a crash of lightning strikes her blades. (lightning crashing) So I've been summoned. Then she rolls. Oh, here we go. 
NOSHIR: Take it. 
GINA: Oh, thank you. 
TRAVIS: Oh, snap. 
SAM: Oh, snapkins. 
GINA: A five and a four. 
SAM: Oh, good rolls. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Three total. 
MARISHA: Three total. 
GINA: Three. Okay, and she-- I would like to spend-- Oh, that's all you need? (mumbling description) Okay. I spend one action point to compel any one fighter to draw one drama. Hey, has been! 
SAM: (sighs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: (laughs) 
SAM: I think she's talking to you, Rain. (laughter) (lingering laughter) 
SAM: "Accuse your foe of being a lackey to the feeble warriors they serve." 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
SAM: I know so much about Rain and his lore. (laughter) 
SAM: Who wears the pants over here, Rain? You or your Kameo? Seems like she's doing more damage than you. You've got nothing. Face me yourself. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
SAM: That's all I got. 
GINA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: I'm a wizard, what do you want from me? (laughter) 
MARISHA: It is your turn, Johnny Cage. 
SAM: It's my turn, and on Johnny Cage's turn I'm going to spend four action points and I am going to end this duel. 
NOSHIR: Oh! 
MARISHA: Wait for it. 
SAM: I-- Oh, wait for it. 
MARISHA: "Johnny Cage." 
ANNOUNCER: Finish him. 
SAM and TRAVIS: Yes! 
GINA: Oh! 
SAM: I'm going to first subdue Rain by doing a number of complicated flip moves and awesome gymnastic moves that again, aren't me doing them, but when I land it's me and I do a flashy shadow kick. When he's stunned, I will whip out another one of my-- 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
SAM: -- my headshots, "To Rain--" What should I say to Rain? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Thanks for all your-- 
GINA: Can you still put in a good word for Kitana? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: "Keep smiling." (laughter) 
SAM: "Johnny Cage." (laughter) 
SAM: I will use my headshot to swipe across his throat, drawing a streak of blood down his neck, ending him, and I will pose dramatically to Sindel and take a bow. That's how you do it. 
MARISHA: She nods. 
SAM: He just got Caged. 
GINA: Oh god. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Rain, you're not entirely sure what happened. Everything seems fine. You could feel the intense, sharp pain as he slid across your throat and a little bit of the blood that starts to pour. Merely a flesh wound, just a scratch. You take one step further to try and go after Johnny Cage as he bows, trying to utilize the moment of distraction. But as your body moves forward, your head does not. 
GINA: Ooh! Oh. 
NOSHIR: (head popping) 
MARISHA: As your head rolls backwards, decapitated. 
ANNOUNCER: Fatality. 
NOSHIR: Ah! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
SAM: Money shot. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: "Congratulations, Mr. Cage." 
SAM: Was there ever a question? 
MARISHA: "Immensely." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: A few. (laughs) 
MARISHA: "I'm honestly quite surprised, which is honestly why I can say I am quite excited to fight you one-on-one." 
SAM: Wait, wait, wait. I did your little trials. I entertained your guests. I killed all these guys. It's over, right? Wait, it's over. I'm the champion, I won! Where's my prize? 
MARISHA: "You didn't think that I would hold a tournament and not get my hands dirty myself, now did you?" 
SAM: I honestly didn't think about you at all. (laughter) 
MARISHA: "Silly little boy. I don't know if you've heard, but it may be a Barbie summer, but it is a Sindel century!" 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: To that I say, "Sir, you are not Kenough." 
TRAVIS: Wow, yes! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yes! 
GINA: I love it here. 
MARISHA: You see the threads of the summons snap, your souls, back in your own bodies as you're back in corporeal form. 
GINA: (gasps breath) 
MARISHA: Sindel-- It looks like she's reversing time. 
NOSHIR: (sucking air) (pops) 
MARISHA: -- pulls Rain back from his demise. 
SAM: Oh, your head's back. 
NOSHIR: Mm. 
SAM: Keep smiling. 
TRAVIS: Christopher Lambert, I have so many questions. 
GINA and SAM: (laugh) 
NOSHIR: I do like this, though. 
MARISHA: "I wish to show you all something." Sindel begins to levitate, and this purple energy that has been forming this aura around her flashes outward into a massive AoE, consuming all of you. You see a bright flash of purple light. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: You are no longer in the garden. 
GINA: Ooh. 
MARISHA: As she teleports all of you to-- Where's the map? Where's the map? 
SAM: Oh boy. Map reveal! 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: A laboratory. 
TRAVIS: ♪ (bass beats) ♪ 
SAM and GINA: Oh! 
NOSHIR: Whoa! 
SAM: Ooh! Shang Tsung's lab? 
MARISHA: Shang Tsung's laboratory. Amongst it, you see vials, bottles, experimentations, as well as gurneys, beds, still coated with the remains of whatever humans they have been experimenting on. In the center of this laboratory, you also see an Asian man, older, maybe in his mid-50s, dark hair pulled back into a tight ponytail, a pointed nose, a nice open robe showing his excellent physique, adorned with brown, tan, black, and gold. He is trapped inside a capsule? He is screaming, but you can't hear him, as he is encased in glass. But what you can see is electrical nodes that appear to be ripping his soul from his body. Then it reenters, and then it pulses again as his soul is ripped and then reentered as he is in this constant state of flux as his soul is neither intact, neither his, but with the constant reminder of what he is missing over and over and over again. "You see, Shang Tsung betrayed me. We were supposed to be partners until he sucked the soul out of my body. It was a horrible experience. So horrible, in fact, I thought, what if I could replicate this? Make it occur again and again and again for eternity? This was his laboratory, after all. Hmm. It's poetic, really, being subjected to the fate that he bestowed upon so many of us. So, who would like to come after me first?" 
SAM: Whoa! 
GINA: Oh! 
MARISHA: You see Sindel levitate above the laboratory. 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
MARISHA: She sends once again a massive shockwave out. "After all, it is my party, and I can fight if I want to!" (laughter) 
GINA: Nice. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah. 
GINA: That was cool, that was cool, that was really cool. I like that one. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yo. 
MARISHA: We are going into this final round-- 
SAM: (as announcer) Final round. 
MARISHA: -- of our fight tonight. 
SAM: How do we do this? 
TRAVIS: 4v1? 
MARISHA: We are going 4v1 once again. 
SAM: Do we have objectives? 
MARISHA: Yes, we are. If you two would like to hand me your objectives that you had. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Boop. 
SAM: Bibbidi bobbidi. 
MARISHA: Boop. 
GINA: We'll leave these in the middle? 
TRAVIS: This is what I've been waiting for. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
NOSHIR: Oh, those. 
SAM: We have special moves. 
MARISHA: I'm going to mix these up at random and hand them out to you. These are your new objectives. You do have special moves. Here, I will let you all pick so it still feels like you have at least a little bit of agency. 
TRAVIS: Ladies first. 
GINA: Oh, thank you. I'll do this one. 
SAM: (mocking Travis) "Ladies first." 
TRAVIS: (gravelly nonsense) 
GINA: Oh hell. 
TRAVIS: What? 
GINA: Oh! 
NOSHIR: Uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: That's so many dots on this one. 
NOSHIR: This does not bode well. 
GINA: We're the same, jeez. 
SAM: (mumbling description) 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
GINA: Oh boy. Okay. 
NOSHIR: Wait, what? 
TRAVIS: How would you even-- Okay. ♪ (humming bubbly tune) ♪ 
GINA: What? 
TRAVIS: ♪ (humming bubbly tune) ♪ 
SAM: These are easy, guys. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Okay. 
GINA: No way! 
MARISHA: Let me pull up my-- 
SAM: No way! 
GINA: No way! 
MARISHA: Use my own 4v1 rules. Yes, they are, just in case. All right, everybody, let's all roll for initiative. 
SAM: Let's go. 
NOSHIR: Holy moly. 
SAM: 16? Come on. 
NOSHIR: Oh, that's great. 
MARISHA: 15, so hang on. 
NOSHIR: Get revvin'. 
MARISHA: Let me do the math here. 
NOSHIR: So we go back to five-- 
TRAVIS: The original card? 
NOSHIR: -- edge die? 
MARISHA: I'm going to-- Blech, yucky. Let me spend another one. 
SAM: All right. 
MARISHA: Okay, that's better. 
SAM: I got five action points. (mumbled reading) 
NOSHIR: I'm going to snag two edge die. We all start with five again, right? Woo hoo. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
NOSHIR: Okay, good. 
MARISHA: All right, who rolled what? 
SAM: I got a 16. 
GINA: I got a 15. 
NOSHIR: 11. 
TRAVIS: 19. (oohing) 
MARISHA: Okay, so it was Raiden. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MARISHA: Johnny Cage. Kitana and Rain, if I'm correct? 
NOSHIR: Yeah, I think that's right. 
GINA: Oh boy. 
SAM: But just one of us needs to complete their objectives, right? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
SAM: And their special moves. 
MARISHA: "-- usual, comes in-- late in game-- Furthers (muttering noises). Counteract the milestone (mumbled reading) initiative advantage, blah, blah, blah." 
SAM: We're all learning. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: As we go. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we're all. All right, Kitana. 
SAM: We're in this fight together. Kitana, let's bury the hatchet and be allies this day. 
GINA: We'll all talk about the ally part later, but I guess we can work together for now. (laughter) 
SAM: Costars. 
GINA: One, two. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
GINA: Acquaintances, at best. 
SAM: Costars. 
GINA: (laughs) Then the real, okay, cool, all right. 
MARISHA: Sindel is up first. 
ALL: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
SAM: She's cooking the books. 
TRAVIS: All right, all right, all right. All right, all right, all right, all right. 
MARISHA: As she is levitating above all of you in this complete mess of a laboratory, she immediately looks to you, Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Johnny Cage. 
MARISHA: "I've been waiting for this moment as you have been so annoying!" She whips her hair and grapples you with her long, almost sentient mane. 
SAM: (grunts) 
MARISHA: You can feel it tightening like a cobra around your neck as she lifts you in with a head whip, throws you across the laboratory, and smashes you into a table with glass shattering all behind you, injuring you. That was me injuring you. 
SAM: (groans) Am I in the same room? 
MARISHA: You are in the same room. I smash you on the table. I land a hit on my foe, but you describe the injury. 
SAM: Oh, you threw me onto a table. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
SAM: Let's say that strangely, even though the table was filled with glass beakers and sharp metal instruments and pointy electrical objects, I missed all of them. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Instead, (sharp groan) I fell on my keys! (laughter) 
SAM: It goes right up into my abdomen. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
SAM: I have to pull them out. 
TRAVIS: That's the worst! 
GINA: Oh, jeez. 
SAM: Blood trickling from my leg. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's the worst! 
SAM: I know that my keys-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: I know that they say Geo Prizm on them, but that's to dissuade people. I really drive a Bentley. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: It's a Bentley, it's just I had to get a replacement key. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Raiden, you are up. 
TRAVIS: A laboratory. My favored terrain. 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: I know. (laughs) I will start to crackle with lightning-- 
MARISHA: Says the lightning guy. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh! (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'll float up off the ground and I will spend two action points to land a hit on my foe. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TRAVIS: But I will use the electrical coils that are situated all around the room-- 
SAM: Oh, nice! 
TRAVIS: -- to amplify, like a Tesla coil-- 
NOSHIR: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: -- this lightning as it arcs around. As it hits you, it strikes just at your hair to see what will happen to that amazing Elvira 'do. 
MARISHA: You hear a little, "Ooh!" from Sindel. It's surprising how unthreatening as it was, as sure enough, like a poodle on a high static day. Poof! (laughter) 
MARISHA: You see that mane go. This pisses her off even more. Johnny Cage! 
SAM: Johnny Cage is up. 
MARISHA: With Kitana on deck. 
SAM: Seeing the electrical mishaps that Raiden has created in the room, there's one particular piece of electrical equipment that is sizzling and jittering. With a couple of turns of the knobs, I rearrange it so that it's sending out flashes of light on a regular pulse. It makes us all look like-- 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! 
SAM: -- we're moving at a stutter, like a strobe effect, like we're all in a movie. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh god. 
SAM: I will-- 
TRAVIS: Stop motion. 
SAM: A stop motion picture. I will use the laboratory floor action, and I just described this artifact and how it's damaged. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: So I get to ready an edge die. That will be my move. 
MARISHA: Okay, fantastic. 
SAM: Next! 
MARISHA: Kitana! 
GINA: Mm-hmm. 
NOSHIR: Wow, that's dope. 
MARISHA: Rain, you're on deck. 
GINA: Let's see. I would like to spend three action points, one, two, three, to rattle your foe into a defensive stance. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
GINA: Kitana looks up at her mother floating in the air. 
SAM: Whoa! (laughs) 
GINA: Take two. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Retake. 
GINA: She looks up at her mother floating in the air. Mother! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: "Yes?" 
GINA: You were a better mother when you were brainwashed. And rattles her into a defensive stance. 
SAM: Can you be rattled? 
MARISHA: I'm going to take it. Yeah, I'm going to allow it. 
GINA: Okay. 
SAM: Oh, she's powerful. 
GINA: All right. Then that was that. 
TRAVIS: Because it's family. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: With her hair all frazzled, she says, "What do you know, you naive little brat?" 
GINA: (scoffs) 
MARISHA: Rain, you're on deck. 
NOSHIR: I'm going to use one action point to draw a drama. So am I drawing from this pile now? 
SAM: Yeah, I think so. For the rest of the game. 
NOSHIR: But I have to substitute for that, and instead I ask Sindel: This already isn't going well for you, Sindel. What do you hope to achieve here? What's your purpose? 
MARISHA: "Mm. My entire existence hasn't gone well. I'm afraid you are speaking to a pro. (cackles)" She cackles. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: As she cackles. 
MARISHA: And she cackles. (laughter) 
SAM: Who's up next? 
MARISHA: Top of the round, that's me! Oh my god! 
SAM: Oh wait. Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: Same round. Same round. 
SAM: Same round, same round. 
MARISHA: But my turn. Sorry. Being incredibly frustrated, especially at her daughter, I'm going to spend two action points to compel Kitana to draw a drama. 
GINA: Ooh, okay. Let's see. 
SAM: Drama! 
GINA: I hit her where it hurt. You can tell. "Tell your foe why you cannot risk sparing her life." 
MARISHA: Mm. 
GINA: Ooh. Okay. Kitana looks up at her mother and says: I've been wanting to do this for a long time, Mother. I'm sick of these meetings that you call upon me to with no warning whatsoever. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
GINA: I was napping, I feel like it's super weird. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
GINA: Jesus Christ. 
TRAVIS: No consideration by calendar. 
GINA: (laughs) I know, hello? 
TRAVIS: I had this week blocked out. 
GINA: Moms, am I right? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
GINA: She looks at the rest of them and says: Besides, for once in my life, I think I've made some friends. She looks at all them, and (clear throat). Not all of them, but most of them. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
GINA: Therefore, you must die. 
MARISHA: "You think friendship and camaraderie can save you? Come here, darling." 
GINA: Kitana floats up to her mother without any control. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
MARISHA: Raiden. 
TRAVIS: Wha? Me? 
MARISHA: It's you. 
TRAVIS: I will-- 
MARISHA: Johnny Cage on deck. 
TRAVIS: I will also land another hit on my foe using two action points. No, fuck that! I'm going to use three action points to rattle my foe into the reckless stance. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TRAVIS: Did you hear that? Your daughter has friends. 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Do you have any friends that you haven't turned into punch bowls of blood? I don't see any. What are those hamsters doing up in those cages? They look like they've seen some shit. You know what they have? Us for friends. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Phenomenal. Johnny Cage? 
SAM: Johnny Cage is going to compel your foe to draw one drama. It says how I have to react to it. But I will yell up to Sindel: Sindel! Just let us go. You know this isn't going to end well for you. Quit playing your crazy games and let us go back to our plush Hollywood estates. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: "I blame my foes for making everything worse." 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: "You asked why I am doing this. You ask if I have friends. No. You know why? Because everyone who's ever been in my life has betrayed me. Trust is not a resource that I can count on. You made me like this!" 
SAM: I'm supposed to react with surprising compassion. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Are you? 
SAM: So I will gently weep. (laughter) 
SAM: And a little tear will trickle down my face and I'll say: That was an incredible performance. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh wow. Wow. 
SAM: Can I use that for auditions or dramatic stuff or some of the theatrical stuff that Rain was telling me about? 
MARISHA: "Save your tears for the camera." 
SAM: There's cameras? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: That's the end of my turn. 
MARISHA: Kitana, with Rain on deck. 
GINA: Okay, Kitana starts flicking her fans together to sharpen the blades. (blades shink) She's readying herself and she readies an edge die for two action points. Then she readies, ooh, yeah, let's put one here. Then that is the end of my turn. 
MARISHA: Okay. Rain. 
NOSHIR: You're confused, Sindel. You don't need to trust, only obey. Draw a drama card. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
SAM: It's all drama this round. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MARISHA:  "So much drama. Warn your foe that their death shall accomplish nothing. You've already died once today, Rain. What do you think will happen when I claim your soul permanently? (laughs sinisterly)" And it's me. It's me on deck. 
SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
SAM: Shit. 
TRAVIS: I was hanging on every word. 
MARISHA: You know what? Just because it's on theme and because I was just addressing Rain, I'm going to draw one drama again and rattle my foe. 
TRAVIS: Oh, snap. 
MARISHA: Rain, are you already rattled? No. 
SAM: He's not. 
NOSHIR: No, I am not. 
MARISHA: I will rattle you and then I boast about my own excellence. "You see, I am entering my villain era!" (laughter) I actually gain an action point with that card. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
GINA: Quietly, you hear Kitana the in the back like: Honestly? Slay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ I hope you're happy here ♪ 
MARISHA and GINA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: That was my turn. Raiden! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) With one action point left, I will destroy some scenery. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I will pick up a beaker marked "Urine." (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ugh! 
TRAVIS: And I will throw it at Sindel. (laughter) 
MARISHA: She darts out of the way, dashing to the side, leaving a purple echo of herself that you do see the bottle of urine just pass by, still shaking her a little bit. She looks at you and goes, "The fuck?" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I don't know, I just saw it. I don't understand why that's in a place like this. 
MARISHA: "Oh, trash people." (laughter) 
MARISHA: Johnny Cage. 
SAM: I will burn my last action point to draw a drama. "Describe the fatality you intend to perform if you win." Okay. When I win, Sindel, I'm going to do to you what you did to your ex-husband, Shao Kahn. I'm going to grow-- 
MARISHA: "He did so many things." 
SAM: -- plants. No, no, what you did to him. I'm going to grow plants. You know what? No, it was really gross. 
MARISHA: I love plants. 
SAM: I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. 
MARISHA: I mean, it was effective. 
SAM: It was too gross. It was super gross. 
MARISHA: I grew those from scratch through his body. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: (laughs) I'm going to use my victory against you as the first thing on my new reel. 
MARISHA: "Mm." 
SAM: So that all the casting directors in LA are going to see me defeat you every time that I submit myself for a role, which is a lot. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: "So they're going to see you beating on a woman?" 
SAM: Oh. Shit! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Extracurricular activities. Extracurricular! 
SAM: I've got to delete those tweets! 
TRAVIS: Stop streaming online. What are you doing? 
SAM: I got to delete those tweets. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Kitana, with Rain on deck. 
TRAVIS: Help me help you. 
MARISHA: How are we on action points, everybody? You two are out? 
SAM: I'm out, I'm out. 
GINA: I have two left. 
MARISHA: All right. 
GINA: With my last two, I would like to do one of those things. 
NOSHIR: Oh. 
GINA: "Describe an artifact and how it is damaged in the fray. The first time you do this, ready an edge die." So I'll spin that and then another edge die here. Describe an artifact and how it's damaged in the fray. Okay, the laboratory floor. The laboratory floor is riddled with shattered glass and beaker, I mean, those are made of glass, metal. Everything that you can see within eye's distance is absolutely obliterated. It is damaged in the fray. Kitana looks over to one empty tube that had liquid filled in it, but now there's a giant hole that was broken into it. Below, you see liquid spilled everywhere, a bright, green liquid. Inside of it is a-- Laying there on the floor is a curled up cat. 
SAM: Oh. 
GINA: A dead cat. Kitana notices it and looks up at Sindel and goes: You said Fluffy ran away! 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: (gasps) Scandal. 
MARISHA: "My first experiment." 
GINA and TRAVIS: (gasp) 
TRAVIS: Shit just got personal. 
GINA: Kitana wipes a tear away with her fans and she says: You will die for this. 
MARISHA: "(humorless laugh)" 
GINA: And that is the end of my moves. 
MARISHA: Rain. 
NOSHIR: Rain takes in the laboratory floor. I noticed that amongst the debris, there are the bodies of strange, twisted creatures with bones coming out of places that they shouldn't. They look warped and twisted. What have you been doing? Draw a drama card. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm! (laughs) 
GINA: Fluffy! 
MARISHA: "Lament on the sad circumstances that made you enemies." Hmm. "You, with so many powers, near the gods. Rain, you must feel it, this new age that we are in. Time has changed, and I must capitalize on it while I can. There may be other dimensions, other multiverses, other versions of me that do not have this opportunity. I'm sorry, but I must embrace the time that I have." Is that the end of your turn? 
NOSHIR: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: All right. I am going to land a hit on a foe. 
TRAVIS: Who's out of action points? 
NOSHIR: Me. 
TRAVIS: Me. 
SAM: Me. 
GINA: I'm out. 
MARISHA: Everyone's out? All right. 
SAM: Next round. 
NOSHIR: Oh, out of action points? 
TRAVIS: Out of action points. 
NOSHIR: Oh, I've got one to work with. 
MARISHA: I am not out of action points. 
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh shit. 
NOSHIR: (groans) 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
NOSHIR: In trouble. 
MARISHA: I have hit you, Johnny Cage, correct? 
SAM: I mean, if you could call it that. 
MARISHA: I'm going to take this moment, spend two action points because I'm going to capitalize on having your attention. I'm going to land a hit on you, Rain. I dash towards you with lightning speed. Once again, all you see is this flash of purple, an echo coming towards you. It almost feels as if a specter, a ghost, is about to pass through your body, but you are shunted and hit with the full force as I headbutt into you, ramming you backwards. You describe the injury. 
NOSHIR: I see a blur of motion and bring my staff up, and I swing and hit nothing as you pass that space faster than thought and strike my body. I can feel my soul shudder and, for a moment, leave my body before it comes back. It leaves me on a knee, trying to figure out what the hell you just did to me. 
MARISHA: You see Sindel lick her lips. Hmm. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Ah. Tasty. 
NOSHIR: Ugh. 
MARISHA: Then she's going to take your staff and grab it out of your hand and then whip it around, using your body and counterweight against you and smash you, once again, into a wall, a shelf filled with artifacts and beakers, destroying scenery and taking us into a new area. 
ALL: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MARISHA: As I throw you, let's see, I'm going to throw you through a shelf that knocks over and flings us into the science lab. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MARISHA: ♪ Um ♪ I am. Okay, that was me using last of my action points 
ANNOUNCER: Round two. Fight! 
SAM and TRAVIS: Round two! 
MARISHA: Hang on, let me make sure I'm tracking all my shit here. Great. Great. 
SAM: We roll, yeah? 
MARISHA: We roll! Everyone gets to refresh an edge die. 
NOSHIR: I had one action point left. 
GINA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Oh, you had one action point? 
SAM: Spend it! 
NOSHIR: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Well, finish it before we move on. 
NOSHIR: I pick myself up out of the science lab. She's stronger than I thought. I brace, and try to pull as much energy to me as I can, and ready an edge dice. 
SAM: Nice. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
GINA: All right. 
MARISHA: All right. So now, round two! 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
SAM: (like announcer) Round two again. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
GINA: Oh. 
MARISHA: I'm going to switch stances here. I got two. 
SAM: Boop. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: Oh yeah, we can switch stances. 
MARISHA: You may switch stances. 
SAM: I think I might... keep. 
GINA: Are you kidding me right now? 
MARISHA: Let me, hang on. 
GINA: A two. 
MARISHA: We have, that (mumbled reading). 
SAM: We make sure-- 
MARISHA: Let me make sure here, and-- 
SAM: -- to change from a stance, to change from a stances. So, he changes a stance. 
MARISHA: Right on, change stance. (laughs) 
SAM: Stance changes. Lots of cards to read here on-- 
NOSHIR: Yeah. 
SAM: -- "Mortal Kombat One." 
MARISHA: Okay. Let's see. 
GINA: Come on! 
MARISHA: Yes, I'm going to. That, let's get a few more going here. 
TRAVIS: Not changing yet. 
MARISHA: That's good, that's good. 
TRAVIS: Not changing yet. 
SAM: Don't fix what ain't broken, right. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Boop. You know what? Okay. All right. 
SAM: I rolled a 14. 
NOSHIR: Oh jeez. 
GINA: Oh, what did I roll? Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, 14, anyone higher than that? 
TRAVIS: 14. 
NOSHIR: 14. 
SAM: What? 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: Rollies? 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Rollies! 
TRAVIS: Before you even say it. 
GINA: (laughs) Hmm? 
TRAVIS: What'd you roll? 
GINA: Six. 
TRAVIS: Aw. Thought it was 14. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Let's do Rollies between the guys. 
SAM: Rollies, so we just roll again, that's the rule of Rollies. 
NOSHIR: Oh, okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's-- 
GINA: All three of you guys got 14? 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
NOSHIR: 13. 
SAM: One. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
GINA: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Mm. So, it will be Raiden, Rain, Johnny Cage, and Kitana. But once again, Sindel goes first. 
SAM: Ah! 
GINA: Johnny Cage's-- 
TRAVIS: Man! 
GINA: Wait, he rolled a-- 
NOSHIR: About damn time! 
TRAVIS: He's dropping-- 
GINA: Aw, no, that's right. 
SAM: That's on the Rollies. We'll teach you guys Rollies after we're done. 
TRAVIS: Trademark it. Rollies. (laughs) 
SAM: It's almost as complicated as Till The Last Gasp. 
TRAVIS: The one sheet. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Okay. I am once again going to jettison myself after just taking Rain, and bashing him through into this next room. I'm going to turn around in rage at everybody, and-- "(shrieks)" I want to scream to hurt anybody. I'm going to Banshee Yell. 
NOSHIR: (wet explosion) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, (pop pop) 
MARISHA: I was spending three points, all of you lose one action point. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
GINA: Aw! 
NOSHIR: Man, that's-- 
GINA: I needed that. 
TRAVIS: Harsh, bro, harsh. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Raiden, you are up, with Rain on deck. 
TRAVIS: I would like to try something. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to spend four action points. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Two of which I would like to do the strange science lab feature where I describe how you smash something delicate or dangerous, and all other duelists must immediately change their stance, or lose two action points. So, can I use four total, and do that as well? 
MARISHA: Yeah, say that again one more time? 
TRAVIS: I'm going to spend four action points to complete one of my objectives, and two of them will go towards this lab feature. 
MARISHA: "Describe how you smash something delicately, all other duelists--" 
TRAVIS: Because it's just destroying scenery. 
GINA: Oh, okay. 
MARISHA: "Change their stance, or lose two action points." Ooh, damn, okay. Yes, I will change my stance. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to look up at the wall of science lab hamsters that I mentioned before. 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Their eyes bugging out, dark circles, (laughs) the mirrors of shit that no one should ever see. I'll reach up, and I'll shove that wall over, and it will fall into one of the green enormous vials glowing behind it, and as it shatters, the body of what looks like Goro, (wet plops)! (oohing) 
TRAVIS: Spills out on the floor, but as the four arms roll over on its back you see the face of Johnny Cage-- 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: -- on Goro's body! 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: What does it mean? (laughter) 
SAM: What does it mean? 
MARISHA: Sindel quickly braces, trying to shield herself as this green ichor comes flowing out. You also hear, "(screams)" As the soul is also screaming from the vial of whatever creature was trapped in there. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
SAM: Wait, do we all change stance? 
NOSHIR: What the hell was that? 
TRAVIS: I think so. 
GINA: All players have to-- 
TRAVIS: You don't have to, but if you do, you have to spend two action points. 
GINA: Hmm. 
SAM: If you do, you have to spend-- 
TRAVIS: No, if you don't change, you have to spend two action-- 
SAM: Oh, I'm going to change my stance then. Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: There are sex-crazed science lab hamsters now on the loose-- 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: -- in the green goo. 
TRAVIS and NOSHIR: (laugh) 
MARISHA: (squeaks) Rain, Johnny Cage is on deck. 
NOSHIR: Ah. I am going to, so, I've been in a defensive, I've been defensive because I'm still in shock at how powerful Sindel is, but I'm rallying. I'm going to spend two action points to change to the quick state, or the ready stance. I think that's all I can do in this round, right? For-- 
MARISHA: I believe so. 
NOSHIR: That action here. 
MARISHA: Yeah, Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Similarly, I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: Kitana, you're next. 
SAM: -- I'm going to go over to the Goro on the floor, 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: -- and I'm going to study his face, and look up with you with horror in my eyes, and say to you: Sindel, how could you do this? 
GINA: (laughs) 
SAM: You took my likeness without my permission. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You don't have paperwork to cover this. 
SAM: I didn't get any sort of license fee. Or-- 
TRAVIS: I've got proof, I've got proof. 
SAM: This is intellectual property theft. I, if I had an agent, he would be getting a call. In fact, I'm going to text my manager right now, and I'm so angry that I'm going to change my stance from wary to bold. 
MARISHA and GINA: Ooh! 
SAM: You're going to pay for that! 
TRAVIS: I thought we had an agreement, Johnny Cage. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: This is why we have to hold firm on AI. (laughter) 
SAM: This is why we strike! (laughter) 
SAM: All right, next up. 
MARISHA: Kitana. 
GINA: Kitana is taking in everything that she's seeing, she is horrified that there's apparently two Johnny Cages, and she doesn't do anything. I would like to spend two to ready an edge die. One of two. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Horrified or excited? Yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
GINA: Yes. 
MARISHA: All right, back to me, I'm going to spend two action points to land a blow on a foe! As they describe their injury, I see my daughter going into a defensive stance, getting ready to attack as she's starting to prep herself. I immediately want to put an end to that. So, I summon, you can see coming out from seemingly nowhere, a giant spear, as I spin it and ram it through you. I take my hair, and whip it around you, and drag you closer-- 
NOSHIR: Oh! 
GINA: Ugh! 
MARISHA: -- onto the spear before releasing you. 
GINA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: "Learn from mommy, sweetheart." 
GINA: Oh. 
MARISHA: That is my turn. 
GINA: Nothing like a mother's love, as she pulls back. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Raiden, with Rain on deck. 
TRAVIS: Is it me? (sputters) 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's you. 
TRAVIS: I will spend my last three action points to rattle my foe into a reckless stance. I will go over to the Goro body with the Johnny Cage face. 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's so beautiful. Johnny Cage, but with four arms! (groaning and laughter) 
TRAVIS: I lick the Goro face. 
NOSHIR: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Ah... 
TRAVIS: There's just some things this immortal body doesn't get to do that often. 
SAM: Raiden, what? 
MARISHA: Sindel's response is mine, which is just, "Ah!" She is actually rattled. 
NOSHIR: Ah! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I will take it. 
TRAVIS: Objective achieved. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh no! 
GINA: Oh my god. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
TRAVIS: I'm out of action points. (laughs) (claps) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: That would rattle me. 
MARISHA: I think Rain is also rattled-- 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
MARISHA: -- as, but he is on deck. 
NOSHIR: (coughs) I-- 
TRAVIS: Might have to dump all of-- 
GINA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: -- those. 
NOSHIR: I'm so disturbed by what I just saw, I unconsciously take a step back, slip in the Goro slime, and running into everybody, because my staff is in my hand. I and unwittingly, the rest of this crew, I pull everyone into zone four, the archives. (oohing) 
TRAVIS: We're on the moon. 
MARISHA: Okay. Boof. 
SAM: Going in the archives, there is no special thing, oh, there is. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: Okay. 
GINA: Who's closest to getting their objectives? Oh, it looks like you've doing really-- 
TRAVIS: I've got two. 
GINA: What's the last one you need to do? 
NOSHIR: I've got one left, a move. 
GINA: A move? 
NOSHIR: Mm-hmm. 
GINA: Okay. Oh, perfect. What round are we in? 
MARISHA: Second round. 
TRAVIS: Second round. 
GINA: Aw, still? 
MARISHA: Still in the second round. 
GINA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, Rain, that was your action, correct? 
NOSHIR: Yes. 
GINA: At this point-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
GINA: -- I think we need to help Rain as much as possible. 
SAM: All right. 
GINA: Yeah, he's closest. Mine are possible, oh, why does he get the easy ones? (laughs) 
TRAVIS: The easy ones! 
GINA: Look at ours, we're struggling over here. 
MARISHA: Yeah, don't forget, you have your special actions where you can throw support-- 
NOSHIR: Oh. I totally-- 
MARISHA: -- if you want to start helping-- 
TRAVIS: It's true. 
MARISHA: You know, one person get closer and closer. Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Johnny Cage. 
MARISHA: With Kitana on deck. 
GINA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: There's not much I can do to help you. So, instead, I will, it feels like we're doing a lot of talking, and not a lot of fighting here. I will, as we left the last room, I gathered up a bunch of the liquid that had spilled on the floor, and I'm covering my body with it. Because I've seen Raiden and and Rain do all these amazing water moves all night, I want to try one, too. (laughter) 
SAM: So I will land a hit on my foe, and they describe the injury. I'm going to run up, and just shake my body, shake all the wet off of it. 
TRAVIS: The goo? 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: And that's it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Little shake shower? 
MARISHA: Wow, okay. 
SAM: I can do it, too! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Sure, you shake this goo off, but unbeknownst to you it's actually acid! 
SAM and GINA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Boiling acid! 
SAM: Boiling, too?! 
MARISHA: Sure! (laughter) 
MARISHA: How it wouldn't hurt you, I don't know, but it doesn't matter, it's "Mortal Kombat!" 
TRAVIS: Why did I lick it? Why did I like it? (laughter) 
NOSHIR: He's built up a tolerance from all the tanning booths. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's good. 
MARISHA: Yeah, oh my god, yes! 
SAM: I try to do what they did, and form it into a ball, and shoot it out, but I don't have any magic, so it just-- 
MARISHA: It's okay, it's just-- 
SAM: -- splatters. 
GINA: -- just is all dead-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It splatters across Sindel's face, and you see in her perfect complexion, these little pockmarks that start to form as it is burned. 
SAM: Wow. 
MARISHA: You can start to see the inner workings of her facial musculature as her skin starts to sear away, even just little at the corner of her mouth, making it look like a permanent smirk as she looks-- 
SAM: She can't be hurt, she can't be injured, everyone. 
MARISHA and GINA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Gives you a wink. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
MARISHA: Kitana. 
GINA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
GINA: We are in the archives right now? 
MARISHA: Correct. 
GINA: "This is where how you move the duel to an adjacent location by smashing through a wall, opening a trap door, or finding a secret passage. Then pick a foe, rattle them, and have them draw one drama." Okay, yeah, let's-- Yeah, fuck it. I spend two to do that. One, two, that gives me one here. And let's see. I grab my fans, or well, I close my fans. Throw one in the air, turn around, and do a spinning back kick at the fan as it falls down. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
GINA: Sending it flying into your throat, pushing you through a wall, and into, I guess, into the autopsy room. 
MARISHA: You hear a screech, a guttural screech filled with blood. "(screams)," as it forces Sindel into the next room. 
GINA: Then, let's see. It rattles you, or you have to draw one drama. 
MARISHA: Hmm. Hmm. Hmm, damn, I will be rattled. I'm going to go into a defensive rattled stance. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
GINA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Stance. 
SAM: We got her on the ropes. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
SAM: This is it. 
MARISHA: Good round, good round. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ooh, wait. Damn, that actually messes me up. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
GINA: Yes! 
SAM: We knew it would. 
GINA: Yes! 
MARISHA: That messes my shit up. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Damn, okay. 
GINA: In the autopsy room, Kitana walks in, and she sees these dead bodies laying everywhere, and she sees one that she recognizes, and it's her boyfriend, Liu Kang. She looks at Sindel and goes: You told me he ran away! 
MARISHA: Mm. (laughter) 
MARISHA: "My--" 
NOSHIR: This happens to you a lot. 
MARISHA: "My second experiment!" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) An escalation, if you will. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: She was more upset about Fluffy. 
GINA: Yeah! (laughs) 
MARISHA: Man, yeah! (laughs) All right. 
GINA: Liu Kang never finished her. 
NOSHIR: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Oh, snap. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I will spend two to draw a drama, and rattle a foe. 
SAM: How dare you. 
MARISHA: Ah. 
TRAVIS: How dare you. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Okay, I accuse my foe of dishonoring the tournament and themselves. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: So as I'm smashed into the next room, everyone's screaming at me, I turn my focus to you, Raiden. "(sighs) Look at you." 
TRAVIS: Just holding Goro's foot on my face. 
SAM: Gross. 
MARISHA: "The god of thunder, protector of Earthrealm, and here you are, subjected to be just a lowly fanboy of some washed-up action hero!" 
TRAVIS: Don't kink shame. 
MARISHA: "Ugh!" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Everybody's got what they love! (laughter) 
MARISHA: "What have you become?" 
GINA: (laughs) Oh god. Don't yuck my yum! 
SAM: This part of the one-shot: This is canon. (laughter) 
GINA: We get this one, all right? We get this one. 
MARISHA: Okay, that was my turn. Who else has any other action points? 
GINA: I still have two. 
NOSHIR: One point. 
SAM: I just got one. 
MARISHA: Oh, and you are rattled. I have rattled you for doing that-- 
SAM: Nice. 
MARISHA: For kink shaming you. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Thank you. Rattled for kink shame. (laughs) 
SAM: ♪ Bah-doo, bah-doo, bah-doo ♪ 
MARISHA: Who said? 
SAM: We got one, one, two over here. 
TRAVIS: Offensive or protective, did it say? 
MARISHA: It didn't say. So pick one. 
SAM: Who's up next? Rain, is it Rain? After you? 
MARISHA: After me, it was Raiden. Do you have, or are you out of points? 
TRAVIS: I'm out. 
MARISHA: Okay, and then it would be Rain. 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
MARISHA: With Johnny Cage on deck. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
NOSHIR: I can't handle this. I start grabbing every random body part I can find, and throwing it at Raiden, just: Get that foot out of your mouth! 
TRAVIS: Ah, no! 
NOSHIR: Stop it! Stop it! 
NOSHIR: I grab a pile of intestines, I wrap them around his neck. I'm trying to pull him up, I'm like: Let it go, Raiden, let it go! 
TRAVIS: (gagging) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: And that's my round. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Fantastic. Johnny Cage. 
NOSHIR: Destroy scenery. 
SAM: I'm going to destroy scenery with my remaining action point as well. I will announce proudly to the room: Hey everybody, I just got a text from my manager. Apparently, they're doing a sequel to "Zero Dark 30"-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: -- called "Zero Dark 31." And Joel Edgerton is not coming back. They're auditioning for the part. So I take a few moments, and I set up a camera-- 
GINA: Oh my god! 
SAM: -- and a ring light, and a little green screen behind me. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: Just give me a second, I got to do this. I do some action moves. They want to see that I'm a real action star. I do a flying jump kick, and I hit one of the autopsy tables, and it smashes, and the body goes flinging across the floor, and I'm like: Ah, I guess, that's all, I'll do another take later when we're done, but that's all. (laughter) 
SAM: Destroy scenery. 
TRAVIS: You auditioned. 
GINA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: You auditioned. 
NOSHIR: The production value, that's nice. 
MARISHA: And Kitana? 
TRAVIS: He travels with a green screen! 
GINA: Oh god, Kitana is taking everything that she's-- taking in everything that she sees, and she is-- 
TRAVIS and GINA: (laughing) 
GINA: Oh gosh, she's very confused, but she is laying there, holding onto Liu Kang's body, just heartbroken. Looks over at (laughs) Raiden making out with dead-ass Goro. 
TRAVIS: Getting choked by an intestine. 
GINA: (laughs) Getting choked by an intestine. I look at him, and I say: You know what? Love who you love, even if they're dead. 
TRAVIS: Love who you love! 
GINA: I hug Liu Kang. 
TRAVIS: Love who you love! 
GINA: Ready an edge die for two of my last two actions. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Nice. 
GINA: Oh god. 
MARISHA: That brings us into round three. 
SAM: (like announcer) Round three. 
NOSHIR: My goodness. 
MARISHA: That was just round two, right? 
SAM: Yep, let's do this. 
MARISHA: Round three. Here we go. We're ready. 
SAM: Here we go. 
MARISHA: Let's see, I'm going to go back. 
TRAVIS: Not bad, not bad. 
SAM: Not bad at all. 
GINA: I haven't had a good roll all day, please. Thank you. 
MARISHA and NOSHIR: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) At the same time. 
MARISHA: Bad roll from Sindel, you guys. 
SAM: ♪ (hums) ♪ 
TRAVIS: Wow, that's surprising, okay. 
GINA: Oh, it's gain one. 
MARISHA: I might as well roll. Ugh! Weak! All right. 
SAM: Weak! 
GINA: This is round three? 
TRAVIS: (like announcer) Round three. 
MARISHA: Round three. 
TRAVIS: Of the final. Fight! 
GINA: What do you need to do still for your last one? 
NOSHIR: To get my third, I need to move the duel to an adjacent area one more time. 
GINA: How many action points do you have? 
NOSHIR: It looks like I had six, so I got two. 
SAM: Oh, you know what? I can give you one more duel dice. 
NOSHIR: Oh shoot. 
SAM: I'm going to use the noble gambit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, special action. 
NOSHIR: Two. Okay. 
MARISHA: What-- 
NOSHIR: Thanks, Johnny. 
MARISHA: What's our initiative looking like? Anyone above a 15? 
NOSHIR: Oh! 
TRAVIS: 14. 
SAM: I had a 15. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
MARISHA: Okay, so Johnny Cage. 
NOSHIR: Six. 
MARISHA: Raiden. 
GINA: Jesus, I rolled a nine. 
MARISHA: Okay, so it'll be Sindel, Kitana, and then what are you at, Rain? 
NOSHIR: A six. 
MARISHA: Okay. So kicking off this round is Johnny Cage. Sindel is in the middle of this one. 
SAM: Okay. Are you still flying, Sindel? 
MARISHA: What happened? I got tossed into the next room. 
GINA: Into the autopsy room. 
MARISHA: And had acid dog shaked into my face. (laughter) 
MARISHA: So, no, I would say I am on the ground, at this point, as I smear the acid off. 
SAM: I want to have a true "Mortal Kombat" attack. So I'm going to spend a couple action points to land a hit on my foe. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to do an incredible "Mortal Kombat" type attack. Now, what you all see is me moving my hands wildly and then going: Huah! 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: That's it. That's it. But in post, when they're done, they're going to make it look, how are they going to make it look? It says you describe your injury. 
TRAVIS: Is it Final Cut or is this just Movie Maker? 
SAM: The effects wizards are going to do amazing stuff to it. 
MARISHA: Gotcha. There was just one "Mortal Kombat" where they gave Johnny Cage weird, like, chi energy, like energy blasts. As I was telling Rain, the timelines, the multiverses, they all seem to be blurring. So Johnny Cage in this realm can't, but for a second, as you've been flashing in almost different dimensions with your stunt double, old Johnny Cage, different Johnny Cage apparates for a brief second in this flash as Sindel is hit with this weird, bluish chi wave that she was not anticipating. It sends her flying back. Ribs crushed into her lungs. 
SAM: Yes! 
MARISHA: Shrapnel from her bones spiking her lungs, collapsing. 
SAM: Then I'll just, as a cool one-liner, I'll just say: Throw that on your shrimp, Barbie. 
TRAVIS: On your shrimp barbie?! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Wait, that's his Australian? Australian Johnny Cage? Are you trying to do that Wolverine moment? Is that what that is? 
SAM: Yeah, I'm trying to do a cool Australian one line-ah. 
TRAVIS: Australian one line-ah. 
GINA: It was funny already, but Travis' laugh makes it way more funny, too! (laughter) 
GINA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
SAM: There you go. 
MARISHA: Raiden, then Sindel on deck. 
TRAVIS: Inspired by that attack, I will spend two action points to land a hit on my foe. They describe the injury, but the light's still flashing from Johnny Cage's earlier thing, the stop motion. I turn, my hair wet, and it moves slowly as you hear the theme song from CW's "Smallville." ♪ Somebody save me ♪ I reach down, hands crackling with blue energy as I look into the eyes of my love, Johnny Cage Goro, and I external defibrillator, baboom! Once. Baboom! Twice. Boom, on the third time, Goro stands up, and he runs across and punches you dead in the face. 
MARISHA: What the hell?! 
SAM: Goro lives! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You describe the injury. 
SAM: Amazing. 
MARISHA: I am facing towards Johnny Cage, so my back is completely turned towards Raiden and Goro as I have no idea what's going on. I'm essentially sucker punched from behind with his giant body. 
TRAVIS: (growling noises) (punches) 
MARISHA: It sends basically a classic "Mortal Kombat" uppercut as it sends Sindel flying and landing flat on her ass. 
TRAVIS: That's what love does. 
MARISHA: You all also notice that as these lightning bursts from Raiden are emanating, it sends off these shocks of ball lightning that have started bouncing across the room. Some of them have hit the giant canister that Shang Tsung is in. You see little hairline cracks start to form. 
GINA and TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: Shang Tsung. What did I say? Did I say that wrong? Shang Tsung. Backward Shang Tsung. Okay, Sindel, being extremely pissed off at this. Okay. 
TRAVIS: I don't know, you guys. I just don't know. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I'm going to spend two points to land a hit. I know I've hit the three. I don't think I've landed a hit on you yet. (laughs) Infuriated by this heinous act, as she was already scorning you for being an embarrassment on the tournament. You essentially bend the rules with your god lightning power. She turns to you and she screams. As she does, this purple wave courses from her mouth and smacks you. You get to describe your injury. 
TRAVIS: (groans) As the wave hits me, Raiden covered with green goop, but eyes full of love as Goro just charged off bravely. The hair starts peeling back on my head. Blowing all of the hair from the roots. Raiden goes completely bald. Eyebrows completely gone, and sits there. It even blows his nipples off. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: No hair, no nipples. He's like (groans). 
SAM: Oh god. 
TRAVIS: You'll pay for this, Sindel. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Amazing, and actually pretty accurate. 
GINA: I just want to say: This is my first time at Critical Role, and I fucking love it here. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Welcome, we're so glad to have you. 
TRAVIS: It's broken here. (laughter) 
GINA: I've seen a man's nipples get blown off. Just wild, you guys. 
MARISHA: With that, Kitana, you are up, with Rain on deck. 
GINA: What the fuck? Okay. Kitana notices Sindel every so often looking over at the tube that Shang Tsung is floating in and realizes that there is something with that tube about Shang Tsung that has her very concerned. So I would like to spend one point to destroy scenery, and Kitana runs over, jumps up, and starts stabbing at the glass. (stabbing) Just breaking it apart to the point it shatters, and Shang Tsung's body comes falling out. Liquid pouring everywhere. 
TRAVIS: Oh snap. Oh snap. 
GINA: I don't know what that does, but yeah, we're going to figure it out from there. It does something. 
MARISHA: You see Sindel snap her head and she goes, "No! What have you done?!" As she screams, another shock wave emanating to you as your hair is burst back. 
TRAVIS: And nipples also. (laughter) 
GINA: Damn it! 
TRAVIS: No nipples is-- 
GINA: Oh, and then Kitana goes: Oh. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You'll pay for this. 
MARISHA: All right, Rain, with Johnny Cage on deck at the top of the round. 
SAM: Okay, good to know. 
NOSHIR: I look down at the body of Shang Tsung, and we've seen Sindel revive bodies before. I give her a look. Not this time. I grab the body, and I smash it through the wall of the autopsy room. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
NOSHIR: And drive it back down into the laboratory floor. 
MARISHA: (thuds) His lifeless body ragdolls and plops into the laboratory floor. 
SAM: Are you moving us to? 
NOSHIR: Yes. 
MARISHA: You're moving all of us? 
NOSHIR: Mm-hmm. 
GINA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Sindel goes chasing after you. Very concerned. All right, Rain. Or sorry, Johnny Cage. 
SAM: Johnny Cage, before we leave, sees his own face on the living body of Goro. I'm going to use some action points to, it says I can compel someone to draw a drama card. I'm going to compel Goro to draw a drama card because I'm going to ask Goro: Hey, I don't normally do this, but there's something about your face that's really appealing to me. 
GINA: Oh my god! (laughter) 
SAM: I've had this script that I wrote. It's a sequel to "When Harry Met Sally," and I've been looking for a co-star. I think we could call it "When Johnny Met Goro." What do you think? 
TRAVIS: I hate it here. (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's a perfect drama card for this moment. Since Travis revived Goro, I'm going to make him play Goro, because this'll be funnier if he responds. 
TRAVIS: Describe the story that shall be told about the bout you're fighting now. 
SAM: The story shall be told. 
TRAVIS: (deep groan) I woke up and fought for love, but the idea of starring with you in a movie is more than my simple heart could wish for. Give me a hug. (laughter) 
SAM: Bring it in, me. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Oh yeah, that's good stuff. 
SAM: We'll get you a dialect coach for the movie because you got to work on your diction a little bit. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Okay. (regular voice) I turn to face Sindel idle pose. 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughter) 
GINA: You sound like sugar water. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Sugar and water. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Like this? 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Raiden-- 
GINA: That is hilarious. 
MARISHA: Hilariously, you are up. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm next? Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: I look across the room, see this betrayal of my love. 
GINA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Wait a minute, I can bitter battle. Do I have enough? I have three action points! I pick up one of the hamsters trying to escape, and I throw across the room trying to strike Johnny Cage in the face. I will land a hit on the combatant other than the boss. They earn an action point and must give you a readied edge die of their choice from the board. 
SAM: Oh. I don't have any readied edge dice. 
GINA: Uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
MARISHA: Oh, are you empty? Ooh! 
SAM: I'm empty. 
TRAVIS: That's okay. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: I throw the hamster and it just misses. (laughter) 
SAM: Then nothing happens. 
TRAVIS: That's what I get for opening up myself to love. 
SAM: I'm just in the embrace with Goro, and this thing flies by. We don't even notice it. (laughter) 
SAM: What, did you hear something, Goro? 
TRAVIS: Just chucking hamsters. Science lab hamsters. 
MARISHA: It smacks against the wall on the other side and explodes like a bug hitting a windshield. 
TRAVIS: I wasted three actions points for that. 
SAM: Worth it. Worth it. 
MARISHA: Fantastic. 
NOSHIR: Oh... 
MARISHA: I am going-- I am up next-- 
TRAVIS: My head hurts. 
MARISHA: -- with Kitana on deck. We are in this laboratory. 
GINA: Laboratory, Dee Dee. 
MARISHA: I am chasing after Shang Tsung's body as Rain is basically absconding with it. I take and I scream as I dash towards you, levitating through the air. I grab your head and smash it through the wall. Grabbing Shang Tsung from your grip as we collide into the next room, destroying scenery in this area and moving us back to the strange science lab, now with Shang Tsung in my grasp. I am out of action points for this round. 
TRAVIS: Oh snap. Same here. 
MARISHA: All right, Kitana, who has action points left? 
GINA: I have two. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: I do, I do. I have three, but I think I'll just burn them all-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: -- destroying scenery or something. 
MARISHA: Sure. 
GINA: With my last two. 
SAM: Wait, so is Shang Tsung fighting with you? Is he alive? 
MARISHA: No, he's unconscious. He does not-- He's not awake, at least at this moment. 
SAM: So wait, do you have any action? You do have action points. 
NOSHIR: I do. 
GINA: Am I next? 
SAM: I think Rain's-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: Oh, you are. 
GINA: With my last two action points, I expend that to... Kitana is very uncomfortable with the scene that's unfolded in front of her with this dude making out with another dude, I think. I'm not sure. A hamster just flew by. She doesn't want to see this right now and disrupts everything. She takes her fan, closes it, runs towards Sindel, and shoves the fan in Sindel's hair and whirls it around her fan. Yanks her and throws her through the wall into the next room. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
GINA: Back into the archives and follows her. Jumps into the room. 
MARISHA: Her hair being a prized possession, she takes this very unkindly. She screams and her body is flung into the next room. Rain, do you have any points left? 
NOSHIR: I do. 
MARISHA: All right. 
NOSHIR: As I chase after Sindel and Kitana, and I'm assuming the body of Shang Tsung is still in play there, I go from speed to power and change over to the bold offensive stance. 
MARISHA: Nice. Johnny Cage, do you have any points? 
SAM: I'm going to burn my points destroying the scenery. We're in the archives? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: I'm going to tear through all of your magazine collection. 
TRAVIS: No. 
SAM: Seeing if there was an old back issue from-- 
MARISHA: Teen Beat? 
SAM: Tiger Beat Magazine. 
MARISHA: No, Tiger Beat. Yeah. (laughs) 
SAM: I was in one issue a long time ago. I've been trying to get a copy, but they're expensive on eBay, so. 
MARISHA: You and Will Friedel? 
TRAVIS: Van Damme in Lionheart? 
SAM: Yep. I find it. End of turn. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Are we all out of points? 
SAM: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Out of points. 
NOSHIR: I've got two points left. 
MARISHA: Oh, you have two points left? 
TRAVIS: Hit it. 
MARISHA: Too soon. 
NOSHIR: All right. So as I close distance, I don't know why I've got a horrible feeling about what happens if Shang Tsung is this important to Sindel. So I grab her hair, whirl her around, and try to slam her into the wall in the hopes that it breaks her hold on the body of Shang Tsung. 
MARISHA: Okay. It does indeed. As she's already been whipped from one location to the other by her daughter, she loses grip as she is flung across the room. You can see her neck snap, probably breaking a few vertebrae in the process as she collapses. She's looking rough. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
NOSHIR: I'll take it. 
SAM: Is the next round round four? 
MARISHA: It is. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: It is. 
TRAVIS: We have a cue? 
MARISHA: We're about to do it right now. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
ANNOUNCER: Final round. Fight! 
MARISHA: Final round. This is it, you guys. 
SAM: This is it. 
MARISHA: Shit, shit, shit. 
MARISHA: Oh, you guys. You're so fucking lucky. 
GINA: Ah, I wanted to give you this one. 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
TRAVIS: The lucky blue? 
GINA: Yeah. 
NOSHIR: Oh, I love it. 
MARISHA: Another bad roll for me. 
NOSHIR: Okay. 
MARISHA: Because I'm very close here. 
SAM: ♪ (smooth jazzy scatting) ♪ 
NOSHIR: Awesome. I'll take the 12. 
GINA: Yeah? Okay. 
NOSHIR: Thank you. 
GINA: A seven. Then-- 
MARISHA: Let's see. I'm going to switch stances here. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I can't. Okay. This last one. All or nothing, baby. 
SAM: All or nothing. 
MARISHA: Let's see. 
SAM: ♪ (smooth jazzy scatting) ♪ 
MARISHA: This, let me add some more. Might as well spend them all. 
GINA: Yep. 
SAM: ♪ (smooth jazzy scatting) ♪ 
GINA: Yeah, everyone's fourth round. 
SAM: This is it. Lay your cards on the table. 
NOSHIR: This is it. 
TRAVIS: That was all I needed. 
SAM: Mortal Kombat! 
TRAVIS: ♪ (Mortal Kombat theme) ♪ Test your might. 
MARISHA: All right. Where are we at in the initiative order? 
SAM: Sub-Zero. 
SAM and TRAVIS: Scorpion. 
SAM: Liu Kang. 
NOSHIR: I got 12. 
SAM: I got a nine. 
TRAVIS: 10. 
GINA: I got a seven. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: This might be over quick, you guys. 
TRAVIS: Who's the top one? 
MARISHA: Me. 
GINA: (groans) 
NOSHIR: Son of a bitch. 
GINA: Oh! Come on. 
MARISHA: You said 12? You said 11? 
SAM: 12 for Rain. 
TRAVIS: 12, 10, nine. 
MARISHA: Rain. 
GINA: Seven. 
SAM: ♪ (scatting background music) ♪ 
TRAVIS: Rain, Raiden, Johnny Cage, Kitana. 
GINA: And Goro, question mark. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Rain, Raiden, and somewhere Goro is in there. 
TRAVIS: This is going to be my coming out project. 
GINA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm going to man myself in all the trades. 
MARISHA: Okay. What to do here? 
TRAVIS: Definitely going to earn a nom. 
GINA: (laughs) 
SAM: If he gets an award before me... (laughter) 
SAM: I'm going to be super pissed. 
TRAVIS: It's just an honor to be nominated. 
NOSHIR: That friendship ended fast. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
MARISHA: Once again, due to her frustration, and she's feeling like she's on her back foot, she lets out another Banshee Scream. You each can feel the inside of your eardrums pop. 
GINA: Oh! 
MARISHA: As your skin starts to burn as if a windburn is shearing off the epidermis of your body. You each lose one action point. 
SAM: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: No. 
SAM: I can't finish it. Damn it. 
MARISHA: Rain. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
SAM: But he can. 
NOSHIR: This ends now. I pull a ball of water into the air and channel it with lightning, and then I tell my friends I'm going to need your help. Anything you want to add to this, go for it. (laughs) 
SAM: I'm coming in. 
TRAVIS: I also start crackling. (lightning crackling) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
GINA: I throw my fans into your ball of lightning, and it's swirling in there. It's just a ball of lightning and blades flying. 
NOSHIR: Nice. I love it. 
SAM: I don't have any powers. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Get your little stun gun out. (brief crackles) 
SAM: You know what I do? I put my phone on silent. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Just because this moment's too good? 
SAM: It's just too important. 
NOSHIR: Wow. That's a huge move for you. 
TRAVIS: Stop streaming. 
NOSHIR: I'm flattered. 
SAM: I didn't turn it off. It's just on silent. 
NOSHIR: Oh, okay. I'll take it. I'll take the win. I'll take the win. 
SAM: Do not disturb. One hour. 
NOSHIR: Rain takes this ball of lightning and water and blades and flattens it into a disc and hurls it at Sindel's head. 
MARISHA: Okay. You can see she's already up against the wall, already low, as all of these blades and the rain and your frozen ice knives smash her up against the wall. One hits her directly in the forehead, one in her shoulder, another several in her abdomen as she is pinned. 
SAM: Then, a pair of sunglasses just come. (laughter) 
SAM: (tiny tinks) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Already humiliated, she gets Ray-Bans thrown into her face. "(grunts)" As you see the one that hit her directly into her temple went right through her eye socket, as you can see blood and goo and organ dripping out of her eye socket, more blood trickling out of her nose. But she is still alive. 
TRAVIS: What? 
MARISHA: As she looks at you, incapacitated. 
ANNOUNCER: Finish her. 
GINA: Oh. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
GINA: Ooh. 
SAM: Do we finish her? 
TRAVIS: Well, yeah. 
NOSHIR: I think so. 
SAM: I already did my thing. I threw my sunglasses. 
GINA: (laughs) Do you have an extra headshot you can fling at her maybe? 
SAM: I'll start working on it while you guys do what you do. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
GINA: Here you go, bud. Oh, you already-- 
SAM: I got extras. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: You keep going. 
TRAVIS: I'll walk up all pinned up, and I'll look at Rain, and I'll charge a lot of lightning crackles up towards my fist and do the classic first "Mortal Kombat" uppercut. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
GINA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Just go (lightning crackles). The bolt of lightning arcs through the bottom of her chin out the top of her head, but the latent electricity leaves her alive. 
GINA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yes. Amazing. As you uppercut her, every place that she was pinned, it doesn't hold her in place due to the sheer force of your uppercut. So instead, it slices her body with each pierce. So at this point, it looks like she is shredded, like she has gone through a paper shredder, completely disemboweled as she is standing there dazed. 
GINA: As she gets uppercutted, on her way down, Kitana's fan flies back into her hand. Kitana runs up and, on her way down, Kitana uppercuts a fan right into her mouth as she lands, mouth open, into her fan. 
NOSHIR: Oh. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
GINA: Then she opens up her fan and all the blades slice her cheeks open like her sister. 
MARISHA: Incredible, almost reminiscent to your twin sister. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: Her jaw is completely ripped from the top of her skull, as she has this fan that almost gives her that cheeky Sindel smirk. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Range on occasion, final blows. 
SAM: I'm going to run up, toss a signed thing on her body, and I'll do a classic splits, nut punch. (laughter) 
SAM: That's my move. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
SAM: That's all I can do. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Your knuckles collide, but she's already been shredded, so you hit a fleshy, sinewy ooze. 
NOSHIR: Oh god. Oh god, this nightmare has to end. Rain grabs Kitana's fan, electrifies it, and then drags it from her mouth straight through, bisecting her, and drives it into the floor. 
MARISHA: Fantastic, super Mortal Kombat, literally from top to bottom, Sindel is spliced, and once again, she stands, what corporeal form she has left, after a pause, she splits like a tree trunk being struck by lightning. 
TRAVIS: Oh, nice. 
SAM: Beautiful. 
MARISHA: As she peels, both halves of her body sloughing down to the floor. 
NOSHIR: Oof. 
ANNOUNCER: Fatality. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Sindel has been defeated. Congratulations. You all have just won Mortal Kombat. 
SAM: Oh yeah! 
GINA: (laughs) 
NOSHIR: (whoops) 
MARISHA: Is there anything else you would like to do? You can start to feel that similar feeling that you have all felt before as you have participated in this, a little bit of that crackling energy where you know you are about to be teleported back to your realm. 
SAM: I'm going to try to reach around and find my sunglasses. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Okay. 
SAM: They're $500. 
MARISHA: They're $500. They are dripping with blood and goo, but they're good. 
TRAVIS: You got those at a Phillips 76. Don't trip. 
SAM: Guys, we put on a good show tonight. I know that this wasn't for the money. There were no cameras. No one will see this. But sometimes it's good to get back to your roots and do something just for the craft. Thanks for making me realize that, Rain. I think I'm ready to be an actor again. 
NOSHIR: (laughs) I wish you all the best. 
SAM: Yeah. 
NOSHIR: As I turn away, I try to wipe a tear slowly from my eye, slowly tucking in my autograph. (laughter) 
NOSHIR: Into my tunic so that it can stay close to my heart always. 
GINA: Wait, did you say that we get teleported home? 
MARISHA: Yes, you're about to get bamfed back to your realm. 
GINA: Kitana looks at everyone and says: Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure. Teleports home. She is relaxed. She's on her couch. Ah, I never get to see my mother again. Thank god. Flips on the TV, ready to relax, and all of a sudden, you hear, "Have you been wrongfully hurt at a workplace?" Johnny Cage pops up on her screen. (laughter) 
GINA: With a cheesy smile. 
MARISHA: Oh shit, he's doing-- 
SAM: I'm Goro Cage. 
MARISHA: He's doing regionals now. 
GINA: Kitana goes (groans) and lays back in her couch. (giggles) 
TRAVIS: Raiden walks over to Rain and extends a hand. The pantheon has room for another day more. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: As they shake, it's the ultimate "Predator" handshake. (lightning crackling) 
MARISHA and GINA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: With that crackling of godlike energy between our god of thunder and our god of rain, the lightning creeps up along your forearms as you both dissipate and bamf back to your home realm. What you all miss, though, now alone in this empty chamber in this laboratory, the body of Shang Tsung twitches. 
GINA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: As the souls from Sindel are pulled from her corpse. (intense whoosh) And are sucked back into the sorcerer. He stands, walks over to her demolished corpse, and flicks a piece of soul energy back into her as he says, "There is work to be done. You're not done yet." And that is where we are going to end this episode. 
NOSHIR: Son of a... (applause) 
MARISHA: This very special Mortal Kombat one-shot. 
SAM: Good job, Marisha! 
MARISHA: Thank you guys so much. I have never heard so many good, campy, cheesy one-liners in a one-shot in my life. 
TRAVIS: That was great. 
MARISHA: You all understood the assignment to a T and just-- 
TRAVIS: I want those fanfics. 
MARISHA: 100%, and just a final reminder that although our one-shot tonight took place in Outworld and used characters from the newly released "Mortal Kombat 1". It looks really good, you guys. Go check it out. The interpretations of those characters in the story were not our own creations. 
SAM: Were our own creations. 
TRAVIS: They were. 
MARISHA: Oh sorry, sorry, yes. You're right. The interpretations of these characters here are our creations, not the creations of the "Mortal Kombat" series. It has nothing to do with the official storyline, but I would like to thank you again. 
TRAVIS: Just a little bit. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: We diverged. 
MARISHA: (laughs) I would like to thank you again to Warner Bros. Games for letting us play around in their super fun universe, and of course for sponsoring this one-shot. Certainly not least, I would like to thank all of our amazing players. 
ALL: Yay. 
MARISHA: Specifically our two guests, Gina and Noshir. 
ALL: Yay! (clapping) 
MARISHA: That was so fun, you guys. 
NOSHIR: Thank you for having us! 
MARISHA: You guys crushed it. Is there anything you guys want to tell the people where to find you guys? 
SAM: Plugs, plugs. 
TRAVIS: Social plugs. 
MARISHA: Social plugs or? 
NOSHIR: You'll see me as Rain in "Mortal Kombat," so. 
MARISHA: Yes, you will. Yes, you will. 
GINA: So awesome. 
MARISHA: Thank you for lending your voice here as well. 
NOSHIR: So much fun. So much fun. 
MARISHA: Awesome. Gina? 
GINA: You can find me on all socials @missginadarling, M-I-S-S-G-I-N-A Darling. I stream four or five times a week. 
SAM: Whoa. 
GINA: I would like to say that this has been equally exciting, fun, and horrifying. (laughter) 
GINA: And I can't wait to be back. (laughs) 
MARISHA: You both will have to join us again very soon. 
NOSHIR: Hear, hear. 
MARISHA: Thank you so much. And of course, thank you to our residents, Sam and Travis. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Yeah, no bigs. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, that's great. 
MARISHA: Thank you all so much. Thanks for tuning in. And... is it fatality time yet? 
NOSHIR: (laughs) 
SAM: Rolls off the tongue. 
TRAVIS: Babe-ality. 
MARISHA: Babe-ality. Mortal Kombat! (shouting)
