TRAVIS: Hey! (cheering) 
MATT: Now I get the costumes. Ready to ruffle some feathers? Introducing "Oh My Pigeons!" your new favorite, ridiculous party of game of fowl play. Ba-dum chhh. Gather your flock of up to five players and let your feathers fly in this wacky, silly game where the goal is to fill your bench with pigeons before anybody else. So whether you're a pigeon enthusiast, admirer, or just love a fun game night with your friends. "Oh My Pigeons!" is perfect for you. Learning the rules is so easy. Might as well wing it. Cards like, Is This a Pigeon? Or: Let's Get Bread! Or even, Biblically Accurate Pigeon. 
SAM: What does that mean? 
ROBBIE: Wait a minute! 
SAM: What does that mean? 
MARISHA: Wait, I want to play this now. 
TRAVIS: It's in the biblical sense. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: In the biblical sense. 
LAURA: It's a pigeon with a lot of wings and a whole bunch of eyes. 
MATT: No, no. It's a nightmare. These things keep the fun going. But "Oh My Pigeons!" is available now exclusively on Amazon. You can visit Rav-- rav.wiki/CriticalPigeon, for more info, and thank you, Ravensburger for sponsoring this episode. (pigeon cooing) 
SAM: Ooh, nice! 
TRAVIS: Oh My Pigeons! 
MATT: This is terrifying. Hey, Marisha, you're up. 
TRAVIS: You've got to do it like this now. Dumbass. 
MARISHA: The session zero for our-- Jeez Louise, I didn't want to-- Okay. The session zero for our Daggerheart Critmas story live show--

TRAVIS: It's across the river. 
MARISHA: It's basically Philly. Tickets are still available and VIPs can contribute suggestions that could affect the story and game ahead of the main show.

ASHLEY: I'll take you up. 
MARISHA: We'll be back the following Thursday on December 5th for our next episode. 
SAM: I feel like by the time we're done plugging our live show, the mayor of Camden, New Jersey is going to come to us and be like, "We're changing the name of the town to Philadelphia." (laughter) 
SAM: It's just basically Philly. 
ASHLEY: I'm sure that's what will happen. 
MATT: We're not going to show up to have the arena closed. Liam, you have an announcement.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So last we left off, after an interlude following the legendary troop known as Vox Machina as they were one of the groups helming the assault on the Malleus Key, they managed to destroy the Key and free the arcane lock that kept Ruidus essentially glued in orbit to Exandria, and possibly tearing apart the very fabric of magic in the world, as well as freeing their ghost of a long lost ally, Vax'ildan, and in the wake of that battle, given an evening reprieve on what could be possibly the last evening on Exandria for some or all. But while they were gone and dealing with this assault, back on Ruidus, the two troops, Mighty Nein and Bells Hells, have been lying in wait after notifying that they were in place and the assault was to begin. So going a little bit back in time to their perspective, we return to moments after they had given the order to begin the assault where they now wait for word back that the distraction has begun and they can begin their business. So here, underneath the surface of the red moon Ruidus in the subterranean half of the capital city of Kreviris, of Vaterra Kreviris, the massive, winding city of strange, twisted, rock-carved streets, the city that now seems partially abandoned by the populace that is preparing for a relocation to Exandria at the promise of the Weave Mind, to see a new life ahead. Many have left already and currently walk as a massive caravan to the Bloody Bridge, that may not await them when they arrive, while others are still gathering their final supplies here, civilians still cluttering the streets heading towards the exits towards the surface to join the rest of the populace, where other stragglers might still remain to keep their homes here. Bells Hells and Mighty Nein, you have been keeping low after making contact with Gaz Tomo, a member of the Volition. Those that still remain are apparently plotting an attack on the Arx Creonum, the massive citadel stronghold that is the home to the Weave Mind affixed along the Prime Pillar of glass built out of the ancient remnants of Predathos' original form. Here, laying low in this bi-side chamber, you have some time to prepare, discuss, and plot before you are given the go-ahead from Allura that the assault has engaged below, and you are free to pursue your individual options. So here as you lie in wait, what would you like to do? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) All right, pull your dicks out. It's time to rock. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: (Braius) Is this some ritual you guys do before battle? 
TRAVIS: Absolutely, 100%. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Yes. Pull it out, Braius. Pull it out. 
TRAVIS: You can only be fearless if you're just-- 
SAM: A lot of armor. 
TRAVIS: -- baring it all, right? 
ASHLEY: Got to bare it all. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, plus it's very off-putting-- 
LIAM: Caleb cranes his neck. 
TRAVIS: -- to the enemy if your dick is out. 
SAM: So it's just our dicks? 
TRAVIS: I mean, dealer's choice. (laughter) 
LAURA: (Jester) Well, go ahead, Fjord! 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Everyone has seen my titties, so. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) I think he was speaking for himself. I mean, I think it's an individual choice of representation. My nipples are actually quite bare. 
LAURA: So are his. 
TRAVIS: You paid for this so you get to hold the chest. 
ROBBIE: (Dorian) My pants don't really, they don't have a fly, it's more of a button-up situation. 
SAM: An up and down? 
ROBBIE: It would be, yeah. 
LIAM: (Caleb) The pants are pretty tight as well. We get the idea. 
ASHLEY: -- how your nips aren't cutting your shirt. 
TRAVIS: She custom ordered this so it's got silk on the inside. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS: It's actually very chilly. 
LAURA: Yeah, he says his nipples get chafed really easily, so I had to give him a sensitive material. 
ASHLEY: A nice silky-- 
TRAVIS: Mithral's nice. You can get a really nice soft layer of mithral. 
MARISHA: (Beau) It's all that saltwater air, you know? I mean, it's probably a rough environment. 
ASHLEY: Really keeps those calluses on those nips. 
LAURA: Yeah. He wears them down very quickly. 
ROBBIE: Are Fjord's nips visible through his shirt, yes or no? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Yes! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: He's constantly just-- (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Pushing them back! (laughter) 
LIAM: Little band aids with sailor ships. (laughter) 
MATT: Little anchor symbols. 
LAURA: Yes, awesome. 
ROBBIE: Classy. 
MARISHA: Little anchor pasties. 
TRAVIS: He's got one pierced. He's got one pierced, but it's in the shape of a dick-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: -- from when Jester did it in his sleep. Ow! Jester! 
LAURA: Sorry! 
ASHLEY: I thought it would look so cute! 
TALIESIN: It's a dick on the left and two little bells on the right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Perfect. 
LAURA: So what do we know about the Weave Mind exactly? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) They're super powerful. There's four of them, or five of them. There's a handful. 
LAURA: (Imogen) I think five, Chet, actually. 
TRAVIS: Five? 
LAURA: Five, yeah. 
LIAM: (Orym) Yeah, it's five. 
TRAVIS: We don't have to give them all the details. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) We would really prefer if you did, though. That'd be great. 
TRAVIS: All right, there's five. They're super powerful. They float. They seem to be telepathically connected. 
ASHLEY: A lot of mental shit. 
LIAM: They appeared around us the last time we encountered them, and then they vanished just as easily as they had arrived. 
MARISHA: Were they illusions? 
LIAM: (heavy exhale) 
LAURA: Well, they weren't exactly illusions, because they could cast. 
MARISHA: Huh. 
LAURA: They could project themselves, basically. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
TALIESIN: You think it's just a connection to each other, or do you think they're somehow, I don't know, connected to the moon itself? Something in it, something around it? 
TRAVIS: Unclear. 
LAURA: That's a good question. 
TRAVIS: Although, Ludinus has been using the snow cone version of himself. The simu-sacrum. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Simulacrum. 
ASHLEY: Simulacrum? 
TALIESIN: Oh, all right. 
TRAVIS: That one, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds different with your accent. 
TRAVIS: We haven't gotten too much actual face to face time. They saw us, thought about engaging us, thought better of it, and then shook a bunch of shit and fled. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) "Thought better of it" is code for "Better shit to do." 
MARISHA: They had better shit to do. 
TALIESIN: Than us? Fuck yeah. 
SAM: Weren't they behind some glass or something, you said, or no? 
LAURA: No, they were in the citadel. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: The leaders of this assault thought that you were the right team for this. You've had experience with-- 
LAURA: (Jester) Oh yeah, we've dealt with a lot of psychic things attacking us before. 
ROBBIE: That's good, that's good. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yeah, it's always gone really well for me especially, with-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: We've got you. 
LAURA: Poor Yasha! 
ASHLEY: It's a joke, I know. 
LAURA: She's been controlled so many times. 
ASHLEY: So many times, I end up fighting everybody. 
LIAM: We have you taken care of this time. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: It's not going to be a problem. 
SAM: (Veth) Are you taken care of, also? 
LIAM: Ja. 
SAM: Okay, because I have a thing that I can do to one or two people, to protect. 
LAURA: Oh, really? 
ASHLEY: What is that? 
SAM: It's a lighter version of what Caleb-- 
LIAM: What kind of duration are we talking about? 
SAM: An hour. 
LIAM: Oh, all right. 
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. You should do that before we go in. 
SAM: I'll do it to me, but if someone else-- 
LAURA: I mean, I'll take it, if nobody else will. 
TALIESIN: What does it do? What kind of-- 
SAM: It protects you against psychic things, psychic damage and stuff. 
TALIESIN: Actually, if you got one for me, I really, my greatest fear is accidentally punching at least three of these people. You, I would love to. But yeah, just-- 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Who, me? (Chetney) Or me? 
TALIESIN: You! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Motherfucker, I don't even know you! No one's asking. 
LAURA: (Imogen) That's true. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) I think you should definitely get protection. He has a-- 
LAURA: (Imogen) Ashton is a bit of a brawler, you know? He could do some damage. 
TALIESIN: I've got a hole in my head? What the fuck, man? 
LAURA: They could do some damage, if they go against us. 
ASHLEY: He would not. 
SAM: Oh, I thought Caduceus was talking to me just then. 
TALIESIN: Is this actually, what really? Okay, fine. (laughter) 
SAM: Sorry, you're Ashton. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) No, I get how we could sound alike, though. That's very fair. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Caduceus took up surfing while-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: But wait-- 
TRAVIS: He's wearing Vans. 
SAM: But Ashton, you're not going-- Wait, you are going to the Weave Mind. Who's going to the Weave Mind? 
LIAM: We are going to the Weave Mind. 
TRAVIS: The Mighty Nein. 
SAM: Right, so we should be protected from psychic stuff. 
ASHLEY: Are you okay? 
SAM: Yes, I'm fine. Why? 
ASHLEY: What are you everybody confused for, Nott? 
SAM: I'm sorry. 
MARISHA: Have you been hitting the flask? 
LAURA: (Imogen) Actually-- 
SAM: Of course! 
LAURA: Veth. 
MARISHA: Can I get some? 
SAM: Yes? 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: Thank you. 
LAURA: I think almost all of the Reilorans can do psychic damage as well. Anywhere we go here on Ruidus, we're going to be running into psychic. 
LIAM: (Orym) The Weave Mind is the tippy-top. They run the show here. The only thing higher is Predathos. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Which is who we're going after. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Right. 
TRAVIS: Because they trust us more. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Yeah, we got chosen with the final boss. 
LIAM: (Caleb) What about you, Bells Hells? Have you all amongst yourselves agreed on a plan of action once you confront Predathos? (Orym) Well, that's an interesting thing. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) We're more goal-oriented rather than plan-oriented. Plans go wrong. 
ASHLEY: We have a plan! 
SAM: (Braius) We're going to kill-- 
ASHLEY: We have a plan. 
SAM: Kill Ludinus. 
LAURA: Yeah, definitely kill Ludinus. 
TALIESIN: I'm big on that. 
SAM: Do something with Predathos. 
LIAM: (Caleb) I would appreciate it. 
LAURA: We're either going to set Predathos free-- 
SAM: Mm-mm. (no) 
LAURA: -- or we're going to try to channel Predathos-- 
ASHLEY: Suck him in. 
LAURA: -- into ourselves. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) I wouldn't. Yeah, I wouldn't-- 
LAURA: Or we're going to try to kill Predathos. It's one of those three. 
TRAVIS: It's hard to really say until you get eyes on the situation, and then the plan starts to formulate. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: What can you tell us about the setting free scenario? 
TALIESIN: That seems like a terrible idea. 
LAURA: Have you ever talked to the gods? 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ROBBIE: We're more of an improv troupe. We really go with the flow-- 
ASHLEY: Yes ands. 
ROBBIE: -- once we understand what the given circumstances are. 
SAM: Can we get a one-word suggestion? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Some of us have talked to the gods, yes. 
LAURA: (Jester) Yeah, I talk to gods every single day. 
LIAM: Would you like an improv prompt? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: Caduceus is very-- 
LAURA: Oh, that's right. 
TALIESIN: You've certainly had a lot of-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah! 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) I've spoken with the Stormlord. 
TALIESIN: Exactly. 
LAURA: And Fjord has talked to the Wildmother. 
TRAVIS: I mean, actually helped me turn my entire life around. I credit the Wildmother with a lot. I don't know what I would do if she wasn't here. 
LIAM: (Orym) She's been looking in on us, too, unofficially. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Wait, so where do you all stand, Mighty Nein, on what to do with the gods? 
TRAVIS: What do you mean? 
TALIESIN: I don't understand. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Do you like them? Should they stay in Exandria or should, you know, they be gone? 
ASHLEY: Because that's kind of-- 
LIAM: Do we have a choice in the matter? 
ASHLEY: -- what we're going there for. 
ROBBIE: I'm not 100% sure they're fully informed on the stakes here. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I think I've just realized this in this moment. 
SAM: (Veth) From what I've been understanding from you, there's some gray area debate about what to do with the gods and whether they're worth it or not. The Mighty Nein, our story is a simpler one with much less gray area. We were all pretty pro-god. 
MARISHA: Were we? 
SAM: Well, I mean, it helped our friends. 
TRAVIS: Sure did. 
MARISHA: I mean, I guess. 
LAURA: So you think they should stay? 
TRAVIS: Well, I mean-- 
SAM: It's the way it's always been. 
TRAVIS: Positive change for us, for you. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) The Stormlord saved my life. 
TALIESIN: I'm a cleric of the Wildmother. I've spent my entire life in service. 
ASHLEY: Of course. 
TALIESIN: And the Arch Heart as well. My family goes back to followers of the Matron. We're generations. 
MARISHA: And the Cobalt-- 
LAURA: I show Caduceus my ring. This is from the Arch Heart. 
TALIESIN: It's beautiful, and I would expect nothing less. 
TRAVIS: When you say, if the gods should stay or go, you mean just hypothetically, right? Not as if you were going to make some sort of-- 
LAURA: So you know Ludinus' plan, right? Release Predathos, let it eat the gods, and then start everything over. 
TRAVIS: Right, what we're here to stop. 
TALIESIN: We're not going to let the gods die. That-- 
LAURA: I mean, how much do we-- I say in Laudna's head: How much are we telling them? 
MARISHA: (Laudna) We're talking about the end of the world. Feels like we should-- 
LAURA: Let them know everything. 
LIAM: Above table question. The Nein have gotten run-downs, though, from types like Allura and Keyleth. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: So it's not like we're-- 
SAM: We know what's going on. 
MATT: They know the details of the stakes. They know the details of the Vanguard and Ludinus' plot. They've been given everything that has been told to Allura, Keyleth, those who are part of that goal, but as far as-- 
TRAVIS: Not necessarily what the Hells know. 
TALIESIN: Not that part. 
TRAVIS: No, no, no. 
MATT: Correct. Just what you've told others and they've built plots around. 
LIAM: Right. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: We don't know the personalities of the gods, or-- 
TRAVIS: But now that you're talking about it. 
LIAM: Downfall stuff. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, so we tell them. 
TALIESIN: You're going to tell us how much? 
LAURA: I mean-- 
MARISHA: Well, you see, we did our own little walkabout. 
LAURA: (flashback noises) 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
MARISHA: Talking to the gods. And, you know, as Imogen was saying, we talked to the Arch Heart, as well as the Matron of Ravens, and it seems like the gods aren't even aligned on what they want. 
LAURA: Yeah, those two specifically are hoping that we use Predathos to chase the gods off. I think they're-- 
MARISHA: They seemed tired. 
TRAVIS: You mean they want you to help Ludinus with his plan? 
MARISHA: No. 
LAURA: Not help Ludinus. Get rid of Ludinus, but-- 
ASHLEY: Just set free the-- 
LAURA: Pantheon. 
MARISHA: I think they just want to retire, it seemed. 
LAURA: Some of them. Not all of them. Obviously, the Wildmother, she wants to stay. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Some of them, not all of them. 
LAURA: Correct. 
MARISHA: Well, yes. 
LAURA: The Arch Heart and-- 
MARISHA: We didn't talk to all of them. That seems impossible. Of course, we have no idea what's going on with the Betrayer Gods outside of maybe this one, but we're not really sure. 
ASHLEY: I still feel like we should've talked to one of them. 
SAM: (Braius) They were betrayed, and they could use another shot. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) That's absolutely right. Yeah, they should have a word. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: It was a long time ago. 
LAURA: (Jester) Wait, wait, wait. How do you know anything about the Betrayer Gods? 
SAM: We've done a lot of research into them. 
TRAVIS: Well-informed, well-read, is what we are. 
LAURA: Well, look, like I said, if the gods are gone, the Traveler would be so powerful, so I'm definitely on board with this plan. 
SAM: Oh, we can agree, then. 
LIAM: I will add one thing, and that is that Ludinus Da'leth is perhaps the most dangerous mortal living on Exandria today, so-- 
LAURA: I mean, he's this cute little guy that has some pretty powerful spells. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Jester, we've been through this. 
LIAM: He's a piece of shit. 
MARISHA: He's awful. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Compared to Trent Ikithon, higher or about commiserate? 
LIAM: He has had centuries longer to prepare and scheme. 
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, because you two have been studying and following him around. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We don't know who's going to, if we come across Ludinus, we don't know if that's the Hells' or the Nein's responsibility. 
LAURA: I think Ludinus is at the Hallowed Cave. 
TRAVIS: Oh, so it's with the Hells. 
SAM: Cage. 
LAURA: Cage. 
SAM: Get in the cage. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) We're not scared! 
ASHLEY: We have the big-- They put that on us. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course they did. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Baller shot caller. 
LIAM: You are good? You have strategies? 
LAURA: (Jester) Should we switch? 
LIAM: Things in place for archmages? 
SAM: (Veth) No. 
LAURA: I mean, we're really powerful. Should we switch? Should we go against Ludinus? 
TRAVIS: No, no, no. 
ASHLEY: We're really powerful as well. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I feel like we probably are all in the right spot. 
TRAVIS: Plus, we beat him once already. Granted, he was a snowman. 
LAURA: Then why is he still-- Oh. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: But listen, we had plenty left in the tank. 
LAURA: (Imogen) We've actually beaten him twice as snowmen. 
TRAVIS: That's true. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) So you're feeling confident because you fought two snowmen. 
TRAVIS: 100%. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: All right, Caduceus. Man! 
LAURA: (Jester) I've beaten a lot of snowmen in my life. 
MARISHA: It's wild when Caduceus is the bitchy one. I want to point that out. 
LIAM: Do you want to fight a snowman? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I think we're getting a little off-- 
LAURA: Oh my gosh, you know what, though? Maybe we will fight a snowman. Maybe a snowman Ludinus will be with the Weave Mind, and the actual Ludinus will be with Bells Hells. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Honestly, that's a good point. 
LIAM: (Orym) Cool. 
LAURA: (gasps) What if there's more than one snowman? 
MARISHA: There could be so many snowmen. 
LAURA: There could be so many snowmen! He could have five snowmen! 
MARISHA: He's got a little glowing-- 
LAURA: You know, I can make four of myself at the same time. 
MARISHA: You can make yourself a snowman? 
LAURA: Well, not snow, but I can make-- 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) You can make many of yourself? 
LIAM: (Caleb) I have done this-- 
LAURA: (Jester) I can make-- 
LIAM: -- as well, one time. 
LAURA: -- four additional mes. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) What if another god-- 
LIAM: A good night. 
TALIESIN: -- appears to you and doesn't want you to-- 
LAURA: What? 
TALIESIN: -- release this. What if one of the gods begs you to let them stay? 
SAM: (Braius) I don't think that there's a clear answer to any of this. We don't really have-- 
ASHLEY: Well, we haven't talked to everybody. But also there could be some-- 
MARISHA: (Launda) We're out of time. 
SAM: We don't have a flow chart to tell us what to do. 
ASHLEY: No. 
SAM: We're going to figure it out. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) If you've talked to the Arch Heart and the Matron of Ravens, which by the way, pretty rare and incredible, it sounds like if we defeat Ludinus, and Predathos is driven off, it sounds like it'll be up to the gods to decide whether they stay or leave. 
LIAM: (Orym) Yeah, the hard part about it is the lack of consensus that exists in this room right now exists amongst the gods as well, best we can tell. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
TALIESIN: It is a quandary. 
MARISHA: I mean, I agree with Chetney though, I think it really does unfortunately feel like we're going to have to play it out in the moment, because the last thing that I want to have happen is for you all to try and take Predathos in and it takes you. I just-- I think whatever we decide, we're going to have to be a little bit flexible. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: But, and I know I'm the new guy here, but we're going to have to do it together. We can't be in that moment and have half of us want to do one thing and half do the other. 
ASHLEY: But I have been thinking about, because everybody talks about Predathos being hungry. And I think about when we get hungry, when I get peckish, I want a snack, I don't feel like I want to hurt people. Maybe if we take it in and I'm feeling that hunger-- 
LAURA: (Imogen) And we're hungry. Just eat. 
ASHLEY: -- I would be like: Well, I'm not going to hurt anybody, let me look for an alternative snack. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Fearne, this isn't very reassuring. 
LIAM: (Caleb) It is hard to know what to do in this situation. What I would recommend, since you are the one who is going to be dealing with Da'leth, is to not let Da'leth be in control of the situation. 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: What the moody one said. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Whatever else would happen. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) So he needs to be immediately killed. 
LAURA: Right. 
ASHLEY: From the get go. 
SAM: For sure. That's a no-go. 
LAURA: that sounds like the plan. We'll definitely try to do that. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Well, you got to take him out first, because you can't do anything with Predathos if you're fighting him. I mean, if Predathos gets out, he's probably going to have an advantage on you in terms of knowing what to do. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Yeah, be riding the thing. It'd be terrible. 
LAURA: Well, you two studied him for a long time. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm sorry, does it ever blow your minds that you're traveling with Chetney Pock O'Pea? (laughter) 
LIAM: I've tried to like-- 
MARISHA: Caleb, focus. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Yeah, reign it in, all right, fanboy? Just lock it up a little bit. There's an egg in this for you, all right? 
MARISHA: No-one is signed up for the zine. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Wait, what do you mean? You're giving him an egg? 
TRAVIS: (shouts) Fearne, dial it in! Relax. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: He promised me an egg, so you can't give him an egg, too. 
SAM: You have the egg? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I don't know what that means. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) We know we've got to stop anybody else from taking control of Predathos, but I'm preferably okay with-- I mean, we have to be, this is chaos. Whoever gets to it first gets to decide, and any sense that we're going to have, consensus is insane. 
LAURA: Yeah, sometimes you just have to embrace the chaos. You know? 
MARISHA: The grumpy one's right, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) With both hands. 
LIAM: Are you talking about him or me? 
LAURA: That's right. What? 
TALIESIN: What? 
MARISHA: (Beau) Obviously he's the cranky one. 
LIAM: Oh, thank you, Beauregard. 
MARISHA: You're aloof. 
LIAM: Am I? 
LAURA: No, you're grumpy. 
SAM: (Veth) You're perfect. 
TRAVIS: Indifferent at times. 
MARISHA: Indifferent. 
TALIESIN: I like your vibe. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: All right, we know what we're doing. 
LAURA: (Imogen) No, we don't. 
TRAVIS: Dicks, no. Nipples out? Mm. But we have our assignments. We know that the fate of the world isn't entirely in our hands, we have our parts to play. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Our task is simple, yours is complex. 
SAM: Whoever completes their task first maybe should Message the other group to let them know what happened and that it's done. Or progress reports, right? 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah, that would be great. 
MARISHA: And also-- 
TRAVIS: Even if you see Ludinus. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean we are going to be your all's closest allies here. So obviously we'll try and work as quickly as possible. 
LIAM: (Orym) If we wrap up quick, maybe we can get to you, yeah. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Maybe he can join. 
MARISHA: But look, I know we've all been a little saucy and a little sassy in terms of which team got assigned to which part here, but you guys are assigned to this task for a reason. Obviously you're close to it. You've been in the thick of it. We've been there. We understand. 
LAURA: I think unless y'all have some Ruidusborn in your group. That's the reason we're where we are. 
MARISHA: Look, Ludinus' weak point, it's going to be his ego. 
LAURA: And the back of his neck. 
MARISHA: And the back of his neck, I know. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Ironically, that's where the ego sits, right at the back of the neck. That was a joke. I was going for it. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We're all a little tense. 
LIAM: We all know it's up his ass. (laughter) 
MARISHA: He's always consistently been two steps ahead, even for us, watching him for a decade almost now. 
LAURA: (Jester) Should we just Send a message to him and tell him to ease up? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) To Ludinus? 
LAURA: Yeah. You know, just ask him maybe, "Look, guy." 
TRAVIS: Actually, I think Imogen would probably have something to say about that. I think she tried something similar and the head stuff gets a little fucky. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Well, the head stuff always gets fucky, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, Imogen, that's the best I can do to categorize it. I'm not a wordsmith. 
LAURA: (Jester) I like fucky. 
LIAM: (Caleb) You all have dealt with him before, you've been here before, he's expecting you to show up. Considers it very likely. So when you run in, expect the unexpected. 
TRAVIS: Dicks out. 
MARISHA: I mean, honestly, that's not a bad idea. I could see that throwing him. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
TRAVIS: "Who are you and what are you doing here?" 
LAURA: No, but seriously! 
TALIESIN: It would throw me. 
LAURA: What if you all ran in with your penises hanging out and then-- 
TRAVIS: I've been around for a long time. Last thing you expect when you're assaulting a moon, is a bunch of genitalia out. 
MARISHA: It's kind of true. 
ROBBIE: I don't know, usually when I see an old man, the first thing I expect is he's going to show me his genitalia. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I've been in a few locker rooms. 
MATT: It's about this moment that you notice-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- the entryway to this safehouse has been quietly opened and the hooded lead of the Volition, Rashinna, has been there for a moment. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Ducks in and closes the chamber and turns around and you hear in your collective heads, "It seems I've stumbled upon some curious plotting in conversation." 
ASHLEY: Well, we're thinking of all things, everything we could possibly do, yes. 
LAURA: (Jester) Let chaos reign! 
LIAM: But what if we just wore our magic items only? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I love this idea. 
MARISHA: Hard mode. 
MATT: Gaz pipes up, he's like, "Oh yeah, all right, so-- Sorry, let me introduce you to my companion boss, kick ass big cheese. I don't know what other phrases you Exandrians understand, but this is Rashinna. She's a big deal." 
LAURA: Good to see you. 
MARISHA: Rashinna. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Nice to see you, Rashinna. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Are you joining us or are you joining the Nein? 
MATT: "Oh, I'm not joining anyone. The Volition is going about their plans, but Gaz here has expressed that some of you plan to also assail the Arx Creonum. So we have put our supplies at the ready and perchance we can combine our forces for a singular strike upon the Weave Mind. If you're brave enough." 
MARISHA: (Beau) What did you have in mind? 
MATT: "We've been preparing an explosive chemical in quite a large amount over the recent weeks. We have a number of demolition experts. We have scattered our supplies at three different places amongst the city. We've been able to craft a number of cable cannons to get us to the exterior of the risen citadel itself. Now when it seems it is best that you are ready, if not the time arises too soon and we must take our plot regardless. We are sending a small team of them, experts, myself included to," and she turns around and pulls out what you see is this device. It looks like a small turret of ramshackle arcane design, a large brass tube with a number of Ruidian glass crystals around it. Mechanisms and winding pieces, and a large piece, almost like a heavy bolt of wound cable. A massive grappling apparatus in the front and a grappling apparatus in the back. "The Arx Creonum is elevated to a height. So to get to it rapidly and unseen has been part of our design. We have a few of these devices here. They can launch and affix a bolt to the outside of the Citadel." 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Cool. 
TRAVIS: From Batman. 
MARISHA: It's so cool. 
TRAVIS: Goes across the museum, the Michael Keatan one. 
LAURA: (Jester) Like a zipline in? 
MATT: "And we have a number of harnesses for those who are up for this assault." 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: "Now, you can decline with gravity, but this is an elevated course, which is why," and she points to the grapple hook. "The harnesses have been affixed with means of propulsion for those who are psychically driven." 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: Jet power! 
SAM: Psychically driven? 
MARISHA: Psychically driven. 
TALIESIN: Brain power. 
MATT: "Exactly." 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) What's a jet, Jester? 
LAURA: It's this thing I made up, I'll show you, it's in my journals. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: You've never been in a hot tub? 
MATT: Gaz chimes in, "Yeah, those of us who can push it with our minds can make it go quickly, take our time up to the top, but it can climb." (laughter) 
MATT: Rashinna goes-- (laughter) 
MATT: "Exactly, Gaz." 
MARISHA: Are you able to-- 
MATT: Pats his shoulder. 
MARISHA: Are you able to send other people who might not be so psychically gifted? 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) She's talking about herself. 
MARISHA: Hey. 
LAURA: Yeah, like all of us that are going in? 
LIAM: Pretty much all of us. 
SAM: I want to be near the big boom! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Do you think you are quite capable with explosive chemicals?" 
SAM: Oh yes. Yes, that's my thing. I do that, yes. Here, look, I pull out two little vials and I mix them together and it turns into a purple goo, no function. (laughter) 
SAM: See? 
MATT: Gaz punches her in the shoulder and goes, "Hey, look at that, the small ones got tricks." 
SAM: It's like slime, yeah, foam. 
MARISHA: Honestly, yeah. 
LAURA: (fart noises) 
SAM: Look, it feels so good when you're stressed, you can do this and run it through your fingers. 
MATT: Gaz immediately reaches out and grabs and goes, "I want to try." 
SAM: Go ahead. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Oh." 
MARISHA: You could make a lot of money off of those. 
MATT: "Oh wow, that's--" 
MARISHA: You should start a business. 
SAM: I was putting some glitter in. 
LAURA: Can you eat it? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: (shrieks) No, don't eat it! (laughter) 
MATT: Gaz is already eating it. (laughter) 
LIAM: (Orym) We met this one dwarf who has a shop, or had a shop. 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: Sold slime. 
MATT: Rashinna goes, "Well, perhaps you could be part of the demolition's arrival team and the rest of you can follow up and help us with the rest of the assault. Hmm, as far as your arrival, perhaps Gaz can guide you across the thread. If you can keep close together, he might be able to use--" She looks at him for a second and Gaz goes, "I got a whole lot of power up here." She goes, "He could maybe bring some of you, the others would have to use other means of propulsion up the cable, you might have at your disposal. You seem rather crafty." 
MARISHA: Once the cable is affixed, does it stay there? 
MATT: "Until it's cut on the opposing side, so you want to get there quick." 
LIAM: (Caleb) Are these devices of yours noisy, a big bang when it goes off? 
MATT: "No, our demolitions team propels them psychically to their destination quietly." 
LAURA: So we need to be able to do it ourselves or you will have people to be able to psychically push all of us? 
MATT: "Well the demo team will be present, so those who are amongst the harnesses, which will be Gaz, and the other distant assault teams will be the only ones capable of doing so." 
SAM: Shut the fuck up. 
MATT: "So you'd have to rely on Gaz. I'm not certain how many he could get up there himself. So whatever sort of cleverness you think could push you up the cable, the harness hook should be able to wheel you along with enough of a push." 
LAURA: How long is the cable? 
MATT: She does some calculations in her head. "Nearly 1,000 feet." 
LAURA: Fuck! That's further than I thought. 
SAM: That's two Dimensional Doors. 
LAURA: I know. (laughter) 
SAM: You're not going to burn two fucking spells on this thing. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) We'll be going up the cable then. It would be us. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) How many did you say there were? 
SAM: What about Fly, you got Fly? 
MATT: "You'll have the assault team--" 
LAURA: Oh, I can Polymorph! 
SAM: Yeah, be a bird or something. 
LAURA: Yeah, I can take some of us as a bird. 
TRAVIS: How far is the distance? 
MARISHA: Said 1,000 feet. 
LAURA: 1,000 feet. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) I can get us halfway there. 
LAURA: I know, but I can just Polymorph. 
LIAM: (Orym) Are you okay? 
MARISHA: What was in those chemicals that you mixed together? 
SAM: They're not edible! Why do you people keep trying to eat them? 
LAURA: They look so yummy. 
ASHLEY: She has very bad allergies. 
TRAVIS: You know, she's sensitive to ammonia. 
MARISHA: Yeah, its fumes. I'm good. 
SAM: It's a mixture of ammonia, pollen, and salmonella. (laughter) 
SAM: Don't eat it. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MARISHA: It just happened to be sitting next to you. 
LAURA: Gaz, we're going to die. 
MATT: "What? No we're not. Why am I numb in the mouth?" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: How many of those did you say that there were of the harnesses? 
LAURA: Yeah, how many can you push, Gaz? 
LIAM: We'll need nine of them. 
MATT: She thinks. "I believe we have to leave a few of our assault crew behind, but you seem a bit more capable than maybe--" 
LAURA: Well, some of us don't need the harnesses, I could turn us into birds. 
LIAM: Me as well, yeah. 
MARISHA: What number are you willing to offer and we can work with that. 
MATT: "We have three at the ready and we could trade out for the rest of you, unless you have other means to get to the Creonum itself."  
SAM: That should be plenty. 
LAURA: That should be fine, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Who would be better equipped in case something goes wrong to fall from a great height? 
LAURA: Beau. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, I think any of us are okay, honestly, right? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we'll be okay. 
SAM: I think I have that, too. Maybe. I don't know. 
TRAVIS: You all can fall from great heights, no prob? 
MARISHA: Mm, yeah. 
LAURA: Beau can. 
SAM: Yeah, I can, too, apparently. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever, I mean, so can-- 
LAURA: (Imogen) Chet, we can do it, too. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Want to test that theory? 
LIAM: (Orym) I can't. 
MARISHA: I bet he bounces. 
LAURA: Yes, you can. 
LIAM: Fall from great heights? 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, I can fly. 
LAURA: You can always cast Feather Fall. 
LIAM: Oh, that's if you're next to me. 
SAM: I think I also have Fly. 
MARISHA: Well, you're not going with us. 
ROBBIE: I can make you fly. 
LIAM: No. (laughter) 
LAURA: (Jester) So when are we doing this? 
TALIESIN: We're waiting on a signal. 
LAURA: When is things exploding? Oh right, we're waiting. 
SAM: (Braius) Perhaps we should-- 
LAURA: ♪ (whistling "The Girl from Ipanema") ♪ 
SAM: -- you know, say goodbye to each other or whatever. 
MATT: "We'll begin to set up the supplies necessary. We are going to be setting your troop with Gaz at the top of the Zoku Belfry." 
SAM: What the--? 
MARISHA: Zoku? 
SAM: What the fuck is that? 
MATT: "Gaz knows where it is." 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Is that where we're waiting? 
MATT: (Gaz) "Yeah, don't worry, I'll lead you right there. It's maybe a hop skip and a jump or three." 
LAURA: (chuckles) 
MATT: (Rashinna) "So, you." 
SAM: (Veth) Wha-- Ah! 
MATT: "When it's time, I'll join you at the Belfry and you'll be part of the early arrival demolition. Once we've set, we'll either turn on the cable or you can climb to the side if you have another means of dangling. Once the assault crew has reached there, we're going to cut the cables on the side of the city and they're going to dangle." 
MARISHA: (Beau) You're not afraid that that'll leave people open to join who we might not want there? 
MATT: "That's the point of cutting the cables is to prevent anyone following up." 
MARISHA: I just mean-- Oh, I guess other people can't do the rope. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) That fall really fucked you up, didn't it? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Nevermind. 
LAURA: (Imogen) All of us are going there? 
MARISHA: I'm the only one who did gym class, I guess. 
LAURA: Or are Bells Hells leaving before the assault? 
TRAVIS: The rope? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "Sorry, the demolitions team are cutting the cables when they're done." 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: "And what was your question?" 
LAURA: All of us are going there, or is it just Mighty Nein going into the Citadel? Are Bells Hells-- 
MATT: "I do not have enough harnesses for the other team. Who's on the assault team to the Citadel?" 
SAM: (Braius) We're going down-- Bells Hells is going down into the cave. 
MATT: Gaz goes, 
LAURA: So we would be right here. 
MATT: "Yeah, they're going below the big shiny glass thing." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You hear that, Nott? Braius is going down. 
SAM: (Veth) Ugh, don't even tempt me. (laughter) 
SAM: That big, beautiful man. (laughter) 
LIAM: (Caleb) Pick your jaw up off the floor. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: (sighs) I just was getting over it. Nott digs her fingernails into her hand and bleeds a little bit. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh my god! Jesus. 
LAURA: Sheesh! 
MATT: Rashinna grins her wide toothy Reiloran grin. "Well then, we'll start setting up our various points of interest. Gaz, about 15 minutes or so, bring the assault team to join me at the top of the belfry and then when you have your signal, we'll begin our--" She rushes out the door and it closes behind. Gaz goes, "Isn't she cool?" 
ROBBIE: (chuckles) 
LAURA: She's the coolest. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: "All right, get your snacks, get your lunchies, get all your stuff you need to get ready to dive on in to--" 
TRAVIS: Lunchies? 
MARISHA: Lunchies? 
LAURA: (Jester) Get your dicks out. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LAURA: Here we go. 
LIAM: (zipping) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Well, if we're taking a moment, I'm going to unpack some cups, a kettle, a little bit of water. I figure we can all sit and have a cup of tea and this could be the last time we see each other. This could be the last time for some of us. 
LAURA: Oh man, what if we drink so much tea that we have to pee in the middle of the fight? 
LIAM: (Orym) I think at that point you let it go. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you take your-- 
TRAVIS: Agreed, yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- dick out. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you let it out. 
TRAVIS: That's very thoughtful, Caduceus Do we have enough cups? 
TALIESIN: I made sure to bring plenty. As those go around, Ashton also pulls out the flask that you gave them in case somebody feels tea is not quite enough and puts some in their teacup and-- 
SAM: Yes, please. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Thank you to Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MARISHA: Hey, blue guy. 
ROBBIE: Hm? 
MARISHA: Yeah, you. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yes! Go on. 
MARISHA: You look like the type of person to make a toast. 
ROBBIE: Oh, no. No, no. 
MARISHA: Aren't you a bardish type? 
LIAM: She's right. You're right. 
ROBBIE: A toast? Certainly. Yes. 
MARISHA: I mean, I could do it. 
ROBBIE: I am a professional bard. I would be glad to do it. You sound great, I'll cover this one. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Had to drink your milk before you came to the moon. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a little gunky protein shake. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Let's see, uh-- 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Don't fuck it up. 
LIAM: Caleb throws globules of amber light, wafting around in a circle. For mood. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
ROBBIE: I like that. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah, Imogen's going to add some little sparklers to that, too. 
ROBBIE: Ah, mood lighting, good. To-- Did you just drink? Did you drink before the toast? 
LAURA: Don't worry about it. 
ROBBIE: It's bad luck, it's bad luck. 
LAURA: That's why I spit it back out. 
ROBBIE: To new friends and old. To a quiet moment before the storm. And to those of us who've just met and those we hope to see again very soon, please don't die. Down the hatch. 
TRAVIS: Yes. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Please don't die. 
TRAVIS: Hear, hear! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
LIAM: (Caleb) To the Nein Hells. 
TRAVIS: Nicely done. 
LAURA: (Jester) To the Nein Hells. 
ASHLEY: To the Nein Hells. 
MATT: "To the dying note." (laughter) 
TALIESIN: To the death note. 
TRAVIS: To the what? 
MATT: "What?" 
TRAVIS: Dying note? 
MARISHA: Diet note? 
ROBBIE: (wheezes) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: The what? 
TALIESIN: Elaborate. 
LIAM: (Orym) He's had a rough time. 
LAURA: Look. 
SAM: He got kicked in the head. 
MATT: "These taste like flowers." 
TRAVIS: He's tripping balls. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You've never had a tea before. 
MATT: "Tea." 
TALIESIN: I grow it myself. This is really good, this is very rare. 
LAURA: It's made probably from some dead people. 
TALIESIN: I mean, it did-- 
TRAVIS: We'll have to elaborate on what tea is. 
TALIESIN: -- grow out of a grave, yes. 
TRAVIS: I don't think, you know. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) It's leaves. 
TALIESIN: Back down we cultivate certain types of plants and we mix them together and we boil them and all of the flavors and oils come out. 
MARISHA: The short version, Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's boiled flowers. 
MATT: "Oh, mushroom water. Yeah. Got it." 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Mushroom water. 
TALIESIN: I put mushrooms in my tea sometimes. 
LAURA: Yeah, you do. 
TRAVIS: We've been offered that once, we turned it down. 
LIAM: Also, earlier you said "big cheese." Is there Ruidian cheese or are you guys have dreamt of cheese? 
MATT: "Mainly in dreams." (laughter) 
LIAM: Anyone got cheese? 
MATT: I've eaten a few things. 
LAURA: Gaz, we got to get you on Exandria. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) This is a bad-- 
LAURA: You got to have some cheese. 
TALIESIN: This is a bad moment to find out if this is an entire| civilization of people who are lactose intolerant. That might not be a great thing now. Maybe after, everyone can get a little-- 
MATT: "I've eaten a few things--" 
LIAM: We do have a few clerics around. 
MATT: "I imagine have a very similar texture to this cheese. There's a lot of types, right?" 
LAURA: There's a lot of types of cheese. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: There's so many. 
LAURA: Yes, some of them are very, very firm. 
ASHLEY: The stinkier the better. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
ASHLEY: That's what I say. 
LAURA: I do not like stinky cheese. 
ASHLEY: Oh, god. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Beauregard, you are always throwing down charcuterie boards, do you have anything in your pack? Goat cheese? 
MARISHA: I have some jerky, I have some bacon. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) You carry around bacon in your pockets? 
MARISHA: It's the best, man. 
MATT: "Give me more of your mushroom water tea." 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. No. 
SAM: Chutney. 
MARISHA: No cheese today. 
LIAM: Not this time. 
SAM: Chetney, before we get going. 
TRAVIS: Chetney? 
SAM: Yeah. Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Sounded like you said Chutney, which seems like a total other person. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Come to the Critmas show. 
SAM: I've long been an admirer of that tattoo of yours. 
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah? 
SAM: Was wondering if you could quickly chisel a little something. 
LAURA: You need a tattoo? 
TRAVIS: In your flesh or in your armor? 
SAM: In my flesh, I want to be emboldened in this battle. 
TRAVIS: Of course. 
SAM: And united in cause. 
TRAVIS: Did you-- and he's, I'm spinning fucking chisels of different sizes. What did you have in mind? 
SAM: I mean, the same thing if that's all right. 
MARISHA: Jester, don't get offended. 
LAURA: Well-- 
MARISHA: He doesn't know. 
SAM: What? 
LAURA: You make tattoo with a chisel? 
SAM: Well, I thought he could chisel. I have lots of ink and I could pour it in. 
LAURA: I've got tattoo equipment. 
TRAVIS: Hold on, he asked me first, blue girl. Okay? 
SAM: Allowing you to-- 
LAURA: (sighs loudly) Do you want a tattoo? 
TRAVIS: Compromise? 
LAURA: Who wants a tattoo 
TRAVIS: Compromise! 
LAURA: You want a tattoo. 
TRAVIS: I'll do the line art, 
LIAM: I'm not really-- 
TRAVIS: and you could fill it in with whatever that extravagance is. 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) I want your line art. 
LAURA: I'm going to do Ashton while you do this guy. 
TRAVIS: Cool, you take the stone one. 
MATT: Yeah, chisel on the flesh guy. (laughter) 
MATT: Tattoo equipment on the stone. 
TRAVIS: (carving) 
TALIESIN: Ashton is made of rock. Tattooing him takes some work. 
LAURA: You need a chisel. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, which is why I've got something chiseled on my back already, anyway, by that weird pirate. 
SAM: Maybe Chetney should do Ashton then because he can chisel. 
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no. There's an alpha inside all of us, Braius, and you need to recognize yours. 
SAM: I know, that's-- 
ASHLEY: Recognize and respect. 
TRAVIS: Take that fucking pauldron off, big boy. 
SAM: All right. 
TALIESIN: I think I would've fought you off on it for a while. 
LAURA: I'm going to give you a tattoo now, Caduceus. 
SAM: Ah, fuck! (groans) (laughter) 
SAM: Oh god! 
TRAVIS: Hold still, bitch! 
SAM: Oh god! 
TRAVIS: Bite down on something! 
TALIESIN: Ow! Ow, ow. 
SAM: Oh fuck! 
TRAVIS: Look how deep I'm going. 
SAM: (groans) 
TALIESIN: That trickles. 
SAM: This is our show! 
MATT: ♪ (jaunty background music) ♪ 
SAM: (pained yelling) 
TRAVIS: Who's got some booze? Hey, you got booze? 
MARISHA: Who's got the flask? Oh, I thought that was for him. 
SAM: (yells) 
TRAVIS: There you go. 
ROBBIE: While they're all tattooing each other. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Dorian's going to take his tea and sneak behind the group and approach Caleb from the side and quietly say: Thank you for your kindness, by the way. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Of course. 
ROBBIE: You have many things that I am envious of. 
LIAM: How do you mean? 
ROBBIE: Well, (chuckles). It doesn't matter. You have a lot to fight for and I know that wasn't my best toast, but I genuinely wish you and your party well as you go. 
LIAM: You are selling yourself short, but same goes for you. We are all rolling the dice here for the most important thing. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LIAM: Good luck to you as well. 
ROBBIE: We have good friends, and I'm going to nod over to all of the idiots tattooing each other. 
SAM: (screaming) 
MATT: Gaz Tomo's like, "I don't know what's happening." (laughter) 
LIAM: Years ago, when I met all of the Nein, I thought I couldn't meet a loonier bunch of people. And you all have surpassed us. Kudos to you. 
MARISHA: I will also take this moment. Laudna will take this moment to-- nope, nope. There's nothing there to give. 
TRAVIS: You're right, it'd just go right through like paper. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Yes. Correct. Very thin skin. Yes. 
TRAVIS: Fuckin' bats come out of you. 
MARISHA: No, Laudna will sneak over to Imogen. Pull her back a little bit from the chaos. Just wanted to check in with you. I don't think there's any secret amongst the group. And so much of this decision lies with you and Fearne. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah. 
MARISHA: At the end of the day, we can all have our own disparate opinions, but it's what the two of you are going to choose in the moment. 
LAURA: What do you want? 
MARISHA: Genuinely? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: This is not a cop out. Whatever you want. 
SAM: Cop out. 
LAURA: Well, fuck. 
MARISHA: Look, just make me one promise. If you get in there and something doesn't feel right, you get out. We change, even if it's the last minute. We can take the staff, get the fuck out of here. Not that I want to abandon anybody, but. 
LAURA: I'm going to kiss her. We both know we can't do that. 
MARISHA: I would follow you anywhere. Trust your gut. It's gotten us this far. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: But also don't feel like you have to do anything you don't want to do. 
LAURA: I never would've thought life would bring us here. 
MARISHA: Gods, no. 
LAURA: Just a few months ago, we were-- we were running from town to town not knowing if we'd be able to find a home. I didn't know what the future held then. 
MARISHA: Simpler times. 
LAURA: Surprisingly. I would've never expected that it was, but-- 
MARISHA: I know. Seems so monumentous in the moment, and now it's so small. We were never meant to be important. (chuckles) But also maybe that's why we're here. 
LAURA: I don't want to abandon them now. 
MARISHA: No, not abandonment. But I do still think of that cozy cottage at the end of all of this. 
LAURA: Me too. 
MARISHA: The gods never had much effect on our lives before and I don't see them having much after. 
LAURA: We'll find that cottage, all right? At the end of this. 
MARISHA: Just promise me. Promise me, you reserve the right to change your mind, whichever way we want to go up until the very bitter last moment. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: I kiss her again. 
LAURA: To the future. I'll clink my tea glass. 
LIAM: I quietly rolled a 30 on perception and I have Observant and through all the noise from across the room Orym just watched that conversation play out, reading your lips mostly, and takes a huge amount of comfort and pride at seeing Imogen say that she was not going to run from this and he stopped paying attention before the end of the conversation. 
SAM: Veth will go up to Yasha, bend her ear for a moment. 
ASHLEY: Yasha's sitting there, sharpening Scaldsaber. 
SAM: (Veth) Ooh. Hey, I felt a little bit guilty about pining over that big strapping minotaur man. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel like you should. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Nothing happened. 
ASHLEY: I'm kidding. I know. 
SAM: But I was wondering, I want to be a better wife. I feel like I've-- It's not that I'm drifting apart or anything. I just want to keep it fresh, you know? 
ASHLEY: Of course. 
SAM: You know, everything, after time-- You know, even gold loses its luster after time. So I was-- You and Beau seem so happy. How do you keep it fresh? 
ASHLEY: Fresh? 
SAM: Are you married, by the way? I don't even know this. 
ASHLEY: We are... (stammering) (laughter) 
SAM: Are you married? 
LAURA: Have you talked about it? 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: We are-- It's none of your business. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I don't know if we were married. 
ASHLEY: Listen! 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
ASHLEY: We didn't do that yet. 
SAM: You're not married officially? Canonically, you're not married? 
MARISHA: Oh wait, Dani says we're married. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Apparently we're married. 
ASHLEY: Yes, we've been married for so long now. 
MATT: I was like, I'm pretty sure you guys said that you were married. 
ASHLEY: I feel like we did, too. 
LAURA: Didn't you adopt kids? 
MARISHA: We said we did a quiet-- Eloped. 
ASHLEY: We eloped. 
MARISHA: No, we've talked about adopting kids. 
ASHLEY: We've talked about it. We haven't done it yet. 
MARISHA: The time hasn't been right. 
ASHLEY: There's a lot going on. 
MARISHA: There's a lot going on. 
ASHLEY: There's a lot going on. 
LIAM: This is apparently pretty open, though. 
ASHLEY: You know, I feel like-- 
TRAVIS: A lot of room on that farm. 
ASHLEY: -- the secret to-- 
SAM: It's not, by the way, it's not sexual. The sex is still great. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's good. 
SAM: We do all kinds of fun stuff. 
ASHLEY: All kinds of funsies? 
SAM: Yeah, we do strap-ons. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
SAM: He spits in my mouth and pulls my hair. 
ASHLEY: Great! 
SAM: We do all sorts of-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All the goods. All the good stuff. 
TRAVIS: Look at Matt's face! 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. The sex is fine. It's just-- 
TRAVIS: Look at Matt! (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeza! 
SAM: He's crazy in bed. 
ASHLEY: I was going to make those suggestions, actually. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Mouth spitting. 
ROBBIE: Oh man. 
ASHLEY: So what are you-- 
SAM: It's not the sex. It's just, I want to-- You know, we've raised a child. We've managed a business together. 
TRAVIS: Hi, Ronin. (laughs) 
SAM: You know, I'm a mom, and I feel like these adventures are getting fewer and further between, and I just want to make sure that I am present. How do you keep it-- 
ASHLEY: How do I keep it tight? 
SAM: Yeah, what do you guys do for each other, with each other? 
ASHLEY: We have sex so much. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I think it's the secret to our success, maybe. Listen. I mean, I think Beau is so hot. 
SAM: Yeah, but there's still a mundane quality to long relationships. 
ASHLEY: Of course, but that's why sometimes, you know, you throw some things in to spice it up. You know, we go out on dates and we meet other people sometimes and have some fun. 
SAM: Oh! Oh, that's a thing that you can do? 
ASHLEY: You can do whatever you want as long as you communicate. You've got to talk about it. You've got to have constant communication. You know, listen. Have you ever-- 
SAM: That seems so hip and modern. 
ASHLEY: It is. Have you ever had-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: -- a conversation with Yeza and said: Listen, I'm super into minotaurs? 
SAM: Maybe he is, too. 
ASHLEY: Maybe he is, too. You have no idea. Or maybe he can help you fulfill that fantasy. You've got to meet each other where you're at. 
TALIESIN: Polymorph. 
LAURA: Polymorph. 
ASHLEY: Make it a playground. 
LIAM: Seeming. 
ASHLEY: When you have fun, it's your playground together. 
LIAM: Cover it in Seeming. 
ASHLEY: Be kids. 
TALIESIN: Seeming everywhere. 
SAM: Be kids. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but not in a weird way. 
SAM: No, no, no! Not in a weird way! 
ASHLEY: But, you know, it's-- (poorly controlled snickering) 
ASHLEY: And, you know, you've got to explore. 
ROBBIE: Where's that signal? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: This'll taper. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: No. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: This is what I want. 
MATT: There were a few points I could've interrupted this, but I'm letting it go. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: You've given me a lot to think about. I hope we survive. 
ASHLEY: But listen. Beau is-- 
SAM: You and Beau wouldn't be open to... 
ASHLEY: Are you suggesting you and Yeza-- 
SAM: I don't know! I don't know how this works! 
ASHLEY: Listen, I am all about communication. If this is a conversation that you would like to have with the two of us, I don't know. I don't know if I would be into it. Yeza's not for me. 
SAM: Well because, you know, you and me, you and I briefly dated. 
ASHLEY: Yes. We did? 
SAM: We went on one date. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) I forgot about that. Listen. 
SAM: I didn't! (laughter) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Listen. (laughter) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I don't know if Yeza's my thing. 
SAM: That's fair. 
ASHLEY: But, I don't know-- (stammering) Listen, I think probably, since we work together, maybe that wouldn't be a thing. 
SAM: Probably not. That's probably not a good idea. 
ASHLEY: But I... 
SAM: But you've given me a lot to think about. Thank you. You're a good friend. 
ASHLEY: You're a good friend. 
SAM: I'm glad this was our last conversation before the end of the world. 
ASHLEY: Don't do that to me. Don't do that. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: No, we're getting you home. You have a kid. Beau and I are going to talk about, we've tabled it quite a bit, about adopting some children. 
SAM: I think you should. 
ASHLEY: We will get there. 
SAM: Beau would make a wonderful mother. 
MARISHA: I was waiting for it. 
SAM: She has this-- 
ASHLEY: Beau. (smooches) 
MARISHA: (Beau) Huh? 
ASHLEY: Come here. 
TRAVIS: Did you just-- (summoning smooches) 
MARISHA: I love it when you do that. (smooching) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's what you do when you ride a horse. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: He was thinking-- 
MARISHA: It's nice. 
SAM: She. 
ASHLEY: Would you like to-- She was thinking, sorry. 
SAM: You should be a mother! 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's not what I was going to talk about. 
SAM: Oh yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: We've, you know-- 
ASHLEY: We've talked about it. 
MARISHA: There's been a lot going on. Wait, what were you going to say, though? 
ASHLEY: No, I was going to say-- 
MARISHA: What were you talking about? 
SAM: This, this. 
ASHLEY: Nott wanted to know if we wanted to have some fun with-- 
SAM: Eh, I'm not really-- She doesn't do it for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Wait, you want a throuple? You want to throuple it up? Is that what you're talking about? 
SAM: I don't know. This is not the time nor place. We should table this. 
MARISHA: This is a safe-- We've known each other for a very long time. 
ASHLEY: We've known each other. It's a safe space. 
MARISHA: It's a safe space. 
ASHLEY: We like to provide a safe space for everyone. 
LIAM: It's a "Hostel" movie. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, it feels like, you know-- 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: It feels like, you know, you can always talk to us, you know? It wouldn't be weird. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MARISHA: Just don't think it would be weird afterwards. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: If Yeza's tired, and he wants, I can show you a fantastic time. 
MARISHA: Do you think, is Yeza the kind of guy-- 
SAM: I need to talk to him about this. 
MARISHA: -- that would want to watch? 
TRAVIS: Artists are eating for that. Artists are-- 
SAM: I'll talk to him about this. We'll get back to this. 
ASHLEY: We'll table it? 
SAM: We'll get back to this. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Doty, take this down. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ROBBIE: I feel like a relationship counselor. 
ASHLEY: Nott, I love you. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Beau. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
ASHLEY: I love you. 
MARISHA: I love you. I know, I know you've been pushing me on the kids thing. I apologize. I have been-- It's not that I don't want to. Everything was fucking Cerberus Assembly. But after, hey, Ludinus dies, let's do it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's a good celebration. 
ASHLEY: That's a good reason to adopt some kids. 
MARISHA: Yes, yes. 
ASHLEY: The death of our enemy. 
MARISHA: The death of an old, rich, very powerful wizard. 
ASHLEY: I agree. To celebrate life. 
SAM and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: I like this. 
SAM: It's healthy. 
LAURA: (Jester) So I'm thinking for wedding colors, Fjord-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Keep rolling this. 
LAURA: -- pink and like dark pink. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) That sounds wonderful. 
LAURA: We could have it at the Lavish Chateau, you know? 
TRAVIS: Mm, mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Mama would, they would-- That would be great. We could have it on the stage at the Chateau, and all of the people that attend could sit in the audience. 
TRAVIS: The paying customers could attend? 
LAURA: No, no no no, we'd close it down for the wedding or something. 
TRAVIS: Mm. Sure. 
LAURA: Or we could get married-- (gasps) We could get married at Traveler Con, on the island. 
TRAVIS: Rumblecusp. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: That feels far more of a destination wedding. That could be very interesting. 
LAURA: Yeah, but people would have to travel there. That's the thing. 
ASHLEY: But then wouldn't people forget it? 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that's true. 
LAURA: That doesn't happen anymore. We changed that, didn't we? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you're right. Sorry. I'm out of this-- 
TRAVIS: Depending on what part of the island you're on. 
TALIESIN: I don't remember. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) You only do a destination wedding if you secretly don't want people to come to your wedding. 
LAURA: Oh, really? 
TRAVIS: Is that true? 
MARISHA: That's what I've always heard. 
LAURA: Hey, if we survive this, you all are invited to our wedding, okay? 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: We could go to Eiselcross. 
LAURA: Eiselcross? 
TRAVIS: I mean, if we don't want people to come, then-- 
LAURA: Isn't that cold? 
TRAVIS: Yes? 
LIAM: It's super hostile there. 
LAURA: I don't want a cold wedding! 
SAM: (Braius) You don't want a cold wedding. 
TRAVIS: Oh, no? 
SAM: You don't. 
LAURA: No, I want to be able-- 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Your nipples will cut right through that shirt. 
LAURA: -- to wear a really frilly dress made of chiffon. Are you kidding me? I don't want to wear a coat when we get married. 
TRAVIS: I don't know, I haven't seen a lot of wedding dresses. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Fjord, Jester hates the cold! 
ROBBIE: A cold honeymoon can be nice, though. Cozy. 
LAURA: Dorian, do you play music? 
ROBBIE: I do play music. Do you not have a band yet? Do you not have a wedding-- 
LAURA: Look, we've been distracted, okay? There's been a lot going on. Do you want to play at our wedding? 
SAM: Is there a wedding date set? 
LAURA: No, not yet. But listen-- 
TRAVIS: That's why we're talking it out here. 
SAM: How long have you been engaged? 
LAURA: A few weeks. 
SAM: Oh, you have time to figure that out. 
TRAVIS: That's what I thought, but it seems like concrete plans are being made now. 
SAM: If you-- 
TRAVIS: Pink and darker pink. 
SAM: I know I just met you, but I could-- I do have the power to officiate weddings. 
LAURA: Oh, really? 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Actually, I thought you would go for the sketching. You need a sketch artist at these things. 
ROBBIE: Keepsakes for the guests! That's perfect! 
LAURA: Yeah, and I was thinking the Traveler-- 
TALIESIN: His stuff is real good. 
LAURA: -- was going to officiate. 
LIAM: (Caleb) I feel like the first step is surviving the next 12 hours, though. 
MARISHA: Can I be your best man? Do you have a best man? 
LAURA: No, Beau! 
ROBBIE: Just to have a carrot. 
MARISHA: What? Oh. 
ROBBIE: Something to look forward to. 
MARISHA: Wait, what were you going to ask? 
TALIESIN: Exactly. 
LIAM: Did you just suggest yourself? 
MARISHA: Do you want me to be your maid of honor? I can be both. 
LAURA: No, there's lots of other people. If you want to be his best man, then that's fine. 
MARISHA: I don't know, I figured you would probably ask Veth. I thought you were close. 
ASHLEY: I thought we all were going to be the best men. 
MARISHA: We could all be best men. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: The Chaos Crew should be your bridal party, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I actually like that. 
TRAVIS: But Beau, I was-- 
MARISHA: We'll table this. I didn't mean to make it weird. 
LAURA: No, that's fine. 
MARISHA: Pink and dark pink sounds-- 
TRAVIS: And maybe some blue. 
MARISHA: -- great. Blue. 
TRAVIS: For the ocean. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: And for me. For the little sapphire! 
TRAVIS: And for you. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Pink and dark pink-- 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) I'm picking up on a little bit of hesitancy from you, for some reason. 
TRAVIS: Hesitancy? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, a little-- 
LAURA: What do you mean hesitancy? 
TRAVIS: No, no! 
ASHLEY: A little fear. 
SAM: I sense it too. 
ASHLEY: A little fear? 
LAURA: Are you afraid? 
ASHLEY: Of commitment, maybe? 
TRAVIS: We're on the moon! We're about to go fight some ancient thing that feeds on gods, and we're talking about wedding colors and chaffon wedding dresses. 
LAURA: Yeah, but Fjord-- 
ASHLEY: Chaffon? Chaffon? 
TRAVIS: Is it not chaffon? 
LAURA: It's chiffon, okay? 
TRAVIS: Cheffon? 
ASHLEY: That's better. 
TRAVIS: Chiffon. 
LIAM: Did you think it was chaffon, or did Travis? 
TRAVIS: Both. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I love it. 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
MARISHA: Blame it on the accent. 
TRAVIS: What's the right one? 
ASHLEY: It's chiffon. 
TRAVIS: Chiffon? 
ASHLEY: Chaffon is great. I'm only calling it-- 
TRAVIS: That sounds like a spice. I think I had that in ravioli once. 
ASHLEY: It does, it does. 
ROBBIE: Saffron is what you're thinking of. 
TRAVIS: Saffron, there it is. 
ROBBIE: Saffron. 
TALIESIN: Ashton turns to Orym. I feel like this is a dark mirror of our future. If we survive this, this is what we're going to fall apart into. 
LAURA: There's no if! 
LIAM: (Orym) We're never going to be that old. 
LAURA: There's no "if we survive this." 
TALIESIN: God, I hope not. 
LAURA: We're all going to survive this, and then we're going to have a big wedding. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) I agree. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You're definitely all invited, and I am very excited about it. 
ROBBIE: ♪ A little bit softer now? 
LAURA: Now I feel like he's lying. 
LIAM: That sounds nice. 
TRAVIS: No no no no no no no! 
LAURA: You're the one who asked me to do this. 
TRAVIS: I did! 
ROBBIE: I'm going to play that one for sure. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) There's a lot of fear in it. There's a lot of fear in committing. It's okay. 
ROBBIE: They say they don't, but they love it. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: But you feel great about it. 
LAURA: I feel so good about it. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. You're going to be the most beautiful bride. 
LAURA: Don't you think so? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I really do. I really do. 
MARISHA: You're going to be so pretty. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
MARISHA: It's good, it's good that-- I would rather be talking about wedding plans right now, honestly. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I actually like it. 
LIAM: I agree. Something to look forward to. 
MARISHA: Something to look forward to. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh, plus-- 
ASHLEY: So let's pick a date. 
TRAVIS: -- if we vindicate the moon, we could have it here. 
LAURA: (gasps) A moon wedding! 
SAM: A honeymoon. You could honeymoon here. 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. 
LAURA: We could-- 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
LAURA: I could make-- Do you think it clashes, though, to do pink and dark pink with a red setting? 
TRAVIS: You've got to stop asking me about colors. I literally-- (blows raspberry) 
LAURA: I know, Fjord. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: (Gaz) "If you're looking to have your honeymoon here, by the way, I know a bunch of great places to get some snacks." 
LAURA: Do you really? 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Is there honey on the moon? 
MATT: "What's honey?" 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! I've got-- 
LIAM: (Caleb) You have got to have honey. 
LAURA: I have honey, don't worry. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, bring that out right now. 
LAURA: Scoop. 
MARISHA: You dreamed cheese, but not honey? 
TALIESIN: You can put some in your tea. 
LAURA: No, I have a scoop! I have a-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's-- 
LAURA: Oh. It's very sticky. That's lavender infused. 
TALIESIN: It's really good in the tea. You can put it in your tea. 
MATT: "(blissful moan)" 
TALIESIN: You don't want to-- Oh. 
ASHLEY: Winnie the Pooh. 
TALIESIN: You didn't wash your hands. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. Yeah. 
MATT: "Oh yeah." 
TRAVIS: That's going to get everything on it now. 
ASHLEY: God, I love honey so much. 
MATT: "Oh yeah. Oh now it's just making strings." 
LAURA: Sweet strings. 
TRAVIS: I'll create a little water. Just a little water in your hand. 
MATT: "Thank you, green fella." 
TRAVIS: You're welcome. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Well, I guess we're in the hurry up and wait phase. 
LAURA: (Imogen) Yeah. 
MATT: About this time-- (laughter) 
MATT: Waiting for the energy to get to a point. (laughter) 
MATT: Rashinna arrives through the door with a bunch of other Reiloran around her in standard civilian clothing, satchels over their backs, not unlike the rest of the civilians that are in the process of essentially abandoning Kreviris. She pushes in. (Rashinna) "All right, friends. Looks like time to prepare is nigh. If what you say is the assault on Exandria is to happen soon, we should prepare. Follow me." Gaz goes, "All right, it's time. Rashinna, you've got to try this honey!" Walks out with her. 
LAURA: Is he going to make her lick his fingers? Oh my gosh. 
TRAVIS: I think this is where we leave you. 
LAURA: (Jester) Oh, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Good luck, Bells Hells. I'm sure you don't need it, but-- You seem very capable. 
MARISHA: (laughs) He-- 
LAURA: He said the thing. 
MARISHA: He said the thing. 
TALIESIN: I know we disagree on what the outcome of this should be. I know I have my feelings. So I ask all of you, I'm not here to tell you what to do, but when the moment comes, do what feels kind. I can live with that, whatever it is. 
ASHLEY: I second that. 
LIAM: Ja. Always lead with your heart. 
LAURA: Yes. And your dick. 
SAM: And Miss Lavorre, I'm sorry I had a-- I'm sorry I misjudged you. 
LAURA: Braius! I go up and give you a hug. 
SAM: Oh, watch the tattoo. 
LAURA: I'm so sorry about everything. But I'm glad you're here with us. Everything happens for a reason. 
SAM: I hope your god isn't consumed by Predathos. 
LAURA: Oh, he's not really a god, so it's okay. 
SAM: Well, that's good. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's really good of you, Doomseed. 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) I'll take it. I hope your goddess isn't consumed by Predathos. 
SAM: I mean-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Sure. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Make sure that one doesn't choose. Whatever happens, that one-- 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) Yeah, it's fine, we'll have redundancies here. 
TALIESIN: Keep them away from any red button. 
MARISHA: (Laudna) Hey! Braius. 
SAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: (squeakily) Did you want that Raven mask? 
SAM: Were those words? (laughter) 
MARISHA: I have a hard time asking for things. (normally) Did you want that raven mask? 
SAM: Oh, right. 
MARISHA: Can I have it? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
SAM: You want it? 
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, I don't know. I had a little bit of a connection with the Raven Queen, and we were talking to the Arch Heart and he was like: You, she wanted to talk to you. And he looked at me, and maybe I just-- 
SAM: Sure, sure, sure. No, no, no, I remember. 
MARISHA: Maybe he was looking at all of us, but it-- You know? 
ROBBIE: Anything to make this stop. (laughter) 
SAM: Her hair's falling out. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's just clumps. 
LIAM: Half bald. 
TALIESIN: It's made an entire cat on the ground. 
SAM: All right. All right, sure. 
MARISHA: I mean, unless you need it. Do you need it? 
SAM: I still never really-- 
TRAVIS: Just fucking take it. 
SAM: I still never prayed with it, but-- 
MARISHA: Do you want to pray with it now? Do you want to pray with it? 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) You're going to pray to a third god now, Braius? 
SAM: Maybe. 
LAURA: You got three gods? 
ASHLEY: Oh. Well. 
SAM: Just two currently. 
LAURA: What are the two? 
TALIESIN: Do they all know? 
LIAM: (Caleb) You should consider a throuple. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: That's disgusting. (laughter) 
MARISHA: How about this? We'll pray together, and we can both hold it. 
SAM: All right. 
MARISHA: Okay, ready? Oh, Matron of Ravens. 
SAM: Oh, Matron of Ravens, can you hear us? 
MARISHA: Can you hear us? 
SAM: Can you give us a sign of guidance? Anything that would-- 
MARISHA: Be here in our moment of need. 
SAM: -- that would guide us-- 
LAURA: (Imogen) I'm going to use Telekinetic Hand to shove the mask into Laudna's hand. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: Like a Ouija board? 
ASHLEY: She chose you. 
MARISHA: She chose me. That is her sign! Thank you, Braius! 
SAM: Did I notice the Telekinetic Hand? 
MATT: You noticed it pull out of your hand into hers. 
SAM: Okay, but I don't know the cause of it. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Well, I didn't move my body, it's just my mental powers. 
LIAM: It's like a wish bone-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: -- you just break it and whoever has the bigger piece. 
MATT: It mysteriously got jolted out of your grasp into Laudna's. 
SAM: Curious. 
MARISHA: It's a sign. 
SAM: I guess so. 
MARISHA: She likes me. 
SAM: All right, well-- 
MARISHA: I'll use it very graciously. 
SAM: Use it wisely. 
MARISHA: I will. 
SAM: Don't use it to-- Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: No, no, no. 
SAM: Don't use it right now! 
MARISHA: No, no, no. I'm not going to do it right now. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: All right. 
MARISHA: Thank you, genuinely. 
SAM: It belongs with you. 
MARISHA: (laughing) I know. 
SAM: It's been wonderful to, to meet friends like you all. 
MARISHA: You're one of us. 
SAM: Yeah? 
LIAM: (Orym) Yeah, you've really stepped up, Braius. 
MARISHA: You're a Hells. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, man. You've been claimed. 
SAM: How's it look? 
TRAVIS: That's a sweet fucking delt, looks even sweeter. 
LIAM: You could be anywhere else, but you're here. 
SAM: I think I'd rather be here than with the best people in the world. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
ROBBIE: But-- 
ASHLEY: That's-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That was beautifully said. 
ASHLEY: You're the best. 
MARISHA: Wait, what is the tattoo? Is it the same as yours? 
ASHLEY: RTA. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, RTA, baby. 
SAM: RTA. 
TRAVIS: There are approximately 16 people in the world that'll give him anything he needs. (laughter) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wait, I want one. Later, later, later. 
TRAVIS: No. 
LAURA: (Jester) I'll give you a tattoo. You want a tattoo? 
ASHLEY: Chet! Well, sure! What do you want to do? 
LAURA: Well-- 
TALIESIN: I haven't even looked at mine. 
LAURA: Now it's-- Yours is so beautiful. 
TALIESIN: I didn't even look yet. 
ASHLEY: Wait, you did that? 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) I think we have to go. 
ASHLEY: Aw! 
MATT: (Gaz) "Hey, hey!" 
LAURA: I'll give you a tattoo at the wedding! Come to the wedding. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, okay. 
LAURA: Okay, come to the wedding. I'll give you a tattoo there. 
ASHLEY: Really? 
MATT: "Hey, Neiners, we got to go." 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: "All right. Hey." 
TALIESIN: Are we letting it be known? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "The other ones, good luck. Stay alive." 
LAURA: (Imogen) Thank you. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Remember-- 
MATT: "(snaps) Chop, chop." 
MARISHA: -- call us if you need us. 
LAURA: Right. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yeah, and you can call us anytime. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm just saying. Not here in this moment. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: (Veth) Should I protect any of them from psychic damage before we leave? 
TALIESIN: (Ashton) Actually, I would really, really like that. Yeah, I mean, it could go really bad. 
SAM: Is this going to be an hour? 
LAURA: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: I'll take an hour. 
MARISHA: Can you only do it to one person? 
LAURA: I think we might run into some-- 
SAM: I can do it to two people, but that's my high-- I can do it to one person, really. 
LAURA: Then give it to Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't want to-- I'm just a liability, honestly, on a certain level. 
LAURA: He's not very wise. 
SAM: All right. 
TALIESIN: Oh. Fuck you, too. You're right, though. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LAURA: I say in your head. 
LAURA and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
SAM: I will-- 
TALIESIN: I know that look. I know that fucking look! 
ASHLEY: I know what you said. 
LAURA: Don't you think about it. 
TRAVIS: What's your wisdom modifier? 
TALIESIN: My wisdom modifier? I'm blind. My wisdom modifier is plus one. 
ASHLEY: Oh, wow! 
TRAVIS: Better than me. 
ASHLEY: It's higher than Yasha. 
LAURA: Oh no. What's your wisdom? 
TRAVIS: Negative two. 
LAURA: Negative two?! 
ASHLEY: What?! Chet? 
TRAVIS: We're fine. We're fine. 
TALIESIN: That's not Chet. 
ROBBIE: Negative one. 
ASHLEY: I mean, Fjord? 
LAURA: What?! 
ASHLEY: Wait, Fjord or-- 
TALIESIN: That explains a lot, to be honest. 
LAURA: Chet. 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: Chet's is negative one. 
TALIESIN: My charisma is super low. 
SAM: I will whisper-- 
TRAVIS: Fjord is negative two. 
SAM: -- mutter some words that Caleb taught me and cast Intellect Fortress. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
SAM: On you. 
TALIESIN: I really appreciate that. 
SAM: Which I'm now reading for the first time. Yes, resistance to psychic damage. 
MATT: Is it concentration? 
SAM: It is. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no, no. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
LAURA: That's not going to-- 
TALIESIN: Nothing with-- Yeah, no concentration. 
LAURA: Don't do concentration. 
TRAVIS: We're just getting started. 
TALIESIN: No. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: It'll drop the second shit goes crazy. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: The minute you get hit, it's gone. 
TALIESIN: Or that you want to do any other spell. 
MATT: With concentration. Your Voltaic Bolt will cause it to drop. If you try and cast it on somebody else, it'll drop. You can do it, still. Just letting you know. 
SAM: I just wave my hands around. (laughter) 
LAURA: You don't feel much. I don't think he'll know. 
SAM: I'll hold his face. 
TALIESIN: This seems like a lot. I'll take it. 
SAM: (blows) I blow my hot breath in his face. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
SAM: Their face. 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
SAM: You're protected. 
TALIESIN: All right! All right! 
LIAM: The last 90 seconds while all that happened, Orym wordlessly grabbed Dorym-- Dorian's hand-- 
ROBBIE: (screeches) 
SAM: Dorym! 
MARISHA: Ship name! 
SAM and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: The ship name! 
ROBBIE: I love it! 
LIAM: It has happened. 
ROBBIE: Go on! 
LAURA: ♪ Shippy name ♪ 
LIAM: Give me a second. And pulls him out the door. Come here. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LIAM: I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know if we have 12 hours or 24 hours or no hours. I'm going to kiss you now. Can I kiss you? 
ROBBIE: Ohhh shit! Yes! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I grab-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
TRAVIS and ROBBIE: (excitedly scream) 
LIAM: I grab the sheer shirt and pull him in and give a nice, long kiss. 
MARISHA: Not the chaffon! 
LIAM: And for-- 
LAURA: Not the chaffon! 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What is that? 
LIAM: -- and forget everything, all the problems, everything, for 10 seconds. If we're here tomorrow, I'd really like to figure out this. If you want? 
ROBBIE: Oh, I want. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: And I'm going to kiss him back. 
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
SAM: As they're kissing, Braius is going to come around the corner with hope in his eyes and be like: Orym, I paint-- (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh, Braius. 
SAM: (dejected sigh) 
MARISHA: (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Punch right through it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
TALIESIN: If we have one last second, too, Ashton's going to really quickly run up to Fearne. I'm going to get right in your face. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Hi. I have a request. I have a very serious request. 
ASHLEY: Lay it on me. 
TALIESIN: If we survive this-- I open up a small pouch and it's filled with weird-ass mushrooms. I stole this off the weird cow one. Would you take half of these with me and see whatever the fuck happens? 
ASHLEY: I absolutely will. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You're the fucking best. 
ASHLEY: I can't even believe that you chose me for this fun adventure. 
TALIESIN: Who else? Honestly, you're-- I would do any fucking stupid thing you were ever down for. 
MARISHA: Amazing. 
ASHLEY: Promise? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I like you, and I'm bad at this because I don't think about the future ever, but-- 
ASHLEY: I don't either. 
TALIESIN: You're fun to adventure with. 
ASHLEY: You're fun to adventure with, too. I'll absolutely take those mushrooms with you. See what happens. 
TALIESIN: I have no idea what the fuck they're going to do. 
LIAM: Take them now. 
LAURA: Take them now. 
TALIESIN: That could go really poorly. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That could either go really well or really not well. 
TALIESIN: Flip a coin. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to put my arms around them and just give such a big hug. 
SAM: As they're hugging, I come around the corner. (laughter) 
SAM: Ashton, I got you a-- 
MARISHA: Oh my god! (laughter) (laughter) 
SAM: (dejected sigh) 
LIAM: Got to play to win! 
SAM: Never mind. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I love how many of those you have. I'm so impressed. 
ASHLEY: Those are so good. 
TALIESIN: It's so good! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Outstanding. 
SAM: It's just these two. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Now I'm even happier! 
TRAVIS: It's about timing. It's about timing. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: That makes me even-- Oh, now my heart breaks. 
TRAVIS: It's all about timing. 
MATT: Oh. 
ROBBIE: Goodness. 
MATT: Incredible. 
LIAM: Oy. 
MATT: So as-- As the Nein wave their goodbyes and trudge off with the cluster of the Volition deeper into The Villums of Vaterra Kreviris, you all begin to gather your things to prepare your journey. 
LAURA: Can I just, one last thing? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm sorry. I was going to do it mentally. 
MATT: Yeah, go for it. 
LAURA: I want to, in Caleb's head, I want to-- As they're walking away, I just want to say: Thank you for talking to me and giving me hope about other possibilities. 
LIAM: (Caleb) Well, now my hope is in you. I will see you tomorrow, Miss Temult. 
LAURA: Good luck, Caleb Widogast. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Keep up, Dirt Wizard! 
LIAM: Coming! 
MATT: As you watch them vanish, the rest of you, bringing your other things and you linger a minute, looking out towards them as they vanish into the city. 
LIAM: You know, I've been clean for years. (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's still fun to pick on you. Widdle, Widdle, Widogast. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I punch him. 
LIAM: I fall off the cliff. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Oh no! 
MATT: And a strange, familiar-- 
SAM: Oh! 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
MATT: -- screech begins to push into your mind. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MARISHA: What?! 
MATT: Close. Immediate. A storm stronger than any you've encountered in your dreams and nightmares. It whips around you. You feel tossed. Like you're unable to grasp the sides of a whirlwind. You hear your mother shouting for your name. "Imogen! Imogen!" 
LAURA: Mama! 
MATT: You see your shadow also drifting through the storm. (wind swooshing sound) 
LAURA: Mama?! 
MATT: "Imogen!" (wind whipping) You both kind of whip past each other with your arms out. Go ahea and make a dexterity saving throw for me. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Oh shit. 
SAM: Ruh-roh. 
TRAVIS: Unwarranted. 
LIAM: Dexterity? 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: To try and grasp her arm as you pass each other. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: Any d20 will do. 
LAURA: Shut up! (gasps) Yeah! 22! 
MATT: 22. (arms clasping) You clasp her arm and you catch yourself and she looks towards you and you see her, her skin itself flush with the purple energy. And as her arm reaches yours, you feel both of your bodies connect and you feel that latent, energetic essence of the Exaltant powers within both of you connect, her eyes burning bright and glowing as she holds you. "Imogen, I've tried-- I've tried to convince him. But he knows. He knows. And I'm sorry." 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: "I'm sorry." 
LAURA: It's all right, Mama. What is he going to do? 
MATT: You catch a glimmer of the back of her feet, the tips of her toes slowly starting to crumble. 
LAURA: (gasps) No! No, Mama! 
MATT: "Stop him." 
LAURA: (sobs) No! 
MATT: "Stop him." 
LAURA: (panicked breathing) Don't do it. 
MATT: "It hurts." 
LAURA: No, Mama! I can't stop it? 
MATT: "I don't know what's happening." 
LAURA: Can I pull her closer to me? 
MATT: You pull her close. 
LAURA: And I just want to hold her as tight as I can. 
MATT: You hold her. Make a perception check. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Oh fuck. 
LIAM: Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. 
LAURA: (thinking noises) 14? 
MATT: 14. You make out in this storm, the outer flashes of shadows of multiple figures standing around her. Reiloran shapes, humanoid shapes, all focused on her, holding her there with their minds. You just see the back of a figure facing away from her. Long hair. And what looks to be a faintly glowing funnel facing-- 
LAURA: No, no! 
SAM: Oh no! 
LAURA: No, no! No! 
MATT: She goes, "Stop him. No matter what happens, stop him." 
LAURA: No! No! 
MATT: (flashing sound) There's a flash of intense energy and a pain that strikes through your mind. And we're going to go to break. 
ALL: Oh! 
LIAM: I've had enough of this dude! 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
LIAM: That was brutal. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: I'm starting not to like him. 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
MATT: We'll return here, picking up with Mighty Nein's side of the assault-- (screaming) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MATT: -- in just a bit. See you in a second. 
TRAVIS: What is the matter with you?!

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So Mighty Nein, as you trek and wind through the somewhat empty streets of the Villums. being guided by Gaz Tomo, Rashinna, and numerous other figures that you could see at a glance would appear like various denizens of various cultural backgrounds, ancestry backgrounds of Ruidus with their supplies gathered up and evacuating the city. But you know what they carry with them to be a little more specific in its purpose to your coming events. You watch some of them into splinter off and head into other alleys and disparate streets, avoiding the roaming elements of the Imperium soldiers, themselves armored and watching around. There's still a thick bastion of guards that sit at the edge of each major street that are either accompanying and keeping watch on people that are leaving as well as keeping eyes peeled for the type of individuals like you that have nefarious plans from their perspective. How do you intend to make your way-- 
ALL: ♪ (high-pitched noises like "Makin' my way") ♪ 
MATT: -- through the city unnoticed? 
SAM: Oh, so we're not at the launch point. We have to make our way there? 
LAURA: No, we have to get to the launch pad. 
MATT: Correct. You're following Rashinna at the moment and again, Gaz is, you know, following up from the rear, but how are you masquerading yourselves? 
SAM: Oh, because we don't have Seeming on? 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: I can do Mask of Many Faces. 
TALIESIN: I can also-- 
TRAVIS: To look like a Reiloran. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look at-- Is Gaz approximately Caduceus's size or-- 
MATT: Gaz is probably close to nine feet tall? 
TALIESIN: Oh, so tall. 
MATT: Yeah, I mean, he's Reiloran Juggernaut or the hulks, as their actual subspecies. 
TALIESIN: So it would be odd if there was one around my size? 
MATT: You haven't really seen another one. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Question about the spell Seeming because that lasts eight hours and Caleb threw that up earlier. But once it's up there's no bringing it down and pulling it up or fading it because I don't want any of a number of our shenanigans to have been in alien form? 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: Correct. So Seeming has-- Well, I'll say for the purposes of the narrative since Seeming is still around and you being the majestic crafter of arcana that you are, there's no reason why I wouldn't think you wouldn't be able to dip the illusion and drift it back up and have it last that distance. 
LIAM: Dim and transparent. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Around us. 
LAURA: I like it. 
MATT: I allow that. 
LIAM: Thank you. 
SAM: So but it's still up? 
LIAM: Still up. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: All right. So you can maintain the shapes that you had before. Thank you for reminding me that you had Seeming still up. 
LIAM: You're a bormodo. 
SAM: I am and I know what that is. 
LIAM: The rest of us are (southern accent) Reilorans. 
LAURA: (Southern accent) All right. 
LIAM: (Southern accent) Reilorans? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You hear the echoing shriek from above of one of the Feskuls. The flying, cave-centric, leather-bat-winged creatures that are armored and surrounding and flying throughout the open space that is the dark subterranean skyline of Kreviris. Some appear to be natural and wild and following the energy of the city but a number of them appear to be armored and mounted. You can see there are various sentinels riding atop as they swoop and perch on different larger buildings and shift off again. I would like you to make a group deception check. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MATT: Because of Seeming, you do have advantage on these checks. 
TRAVIS: Time to die. Sorry, what? 
ASHLEY: Oh, I have disadvantage on deception. 
LAURA: (muttering) 
TALIESIN: You have advantage. We have advantage. 
MATT: Everyone has advantage. 
ASHLEY: Or not disadvantage. I'm minus two. 
TALIESIN: You're negative two. 
ASHLEY: Oh, good thing we have-- 
MARISHA: I rolled a 19 and a 20. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
SAM: How do I have a negative one to deception? 
TRAVIS: Good to be back. 
MARISHA: Let's go, baby. 
LAURA: Wow. I don't remember that about Nott. 
SAM: I guess I am-- 
LAURA: You were a terrible liar. 
SAM: I am bad with charisma. 
LIAM: Just cries. 
MATT: (laughs) All right, starting over here. 
LAURA: I am, too, that's why I have that-- 
TRAVIS: 25. 
MATT: 25. All righty. 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
SAM: Whoa. 
LIAM: Nice. 
LAURA: I don't have bad deception. 
LIAM: 21. 
MATT: 21. 
SAM: 17. I rolled well. 
LAURA: I rolled really bad. I rolled 12. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: 18. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Seven? 
SAM: Uh oh. 
TALIESIN: Good for you. 
LAURA: You don't often see Reilorans skipping around, but-- 
TRAVIS: We kill Yasha! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Hey! 
LIAM: Taliesin, I love your shirt. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. It's new. 
ASHLEY: I love that shirt. 
TRAVIS: We're just going to bleed you out a little. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's really good. It looks good with your hair. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MARISHA: I'll always think of you. 
MATT: As you shift, not as a tight clustered group but like a broken series of smaller groups to try and not draw as much attention. It can't be helped that the path you are taking is not in line with the exodus that most of the civilians are taking. You are actually heading deeper into the city. Along that path, there are a handful of imperial sentinels, Reilorans that are armored as well as one bormodo who is armored as well, keeping keen eyes out, inspecting, looking at individuals as they're passing by and they begin to follow a bit behind and the closer they get, eventually, Rashinna stops and looks back and sees them. Looks about the rest of you. "Anyone? "Hmm. No. I'll handle this." Looks about the rest of you realizing that none of you can speak psychically. To her awareness. 
LIAM: Caleb has a Ring of Telepathy and says: Is there a problem? in her mind. 
MATT: Her eyes narrow at you. "How convincing are your conversational skills in your mind's connectivity?" 
LIAM: Above average. 
MATT: She looks to Gaz. He waves. "Best you handle this." 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Guidance on Caleb. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: She covers her face and goes, "I'm too recognizable." And she pushes through the cluster of people to go towards the front as the soldiers begin to arrive. The bormodo goes, "Halt! Why are you trekking deeper into Kreviris?" The other flanking three other armored imperium soldiers step up with the bormodo. The bormodo, you can see, missing one eye has an empty skin-filled socket on one side. The other large dark eye, the cheeks themselves almost drooping like Droopy the Dog, a little bit, hanging down and swinging as it walks to approach you. Its breastplate looks like maybe it was a fitted for it maybe 10 years earlier in its youth and it's outgrown it in ways but still carries the station. Hairless on top and the mantle of wrinkled cloth, sits around its shoulder, looks like it's adorned with a few gold-colored rings that are placed on it that seem to present some sort of station. But as it moves up to you, "Why? Tell us." 
LIAM: So using the ring, Caleb will say: Business has been tasked to us by the Weave Mind and the less questions you ask, the better. 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
LIAM: Does the Seeming help with that as well or it's separate? 
MATT: The Seeming means that you don't have disadvantage. 
LIAM: Okay, got it. 
MATT: For a species of people that have not seen your normal height. 
LIAM: And I have Guidance. 
LAURA: Yes, you do. 
LIAM: That's a tiny die. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: What does it say? 
TRAVIS: I'll never understand tiny die. 
LIAM: I stole one of Ashley's dice. 
TRAVIS: Don't understand. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 17, 19 total. 
MATT: 19. 
MARISHA: That thing is minuscule. 
LIAM: This is made from-- 
LAURA: Is that meteorite? 
LIAM: This one is the bone. 
LAURA: Coprolite. 
LIAM: This one's bone. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: The bomordo glances at you, eyes you up and down, eyes the rest of the crew and Gaz reveals his forearms a bit and does a nod. 
LIAM: We have not time for this. 
MATT: "Very well. Wouldn't want to get in the way of Weave Mind business." And it turns around and takes a few steps into the other three and they all look at each other and they continue and walk away. 
LIAM: In your head you hear: My accent work is getting better. (laughter) 
SAM: I'll take your word for it. 
MATT: All right. You continue on following the groups as they push through. Who has the highest passive perception here? I'm trying to recall the-- 
LIAM: Probably Caddy, right? 
TALIESIN: I am 26. 
MATT: 26 for Caduceus? You notice, keeping an eye on the troop that you just spoke with, the three armored Imperium Reilorans the three armored Imperium Reilorans branch off shortly after they all look at each other as the bormodo approaches and circle around and you get an immediate sense that there is still question about. 
TALIESIN: They didn't buy it. 
LAURA: Ruh roh. 
TALIESIN: They might either be going to look for reinforcements or rolling around the back. 
SAM: How many are there? 
LIAM: Three plus one. 
MATT: Yeah. There was three Reiloran and one bormodo. 
SAM: Should we take them out? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, should we just kill them? 
TALIESIN: I don't think we can reach them anymore. 
LIAM: Yeah, our surroundings are what again? 
MARISHA: Are we out in the open? 
MATT: You are on the ground floor right now of the Villums, there are all manner of 10 to 20 foot tall buildings and these tight winding street ways and alleys. Some bridges that arch over in the way. It feels like a clustered, MC Escher-esque cityscape. 
MARISHA: Do we lead them down an alley? 
LAURA: I am going to-- 
LIAM: Quick and quiet. 
LAURA: -- Invoke Duplicity. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Are there any doors around, out of curiosity? Are we on a straight pathway or are there doors in other rooms or otherwise? 
MATT: There are openings. Some doors are closed. Some appear to be left open. 
TALIESIN: It seems like they're circling around? 
MATT: Yeah, the bormodo is out of sight as well as the other three. But what you noticed was the bormodo-- As you continued, fell out of sight while the other three dipped off into a side street while they were still paying some mind to your path. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to push one of the doors we're walking by open and just in case they're coming that way, you might want to have one of your-- 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- people run in there and I'll slam it shut. 
LAURA: I'm going to have one of my duplicates run in there and then I'm going to have another duplicate run down another alleyway and then I'm going to have another one run down another alleyway and peek her head out and run away. Leading in different direction. 
TALIESIN: The one that ran through the door, I'm going to have the door shut loudly enough that you can hear it. Just with Thaumaturgy. 
MATT: Okay, that's great. One of your duplicates rushes down the alley to the left of the path you were all taking. Can you see through the eyes of your duplicates? 
LAURA: I cannot. But I can talk through them. 
LIAM: You fought a whole PVP battle. 
LAURA: I know. 
LIAM: Hiding in a house. 
LAURA: Maybe I can. It's been a while. 
ALL: (mumbled sounds of ♪ "It's been a while" ♪)  
SAM: ♪ It's been a while! ♪ 
TALIESIN: ♪ A while! ♪ 
LAURA: The illusion as a bonus action can move. (reading rapidly) Nope, I don't see through it. 
MATT: I mean, if you're in a place with an opening, you could watch them. As long as they're in eye contact, you can cast spells through them. 
LAURA: I can. 
MATT: Which I see is limited visibility once they're there. I'll interpret it as that. But if it's out of sight, it's left to its own devices. You can still give instructions and such. But let's see here. 
LAURA: Yeah they might accidentally run through walls. I don't know. 
MATT: It can also go up to a maximum of 120 feet from you. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Great. So as it heads-- they all scatter off different alleys and spaces. You guys continue to walk on the path that you're on. Eventually, you begin to hear the sounds of chasing and footfalls falling in the direction of where one of the duplicates went. There's no shouts generally between Reiloran soldiers. The silent communication makes it hard to track where action is happening aside from the sound of activity. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: But there's enough that you pick up, Caduceus, as well in the direction of where one of these duplicates went where at least their chases begun, albeit a little off the beaten path. With this indication, Rashinna looks back and says, "Is there a problem?" 
TALIESIN: The beginnings of one. 
MATT: "Let us quicken our path to the Belfry. This way." 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I try to keep my duplicates as far away from us as we can and while still distracting them. 
MATT: Okay, so you keep them winding through alleys. 
LAURA: One of them singing, one of them laughing, one of them is casting Thaumaturgy to open all the windows and just making noise. 
MATT: (slamming) All the din that's happening is definitely pulling attention to those parts of you. Oddly dragging attention in the direction of your group, albeit 120 feet behind you and scattered off to the edges. But it's enough chaos that nobody is directly on your trail again and seem to be caught up in this goose chase. 
LIAM: That's nice. 
MATT: Make a deception check for me, if you could. 
LAURA: 21. 
MATT: 21. The distraction continues to keep them off your scent-- 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: -- for quite a bit before Rashinna ushers your troops off into a small homestead that you all go inside and it looks like it's been cleaned out. Anything of keepsakes, even the simple furniture that would've been here. There's that element of dust that's laid and you can see the spaces where anything of importance had been taken and leaving a more clean spot in the shape of what previously took it there. One of the various families that probably moved out and are heading towards their hopeful future in Exandria. You step into this particular building, Rashinna leads you out the back half of it into a secondary alleyway into the next building. You begin to realize that many of the homesteads here are not locked. There isn't really a locking mechanism on a lot of the homes here. 
SAM: Nice neighborhood. 
MATT: Maybe. Or the locks were taken by the people. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: But what proceeds then is a series of shifting from building to building to building as opposed to just open streets and alleys. You continue to drag your duplicates out of sight behind you, making the noise, but without really seeing where they're going. They're being ghostly pulled through walls as well as they go, which likely probably disorients and frustrates the pursuers. It doesn't take too long before Rashinna eventually brings you to this intersection with a circular core. In the middle, there is a three-tiered tower that rises up and a large belfry with a big, strange looking, dark metal bell that hangs in the center. She looks back at the rest of you. "This will be where we station it." She points to the left where you hadn't noticed quite yet. Once you peek out from the building, the Prime Pillar itself is right there among the large wall battlement that's set up separating the interior of the Prime Pillar's core base and the numerous varying heights of the buildings that fill this intersection as well. You can now glance at the incredible display of the Arx Creonum, this terrifying citadel, this stronghold that has constructed and built into the Prime Pillar. You can see numerous extended battlements and parapets, platforms, and extended alcoves that lead deeper into it. You can see these long, stretched windows that seem to rise up with it, made it the same glass as the pillar itself. It looks almost like a symbiotic life form that has been growing on the side of this glass. Whereas the glass gives that faint pale blue-green glow from top to bottom with that very, ever-so-gentle pulsating to wherever the energetic light source is within this glass. The citadel is a dark spot of stone that seems to grow through it, almost veined through parts of the glass itself and the further in, the shape becomes more crisp, beautiful, gothic even. You see large pillars that line the exterior of these various extended balconies and what looks almost like long pathways or odd red leafed gardens that have been grown on the exterior of it at different heights and levels. It is an odd, clustered interpretation of what a temple and a castle would look like through the eyes of someone who can only interpret through dreams and time. 
LIAM: Salvador Dalí. 
MARISHA: How massive is it? Is it standard, like a single chamber temple size or does it feel like we are about to go on a crawl to find these guys? 
MATT: The scale's a little hard here when you look up because the pillar is so massive. It's like staring into the the Grand Canyon, and you can't really make out scale on the larger pieces until you compare it with smaller ones. You glance up and you begin to see soldiers, Feskul winged beasts perching and landing and flying around, and that's the best moment you have for size comparison. It is a massive stronghold. It looks, for your comparison here, probably comparable to Castle Ungebroch in the center of Rexxentrum. 
SAM: Oh wow. 
MATT: If not a bit larger. But instead of being a central structure, it is more stretched and wide and pressed into the side of the pillar. So imagine if you take a central stronghold, and, from what you can see, smear it on the outside of a glass pillar. 
MARISHA: That's so old. 
LIAM: You mentioned a bell. How high above us is that bell? 
MATT: The belfry sits about three stories up. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Do we have to get up to the belfry to go? 
MATT: Rashinna continues to lead you into the structure itself. As she heads to the main doorway there, it is barred it seems. She concentrates for a second, and you hear a faint whistle on the opposite side. She responds with a whistle in kind, and the door unlatches and opens. On the inside another bormodo, an older female bormodo opens the door and ushers you all in quickly. As you begin to dart in, you begin to hear the sounds of heavy footfalls of following soldiers, Imperium guardians that have been keeping your tail, following the many Jesters. Do you maintain your duplicates? 
LAURA: Those would drop by now. 
MATT: Right, because they only last for about a minute, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So they vanished, and you can hear them moving, they're now scattering far and wide trying to keep a wide berth-- 
SAM: Oh, good. 
MATT: -- since they have no real bead on where you are, having been sent throughout the various capillary alley networks. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: You wait for a few beats until eventually a watch out comes down from below the belfry and goes-- Looks over to Rashinna, Rashinna nods. Still odd for the Mighty Nein, noting conversations quietly happening between different denizens of this location, this city. But Rashinna turns back around and goes, "We should be good to begin setting up our cannon. We have some of our cannoneer engineers at the ready. We'll have them go and build this upon the belfry itself. I guess get yourselves as ready as you are," and she tosses a heavy, duffle bag-like thick satchel. It hits the ground, opens a bit, and you hear the sounding of metal clanking against metal, leather squeaking, and looking inside you can see these strapped harnesses with heavy metal hooks. On each of them, one large hooking device that clamps around like a large carabiner, but within the top of it, it has two prongs that go over and within it you can see green teal glass wheels that are set inside. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
MATT: So three of these are placed at your feet. 
SAM: Did we ever figure out who's going to use these? 
MARISHA: Yasha's going to take one. 
ASHLEY: I think I'll take one. 
MARISHA: I think Jester-- 
LAURA: Caduceus is going to take one. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: And then Caduceus. 
LAURA: Yeah, if nobody else needs it, then I will. 
ASHLEY: I'd probably try to hold somebody as well. You want to just wrap yourself around my body? 
SAM: I could. 
ASHLEY: You really could. 
SAM: I could do Spider Climb, but-- Why aren't you looking at me, Beau? We're trying to make a plan. 
MARISHA: Sorry, there's a lot going on. 
TRAVIS: Something about your ear? 
MARISHA: Yeah, something. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Oh, they're just catching on. 
LAURA: Look at the little baby! 
ASHLEY: Just a little baby! 
LIAM: That's a baby. 
TALIESIN: I haven't seen that in a while. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I still have my baby fat. 
ASHLEY: I love her! 
MARISHA: I had just moved to LA. I was probably like 19. 
LAURA: So cutie! 
ASHLEY: I love her. 
LAURA: Look at your Claire's jewelry. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
SAM: It's Photoshop. 
MATT: Yeah. Your arm's too low though. The true pose is up here. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: This is your first head shot? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: An early headshot? 
MARISHA: (dismissive mumble) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: It was five years ago. 
LIAM: Tell me everything. 
MARISHA: Whatever. (laughter) 
LAURA: Is that a butterfly necklace? 
MARISHA: Something like that. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MARISHA: I think it was a stars, red, white, and blue T-shirt that I probably got at Forever 21, I don't know. 
TRAVIS: Assaulting the belfry, assaulting the belfry. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We're here. 
SAM: I mean, I could do Spider Climb unless someone could carry me. 
MARISHA: I should be able to-- 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: --to run across the cables. How much of an incline is it? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) "I should be able to run across the cables." 
MATT: You don't know yet. From where you are-- 
LAURA: You're such a cool monk, of course you can do it. 
MARISHA: I really want to do that. 
SAM: I want to do that, too. 
MATT: Make an investigation check for me. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 
MATT: This is going to be you stepping up to the higher level of the belfry where they're currently assembling this device-- 
MARISHA: Use my Beau dice. 
MATT: -- this cable cannon. 
MARISHA: My Beau die for monk shit. 
LIAM: Come on. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 20 total. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: 20's not bad. 
TRAVIS: It's not bad. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: The incline from where you are is going to be probably about 25 to 30 degrees up. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: That feels pretty steep. 
TRAVIS: That's a little steep. 
SAM: But-- 
ASHLEY: Wait, 25 degrees. 
SAM: You're going to stick to it? 
LAURA: No, she's going to run it. 
ASHLEY: You could do that. 
LIAM: Level 20 monk. 
SAM: With Spider Climb. 
LAURA: You could run it. 
MARISHA: I don't have Spider Climb. 
TRAVIS: No, she's going to monk it. 
SAM: Oh, you're going to monk it. 
MARISHA: You're thinking of the dead one. 
LIAM: She can run on water. 
LAURA: Of course she can do it. 
LIAM: It feels plausible. 
MARISHA: I can run on water. 
SAM: But she could fall. 
LIAM: She could glide to the bottom and then we just say goodbye. 
MATT: What's the point of having a monk if not running across cables. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Exactly! 
LIAM: Exactly. 
MARISHA: I just want to Naruto run this-- 
TALIESIN: Somebody had to say it. 
MARISHA: -- like it's fucking Area 51. 
MATT: Hell yes! I'm here for it. 
LIAM: You got to put your arms back. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'll try it! 
MATT: Okay, so no harness. 
ASHLEY: You'll do it. 
MARISHA: If it goes poorly, we'll figure it out. 
LIAM: I am going to-- 
MATT: Oh, I have rules for this, don't worry. 
LIAM: -- wing it as per usual and I can bring a passenger, maybe two. Anyone? No. 
LAURA: I mean we have three harnesses, right? 
MATT: There are three harnesses. 
SAM: I just want to race. 
MARISHA: However we're going to go. 
LAURA: Maybe you can be on Beau or Nott catching duty in case one of them fall. 
SAM: That's a good idea. 
LIAM: Do I think Beauregard can run the cable with me like Yoda in a backpack? 
LAURA: No, no I meant you glide underneath and if she falls, you can catch her. 
LIAM: Sure, I will be your safety bird. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Caleb, using the ring, speaks to Rashinna in their mind. The bell up there, its purpose is what? Ornamental? An alarm? 
MATT: "The bell serves the purpose that those who wish to gather and dream communally during certain times of the year, it would be what calls those to the center of these streets. It once was considered, or at least were designed to be indicators of conflict before the unification under the Imperium. However, this tonight is only going to represent a position out of sight and just enough distance to get to our destination unnoticed." 
LIAM: Understood. 
SAM: Matthew? 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: Spider Climb lets you climb up walls and ceilings. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Ropes? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, a surface. A rope you could Spider Climb and climb across it. 
TRAVIS: A minotaur? 
MARISHA: Sticky. (laughter) 
LAURA: You want to Spider Climb up that minotaur? 
SAM: I will cast Spider Climb. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: And waste a spell-- 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
SAM: -- to beat you. 
MARISHA: Let's go, bitch. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go. 
MATT: All right, Spider Climb, dope monk shit, flight. 
LIAM: Giant eagle. 
MATT: All right. Who is taking what else? Any other harnesses? 
TRAVIS: I will also cast Fly from Star Razor. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Nice. 
LIAM: I could give you a ride, but I kind of want to see this. 
MARISHA: Yeah, well we have-- 
LIAM: Don't fall. 
MARISHA: We got to settle this. 
SAM: I have a firearm. 
MARISHA: You better not shoot me in the ass, Brenatto. 
SAM: Also probably makes a lot of noise. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I'll wrap it up in some cloth. Maybe that'll-- 
MATT: Great, yeah. 
MARISHA: I think I still have the arrow tip in my ass from seven years ago. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. You see Gaz has his harness, is in the process of connecting it. It has cross straps, torso straps. It's meant to be a fairly decent load-bearing harness, though even on him, he's like, "(grunting)" (latch clicks) "Yeah, that'll do." 
LAURA: Are we all going to be on this thing together? 
MATT: "I mean, as far as I know, that's the plan. Once the big boom goes boom, we go boom to the boom." 
SAM: (laughs) It's one line. We're all on one line? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
SAM: So we got to pick an order? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
ASHLEY: Oh, so there's not multiple-- 
MATT: "I mean there are multiple, at different towers, different stations." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. This is our tower. 
MARISHA: No, you're going to-- 
MATT: "This is our tower. Down here it's our tower." 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: You're going to be psychically pushing us along? 
MARISHA: That's actually a good idea. 
MATT: "Yeah," looks to Rashinna. She's like, (Rashinna) "To the best of his ability, yes. But if you have any sort of backup means of transportation--" 
LAURA: We do, we do. But you can push three of us, right? 
MATT: (Gaz) "Yeah, I can-- Yeah, we're good." 
TRAVIS: I can also help push. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: As I float in the air. 
SAM: Oh, Fjord! 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LAURA: Hold onto my hand, Fjord, and just hold me on the harness and scooch me along. 
TRAVIS: Can you read my mind? (laughter) 
LAURA: What does she say? I don't remember what she says. 
MARISHA: (like Lois Lane) "Can you read my mind?" (laughs) 
MATT: "Okay, anyone else need help putting one of these on?" 
TRAVIS: ♪ Can you hear my voice ♪ 
ASHLEY: I think I've got it. 
TALIESIN: That looks right. 
ASHLEY: Click on. 
MATT: "Yes, got to snap the thing on the side there." 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
ASHLEY: All right. Ooh. 
MATT: "All right, there you go. Sorry, did I get your skin on that one?" 
ASHLEY: Yeah, no that's okay. 
MATT: "My sincerest apologies." 
ASHLEY: It wakes me up a little bit before battle. 
MATT: "All right. All right, so we got one, we got two--" 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: "-- we got three. All right so, quick little safety tip instructional." 
MARISHA: Whee! 
LAURA: I'm kicking my feet. 
LIAM: We're at a tree top-- 
TRAVIS: Sign your waivers. 
LIAM: Yeah, we're at a tree top obstacle course. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: "Make sure to check each one of your buckles and straps, that they're nice and tight and not going to come undone. Go ahead and tighten it around you." 
LAURA: I love when the carnival comes to town. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: "Second, when we get up and the cable's affixed, take your little hook-delio and put it around the cable. We're going to go ahead and figure out an order. Probably stay at least a few feet across in case somebody slides back, it's not going to knock us all off or something." 
LAURA: Oh, right. 
MATT: "Then when we're all ready to go, I'm going to go ahead and concentrate." 
TALIESIN: Why? 
LAURA: Hold onto my hands, Fjord. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, 100%. 
TALIESIN: What's the concentrating about? You got to-- 
LAURA: He's going to psychically push us along. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 
MATT: "I make the wheels go." 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm even more worried now that I know he has to concentrate. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I mean. 
ASHLEY: Can we help you in any type of way? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: "Yeah. Be light. Think light thoughts." 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Guidance on Gaz. 
MARISHA: Just don't distract him. 
MATT: "Oh, that felt good." 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it gives you a little boosties. 
MATT: How long does it last? 
LAURA: I think it's a min-- Until you're-- I don't know. (laughs) I'm making it up. 
TALIESIN: It lasts a minute. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do it right before we go. 
MATT: "Cool, I'll take it." 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: (pulsing) 
MATT: "Thank you." Rashinna eventually returns with a few other figures. Themselves, their heads are masked over their face with dark hoods. Their armor itself is a blackened leather with a soft hide and patches. 
LIAM: Reiloran shinobi. 
MATT: They're all dressed darkly to obscure their selves. 
LIAM: Reiloran shinobi. 
MATT: You see Rashinna now wears most of the same armor. They have these large pouches on the side and as they move, you can hear the clinking of some sort of a glass material. She comes down to you, Nott. 
SAM: Oh, that's me, this is my job. 
MATT: (Rashinna) "All right. So you assured us that you are quite familiar and capable when it comes to volatile chemicals." 
SAM: I'm very, very capable. I'm good with measuring, I'm good with handling delicate things. 
MATT: "Good. Then you'll come with us." She tosses you an outfit-- 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: -- to match theirs. (laughter) 
LIAM: (explosion) 
TRAVIS: Not a good time. 
SAM: All right. 
LAURA: Are you going to be back in time? 
SAM: Oh, we're leaving separately? 
MATT: "The demolition team has to get there first." 
SAM: Great! 
MATT: "Detonate the side, and that's the sign for the rest to come up on the cables." 
LAURA: Oh, okay. But you'll be able to meet back up with us really fast, though, yes? 
SAM: Of course, of course. We're all going to go in the same hole. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
SAM: Right? 
MATT: "That's the idea." 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: "So--" 
SAM: I'm going to time myself. 
MARISHA: All right, all right. 
SAM: And you're going to time yourself. 
MARISHA: Deal. 
SAM: Honor system. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Start counting. 
LIAM: (squawks in time) (laughter) 
MATT: The older bormodo comes down the steps and goes, "Rashinna, they've completed the cannon. I think we're placed." She goes, "Very well, good work. So now we just wait until the time is right. In the meantime, I'll teach you how to deal with our payload." 
SAM: Yes, please do. 
MATT: Rashinna pulls you off the way. 
MARISHA: She's good at handling payloads. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: She nods. "Indeed." 
SAM: (laughs) I got it. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: You meet the rest of the demolition team that is present here. There are two others that are here, and you're instructed there are other teams in these other towers as well. These cables are being sent up and then the teams are going to trek. They're going to set these explosives. Once they're placed, they're set on a time detonation to give you all chances to essentially rappel out of the way or hide from the immensity of it. It's up to you all to find a place to keep safe for the detonation. 
SAM: So, sorry, just to get the order of operations. Cannons, fire, cords. 
MATT: Mm-mm. 
SAM: Right? 
MATT: Yep, then the demo team. 
SAM: Demo team clambers up, sets the-- 
TRAVIS: Charges. 
SAM: -- charges, and comes back down or just hides away? 
MATT: Hides away. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: I mean, some might come down, but those who are part of the strike team are remaining there for the others to meet up. 
SAM: Then the rest of the team is also clambering up before the explosion or after the explosion? 
MATT: After the explosion. 
SAM: Got it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Question. I have a telepathy ring melded into my wing? Am I able to think to-- (laughter) 
LIAM: Am I able to think to my friends as Caleb? 
TRAVIS: That was close. 
SAM: In bird language. (laughter) 
MATT: I mean, the Ring of Telepathy, as per the spell, yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Quack. 
MARISHA: (mumbles) It's not so bad. 
LIAM: Maybe you could hide up inside of the bell. You hear in your head. It's metal protection, if the explosive is set above this structure of the bell. 
SAM: The bell is where we are; we're going up here. 
LIAM: Oh, I thought we were going to the bell. 
LAURA: No, no, no, we're in the belfry now. 
MATT: You're in the belfry now. 
LIAM: Got it, okay. 
MATT: And that's where the contraption is being set up and you're all going to be leaving from here to the Arx Creonum proper. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Okay, I've got my assignment. 
MATT: Okay. She kind of-- 
SAM: I don't have my assignment. (laughter) 
MATT: No, you all still in this waiting period are gathered and told that the intent is when the detonation happens, there are additional cable setups if need be. Should there be sort of any damage sustained to the original grapple point, and additional ones will be fired if that's the case. The reason not everyone's going there right now is that much traveling will likely call attention to the demo team and would completely eliminate the need for this. But the distraction of the explosion will one, probably take out a number of the defenders of the Arx Creonum, and also leave a very vulnerable point of entry amongst the chaos that, if utilized rapidly, would allow your strike team to get far into the Arx Creonum before they can truly rally a defense around the Weave Mind. There will be defenders there. The place is still well defended, though much of the military has been placed further out into Ruidus, or heading towards Exandria. But that is the expected plot. Partway into the final elements of this description, a message comes to you, Caleb. (Allura) "Mighty Nein. The assault is beginning. The armies rally on the Key." 
LIAM: A giant bird head swivels to Beau. (squawks) You hear: It has begun, in your head. 
LAURA: It has begin. 
ASHLEY: (whisper) It has begin. 
LIAM: That is terrible High German. What's going on? Oh, my tag is still on. (laughter) 
LAURA: How long have you been wearing it? How does it still have a tag on it? 
LIAM: 30 minutes. 
SAM: Oh okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: All right everybody, it's go time. 
LIAM: It's the first time I've ever worn it. 
LAURA: It looks so good. 
MATT: Rashinna looks to you. 
LIAM: (squawks) 
MATT: "It is time?" 
MARISHA: It's time. 
LIAM: (deep squawk) 
LAURA: Oye. 
MATT: "Very well. Demolition team, with me. The rest of you, stay atop with Gaz. He'll get you situated when the moment is right, correct?" 
SAM: Thank you, Yasha. 
MATT: "You bet your sweet you." "All right." 
SAM: (chuckles) 
MATT: Rashinna treks up with you. You all take and triple check that all of your containers are kept close to you. 
TALIESIN: Too bad you can't carry them either. 
LAURA: That's true. 
MATT: Your harnesses are clipped to your bodies. One by one, you all set around the contraption. The engineers that are set, kept low at this point, notice you all coming up. Aim it. Situate it. One of them pulls out a small glass orb and flicks it on and off. 
SAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MATT: Four times. You see it, two other rooftops, similar orb flickering in a similar pattern. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
SAM: I'm going to tie-- 
TALIESIN: How organized. 
SAM: -- a piece of fabric around my eyes with two little eye holes. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, like a Ninja Turtle. 
SAM: Purple, purple. 
MATT: Yeah. God, I love being a halfling. 
LIAM: For no particular reason. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MATT: As they pull the orb back, the engineers get down clutching the sides of this device, shifting it, aiming it. You see one of them is concentrating on it. Puts a finger up. All three of them look at each other and they all focus on the device. You see all of the Ruidian glass throughout its structure begin to glow in a light and you see the grappling hook begin to pull back into it as a portion of some sort of infused runic glyph on the back begins to get brighter and brighter and brighter until with very little sound, (whooshing) it fires off and the cable snaking behind it. You see then other points of light. (whooshing) They all dip at an arc and then pick up-- 
SAM: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: -- as the engineers continue to focus on it. You can see them all training their eyes on it, psychically carrying it at its apex trajectory until eventually all of them, (thudding) affix to the outside of the under point of one of the cluster of massive, outreaching balconies that carry multiple gardens and smaller structures that adorn the exterior of the Arx Creonum. As all the cables hit and begin to bow, the engineers-- 
LAURA: It's you. (laughter) 
MATT: The engineers then focus back to the machine and you watch as it, (whirring) begins to wind up the cable as one of them takes and ratchets the grappling end to it to one of the belfry's massive pillars that affix to the top there. As that situates in and they tighten it in, they lock it. You can now see it's now a completely taut cable between here and the Arx Creonum. Rashinna turns around. "We have very little time. Now." 
TRAVIS: Go. 
MATT: She hooks up her harness. The other demo individuals hook it up there and you? 
SAM: Cast Spider Climb. 
MATT: Cast Spider Climb. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: With that, Rashinna concentrates and you watch as the, where these hooks are, they begin to glow where the glass wheels are and the harnesses (whooshing) begin to zip up as a cluster along this cable, this impossibly long cable. 
SAM: Go. (laughter) 
LAURA: While that's happening, I'm going to touch Caduceus's shoulder and then reach out and touch Caleb Bird. I'm going to cast with a Ring of Spell Splitting, Death Ward on both of them. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to go in for another hug and cast Death Ward on this one. 
SAM: Aw. 
TALIESIN: You know, we're family. 
MATT: Great. 
MARISHA: Don't touch me. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: I am Keen Mind timing Veth's progress. 
MARISHA and MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm using movement, action to dash, and also bonus action dash. 
MATT: Right, at a total speed of? 
SAM: 90. 
MATT: So 30 each? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Pop, pop, pop. All right, that's 90 feet a round as you (rapid footsteps) over to the side there. 
SAM: Maybe I run under, just for flavor. 
MATT: That's true, you could (footsteps). You are moving at a faster speed than these harnesses are going. You watch as the demo experts who are hanging on and gliding up, see you bypass them from underneath. You start on top and then curve down underneath-- 
LAURA: That's awesome. 
MATT: -- and keep going. 
ASHLEY: So cool. 
MATT: They like, give a nod of an impressed essence, as you all (zooming). You can feel like as you're moving, the cable is gently shifting just from the sheer length of it and the movement of you moving on it. So you have this odd changing. You can see above in the cable has very faint snaking quality to it at that length. But the immensity of the Arx Creonum approaches larger and larger and the scale of it causes you to feel smaller and smaller as you approach. You can see now along the outer edges, numerous armored soldiers that are looking out over the city that haven't yet caught wind of your group. Yet. I would like you to make a stealth check, please. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: Along with the rest-- 
LAURA: I should have given-- 
MATT: -- of this troop here. 
LAURA: -- you Blessing of-- 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: -- the Trickster before you went. 
SAM: Oh wait, I get advantage. 
LAURA: Good. 
MATT: Oh hey. 
SAM: I'm going to have an enormous-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Schwanzstucker. 
SAM: Is that-- That's better. 35. 
MATT: (laughs) They actually all rolled really well too. Yeah, they rolled in ascending order. It was like a natural 12, 13, then a 14 plus their bonuses. So yeah, your whole troop glides up and you can see the numerous creatures that call this cavern landscape home. The armored and natural feskuls sweeping through. You can briefly look down as you're hanging upside down into the whole city beneath you and it's the first time you really get a true glance of the scale and scope of Vaterra Kreviris, the underside of this massive city. It is like a wild, textured, incredible metropolis of mixed dreamscapes and at this time, a draining blood life. Like you can see much of the city where the cluster of the masses of the populace are all exiting out one side. The rest of the streets are left fairly barren by comparison. You can see as the areas that are more abandoned, some of the natural burrowing creatures of the land are moving in to places that are a little more available now. You can see dozens of scattered, massive insectoid creatures that have begun to carve through and tear through some of the buildings. Apparently, it seems that just the very presence of the society here was enough to keep these creatures at bay from naturally destroying what's there. And nature is reclaiming. (chuckles) But with that, you get closer and closer to the massive citadel and cruising up underneath this cable. The pillar-- It's hard because you're moving so quickly and yet everything is slowly getting larger, which makes it feel that much more massive in scope. You can see along these outer battlements of the Arx Creonum, there are all manner of strange ballista. You can see there are soldiers and figures that are at the ready keeping an eye out. There is definitely an air of expectation of something. But none catch sight of your team. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: As you get towards the end of this cable, you're the first to arrive there, definitely, and the rest of the team takes a moment to catch up to you as their harnesses (whooshing) get there. 
SAM: I'll catch them so it's a soft, quiet landing. 
MATT: Well, you get there first and this is like a sheer cliff face wall. Like the Arx Creonum structure, it seems to have been much like the fortress and the surrounding, the buildings and structures here seem to be psychically formed and molded from the rock and surrounding materials. You can see towards the base of this massive stronghold, it's more of a rougher natural texture that gets smoother and more refined once it becomes the actual fortress. Down here it's a bit rougher where the grappling hook is set in, but there are alcoves there and you have some of the supplies that you were given as part of this, hammering a hook, latch yourself there. There are shelves and some outcroppings that can be climbed. So with that, you pull out your materials, set a couple of things to lock yourself safely in place. Although you have Spider Climb, you're not too worried about it, actually. But help keep them a safe space. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: They come in and they transition their harnesses over to the safety pitons that you've put in there. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Eventually when they've all arrived everyone pulls out climbing gear and begins to, (clanking) these large hand bound spikes. It looks like pieces of really dense bone that come out of the hands and you all begin to Spider-Man climb along the side of this rock. Now it's a point of finding amongst the base of this stronghold where you are, the weakest points. I'd like for you to make either a nature or an investigation check, your choice. 
LAURA: Oh gosh. It's all up to you? 
SAM: Investigation, please. I didn't know that, but I will do investigation. Guidance, I don't have that. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: Oh! 28. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: 28. As your team scatters off a bit, all looking for the best places to be able to deploy your explosive payload. (laughs) He's waiting for it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You begin to rummage through the vials that you have, the rough glass interior. You can see this dull, green, somewhat clear liquid and there's a very, very strong chemical smell to it. As you move it in there, it seems to be almost putty in how thick it is. 
SAM: Putty? 
MATT: (laughs) Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: It's putty. 
MATT: But you immediately can find open cracks and elements of the stonework in here that would definitely drop some heavy sections of the front of the citadel if enough explosive were to go off there at once. So you begin to set them, one, two. You're connecting them all with the main fuse cables. You're uncertain, are these fire cables? You don't see what looks like gunpowder. Any sort of black powder that would ignite a common fuse that you've utilized on ship cannons and being a powder monkey before. They're just like a cable that affixes them all. As you're looking at it, you hear Rashinna speak into your mind, "I'll handle that, just set them in place." 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: As you've tethered all these cables together and you're all moving so quickly right now, it takes you just about a minute to get all of them set in place and strung together on one long set of cable. 
SAM: Uh-oh. My Spider Climb only lasts a minute. 
MATT: You might want to cast it again. 
SAM: I might want to cast it again. 
MARISHA: Wait, Spider Climb? 
SAM: Doesn't it? 
MARISHA: It lasts an hour. 
TALIESIN: No. 
SAM: It lasts an hour, sorry. 
LAURA: Whew. 
MATT: I was like, okay. I thought it lasted longer than that. 
SAM: I don't know how spells work. (laughter) 
MATT: At that point, you get yourselves to safety. Rashinna goes, "Now, as far that way as we can. Find a place that is not tethered to the collapse that is about to happen. So let us go along." She begins to climb. The rest of the group begins to clamber along. 
SAM: They're so intense. I like it. 
MATT: About another minute goes by. 
MARISHA: She ignores you. 
MATT: As Rashinna looks back and narrows her eyes at the one dangling fuse and a little green spark. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Sick. 
MATT: As opposed to burning, it just begins to glow. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Like a bit of phosphorescent liquid going through a tunnel or a pipe. 
TRAVIS: Green glow? 
MATT: Yeah, just. Following through. You all climb as fast as you can out of the way. There is one section of the stonework here that is a mentally crafted pillar. It is a solid pillar with space behind it and it looks like it's pretty heavily fixed to the rock. Make a nature check for me. 
SAM: Nature. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: Not my best. 11. 
MATT: 11, it looks like it could be safe. 
SAM: Okay, okay, sure. Sounds good to me. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: This'll hold. I mean, I point to them and cast Message. This'll hold. 
MATT: (chuckles) You all begin to maneuver over to this little alcove where this pillar is carved. It's carved below and then penetrates the rock shelf above it and it continues on into the rest of the citadel above. You all move behind it now, not having to be stuck to the wall. You're all have a place to stand and get behind the pillar. As you move, Rashinna goes, "I think we've been spotted. But it shouldn't be a point of worry. They'll definitely know we're here in about--" (explosions) These explosion detonate and reverberate throughout the entirety of this cavernous chamber. The open space here itself is a closed echo chamber. So the explosive sounds reverberate and continue to bounce around. The rest of you below can see these incredible bright green-blue explosions of flame and arcane power (blasting) flashing outward before dissipating into a soft mist. But in the moment after these explosions go off, you can feel the collective air of the city pause for a moment. As there is now this (cracking). 
SAM: Oh, uh-oh. 
MARISHA: Damn. 
MATT: An entire, probably a good third of the front of the Arx Creonum cracks up in multiple places and then. (rumbling) 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: Whoa. 
MATT: Begins to just slide off the Prime Pillar. 
TRAVIS: It's like a glacier shelf. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: A third-- 
LAURA: Awesome. 
MATT: (rumbling) 
LIAM: -- of a massive structure. 
MATT: With it, who knows how many Imperium soldiers who were defending the Weave Mind are lost and in its wake, a massive cloud of ground stone, glass dust begins to fill and consume the rest of the front of the entire fortress, obscuring the vision to it. At this point, the cable goes slack. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: And falls back down. At which point, the engineers already retort. They've already prepared for this, they cut the cable as soon as it snapped, they move around, put it in another spool, another grappling hook, and (blast) fire off second rounds. You now can hear the sounds of shouts. The first time you've really heard shouting soldiers having to reach out to whoever they can without the use of direct-direct telepathy. The languages, in some cases, are hard to even make out words if they aren't just cries for attention. But all attention right now is on the Prime Pillar as the massive, and I say massive section of the Arx Creonum continues to fall. The sheer immensity of it seems like it's slow-mo as it still plummets and breaks apart, leaving that trail of debris and dust behind it. (thud) As the cable hits, pulls taut. With that, Gaz goes, "All right, kids, looks like it's time!" Clips on. 
ASHLEY: You ready? Oh, let's fucking go. 
LAURA: Guidance! 
MATT: "Let's friggin' do." (laughter) 
MATT: All the wheels on your harnesses glow, and (whooshing) begin to drag the three of you along with Gaz as the caboose, up the cable. Now, because of the intensity and you can feel now the shockwave as it (booming) comes back and knocks your hair back as you clip onto this and begin to move forward. The cable is shaking at this point. You and the demo team, the explosion rocks the interior and stones begin to fall from the space that you're hiding. Make a dexterity saving throw. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
SAM: Heads up! Save or check? 
MATT: Save. 
SAM: 20. 
MATT: 20. You only take-- 
SAM: Watch out. 
MATT: -- five points of bludgeoning damage as elements of the nearby stonework falls and cracks around. Some catches you in the shoulder, one hits you in the back, but they're smaller stones. But this alcove holds, holds for the most part. The pillar that you're behind cracks a little bit and you can see whatever load bearing this was, it's still bearing. Barely. With that, Rashinna turns back to you and says, "All right." Looks then at the demo team. "Those who are going in, come with us. Those who aren't, once the strike team arrives, back to the city and run." They all nod and just wait at the ready. Rashinna looks to you. "Let's meet your friends up top," and leaps up and starts climbing up the side of the stones to meet where these new cables are grappled. 
SAM: So intense. 
MARISHA: (laughs) With Evasion, do I take half damage or zero damage? 
MATT: Oh, with Evasion, you take zero. 
SAM: (snickering) 
MATT: ♪ The rogues are back in style ♪ 
ALL: ♪ The rogues are back in style ♪ (laughter) 
SAM: It took a little while. You got there. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: (whooshes) 
MATT: While the rest of you are cruising up, either on the cable and around it, it's going to take seven rounds to ascend this cable. 
LAURA: Oh my goodness. 
MATT: So. 
MARISHA: Seven rounds. 
TRAVIS: As a flyer, I'll be 15 feet down and 10 feet behind wherever Jester and Company are. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: I'm going to do that, but 15 feet up and behind Beauregard in case I need to dive. 
MATT: Okay. Beauregard, you're racing across for time. 
MARISHA: Seven rounds at their pace? 
MATT: At the pace that the harnesses are going, it's seven rounds to get up there, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. You're running full speed, or are you staying with the group? 
MARISHA: I'll run full speed. 
MATT: Great. Yeah. All right. 
MARISHA: Because I have a time to beat. 
MATT: That's what I was checking. 
TRAVIS: Which is 140 feet a round? 
LIAM: Let's go, Marisha. 
TRAVIS: 200 and-- 
LAURA: Oh, you can totally-- 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Yeah, unless she stumbles. 
MARISHA: Unless I stumble. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Is that 210 feet or just 140 feet? 
MARISHA: Well, yeah, because I have 70 feet of movement dashing. 
MATT: So you're moving 70 naturally. 
MARISHA: 70. 
MATT: Right. 
SAM: Climbing is halved, right? 
LAURA: Jesus! 
MARISHA: But then, so movement, dashing, but then I can also bonus action-- 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: -- dash, right? 
MATT: But you can Step of the Wind. 
MARISHA: I can Step of the Wind. 
MATT: Spend a ki point to do that. 
SAM: But climbing is half speed. 
TRAVIS: Ki points are valuable. 
MATT: Climbing is half speed. So you could climb comfortably at half speed or you could dash and make acrobatics checks along the paths so you cover the distance. 
MARISHA: No, I'm dashing. 
MATT: Great. Let's go! 
TALIESIN: I disapprove of this. I cast Ray of Enfeeblement. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Ray of Enfeeblement? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (groans) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Bro! 
MARISHA: I can barf and still run. 
MATT: All right, so we're going to do Beau first because she's going to get there before anybody, unless she fails. Sorry. So your speed is 70. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So that's 140. That's 210 feet per round. You will clear the length of this cable in four rounds. 
LIAM: You have this. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Warm it up. 
LIAM: You have this! 
TRAVIS: Warm it up! Undercut. Warm it up! 
MATT: So that'll be four checks for her to make. 
LIAM: That's a big bonus for acrobatics. 
MATT: Four acrobatics checks. 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
MARISHA: It is a very big bonus. 
TRAVIS: ♪ For the love of women ♪ 
MARISHA: Basically, as long as I don't-- 
LIAM: Skewed toward success. 
MARISHA: As long as I don't-- 
LIAM: Just don't eat shit. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Do it for the ladies. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: Come on, Beauregard. 
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MARISHA: 27. 
MATT: 27. Easy enough to do. (skittering) The cable, once again, is snaking still. As other elements of the castle are still crumbling, and some things that weren't blown apart in the intensity of the first explosion, other parts are still slowly crumbling off as they can't hold some of the weight that they're still having to keep on. You can hear the creaking and additional crumbling and shouts and collapse of other outer parts of the Arx Creonum. As they impact and crack, the cable shakes a bit, but you maintain your position, running as fast as you can. Next one-- 
TRAVIS: Doing a cartwheel and a roundhouse just to be fucking cocky about it. 
MARISHA: Maybe, let's see. Let's get through these other two. 20, 21! 21. 
MATT: 21. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Is it a climbing DC? 
MATT: Hmm? 
TRAVIS: Is it climbing DC, or just four checks? 
MATT: No. This is four. Oh, you mean advancing DC? It gets a little bit harder with each roll. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: But you manage to maintain yourself. At one point, you feel the cable begin to move and you adjust with it and like a dancer for a moment, catch yourself, and then keep running up it. Next check. 
TALIESIN: Get cocky. 
LIAM: Do a lot of reps. That's when you start routine. 
TRAVIS: (quick breathing) 
LIAM: Let's go! 
MARISHA: Come on, come on, come on! (grimaces) 17. 
MATT: 17 is just barely! (groaning) 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: (wails) 
MATT: You're like-- 
TRAVIS: 12, 14, 16. 
SAM: This cable is made of metal? 
MATT: Yeah, you read the DCs. 12, 14, 16. 
MARISHA: Don't you fuck with me! 
SAM: Is it made of metal? 
MATT: The cable is made of metal. Yeah. 
SAM: Shocking Grasp. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You bitch! 
TRAVIS: What are you doing? 
LIAM: We're trying to save the world! 
MATT: I love it! 
MARISHA: Do I see it? Do I see her? 
ASHLEY: Are more of us on it? 
TRAVIS: Is it going to hit everybody that's on the cable? 
LAURA: We're all on it! 
SAM: You've got glass. That's insulating. 
MATT: So Beau, you're closing the distance running and you see, affixed to the wall on the sides of where the grappling hook is and the large part of the stone that's still holding the demo crews, they're waiting, and one of them, the smallest one of them reaches out and grabs the cable. Reaches the cable and (electricity sizzling) 
MARISHA: Veth! Okay, do I see it coming? 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
SAM: Lightning? 
MARISHA: Well, I know you. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Weird-- 
TRAVIS: Animation. (electricity sizzling) 
MARISHA: Weird? Yes. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Do I see this in 16 frames? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: 12 frames. 
LIAM: Split second decision. 
MARISHA: Okay. I want to do some dope monk shit. 
MATT: Yeah, let's go. 
SAM: You're going to hop the electricity? 
MARISHA: I want to see it. 
TRAVIS: (electricity sizzling) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It still arcs. (electricity sizzle) (laughter) 
LIAM: A giant bird above you just goes: (annoyed exhales) (laughter) 
MARISHA: I want to take my Belabor, my staff. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh, that's great! 
MARISHA: And-- 
TRAVIS: Send it back up. 
MARISHA: Use it as a-- 
MATT: Like grinding on the rail? 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MARISHA: (grunts) (laughter) 
MATT: All right. I will allow it. 
LIAM: What's it made of? 
MARISHA: Shut up! (laughter) 
SAM: It's wood! 
MARISHA: The good news is-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: You're not taking any damage nor are you rolling with disadvantage because of the Shocking Grasp. 
MARISHA: You bitch! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Now, the DC is increased because of what you're trying to do to maintain your time on the cable. So on your last roll, the DC is now 20. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: 20?! 
MATT: It was 18 originally. It was 18, but the Shocking Grasp maneuver, an avoidance, brings it up to 20. 
ASHLEY: The fuck, Nott? (laughter) 
LAURA: Call her Nott. (laughter) 
LIAM: This incursion brought you by Tony Hawk. 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: It's okay. She can gleam that cube. 
LIAM: Come on, grind it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. When she's being Nott. 
ASHLEY: When she's being a little bitch, I call her Nott. 
TRAVIS: Hey oh! 
LIAM: Grind it. 
MARISHA: That's it! That's a 21, bitch! That's a 21! (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Yes! (laughter) 
MARISHA: I rolled a 10. 
MATT: You jump, you turn. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Nott to go. 
MATT: Yes! You spin the staff around, do a little Christ Air while you're there to get some bonus points, land, grind on this cable. (grinding) I say grind, like sparks are flying because the Shocking Grasp is absorbed by the impact of your magical staff as you (grinding). Your momentum slows ever so slightly, but not enough to prevent you from reaching the end of the cable with a time that indeed beats Nott out of the gate. As you catch the end of the cable, you (impact) grapple onto the wall with just your monk fingers, like you can do. 
MARISHA: I just look at Veth and we're going to take two of my fingers and jab her right in the rib. 
SAM: Dim mak? 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughter) 
MARISHA: To just knock the wind out of her. (laughter) 
SAM: (gasps) 
MATT: You just like-- 
SAM: You cheated! 
MARISHA: How did I cheat? 
SAM: You used a weapon! 
MARISHA: You cheated by trying to electrocute me, you bitch! (laughter) 
SAM: It was just was a storm! 
MARISHA: What you mean? We are underground on the fucking moon! Wha! Wha! 
TRAVIS: I love this. 
MATT: The rest of this troop, the three of you that are on this harness with Gaz, there are seven rounds to see what happens as we go. 
LAURA: Oh jeez! 
MATT: So for the first round, I'd like someone to roll a d20 for me. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You want to start at the end? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Why? 
LIAM: I think my eagle would have landed by now. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: We'll go one at a time. 
LIAM: So I'm going to watch them in case anything goes wrong. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Ready to dive. 
MATT: You were following behind them? 
LIAM: I was right behind Beau, above, in case she had any mishaps. 
ASHLEY: 14. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're above, I'm below. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: She flew ahead of you, though. 
ASHLEY: Am I adding anything? 
LAURA: She would have been outrunning you. 
MATT: No. 14. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: The first leg of this journey continues without issue. 
LIAM: Six seconds later, anyway. 
MATT: You all continue gliding up the ascending cord, keeping an eye on the display of Beauregard cruising across and gaining rapidly on Veth's time across the cable. For the second round, who wants to roll? 
TALIESIN: 13. 
MATT: 13! You, looking ahead, notice over one of the upper shelves that's just above where the grappling cables have snagged, a number of Imperium soldiers curl over the edge and notice your ascent. Within a brief moment, you begin to notice projectiles (whooshes) arcing in your direction as psychically vaulted, glass-tipped spears have been thrown from the top of that balcony cliff edge and are heading towards all three of you. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
TALIESIN: How far away are they? 
MATT: I need all three of you to make dexterity saving throws. 
TALIESIN: We don't have advantage on those do we? 
MATT: You do not because you are stuck to a cable. 
TALIESIN: I did have a Guidance, though. 
ASHLEY: I have advantage on dex against effects (mumbled) that I can see. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MATT: Oh yeah, so you have advantage. 
ASHLEY: So I have advantage? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (mumbled) "Advantage on dex against effects I can see." 
TALIESIN: Ew! Wow! Really? 
LAURA: 13. 
TALIESIN: That's so bad! 
MATT: 13? 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
TALIESIN: Wait, why do I have a dex thing? 
MATT: 12 points of piercing damage to you. 
LAURA: Ow! 
TALIESIN: Six. 
MATT: 12 points of piercing damage to you. 
TALIESIN: 12 points. 
ASHLEY: 21. 
MATT: 21. So there would be spears that are rushing by, many just go flying past your crew. Gaz takes one on the shoulder and doesn't even care. Chuckles it off. One cuts into the side of your armor and pierces you a little bit before breaking off and falling below. Caduceus, one goes almost to break the clavicle, but just manages to cut above and hit the flesh there. You reach up and pull it free and chuck it off to the side. Yasha, one comes and you catch it in the air and break it in your grip before throwing the pieces to the ground. 
LAURA: I want to do that! 
ASHLEY: I want to throw it back down at them. 
MATT: Well, they're actually up and above. 
ASHLEY: Never mind. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (whooshes) 
MATT: They're a bit far to throw, but you can hold onto it, if you want to try and hit them when you get closer. 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
MATT: All right, so you hold that edge of the spear. All right, for the third roll, for the third round, who would like to roll? 
LAURA: I will roll! 
MATT: Go, Jester. 
TALIESIN: That was a terrible roll! 
LAURA: Three! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: Three? 
SAM: Ah! 
MARISHA: It got worse! 
MATT: (laughs) The next volley of spears go flying by, but they miss each of you, but one of them does catch the top of your harness. (whooshes) It carves and cuts through the majority of the belt that is holding under the top, and you see it go up and look right as the belt-- (clicks) 
LAURA: Oh no! Oh no! 
MATT: (tearing) And snaps. 
TRAVIS: Single again! 
MATT: Your harness. (laughter) 
MATT: Jester, your harness breaks. 
LAURA: And I go falling? 
MATT: The rest of you see Jester. 
ASHLEY: Can I try to reach out and grab her? 
MATT: You are about five feet from her. You can. You'll be at disadvantage to attempt to, but you can certainly try. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll try, I'll try, I'll try. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: (wails) 
ASHLEY: Am I-- What do I roll? 
MATT: So this would be a-- 
ASHLEY: Strength? Because I'm so strong, I can probably hold her. 
SAM: A d4. Roll a d4. 
MATT: This would be an athletics check to see if you can quickly grab and then hold without losing grip on her. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: But you do have disadvantage on this because-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: -- you are currently held by a harness. 
ASHLEY: Okay. That's a one. 
LAURA: That's okay! That's one. 
MATT: Natural one! 
SAM: Can't you Fjord fly? 
TRAVIS: I'm diving, yeah. 
MATT: You go to reach for her and you catch the tip of her fingers before (whooshes) 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: You look down as Jester is plummeting, what will be probably-- 
LAURA: Have fun, you guys! 
MATT: -- hundreds and hundreds of feet to an open street-wide gap that is between the base of the Prime Pillar and the walls that separate from the rest of the city. 
TRAVIS: As soon as I see Jester and Yasha look and miss, I'm in the dive after her. 
MATT: You dive. (whooshes) As you dive down towards her-- 
LAURA: I'm getting ready to cast a spell. 
MATT: You're getting prepared and ready. You look down, you can see the soldiers that are now rushing out of the city walls, heading towards the Prime Pillar. They're like ants at this point, they're so far, but getting bigger rapidly as you (whooshes) go after her. You only fall about maybe 100 or so feet before you manage to catch up (whooshes) grab and pick her up from underneath. 
LAURA: This is why I said to hold my hand the whole time! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) You're right. I should have listened. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Look who fell! 
LAURA: Thanks are saving me, man! 
TRAVIS: And there we go. (laughs) 
MATT: Unfortunately-- 
SAM: They're going to do good as a married couple. 
MATT: -- this process does slow the ascent slightly, so that's going to add one more round to the travel. 
LAURA: (groans) 
MARISHA: Negging in the middle of-- 
MATT: So we're going to go do another third round of the seven, then we're going to repeat that round. 
LAURA: So I'm off of it now? 
ASHLEY: My turn? 
MATT: You are currently, and now it's just between the two of them. 
LIAM: Sure they're not already married? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Three. 
LAURA: No! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Oh no! 
MARISHA: What the hell, you guys? What? (laughter) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Maybe you can carry them both? 
LIAM: Yes, I can. I'm watching for this. 
SAM: (whooshes) 
ASHLEY: You know when you know? 
TALIESIN: I do. 
TRAVIS: "You know when you know?" 
TALIESIN: I know when you know how-- 
ASHLEY: Then, you're like, "It's just dice. It's--" 
LIAM: ♪ ("The More You Know") ♪ 
TALIESIN: It's in my head. 
ASHLEY: It's in my head, but then you do it and you're like, "I knew it. I shouldn't have rolled it." 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so Yasha-- 
LAURA: But you're 1000 feet away. 
MATT: You notice that the ascent itself, the cable's starting to rock a lot back and forth. As it does, as much as you thought you did the best you could to attach this harness, you weren't paying quite as close enough attention during the safety briefing from Gaz, or maybe he wasn't really good at describing it. But as you're holding on after trying to reach for Jester, suddenly there's a ping in the back of your harness that one of the cables comes free. 
ASHLEY: Can I try to-- 
MATT: Try and grab the tower? 
ASHLEY: Can I try to-- 
SAM: You're free-handing it? 
ASHLEY: Can I try to? Yeah! 
MATT: It's a bare cable. Are you grabbing the glass hooks or the bare cable? 
ASHLEY: I am grabbing the... what would give me a better chance? (laughs) 
MATT: You tell me. 
TRAVIS: If you grab the cable-- 
MATT: You tell me, Yasha! 
TRAVIS: -- you're just going to be stuck holding onto a cable. If you hold the hook-- 
SAM: You're a fucking barbarian! So maybe that's okay. 
MATT: What are you doing? 
TRAVIS: If you grab the hook, you can move. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to grab the hook because that'll help me (whooshes). 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, I'm stressed. 
MATT: So the harness is no longer holding you, but as you feel it begin to give way and you feel like the whole harness is coming undone and you're starting to spin like it's a wrapped silk that you're unraveling from as you're like, "Whoa!" You reach up and try and grab the top of the harness hook. Go ahead and make a... Yeah, this would be a strength saving throw to see if you can keep yourself up there. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: You're strong. You're strong. 
ASHLEY: Do I disadvantage or anything like that, or--? 
MATT: No, this is a straight strength saving throw, but the DC is fairly high on this. 
TRAVIS: Rage! Just kidding. 
ASHLEY: Well, I was thinking it. Can I rage, or not in this moment? 
MATT: I'll-- 
ASHLEY: It's okay. I'm adding a lot. 
MATT: You're a level 20 barbarian. If you want to harness your rage in this moment, you will burn a rage. 
TALIESIN: Burn the rage! 
LAURA: Did you get one? Was it a one? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you can burn the rage. 
LAURA: But it's a one. 
ASHLEY: It was a one. It was a fucking one again! 
TALIESIN: Don't you get advantage? 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
MATT: She rolled before she said she was raging. 
TALIESIN: You did. Damn it! 
ASHLEY: I did roll before I said I was raging. Piece of shit! Piece of shit! 
LAURA: So Fjord is carrying me, right? He just caught me and then this happened? 
MATT: Yeah. Fjord is carrying you. The eagle has-- 
LIAM: Eaglegast has been watching for this. So as soon as he sees Yasha fall three inches, he's diving with a flight speed of 90. 
MATT: Flight speed of 90. 
LIAM: Or 80. 80 feet. 
MATT: She's about almost halfway across the cable. So you're going to be like-- 
LIAM: I'm going down. Scoop. 
MATT: Yeah, you're going to try and get-- This is going to be a race. As you just-- 
ASHLEY: Once I see it, I'm going to put myself in a good position. 
SAM: Doesn't she have fucking wings? 
LAURA: Don't you have wings? 
ASHLEY: I do, but they only last a minute, and I want to save them because they're better on-- 
SAM: Sure. Makes sense. Makes sense. 
ASHLEY: I want to save them, if I can. 
LIAM: If it looks like I'm not going to get there-- 
ASHLEY: If it looks like you're not going to get there, I'll have to use them. 
MATT: Right. So as you plummet and as you're falling there, you can see other smaller explosions. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to start to rage as I'm plummeting because I'm pissed that I didn't get it. 
MATT: Okay. You are rage falling. 
ASHLEY: (growls) 
MATT: I love it! 
MARISHA: 50 gold says he catches her. 
SAM: You're on, bitch! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: No bet! (laughter) 
MATT: So as she's falling. What's your fly speed, you said? 
LIAM: 80. 
MATT: 80. So you can move 160 per round. 
ASHLEY: Why didn't I fucking rage first? Then I would've fucking got advantage! 
SAM: You can't rage instantly. 
ASHLEY: I know, whatever. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, at level 20 you can. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you can. Whatever, whatever. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's passed. 
MATT: It's all good. It's passed. 
ASHLEY: I should've done it. My bad. 
LIAM: In your brain you hear: What the fuck, you're betting against me? 
SAM: I'm not. I'm betting against Beau! (laughter) 
MATT: As you're falling here and you are gunning as fast as you can, it's going to be tight. As you're falling, you're looking up, and you turn around and you're angry and you're staring at the ground as it gets closer and closer. You can see now this is an open series of carved trenches and battlements and places for what are likely the Imperium soldiers that were working alongside the Ruby Vanguard to be training, of which some are still present and rushing towards the pillar. A couple of them look up and see you plummeting and start reaching for weapons of some kind as you're getting (whooshes). You are diving to try and catch her. 
LIAM: (squawks) 
MATT: Make a strength check with the physicality of your giant eagle. 
LIAM: That's plus three for the giant eagle. 
MATT: This isn't a terrible DC. 
LIAM: 15. 
MATT: 15 will do it. 
LIAM: It's Eagle-gast. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
MATT: You catch Yasha. The impact does prevent her from cracking into the ground maybe about 60 feet off the floor. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Oh shit! 
MATT: (whooshes) You catch her almost from terminal velocity and you (fwoomph) catch her onto the feather wings and (whooshes). 
LIAM: (squawks) 
MATT: The two on the floor that go to try and fire at her as she's falling see the eagle grab it and fire at you. They have disadvantage at this range, though. It's going to be a seven. 
LIAM: No. 
MATT: And a 13? 
LIAM: Just hits. 
MATT: Just hits. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Can I throw my spear down? 
MATT: If you want it. 
SAM: Yes! 
MARISHA: No! 
SAM: Yes! 
MARISHA: No! 
SAM: Drop her! Drop her, Caleb! (laughter) 
MATT: It's going to be-- 
MARISHA: You already called it, the bet stands! 
SAM: No! 
MATT: -- five points of piercing damage. 
SAM: I get them back up here. 
LIAM: (squawks) 
MATT: And for catching Yasha at near terminal velocity onto your back from underneath-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: This could be bad. 
MATT: That is 14 points of bludgeoning damage. 
TALIESIN: You okay? Or is it looking bad? Because if it is, I have a reaction that I was going to throw. 
LAURA: You can't, they're too far away now. 
LIAM: Close. 
TALIESIN: Are they-- 
MATT: Oh no. 
LIAM: Giant eagle has 26 hit points. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: I have five hit points left. 
MARISHA: Five hit points. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: I shit on our attackers as I curve up. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: Fair. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: (soaring) 
LAURA: But it's human shit that comes out. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: Why would it be human? (laughter) 
SAM: Magic. 
LAURA: Because magic. 
TRAVIS: Because magic. 
MATT: Because magic. 
TALIESIN: What did you do to him that hits-- 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: It's a fantastical world of mystery and intrigue. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's 60 feet. 
MATT: So now Yasha, you grabbed on to hold and Caleb's eagle form has now pulled you back to arc up to where the cable is sitting. You can see the rest of your friends heading that way with the singular Caduceus and Gaz harnessing over. However, because Gaz is not having to concentrate on three people, you are moving a bit faster. So the benefit is while you still are on a round three roll, you only have three more rounds at this point. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So, you are now speeding up on the cable. Roll a d20 for me. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. Oh boy. (laughter) 
SAM: I cocked my crossbow. 
LAURA: Don't roll a three. Don't roll a three. (laughter) 
LAURA: No. No. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no! You did? 
LAURA: No! 
ASHLEY: No, you didn't! That's what it was? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay, listen. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LAURA: That's fine. 
MARISHA: Did you roll a one? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: You guys, there's a whole ass game waiting for us-- 
SAM: Nope, this is it. 
MARISHA: -- and we're fucking stuck on a cable. 
SAM: This is the game. 
LAURA: No wonder Bells Hells got sent to the big fight. 
LIAM and MATT: (laugh) 
MARISHA: No shit. 
TALIESIN: Since this wasn't my roll, though, I can't even have used any of my Bless for it because it's not my roll. It's a situational roll. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. What Bless would it be? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, exactly. 
LAURA: Okay, listen. The minute he starts to fall-- 
TALIESIN: I haven't fallen yet. 
LAURA: I don't know how it's going to happen, but I assume he's going to fall. 
TALIESIN: I've got emergency shit to do, but it's awful. So, all right. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) It's awful. 
TALIESIN: It's stuff I wanted to save for later. 
ASHLEY: Oh fuck. 
MATT: Wow, guys. 
TALIESIN: That was several ones in a row. That was a lot of ones in a row. 
MATT: That was. Oh, there was so much more on this whole breakdown. But here we go, okay. (laughter) 
SAM: We'll still get to the other stuff. 
TRAVIS: You got to not roll ones. 
MATT: It's all good. So as you watch, as you're looking down and Yasha is plummeting and you see the cable, or you see Caleb's eagle catch her and prevent her from splattering on the ground below, you breathe a sigh of relief. (cable twangs) (laughter) 
MATT: (cable twangs again) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I shouldn't have eaten breakfast (laughter) 
MATT: (harness releases) (laughter) 
MATT: (rapid plummeting) 
ASHLEY: This is so amazing. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: They gave you the loaner harnesses apparently. 
LAURA: I assume we are very close still. 
SAM: You didn't check your straps! 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
ASHLEY: Fucking Gaz! 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Polymorph on Caduceus. 
MATT: Okay. Into what form? 
LAURA: But listen, I have a question about this. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: Could I turn him into basically Caduceus with wings? 
MATT: That is not an existing creature. 
TALIESIN: Well, any creature? 
LIAM: It's beasts. You have to be a beast. 
TALIESIN: It has to be a beast. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: He is technically a humanoid, so it would have to be a beast. 
LAURA: A beast. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
MATT: I would allow you to turn him into a winged beast with a Caduceus face. 
TALIESIN: I would do a Caduceus version of it, though. 
MATT: If you want to be really creepy. 
LIAM: Like the spirit of the forest in "Mononoke"? 
TALIESIN: I mean, if you wanted me to have-- I think manticore has a human face. 
LAURA: But is that a beast, a manticore? 
TALIESIN: That's a creature. 
LAURA: Or is that a monster? 
SAM: It has to be an animal. 
MATT: Manticore is a monster. 
MATT and LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, just go-- 
LAURA: Yeah, then I'm going to go a giant owl. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I could do that. 
LAURA: Ooh no! A dire beetle, a really giant one. Can I make him into a giant beetle? 
MATT: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LAURA: With a Caduceus face. 
MATT: Yeah. Not a Caduceus head, just Caduceus face emerging from the front. 
TALIESIN: But there's a giant-- 
MATT: With the mandibles, yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: That's a different kind of beetle. My beetle doesn't have a giant horn. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: So you plummet-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: -- maybe 30 or so feet-- 
LIAM: Jester's cycling through choices, and Cad-- 
MATT: -- before suddenly you feel your body-- 
LIAM: -- has hit the ground five seconds ago. 
MATT: -- reform. (rapid wing vibrations) 
LAURA: Look at him! 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
LAURA: Look at that guy. 
ASHLEY: (harness clicks) 
TALIESIN: There's a lot of whiplash in this. (laughter) 
MATT: (garbled) Everything you say sounds like this. (laughter) 
MATT: (wings buzzing) 
TALIESIN: I'm doing little circles then I'm going to land near you on the-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: How big am I? 
LAURA: You're this big of a beetle. 
MARISHA: (warningly) Veth. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: Veth! 
LAURA: You're an absurdly large beetle. 
TALIESIN: I'm flying with you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: As the eagle gets closer-- 
MARISHA: I can Deflect Missiles. 
LIAM: I see it coming. In your head you hear: Veth, I will encourage your son to make your life a living nightmare. That boy dotes on me. Don't do it. 
ASHLEY: I will kill you when I get up there! 
SAM: As I squeeze the trigger-- 
MARISHA: Veth-- Okay, you win. You win by default. 
SAM: I relent. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: (laughing) By default. (laughter) 
LAURA: Terrible. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: As you all begin to gather up, Gaz riding now at a very rapid speed just having to focus on himself up the cable. You hear him shout like, "You guys are bad at this!" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: That's right, yes. 
MATT: Then (rapid arrival) he finishes up, clasping onto the side and you all begin to gather up towards the immediate exterior platform where the base of the most reachable element of the Arx Creonum is. The demo team begins to climb and splinter off to one side of it. The rest of you that are currently not flying in the air, which would be primarily Beau, and I think Veth, and that's pretty much it because everybody else is cruising around. You both begin to climb up the outskirts. 
SAM: Look at all these fuckers. (laughs) 
MARISHA: We're fighting on a ledge. (laughter) 
LIAM: I glide overhead and drop a definitively human shit. (laughter) 
MATT: Perfect. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (soft smack) 
LAURA: (gags) 
MATT: I would like you both to make athletics checks for me to climb the side of this rock face to the top of that balcony. 
MARISHA: Well, she's got Spider Climb still. 
MATT: Oh that's true. You're fine. You don't have to roll at all. 
MARISHA: Okay, it's not the best, but it's not bad. 17. 
MATT: 17's fine. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: The DC on that would've been 13 to climb up the side there. I was just curious if any of you were going to fall, too. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: (laughs) As you begin to clamber up and reach to the edge, you can see the pillars that mark the outside of this balcony. You can hear the sounds of feet running, soldiers shouting to each other and prepping while still the cracking and falling of stones and other parts. You can just barely see up other edges of the Arx Creonum the cracks now have driven up high and wide and other parts have partially fallen and have held in place, and people are precariously trying to help and save others to get off to the side. But as soon as you climb up and look over the edge, you can see soldiers turn, looking for any sign of anyone coming. As soon as they make eyes towards both of you, they get their weapons ready. (exclaiming) 
LIAM: Oh! A battle map! 
SAM: Oh boy. This combat brought to you by WizKids minis. Darrington Brigade miniatures available now. Heed the call to adventure alongside the heroes of Exandria. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
SAM: The Darrington Brigade available now at-- 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
SAM: -- WizKids.io/DarringtonBrigade. 
TRAVIS: Fingers, fingers, fingers! 
LAURA: Oh, are you okay? 
SAM: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Woof. 
SAM: You had to make three and stack them? 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
TALIESIN: Do they-- 
SAM: Is it cake? 
TALIESIN: Do they understand Common here? 
LIAM and SAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: One way to know. 
LAURA: What on Earth? 
LIAM: Not the front part, just the back. 
TALIESIN: They understand Common, right? They understand Common. 
SAM: WizKids.io/ 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. We should do it as a cake. 
LAURA: (gasps) Matt! 
TALIESIN: Oh my word! 
LIAM: Of terrain, yeah. 
MARISHA: Of terrain. 
LIAM: Total terrain. 
LAURA: Eee! 
MATT: So. 
LAURA: This is so cool. 
LIAM: It's so big it needs two pieces! 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
MATT: These are two parts of the outer edge. So Veth and Beauregard end up over this edge here. 
TRAVIS: This is sick, bro. 
MATT: This is the broken opening that is immediately available on this side of what was detonated by the demo crew. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: Over here. There is an opening here where you can see the edges of this. 
TRAVIS: That all just fell away. 
MATT: All of this just fell away and there are layers exposed of inside hallways and such. 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: So to that degree, we have... 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: Oh, I see it. Oh god. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
LIAM: That's not just the back of the theater production. 
SAM: Oh gosh. 
LAURA: There's a lot of really-- 
SAM: There's bad guys. There's lots of bad guys. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
LAURA: A lot of bad guys. 
TRAVIS: You mean a lot of targets? 
ASHLEY: This will be cool. 
SAM: It's a target rich environment. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: The big fight. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so we got to be gentle. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I want my baby back, baby back ♪ ♪ baby back, baby back, ♪ baby back, baby back ♪ 
ASHLEY: I think that's probably a good amount, Matt. 
SAM: Are those floating swords? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: Spectral swords. 
ASHLEY: Yikes. 
MATT: So, immediately upon clambering over that side, you can see there are this entryway here, where the rock shelf ends at that point. There are two Juggernauts off to the side. There is one glass blade-wielding Reilora troop there. There is one Reiloran who has no weapon, but is surrounded by three floating and spinning glass blades that surround it in a circle. This one up here and this one over here have a long glass cannon that they have affixed, latched onto one of their arms, underneath the arm. 
TRAVIS: Where are they? Which ones have that? 
MATT: This one-- Well, what would be the Shrikes are acting as the glass cannoneers. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
MATT: You also hear the shrieking of armored Feskuls swirling up and above. Now we have, as is the nature of this momentary chaos, we have an eagle formed Caleb. 
LIAM: With Yasha on him. 
MATT: With Yasha on its back. 
LIAM: Seven hit points. 
MATT: That has flown up and over on this side. Then we have Fjord, who is currently floating with Jester over to this side. We have a Caduceus beetle. Do I have an insectoid mini? 
TALIESIN: There was that little bee running around. There's a tiny bee somewhere around here. 
LAURA: We did have a little Marisha bee. 
TALIESIN: Where's that little bee? 
SAM: Marisha has some bees. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you have a bee? 
LAURA: Yeah, the bees. 
MARISHA: I just threw them away, but I can get them. 
SAM: Why would you throw away bees? 
MARISHA: Because what do I do with the bees? 
TRAVIS: They're so vital to the environment. 
TALIESIN: I had them a day ago. 
LAURA: Yeah, Marisha threw them away! 
MARISHA: Hang on, I can get them out. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Here, here. 
TALIESIN: Here, we got a bee. 
MARISHA: I got a bee. Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Oh no, what happened to the bee? 
LAURA: Is it covered in food? 
MARISHA: One fell inside of a coke can. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: They do like-- 
TALIESIN: That is the most D&D shit ever right there. Oh no, I lost a bee in a coke can. 
LAURA: You got it? 
MARISHA: I have two bees. 
TALIESIN: We have a bee. 
MATT: You have a bee? 
SAM: We just need one bee. 
MARISHA: Oh, here's two bees. 
SAM: They're tiny. 
LAURA: Bees! 
MATT: Hello, bee. 
ASHLEY: Hello, bee. 
TALIESIN: Hello, bees. 
LAURA: Hello, bees! 
TRAVIS: Hello, bees. 
MARISHA: That's so cute. 
LAURA: I should have turned into a bee! 
SAM: You just did. 
MATT: I'm going to set this. 
LAURA: Then you could have stung-- 
MATT: You keep that one. 
TALIESIN: That's perfect for me, by the way. I'm so happy with that right now. 
ASHLEY: That's so cute. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there we go. 
MATT: It sticks to it there, and then-- 
LAURA: (laughs) So cute. 
MATT: All right, so-- 
LAURA: You have to get to the ledge before somebody hits you. 
MATT: -- that is our troop as it currently stands. Your destination is to get everyone into the hole safely. 
LAURA: Ha! 
SAM: The hole? Where's the hole? 
LAURA: Over there. 
MATT: This massive space here. 
SAM: Oh, I see. 
MATT: This leads into the blown out part of the Arx Creonum. Everyone please roll initiative. 
SAM: Oh, shi-bolls. 
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise! Oh my gosh. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Oh my god ♪ 
TALIESIN: Where were you? Where were you? 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: All righty, friends. 
TALIESIN: Did not do my normal Caduceus chill. 
SAM: (vocalizing) 
MATT: 25 to 20. 
LIAM: Natural 20 for a 22. 
TALIESIN: 21. 
MARISHA: 23. 
ASHLEY: Oh, 21. 
TRAVIS: Beau. 
LAURA: So wait. 
TRAVIS: Caleb. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Caduceus. 
ASHLEY: I got a 21. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: Wait, 20-- 
TALIESIN: Wait, again. 
MATT: Caduceus got a 21 as well? 
TRAVIS: Caduceus and Yasha roll off, or who has the higher dex? 
TALIESIN: My dex is-- 
MATT: No, Rollies y'all. 
TALIESIN: Rollies, Rollies. 
ASHLEY: Rollies, Rollies, Rollies. 
MATT: That's what is there for. 
LAURA: I just write: Cad. 
SAM: How do you spell it? 
TALIESIN: 10. 
ASHLEY: Six. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: All right, so we got-- 
TRAVIS: Caduceus, Yasha. 
ASHLEY: So we got Caleb. 
TRAVIS: Beau, Caleb, Caduceus, Yasha. 
MARISHA: Yasha. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: It's Ca-douche-yas. 
SAM: I don't think that's correct. 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
LAURA: 18. 
TRAVIS: 15. 
MARISHA: Jester. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Fjord. 
TRAVIS: The J is silent. 
ASHLEY: Fjord. 
LAURA: Fjord. 
MARISHA: F-jord. 
TALIESIN: That's all of us, cool. 
LAURA: Then you are last? 
TALIESIN: Or, yeah. 
SAM: I am twelfth. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: I rolled a 12. 
TALIESIN: That's not bad. 
LIAM: Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: We did pretty well here. 
MATT: And Veth. 
TALIESIN: And Veth. We got a good group, good group. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Cadu-ceus. 
MARISHA: We're not necessarily trying to kill all these guys, right? 
LAURA: No, we're just trying to-- 
MARISHA: We're just trying to get by. 
LAURA: -- get into the hole. Avoid them and get in the hole. 
TRAVIS: Get in the hole! 
MARISHA: Is that the plan, get in the hole? 
LIAM: Yeah, save your juice. 
MATT: Up to you. Beauregard, you're up first with Caleb on deck. 
MARISHA: Did you say, does it look like some of these duders-- 
SAM: ♪ Did you say ♪ 
MARISHA: -- have range? 
MATT: These fellows here have what looked like glass cannon-type attachments that are both affixed to a bracer and under their arm with a harness. So it's a large, massive arm cannon they're holding under one arm on each of them. This gentleman has blades that float around them. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: What little bit of glimpses you've-- You've been around Reilorans. You were probably the only two that have really interfaced with them around the base of the Malleus Key in recent times. You know that they psychically sometimes can throw weapons at a fair distance. 
MARISHA: Okay. I'm just wondering if I should try and debilitate some of these people, or if we should just go for it. 
LAURA: I think-- You can dash, you can get there so fast. 
LIAM: Yeah, you can-- 
MARISHA: I can get there so fast. 
LIAM: -- get over there and then-- 
TALIESIN: Help everybody. 
LIAM: -- deal when you're in a better position. 
MARISHA: That's fair, actually. 
LIAM: What about you? How mobile are you? 
SAM: I'm super mobile. 
LAURA: She's also little. 
SAM: Yeah, I'm roguey, but I'm hoping that someone will get near our opponents so I can sneak attack them. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Or you could-- 
MARISHA: How about this? I've got a speed of 70. 
SAM: I could also sneak. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Move and move and dash. 
MARISHA: Can I-- 
MATT: Yeah? 
MARISHA: -- jump on this wall, on this-- 
MATT: On this here, the crenelated top? 
MARISHA: On the crenelated top? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: And run along. As I run along, my full move this way, 70 feet. 
MATT: That's 40. 
MARISHA: I can move 70. 
MATT: Along the wall still? 
MARISHA: Just as long as I'm not necessarily in range of these guys. Put me the rest of the way. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I don't want to provoke. 
MATT: 45, 50. 
SAM: (Uk'otoa) Provoke. 
MATT: 60, 65, 70 gets you there. 
MARISHA: Okay, and as I run by, I'm going: (mocking laugh). 
TRAVIS: Mature. 
MARISHA: Getting their attention. Then I am going to spin. 
LAURA: She's a level 20, folks. She's mature now. 
TRAVIS: Professional. 
MARISHA: Because that was my move. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You know what, how about this. Let me actually go ahead and get into combat with this Juggernaut. 
MATT: This one here? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: And-- 
TRAVIS: I'm this Juggernaut, bitch. 
MARISHA: Because that was my move and I can attack. 
MATT: Correct, yeah. 
MARISHA: So let me do two attacks. 
MATT: Go for it. 
MARISHA: Here. 
LIAM: Let's start a war. 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: A nuclear war. 
LIAM: At the Creonium. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Woo! 
MARISHA: Pop-pop! We're back, baby. 
MATT: I got seven to put in you. (laughter) M
MARISHA: That is going to be a 18 and a 20 to hit. 
MATT: Both hit. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Pop-pop. 
MARISHA: What do I roll? 
LIAM: Let's go, Expositor. 
SAM: (coconuts clacking) 
LIAM: Fuck it up-- 
MARISHA: I do d12 damage? 
LIAM: -- to the tempo. 
TALIESIN: I'm glad we kept those coconuts. 
MARISHA: Okay, that is going to be 17 for the first. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Eight for the second. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: They actually have nice quiet-- 
MARISHA: Stunning Strike. 
MATT: Stunning Strike. All right, constitution? 
MARISHA: Yep. 
MATT: That's going to be an 18. 
LIAM: Caduceus. 
MARISHA: 18. Wait, let me make sure here, actually. 
MATT: Yeah, double check your DC. 
MARISHA: Because things might have changed. 
MATT: These guys are pretty hefty, so they have a pretty decent constitution bonus. 
MARISHA: That's fair. 
MATT: It's not massive, but better than the average ones. 
MARISHA: 18 is the DC. 
MATT: 18 is your DC. Okay, yeah. So he resists the stun of that strike, that first hit. 
MARISHA: That's okay. Then, I will bonus action-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm? 
MARISHA: Patient Defense. 
MATT: Okay, so now you are taking the defensive action. Attacks against you have disadvantage. 
MARISHA: I'm going to yell to the others: Go, go, go, go, go. Move, move. 
LIAM: There's so many around her. 
SAM: She's fine. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
MATT: Caleb, you're up, with Caduceus on deck. 
LIAM: I'm going to use-- staying low and at the altitude I'm at-- I'm going to use my 80 feet of movement to get Yasha as far over as possible. 
MATT: All righty. So the 80 feet of movement-- 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
MATT: Will put you-- (whooshes) Right there. 
LIAM: Am I able to spill her out onto the ledge right there? 
MATT: It would be more of her-- I mean if, if you want to use a little bit of that movement to bring her closer in, you can. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Otherwise she'd have to spend her turn to leap off. 
LIAM: I'll, yes, what I wanted to-- I'm hoping to do, is use my movement and then use my action to move further. So can I use a little bit more of my action and dump her? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Veer sideways and then head halfway back closer toward Veth's position. 
MATT: Sure, so you can put it there. 
LIAM: Still fly low. Like ideally-- 
MATT: So I'll say about 10 extra feet from that, which gives you 70 more feet back that you could get. 
LIAM: I would love to be in this general vicinity. 
MATT: Oh yeah, you can definitely do that. 
LIAM: In that depth there. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So you you get low, almost shrugging her off while doing a half land. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Then kicking off and (whoosh). 
LIAM: Cool, because I shat on her so I know where she is and I want to be available if she needs me to get her out of there. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Done. 
MATT: See, Scanlan's not the only person that can Scry via shit. Caduceus, you're up, with Yasha on deck. 
TALIESIN: I assume I can't cast spells while I'm a-- 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: -- a beetle? Which is a damn shame. What's my speed? 
TRAVIS: It's a damn shame. 
MATT: What is the speed of the beetle? 
MARISHA: Damn shame. Damn shame. 
TRAVIS: Can in Daggerheart. 
MATT: You said it a dire beetle, is that what you said? 
TALIESIN: Dire beetle. It's like a beetle but dire. 
LAURA and MATT: (chuckle) 
LIAM: This is getting dire. 
MATT: I'll say you have a flying speed of 40 feet as a dire beetle. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So I'm going to try and get 40 feet-- 
MATT: Why not? 
TALIESIN: -- around this direction, towards that platform over there. 
MATT: Okay, 40 feet. 
TALIESIN: Or I'm going to head at least 40 feet in that direction at the moment. 
MATT: You can get-- 40 feet will be about there. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so probably then I'm going to dash. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (buzzes) I think I'm going to hide under that. Use the platform for cover, so I'm going to hide in the corner there so I can hop up when it's time. 
MATT: Okay, so you're hiding under there now? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm up there taking a second before I hop around again. 
MATT: You got it. Okay, that finishes your go, Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: All right, Yasha, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: So I have 50 feet of movement. 
MATT: Right, you're right here. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: On the cliffside. 
ASHLEY: Can I start getting up, climbing up the wall to get-- 
MATT: What's your speed? 
ASHLEY: 50? 
MATT: 50, you can do half speed to climb up, which will put-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, 25. 
MATT: 25. 
LIAM: A lot of enemies here. 
MATT: Yeah, that'll get you up-- 
MARISHA: We're going to get slammed. 
MATT: You can get up onto the top there. 
LIAM: We have five super bigs to fight. 
ASHLEY: All right, so-- 
MATT: So that's your movement. 
ASHLEY: That's my movement. Then, (sighs) I'm going to try to throw the spear at one. The one that I had in my hand. 
MATT: Okay. Which one are you throwing at? 
ASHLEY: The one-- Beau's got that one. I'll take the other one. 
MATT: This one here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, roll an attack. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so-- 
MATT: Strength based. So roll and add your proficiency and your strength bonus. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So it'd be six plus your strength is 20? 
ASHLEY: Yar. 
MATT: So it'd be six plus-- 
ASHLEY: Or 22. 
MATT: Oh that's right, so it'd be six plus-- So plus 12 to your roll. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Ooh! 29. 
MATT: Oh, that definitely hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Roll a d10 and add your plus six strength bonus to it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Beau, how's your HP? 
MARISHA: I'm fine. I mean, I haven't taken any damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I don't have any 10s here. 
MARISHA: We're freshies. 
TALIESIN: That's right. 
MARISHA: And I still have some temp HP. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to remember who had. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, looking for a 10. 
TALIESIN: The three of us. 
ASHLEY: I don't have one. 
MARISHA: When we came-- Ow. 
TALIESIN: When we were going up. 
LIAM: (slaps) Just like my grade school. 
TALIESIN: I have some interesting shit available to me. 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
SAM: Did you get-- 
ASHLEY: That will be-- 
SAM: -- slapped in grade school? 
LIAM: First grade. 
ASHLEY: 12 total. 
LAURA and SAM: Aw! 
LIAM: Then they did away with it. 
MATT: 12 points damage. So the spear (slams) sticks into the juggernaut. (grunt) Pulls the spear out. Throws it to the ground. (crash) It snaps. Looks over at you, (slam) slams its massive bone-- Jagged bone cestus on its knuckles and slams them together with a heavy cracking sound. He's getting hyped up and ready to charge. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Are you going to Rage or are you going to-- 
ASHLEY: I'm already raging. 
MATT: That's right, because your holding it from earlier. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah. Okay, finishing Ashley's go it is now the glass cannoneers' turn. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: One, begins to rush over to this side and is going to get over here. Unfortunately, this distance is going to be a little tough. Technically, Yasha, he's going to fire at you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
MATT: He has disadvantage on the attack because of the distance, but he's going to go for it anyway. The cannoneer though on this side, the one that's across the wall there, With disadvantage is going-- Oh, it's a natural 20, but with disadvantage. It's going to be only a 16. 
ASHLEY: That does not hit. 
MATT: Does not hit you. (boom) You hear this weird-- (whizzing) There's no detonation, there's no black powder work in these. They are cannons that are psychically railgunned pieces of sharpened glass or metal. 
SAM: (groans) 
MATT: It's like-- (whizzing) You hear this-- (crash) And the rock next to you (explosion) shatters and explodes. You look back and you can see the two of them getting low and firing. One's behind the wall. The one that's out on the edge here has a better shot at you. This one's going to shoot you without disadvantage. That's going to be 19 a hit. 
ASHLEY: Does not hit. 
MATT: Does not hit! 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: Both shots-- (crashes) They're both going to take a second shot at you. 
ASHLEY: As I'm raging and breathing heavy, I turn and I just look at them. (growls) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: It's going to take its two shots at you. First one-- Actually, I was going to say. That one went, then the other. They both have two attacks. So this one's going to be a disadvantage again. With disadvantage, it's going to be-- One second, I'm looking at this again. 21? 
ASHLEY: That hits. 
MATT: That hits, okay. So with that, you take-- 10 points of piercing damage. 
SAM: Yasha, no! 
ASHLEY: Halved? 
MATT: Halved because you're raging. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But because it is-- Wait, actually no, these are considered magical because the Ruidian glass cannon, the way the psychic energy pulls it, it turns it temporarily magical 
ASHLEY: So I take full damage? 
MATT: So you do take full damage. It's a full 10. Make an intelligence saving throw for me. 
LAURA: Mm! 
LIAM: (sighs) 
LAURA: Mm? 
MATT: Intelligence saving throw for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, what? 
LIAM: Does Mind Blank have any bearing on this? 
ASHLEY: Does Mind Blank have anything to do-- 
LIAM: Just remind us that that's in the air. 
MATT: Right. Mind Blank, what does Mind Blank do? 
LAURA: I think it's wisdom, isn't it? 
MATT: Here, I'll pull it up. 
LIAM: Yeah, it's more wisdom to me. "Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage. Any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts--" 
MATT: You don't need to roll because you're immune to psychic damage. 
TALIESIN: Which, also that 10 points-- 
LAURA: Yay! 
TALIESIN: -- is yay or nay? 
TRAVIS: Clutch. 
MATT: No, the 10 points is the physical impact. Then you roll to see if you resist the initial blast of psychic damage on it. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: So you ignore it. 
ASHLEY: Thank you, Caleb. 
MATT: You only take the initial hits. Those ones are magical. 
TRAVIS: That's great. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: We all have that Heroes' Feast, too. 
MATT: Then the other one's going to be-- 
TALIESIN: What temporary hit points did we get? 
MATT: -- 19 to attack, which I think misses you again. 
LAURA: We got seven. 
MATT: So those two finish out their attacks. This one here is going to take two shots at Beauregard because you were the closest to it right there. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
LAURA: We had at the beginning. 
MARISHA: He has disadvantage. 
MATT: Natural 20. Oh disadvantage, right! Oh, that's another crit wasted. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: No, no! 
MATT: 14. 
MARISHA: Miss. 
ASHLEY: He's rolling so many nat 20s. 
LAURA: Oh no, did it go away? Mine did, too, then. 
TRAVIS: And we rolled so many ones. 
MATT: But it's also been so many disadvantages. It's true. 
LAURA: But it also helped-- 
MATT: That's going to be a 22 to hit. 
MARISHA: Oh, just hits. 
MATT: Does it? Okay. So you take-- 
MARISHA: This is the guy that I'm squared up against? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to be 14 points of piercing damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: (blast) In your direction. 
MARISHA: Wait, is it a shot? 
MATT: Yeah, they have these glass cannon rail guns-- 
MARISHA: Oh, I thought-- That's why I was asking. Deflect Missiles. 
MATT: Sure. So ki point and then roll your-- 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: Oh no, you just do it. Yeah, that's right, it's ability. So, go ahead. 
MARISHA: Yeah, and it was 14 damage? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So it's 1d10 plus 25 damage. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: So that's 30 damage. 
TALIESIN: I can't see. Oh, never mind. 
MATT: As you're getting defensively, you glance up and see over the top this glass cannoneer gets over, (whizzing) fires, and you (quick deflection) catch it in your hand. 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
MARISHA: But just because I am feeling sassy-- (tosses) I'm going throw it back. 
MATT: Throw it back at them? 
MATT: Let's go. That's right, it's spend a ki point to throw back. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Worth it. 
MATT: So roll an attack. 
MARISHA: Okay. So it's, it's, it's-- "Spend a ki point and make a ranged attack." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. Roll and add your dex and your proficiency. 
MARISHA: My dex and my proficiency, 21. 
MATT: 21? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That hits, roll a d12 plus your dex bonus for damage. 
MARISHA: Ew, icky. But that's okay. Seven damage. 
MATT: Okay, seven damage. Then he has to make an intelligence save. Which would be 13, which fails. Roll 2d8 psychic damage for me. 
LAURA: Yay! So it can take psychic damage. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: 2d8? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see. It might not. 
LAURA: I mean, he wouldn't make us do this then. 
SAM: Yeah, but it might be half or something. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it might be resistant. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's probably resistant. 
MARISHA: 11. 
MATT: 11 points of psychic damage, okay. 
TRAVIS: (goofy) Ah! 
MARISHA: (goofy) Ah! Ah! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: ♪ Beat you at your own game ♪ 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: ♪ You do it to yourself ♪ 
MATT: That finish the cannoneers' turn. Jester, you're up. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Do it to yourself ♪ 
LAURA: Yes. I'm riding Fjord, so I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
LIAM: (like Jester) We have heard this. 
TRAVIS: With, with. 
LAURA: I'm going to hold my action until I get closer because it's his movement. 
MATT: Yeah, what action are you holding? 
LAURA: I want to try to use one of my-- What feature is this? It's a background feature or something. Maybe it's a-- A class feature? Species? Yes, I'm going to hold Darkness. 
MATT: Okay, you're holding the Darkness spell. You got it. All right, that finishes your go, Jester. 
SAM: (gruffly) Holding Darkness. 
LAURA: I'm holding it at bay-- 
MATT: It is now the juggernaut's turn. 
LAURA: -- until I get closer. 
LIAM: Don't fly. Don't fly. 
MATT: This one's going to leap over here. 
LIAM: Don't fly. 
MATT: It is going to attempt to jump the chasm. 
LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Whoa. 
MATT: So this is a very high DC. 
LIAM: Each shit. Eat shit. 
TRAVIS: Please miss. 
MATT: So, he gets to add a plus eight to this roll. 
TRAVIS: Miss it! 
MATT: He has to get a 20 to get across. 
TRAVIS: Miss it! Miss it! 
MARISHA: So under 12. 
MATT: Natural 20. (exclaiming) 
TALIESIN: Wait a minute. No, never-- Well, no because there's no target. There's no target. So I can't cancel that one. 
LIAM: Wow, he rolled a nat 20. 
MARISHA: What do you mean there's no target? 
TALIESIN: I can cancel a nat 20 if there's a target, because-- 
LAURA: Oh, if he's targeting against somebody. 
TALIESIN: It's not who rolls the 20, it's who the 20's aimed at. 
TRAVIS: That was sick. 
LAURA: That was amazing. 
MATT: That's his move and his dash to get all the way across. But he basically runs, leaps over this wall, runs-- (extensive leap) 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
MATT: (impacts) -- and Hulk lands on the opposite side. Cracks, you hear it above the floor above you that's already damaged (cracking) cracks a bit, bits of stone and dust fall. 
TALIESIN: I saw him do the-- 
MATT: The leap, yeah, through. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Yasha, you as well, hear the impact and turn and you could see the juggernaut that's followed up on that side. 
TALIESIN: I got a plan. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: This one here is going to rush up here to attack you while this one's going to spin and turn on Beauregard. So against you, Yasha-- 
MARISHA: I guess let's see what happens. 
LAURA: Yeah, you wouldn't be able to see. 
MATT: The first one's going to attack you-- 
MARISHA: I can dash out. 
MATT: -- three times. 
LAURA: I mean, they can probably run, too. 
TALIESIN: Here you go. 
MATT: Natural one, but it's going to be a 24 and a 25. 
ASHLEY: Those hit. 
LAURA: Ugh! 
MATT: Those hit you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I thought it was you. 
MATT: So you take 13 points of magical bludgeoning damage. 
ASHLEY: Is that halved? Oh, that's magical. 
MATT: No. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, that's right. 
MATT: Well no, for barbarian, I think barbarian's just half bludgeoning damage. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. So actually, what am I saying? Sorry. You just take half the damage. Monsters have magical and non-magical, but barbarians, I believe it's just bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing you just take half of. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so that's, you said 13? 
MATT: So it'd be 13 reduced to six. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Actually, the last damage you've taken would've been halved as well. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Which was 10? 
MATT: I think it might've been 12. 
SAM: We'll never know. 
MATT: Take off another six. 
LAURA: Or give yourself six. 
MATT: Give yourself six, I mean. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: Buy yourself something nice. 
ASHLEY: Buy yourself something nice. Okay. 
MATT: Then the other one is going to be five, 10 points of bludgeoning damage. 
TALIESIN: Halved to five. 
ASHLEY: Reduced to five, okay. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah. 
MARISHA: Did you hold that spell? 
MATT: Two or more of its attacks hit in a single turn-- 
LAURA: I'm holding it until I get closer. 
MATT: -- make a strength saving throw as it's using its telekinetic combo. So it misses with one punch. 
LIAM: Oh no. 
MATT: Smacks you with a second, and is going to hit you in the stomach with a third. 
LAURA: Sheesh! 
LIAM: Oh, it's trying to shut you off. 
MATT: You feel the psychic mind trying to push through the impact. 
MARISHA: Shit, come on. 
MATT: You have advantage on your saving through. 
ASHLEY: I get advantage because I'm raging. 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 22. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: 22 succeeds. 
LIAM: Awesome. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: The last one hits you and (grinding) you skid back about a foot, and you feel one heel just barely dip off the edge and you glance over your shoulder and see the sheer drop of, who knows-- 
LIAM: Yasha's abs! 
MATT: -- thousands of feet below, and catch yourself. 
ASHLEY: Goosh! It's all core. 
MARISHA: God, that gives me the heebie jeebies. 
TRAVIS: It's all core! 
MATT: This one here is going to-- 
LAURA: Where's Gaz? Is he on the thing with us? Was he on the-- 
MATT: Gaz is climbing up on the other side. 
LAURA: Whoa. Okay. 
MATT: I haven't gotten to his turn yet. 
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: Other juggernaut? 
MARISHA: Disadvantage. 
MATT: Yeah, disadvantage against you. Three attacks. First one is going to be 20? 
MARISHA: Miss. 
MATT: Next one is going to be 21. 
MARISHA: Hits. 
MATT: Okay. Last one. Oh yeah, both natural 17. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's going to be fun. I got a great idea. 
MATT: So this guy's going to move here, and it's going to-- First one's going to hit you for, ooh, 18 points of bludgeoning damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Second one's going to hit you. This is going to be 15 points-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ Ow ♪ 
MATT: -- of bludgeoning damage. 
SAM: ♪ ("Groove is in the Heart" by Deee-Lite) ♪ 
MATT: Make a strength saving throw for me. 
MARISHA: Ooh, hang on. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. 
TRAVIS: That's what-- 
SAM: ♪ ("Groove is in the Heart") ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Ow ♪ 
MARISHA: So wait. Hang on, sorry. 
SAM: ♪ Everybody, everybody ♪ 
MARISHA: It was 18? 
SAM: ♪ Everybody ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Everybody ♪ 
MARISHA: So that's going to be 190. Then, what was it, 15 points for the second one? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So that's going to bring me to 175. Then make a strength saving throw? 
MATT: Strength saving throw for me, please. 
SAM: Beau, no! 
MARISHA: 13. 
MATT: Okay. That's a fail. 
MARISHA: I will spend a ki point to reroll it. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: That's going to be 15. 
MATT: Fail. 
SAM and ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: So (bashing), a double fist punch right to your chest. (thud) You slide back 15 feet to the wall and he closes the distance to join. 
ASHLEY: Oh shit. 
MATT: Technically, it's going to meet you there. That way, there's the two have now, have you flanked each side of the wall between you. You do get an AC bonus against this one. But they both technically get advantage on attacking you. But they've both goin'-- gone. So it's not going to make a huge difference for that now. 
LAURA: They both goin'. 
MATT: They both goin'! That finishes the juggernauts. Now, the Shrieks. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh fuck. 
MATT: (shrieking) As two armored feskuls. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: Oh boy! 
SAM: What is this now? 
MATT: Begin to fly down. This one-- 
LAURA: Jesus H. 
MATT: -- catches there and looks around for a target. Sees you, Veth. 
SAM: But I'm just a little-- Oh! 
MATT: And it falls and dies. 
LAURA: And then falls and dies. 
MATT: No. 
ASHLEY: Look at the baby. 
SAM: Can't this game just be roleplaying and not fighting? 
TRAVIS: No, fuck that. (laughter) 
MATT: This one's going to swoop down here and-- 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to figure out how to use the pool. 
MATT: Engaged there, it does not see Caduceus from that height. So it's going to take the rest of its 80-foot movement to dash and swoop out that way. So it's be, oh. (clatters) That one there is now going to-- 
SAM: It's Liam O'Brien of Critical Role! (clapping) 
LIAM: Am I dying? 
ASHLEY: Liam O'bam bun. 
TALIESIN: Aren't we all? 
SAM: No, but there's shrieks now. Shrikes. 
LIAM: Freaks? 
MATT: It is now diving towards Fjord and Jester. (whooshing) 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Towards us? 
MATT: Okay, that finishes their turn. Fjord, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Sweet, I'm going to use all 40 feet of my flying speed to send Jester and I towards this ledge that's down right where you're-- 
MATT: 40 feet will get you right there. 
LAURA: Right where? 
TRAVIS: I'm going to put us down on that-- 
MATT: Down on the ledge? 
TRAVIS: The ledge down there, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yep, deep. 
MATT: It is a very precarious ledge. 
LAURA: As soon as we got within range, I'm going to use my Darkness and I'm going to say: Get to safety, Beau! I'm going to hit it where the juggernauts are circling her. It's a 50-foot radius. 
SAM: The Darkness? 
LAURA: 15-foot radius, yeah. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Okay, so you can create it above here is where you'd be able to see it. 
LAURA: Yeah, while we were flying, I would've been able to have been (casting) before we duck down. 
LAURA: Right. Well, you were flying at a lower level. So technically, you can't really see what's going on up here because you guys were coasting. If you wanted to get a little fire-- 
LAURA: Well, I want to f-- I save it. Okay. 
MATT: Just because you're going to that ledge there-- So if you wanted to aim it up here is where you could see? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Where Yasha is? And fill that space? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. That'll work. All right, so that'll give us a sphere of darkness. 
TRAVIS: (zooming) 
TALIESIN: I didn't think that was concentration. 
MATT: (whooshes) So now, Yasha and Beauregard, everything-- 
LAURA: Did it hit Yasha, too? Is it possible to just get the juggernaut in Darkness and not hit Yasha? 
MATT: From the height where you were-- I'll say, if you can hit the wall here-- 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: -- it catches Yasha's vision and you back up slightly and your head is out of the sphere of darkness. So like, you're partially immersed in it, but it's just on the cusp where you can see to right and left of it. But that's about it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But it is sitting right about there. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right, so finish that. So Fjord, that's your movement. You drop you both down on that space. 
TRAVIS: As I was coming down, I would cast Hex with my bonus action on the juggernaut that Yasha is facing. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: As I was coming into this precarious cliff landing, I would fire off four Eldritch Blasts-- 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
TRAVIS: -- at that juggernaut that is hexed. 
MATT: Okay. You do have disadvantage on these attacks because the juggernaut is currently now swallowed in darkness right as you cast Hex, because she was holding her action until you were in range to cast it. Then all of a sudden it fills with darkness. 
LAURA: I'm sorry, Fjord. 
MATT: You can still see where it is. 
TRAVIS: How dare. 
MATT: So you get four attacks at disadvantage. 
TALIESIN: How does this work? 
LAURA: There's also that shriek that's coming at us. 
TRAVIS: Misses. That is 33 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: First one missed. Second is, boy, 19 to hit. 
MATT: Hits. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good. Third one is a 20 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay, great. 
MATT: So three hits on that. 
TRAVIS: Not too bad, not too bad. 
MATT: They're not extremely high ACs. They just got a fair amount of hit points and they hurt a lot. 
TALIESIN: We would've established if they understand Common, right? 
MATT: Yeah, I mean, the conversations you've had and you heard them talk, some of them have their own languages, but also you've heard shouts of Common around. So you can assume that some do. 
TALIESIN: Some do. All right. 
TRAVIS: 26... 
TALIESIN: Oh, I think they dream in Common. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. True, true, true. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: 33... 
LAURA: Well they dream in lots of languages, I assume. 
TRAVIS: 37 plus five is 42. 42 points of total eldritch damage, including Hex. 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
MATT: One goes (whoosh) and carves out to the darkness off into the distance, but the other three you hear (explosive impacts) as well as a (groans), doubling over impact pain as you land down onto setting Jester onto the side. Yeah, pretty heavy hits on that. 
TRAVIS: That's our turn. Fjord's out there hanging out horizontally off the cliff. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He's doing the moonwalk, space walk. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: What if we're balancing each other? (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Nice. (laughs) Hold on. Ropes course. 
MATT: All right, the Blade Baron is going to move 30 feet this way. 
ASHLEY: Blade Baron. 
LIAM: Where is the Baron at the moment? 
MATT: Right over here. His blades move with him. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that would've been-- 
MATT: Then he is going to use his Blade Storm ability, which means he can move all of his blades. Yasha's the only one close enough. In the middle of the shadow, he's going to send these blades. 
LIAM: For fuck's sake. 
LAURA: Oh no, Yasha! 
ASHLEY: That's okay. 
MATT: Shifting in from there. All the blades (rapid swirl) begin to whip around in a frenzy around you. Make a dexterity saving throw that you technically cannot see because the darkness prevents you from noticing their arrival until it's too late. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Nine. 
MATT: Nine fails. So that's 8d10 slashing damage. 
LIAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: 8d10?! 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: 8d10? Okay. 
LIAM: That's 40 points of damage, ish. Halved to 20, ish. 
LAURA: (chuckles) 
TRAVIS: Unless they're magical. 
MATT: 42 points of-- No, magic still gets halved. 
TRAVIS: Okay, good. 
MATT: 42 points of slashing damage reduced to 21. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's-- 
MATT: That finishes the Blade Baron's go. 
MARISHA: This is, you know, barbarian. 
ASHLEY: Damn. Okay. 
MATT: (Gaz) "Hope you didn't start the party without me!" 
LAURA: Yeah, Gaz! 
LIAM: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Leaping off the side-- 
MARISHA: Please don't die. 
MATT: -- with a massive arc in the air and pulling two glass blades out as he jumps in the air. 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
MATT: "Don't worry." 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Oh, he's big. 
MATT: "Gaz has got ya." 
TALIESIN: He's a big boy. 
LAURA: Yeah, he's a juggernaut. 
ASHLEY: I forgot. 
MATT: Takes a leap up onto there. Nothing's quite in range. He goes, "Ah, schnikey, kind of out of--" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Misrepresented that one." 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: "You!" "You're going to die." But he's on the battlefield there. About there, it's going to finish that go. Veth, you're up. 
SAM: I guess I will bonus action disengage. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: From this Shrike. Poo. 
MATT: Feskul, technically. 
SAM: Oh. Then I will run my 30 feet towards my friends. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Maybe, maybe-- 
MATT: 30 or up here? 
SAM: Yeah, maybe up along the-- 
MATT: The wall? 
SAM: Yeah. I know I can't see them, but I'm going to hope I remember where they are. Tell me this. 
MATT: Yeah? 
SAM: I get sneak attack, I get sneak attack if they can't see me. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: All right, so they're in there. Hope I don't hit Beau, (whispers) but I sort of hope I do. (laughs) 
MARISHA: You bi-- I can hear you! 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
SAM: She can't hear through the darkness. (laughter) 
SAM: She reads lips. All right, I will fire my Aeorian security cannon, All right, I will fire my Aeorian security cannon, which is the weapon that I use. 
MATT: At the one fighting Beau? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. Yeah, so it is-- 
SAM: Disadvantage. 
MATT: It's at disadvantage because of the attack, but she's still next to it so you still get sneak attack if you hit. 
SAM: Okay, so roll twice. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
SAM: Where's my other rollie thing? 
LIAM: Do you need a rollie? 
SAM: I think it's called a dice. 
LIAM: A rollie dice. 
SAM: Where's my Gil? Where'd it go? 
LAURA: Right here. 
SAM: Oh wow. I couldn't see it. 
LAURA: Wow, Sam. 
MATT: It blended in. 
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. A 20 and an 18. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Ooh! 
SAM: Amazing! 
MATT: That'll hit. 
SAM: Okay yeah, that definitely hits, and I get a million points of sneak attack damage. Okay, let's see this here. It's-- Wait, how many are there here? I'm not rolling, I'm just counting them. Four. Four, okay, yes. 11d6. Okay. Five, 10, 15, (struggling whines) 20, 32. 
MARISHA and LIAM: (mocking whines) 
MARISHA: Counting is hard. 
SAM: 39 points of damage. 
MATT: Nice! 
SAM: I already used my bonus action, didn't I? And my move and my action. That's all that a D&D character can do. 
MATT: Yep. Bonus, action, move. All right. Finishing Veth's go, we're back up at the top of the round. Beauregard, you're up, with Caleb on deck. 
MARISHA: Okay. We're trying to get out of here. I will-- Since they're in darkness, if I bolt out of here, will I provoke an attack of opportunity? 
MATT: You will, it'll be at disadvantage because they can't see you. The minute they hear you starting to move he's going to try and swing wildly in the space, but. Actually no, if you can't see a target, I think the rule is if you can't see a target you aren't able to make an attack of opportunity. Whether invisibility or with that, I've learned through the years, apparently at some point, as the internet yelled at me. So yeah, you may, I'll say he's not going to attack of opportunity because he is currently blinded. 
TRAVIS: Also, Matt, Hex on the barbarian with Yasha has disadvantage on strength checks. 
MATT: Got it. 
LAURA: Also, Matt, Caduceus is no longer a beetle, because I cast the Darkness. 
SAM: (gasps) Oh no. 
TALIESIN: I got kicked out of the band. 
MATT and LIAM: (chuckle) 
TALIESIN: At least I wasn't-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Just hovering somewhere. (wheezes) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, at least I didn't Wile E. Coyote at the end. (laughter) 
LIAM: (like Caduceus) Well. (laughter) 
MATT: Ya-hoo-hoo-ooey! That's-- actually, he would've made the Goofy sound. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay. Here's what we are going to do. 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Are you good? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Are you sure? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Because I'll hop out, too, because we can't attack in darkness? Because we can't-- Right? 
MATT: You can attack, you're just at disadvantage. 
TALIESIN: Can't you see in dark? Don't you have goggles? 
LAURA: They can't see-- He's not going to see you if you leave. 
MARISHA: Yeah, but it's-- 
LIAM: But not-- 
LIAM and MARISHA: -- magical darkness. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's special darkness. 
MARISHA: I'm going to run-- Because we're trying to get this way. We're all still moving in this direction, yeah? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm going to move my speed and jump down and square up against this guy. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say you might not need him, but okay. 
MARISHA: Boink. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Ah! Fancy meeting you here. Then I am going to use my action to expend-- (murmured reading of rules) 
TRAVIS: Mmm. 
MARISHA: Mmm. 
MATT: Mmm. 
MARISHA: Mmm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there was a realm where I could've taken care of that guy. But I don't-- We don't have earrings. 
MARISHA: These guy's are probably pretty stronk, aren't they? 
MATT: They seem pretty beefy. Reiloran hulks are genetically designed to be brutes. 
MARISHA: Um. Hmm. That, sorry. I am sorry! Sorry. 
SAM: You should be. 
MARISHA: I don't want to-- I don't want to risk anyth-- God, it would be so cool if it worked, though. 
SAM: Do the cool thing. 
LIAM: Shove that fool off? 
MARISHA: I'll try the cool thing because then I can always still do Flurry of Blows as my bonus action. 
MATT: Okay, what are you trying to do? 
MARISHA: So I'm going to take my staff, spin it around, and a Gust of Wind starts forming around it. I'm going to bring it around my back and do a big sweep and try and use one of my charges to try to push him off this cliff. 
MATT: Okay, for the Belabor? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Nice. 
LIAM: Belabor. 
MARISHA: He has to make a-- 
ASHLEY: ♪ I'm a Belabor ♪ 
MARISHA: -- strength saving throw. 
MATT: Okay, what's the DC? 
MARISHA: 15. 
MATT: 15. Natural six. 
LIAM: Oh yes. 
LAURA: Oh my god, it worked? 
MATT: That's not going to be enough. 
MARISHA: (laughs) (mocking noises) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: You leap out of the darkness, (whooshing) (thudding) land, he's not expecting you, all of a sudden he's like, pulls back as you, (whooshing), and he falls off the edge. "(groaning)" And vanishes hundreds of feet-- 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
MATT: -- into the dark below. 
MARISHA: ♪ I believe I can fly ♪ 
SAM: Woo! 
MARISHA: Fantastic. 
TRAVIS: ♪ (beatboxing) ♪ 
MARISHA: No one else is around, I can't really do much else. 
TALIESIN: I'm underneath you, but you don't know that. 
LAURA: I think you would've seen him fly past you. 
TRAVIS: Are you reaching a hand out to Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Well, fuck, there goes my idea. 
TRAVIS: Get that motherfucker to jump up. That's pretty high. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Can you get up, Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: I'll take the help. 
MATT: I will say, given the circumstances and the focus of things, you likely did not see Caduceus go down there and would not be aware that he's there. 
MARISHA: Then I will Patient Defense. 
MATT: Okay. Put that in there. Finishing Beauregard's go, Caleb, you're up, with Caduceus on deck. 
TRAVIS: I'm a bird! 
LIAM: Yeah, with seven hit points. I want to save all of my juice for later. You've got Gaz. I'm going to-- 
SAM: ♪ You've got the Gaz ♪ 
MATT: (chuckles) 
TRAVIS: ♪ You got the power ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LIAM: This is sheer inside, going in? 
MATT: Yeah, it opens up inside at that point. 
LIAM: All right, I'm going to curve around Fjord and Jester. 
MATT: Okay. 80 feet, you said? 
LIAM: 80 feet. 
MATT: All righty, so that'll get you around there. Yeah, you'll get to about here. 
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to land there and put a wing down for Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: But Caduceus' turn-- 
MATT: Is after you. 
TALIESIN: Is right after you. 
LIAM: -- is right after mine. So there's no way for me to use my action to fly further if I wait for Caduceus, right? 
TALIESIN: Is it an action if he uses a dash? 
MATT: You can. 
TALIESIN: Holding a dash? 
MATT: If you want to hold your action as a dash and then wait for him to get on then you can do that. 
LIAM: Yes, that's what I would do to get us further in. 
MATT: You got it. Okay. So that finishes your go. Caduceus, you're up. 
TALIESIN: I am going to climb onto the-- 
SAM: Mount Caleb. 
TALIESIN: -- back of the bird and then I'm also going to-- I can't find anything, Just because I have a second and I can do this. I'm going to use my action to cast Guidance on you. 
LIAM: (squawks) 
SAM: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Thank you, buddy. 
MATT: (chuckles) All right, so with Caduceus currently hovering on Caleb eagleback on there. You then spend your held action to dash. Dashing into the alcove. 
LIAM: Yeah, and I'll get in a ways. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Look at this eagle back ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: About this point. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: The collapsed opening is now exposed layers of halls. You have flashbacks to the depths-- 
LIAM: Of Aeor 
MATT: -- of Aeor where you can see exposed stacks of floors. Here it's all crumbled in, the impact of it being dragged down. You can see bits of exposed metal and a lot of the stone has just fallen in. You can see the occasional long hallways that go inside and is a beautiful, odd interior of polished dark metal floors and rows and rows of intricately carved pillars. 
LAURA: Oh no, Fjord! 
MATT: No, Fjord, no! 
TALIESIN: No wedding anymore. 
TRAVIS: Single again! (laughter) 
MATT: Very-- 
LAURA: Fucking dick. 
MATT: -- precarious edge, there. 
ASHLEY: Oh, is he going again? 
MATT: He's leaning back. 
MATT and LIAM: ♪ Lean back ♪ 
ASHLEY: ♪ Lean back ♪ 
LAURA: Hold onto my tail! 
TRAVIS: My chill is more intense than yours. 
MATT: So that's about as far as you get, catching yourself as now you have these multiple levels and you can see some soldiers climbing out of edges and people that are trying to get to the edge here or to see what's going on. 
LIAM: If I have the option, I would stay in eagle form and land on the edge of a unoccupied broken shelf, that I'm not hovering to get dropped. 
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. You catch yourself up on the edge. You are noticed by some of these, you know, soldiers that are there, they see you going there and you perch out of view on a different floor. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: But that's where your turn ends. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right, so Caduceus, that was-- You got onto that. 
LIAM: Can I ask one last question? Do Caduceus and I have any view of anything out here where we are? 
MATT: You have a view of Beauregard and this feskul. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: And this one glass cannoneer. 
LIAM: Got it, thank you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think that's good for now, yeah. 
MATT: Do you want to use the dodge action just to keep it ready if you don't want to cast anything? 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a good idea. I didn't even think of that. 
MATT: Anybody can take the dodge action. 
TALIESIN: I will take the dodge action. 
MATT: She just gets to do it as a bonus action. Okay. 
TALIESIN: I always forget that that's a thing. 
MATT: Yeah. All right, cool, that finishes your go. Yasha, you're up. 
LIAM: I'm a monk! 
ASHLEY: Are the glass cannoneers gone? 
MATT: Glass cannoneers? 
ASHLEY: I thought they were before me, but I may have-- 
MATT: No, no, they're after you. 
TRAVIS: I have them after Yasha. 
ASHLEY: I am so sorry. 
MATT: It's you, them, and then Jester. 
SAM: I am so sorry, Matt. 
ASHLEY: I am so sorry. Okay, so, if we're trying to make it in there-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) Quoting our show again. 
LIAM: Yeah, getting it around. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to start ♪ makin' my way ♪ back to the hole. 
LIAM: Shit-cocking it. 
MATT: Okay. Now there is still a blinded or shadow consumed juggernaut in there who is hexed. 
ASHLEY: Can I see him? 
MATT: In a very little space to get by him. So you will have to make a, I'll say an acrobatics check to try and get past him on the edge of this cliff without-- 
ASHLEY: Can I see him to try to make an attack? 
MATT: You can't see him, I mean, you know he's there. 
TRAVIS: The side-mouth talk. 
ASHLEY: I don't know why. 
MATT: You know he's there because he hasn't moved from that place, but he's engulfed in shadow. You can make attacks on him, but they're at disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Try to chuck him off. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to take an attack on him. 
MATT: Okay, you attack with Scaldsaber? What do you want to do? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: All right. So-- 
ASHLEY: Disadvantage. 
MATT: Disadvantage, but you can take Reckless, if you want to, and cancel it out. 
ASHLEY: Oh yes. Great, Reckless. 
MATT: Let's go. 
ASHLEY: That's what we're going to do. 
SAM: Fjord is horizontal. 
ASHLEY: Oh god. I don't know if that hits. 
TALIESIN: Why do you keep rolling that die? It has been bad to you forever. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 17. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: Oh good! 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
MATT: So you get two attacks. 
ASHLEY: It's two attacks, yeah. Let me do another one. All right. Oh, that definitely hits. 
MATT: Okay, so two hits on him, even though he is consumed my darkness. Roll your Scaldsaber damage twice. 
ASHLEY: So we've got. Ooh, 11 plus. 
LIAM: It's whatever number you want it to be. 
ASHLEY: The first hit is 24. 
MATT: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Plus 1d8 fire damage. 
MATT: Awesome. 
ASHLEY: Which is six. 
MATT: Great, so 30 damage total on that. 
ASHLEY: And then Divine Fury is another d6. So that's 13. 
MATT: How much Divine Fury damage was that? 
ASHLEY: That's 13 points. 
MATT: Oh, 13. 
ASHLEY: Because I rolled a three, and then it's a plus 10, Divine Fury, for radiant damage because-- 
MATT: Oh right, right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I don't know why, I just wrote it down. 
MATT: Well, I'm going to double check if that's-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, double check actually, because I'm-- Hang on. 
LIAM: Juice! 
ASHLEY: No! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Divine-- 
ASHLEY: Yes, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that is 1d6 plus 10. Holy shit balls. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So that's once per turn, you can do that? 
ASHLEY: That is-- 
MATT: Yeah. It's been a bit since we've played these characters. 
TRAVIS: 100%. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yes. 
MATT: Yeah, so an additional 13. So that is 43 points of damage on that first hit. 
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ, you're a monster. 
ASHLEY: Okay, second hit. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay yeah, that's great. 
LAURA: That's good, right? 
ASHLEY: We've got 19 points of damage. 
MATT: 19 points of damage. Hold on a second. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
LIAM: That seems-- 
MATT: He is looking real hurt. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
LAURA: Hanging on. 
MATT: Or he would be, if you could see him. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay. 
MATT: You strike twice with the Scaldsaber. As you carve through the air, "(growls)" in your head, "Fuck!" 
ASHLEY: Great, and then I'll try to shimmy by. 
MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Acrobatics? 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right, all right. Let's do-- 
MATT: This is less athletics, but trying to do something-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: -- strength. This is carefully, nimbly moving along the edge. 
ASHLEY: 17? 
MATT: 17 will do it. You needed 15. 
TRAVIS: Hey! 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right. 
MATT: Barely squeeze by. 
LIAM: You're going down, down, baby. 
MATT: He does not get an opportunity attack on you because he cannot see you. 
ASHLEY: He can't see? Okay, great. 
MATT: You hear the swing, but they're going wide to nothing in the space. 
ASHLEY: Okay, and I have 50 feet of movement, so I'm going to try to get-- 
MATT: Right. So that'd be 10 to get there. Or sorry, 15 to get there. 
ASHLEY: So I'll try to get as far in as I can. 
MATT: Okay. 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. You can try and leap down to meet the ledge that Caleb and Caduceus are on, if you want to-- 
ASHLEY: Let's do it. 
MATT: -- with the rest of your movement. Make one more athletics, sorry, acrobatics check to try and land without taking any damage. It is a 20-foot drop. 
ASHLEY: Okay. That's cocked. That's cocked again. 
MATT: That die! 
TALIESIN: I hate that die so much. 
ASHLEY: I know. It's cocked again. 
LAURA: Ashley! 
MARISHA: What the fuck? 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 17 again. 
MATT: 17. Yeah, you catch yourself fine. 
ASHLEY: Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm just going to steal it. 
ASHLEY: When it rolls well, though, it rolls well. 
MATT: Sure, when it rolls. 
TALIESIN: Except when it doesn't. 
ASHLEY: When it rolls. 
TRAVIS: Every sixth roll. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I love it. 
MATT: It's a very pretty dice. It's just wild to see a dice that's designed to not finish rolling. 
ASHLEY: I know! (laughter) 
MATT: It's like the "Inception" top-- 
TALIESIN: If you didn't roll it on-- 
MATT: -- in real life. 
ASHLEY: It probably would, if it was a hard-- Yeah, it probably would. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know. Just a thought. 
ASHLEY: Maybe I'll try it on wood. 
MATT: So that finishes your turn? You leap down. You've now joined-- 
ASHLEY: That finishes my turn. 
MATT: -- with Caduceus and Caleb. 
ASHLEY: Done. 
MATT: Finishing Yasha's go, it is now the cannoneer's turn. This cannoneer cannot see anything over here, cannot see Jester or Fjord, cannot see Beau, cannot see any of them down here at the moment, but can see Veth. 
SAM: Sure he can. 
MARISHA: It's going for you, babe. 
MATT: It'll take two shots at you, Veth. 
SAM: I'm fine. 
LIAM: Bam bam. 
MARISHA: Deflect Missiles. 
MATT: One of them is not great. 
TALIESIN: I can't help any of this. 
MARISHA: Just shoot it with your gun. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Shoot them. 
MATT: One of them is a 13. 
SAM: Nope. 
MATT: The other is a 22. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Does that hit you? 
LAURA: Oh no! 
SAM: It hits me. 
MATT: All right. You take nine points of piercing damage, and then make an intelligence saving throw for me, please. 
SAM: Uncanny Dodge? 
MATT: Intelligence saving throw. You can Uncanny Dodge for half damage, yeah. So you take four points-- Sorry, what the total I just told you? 
SAM and LAURA: You said nine. 
MATT: I said nine. Yeah, so it was four. Four points of piercing. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Then make an intelligence saving throw. 
SAM: Intelligence saving throw. Is that a 10? 
LAURA: That's an 18. 
SAM: It is? 
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, that's a 10. 
SAM: Is that a 10 or an 18? 
LAURA: That's a 10. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You misjudged it. 
SAM: 19. 
TALIESIN: Sorry. 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: 19? 19 succeeds. You only take half damage on that. 
LAURA: Yeah, it was a 10. 
MATT: So it would be 15 reduced to seven. 
MARISHA: 10 signs that the cast of Critical Role is getting fucking old. 
MATT: 15 reduced to seven, but because you Uncanny Dodged, it would reduce it to three. 
LIAM: No, the dice are getting smaller. 
MATT: So it would be three points of psychic damage. 
SAM: Oh, okay. Great. 
TALIESIN: It's not quite Aimee Carrero's-- 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Why do you think I keep getting bigger and bigger dice? (laughter) 
MATT: This guy is going to move up over to this ledge. 
TRAVIS: On the corner. 
ASHLEY: My brain. 
MATT: Now, these two can see the troop over here. 
TALIESIN: This is mine. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: So one of them is going to fire at Caduceus. The other is going to fire at Caleb. 
LIAM: Only a monster would fire on a bird. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: They're monsters. 
MATT: Half their castle just got blown up. (laughter) 
LIAM: But I'm perched. 
MATT: So shooting at Caleb. Oh, that was d12. 
LIAM: Seven HP. 
MATT: That is going to be a 21 and a 20. 
SAM: Oof! 
MATT: Against your eagle form. 
LIAM: Well, I have an AC of 13, so yes. 
MATT: Okay yeah, so both hit. The first one does seven points of piercing damage. 
LIAM: That's to me? 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Poof. 
LIAM: Wizard. That was exactly how many hit points I have. 
TRAVIS: Wizard! 
LIAM: Had. 
MATT: Then make an intelligence saving throw for me. Oh, you're immune to psychic damage. 
LIAM: And immune to blind as well. 
MATT: Yeah, you are. Then the other attack against you is going to be-- I already rolled the attack on that one. 
LIAM: I thought it was one on each of us. 
SAM: 21 and 20. 
MATT: Sorry, no. Both of them get two shots. 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: This one's going to be 15 points of piercing damage. 
LIAM: Was this a second shot? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: What was the roll? 
SAM: You have an AC of-- It was a 20. 
LIAM: 20? 
MARISHA: 20 and 21. 
SAM: 21 was the first one. 
LIAM: No, the Shield wouldn't help, so I take that damage. 
MATT: Okay, so 15 points of piercing damage, no psychic. 
LIAM: No psychic. 
MATT: The two against you, Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: I have dodge up. I don't remember what it does. 
MATT: You do, so disadvantage on the attacks. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Which turns into a 17. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
MATT: Which misses, and a 15, which misses. 
TALIESIN: (dodges) 
LIAM: Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch. 
MATT: These bits of glass are being railgunned to the side, splintering and sparking off pieces. That finishes their go. Jester, you're up. The juggernaut's next. 
LAURA: Oh gosh! 
ASHLEY: Am I taking hits, too, down there? 
MATT: No, not yet. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
MATT: They're aiming at the eagle and the rider. 
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- No, that thing is more than 30 feet away from me, isn't it? 
TRAVIS: Which one? 
LAURA: The bird thing. The shriek. 
TRAVIS: That's pretty close. 
SAM: Could be close. 
LAURA: Is that 30 feet? 
MATT: The feskul? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: The Gaba-feskul. 
MATT: It's about 30 to 40 feet. Hard to eyeball it at this point. It's about-- It's a little over 30 feet. 
LAURA: It's over 30 feet? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You can move a little, if you need to. 
LAURA: I can't move. 
SAM: You'll fall. 
LAURA: There's nowhere for me to move to. 
SAM: You could hop. 
MATT: You can climb. 
SAM: Just hop. 
LAURA: To get within 30 feet of it? 
SAM: Nah, can't be done. 
MATT: If you jump over here. (laughs) 
LAURA: That's too far of a jump. 
TALIESIN: Whoa, yeah. 
LAURA: That's ridiculous. 
TALIESIN: That's crazy. 
LAURA: Okay, then in that case-- 
MATT: I'm just saying, it's possible. 
LAURA: -- I'm not going to cast that. I'm simply going to cast Guiding Bolt! I'm simply going to cast Guiding Bolt! 
MATT: ♪ Up their butt ♪ 
LAURA: ♪ Up the bird's butt ♪ At 2nd-level! 
TALIESIN: Birdie butt. 
MATT: Let's go. Roll an attack. 
LAURA: So that's 5d6 if I hit. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I should not roll this bee die anymore. 
TRAVIS: Bee die! 
LAURA: Because that was a 14. 
MATT: A 14? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: A 14 does not hit, unfortunately. 
LAURA: I didn't think so. 
TRAVIS: This bitch die. 
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! 
MATT: Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
LIAM: Wait. 
LAURA: No, it was a 14.

MARISHA: Wait. 
ASHLEY: Wait.

MATT: (laughs) No worries.

ASHLEY and MARISHA: ♪ ("I Feel Good") ♪ 
SAM: Bonus action? 
MATT: Do you want to move or do you want to stay put? 
SAM: Move? 
TALIESIN: Since we're leaving. 
LAURA: I'm hoping that Fjord is not going to let us just stay here. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to fly away, but you can just hang out. 
SAM: Bonus? 
TRAVIS: My darling. We're going to go. We're going to fly. 
TALIESIN: You're going to hate me when I-- 
LAURA: Could I scoochy over and leap onto that ledge? 
TRAVIS: Wait, I'm going to fly us out of here. 
MATT: Over here, you mean? 
TRAVIS: You got a plan? 
MATT: Here or here, you mean? You could try and get down there. 
LAURA: What if something hits us? You're about to-- No, all these things can go before you go. 
TRAVIS: I know. I have my arm on you. Our feet are resting. We're still flying, technically. 
LAURA: Oh really? 
TRAVIS: I've got it up for an hour. Yeah, we're going to keep going this way. I just said 40 feet, so I just parked us there. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: Yeah, how did it work in the old Superman movie? He just touches her arm and she flies? 
TRAVIS: Literally, yeah. 
MATT: Yep. Whee! 
TRAVIS: They hold hands, which makes-- 
LIAM: No sense. 
TRAVIS: Shatter her wrist, for sure. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: All metatarsals are gone. 
LAURA: Yeah, I thought it was. 
MATT: It was this romantic moment until they hit the sound barrier. 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
TRAVIS: Flesh flies off. 
MATT: Degloves her face. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
LAURA: I have no-- 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to conserve so hard. 
LAURA: -- bonuses. I don't have any bonuses. 
TRAVIS: I forgot how warm-- (face flapping in speed) 
MATT: All right. Jester, that finishes your go? 
LAURA: That's it, that's all I can do. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MATT: This juggernaut is going to try and move out of the darkness, which it does-- 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: -- and then stumbles. 
LAURA: And if falls. 
MATT: (laughs) It's going to try and make an acrobatics check with disadvantage, since it didn't expect it. 
LIAM: Eat shit, jugs. 
MARISHA: It's coming after me? 
MATT: Oh, that's not good. It fails, it falls prone. 
LAURA: Beau, kick him off the edge! 
MATT: Uses the rest of its movement-- 
LIAM and MARISHA: To get up. 
MATT: -- to get up. but that's all it's got. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That would've been funny. 
MATT: It's technically got five more feet of movement. 
TRAVIS: I fell on my tailbone! 
MARISHA: I would've loved if he would've slipped. (juggernaut shouts) 
MATT: He's going to unload on you, Beau, with three attacks. 
MARISHA: Disadvantage. 
MATT: Because you took the dodge action. 
LAURA: She's not into that. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Indeed. 
LIAM: Monk shit, monk shit, monk shit. 
MATT: Ooh, that's not great for him. That first attack is going to be a 13. 
MARISHA: Nope. 
MATT: Second attack is going to be 12. 
MARISHA: Nope. 
MATT: Third attack is going to be a natural 20 on the Beacon die and a 19, so it's just a 19 on you. 
MARISHA: Can you do anything about that? Oh, it's technically a 19. 
TALIESIN: Unless he crits, then no. 
TRAVIS: Can you do anything about that? 
TALIESIN: I mean, normally? Also, I don't know if I can see you. 
MATT: Is that going to hit your AC? 
ASHLEY: Oh, 19 is the hit, not the roll? 
MATT: Sorry, yeah. 19 was the-- 
MARISHA: No, miss. 
MATT: Yeah, so all three miss. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: He's still dazed from the impact and the shift in light in the space, and it goes wide. You dodge and duck and parry out of the way, no issue. That finishes his go. 
TALIESIN: He's fucked up, too. He's real fucked up. 
SAM: He's hexed. 
LAURA: He's hexed. 
MARISHA: Moving a little slow, buddy. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, Yasha-- 
MATT: This one here-- 
LIAM: Yasha! 
MATT: -- is going to turn, step out of the darkness, and sees that there's this sphere of it. It's going to rush along here to try and look for somebody. It looks down and sees the rest of them below. 
MARISHA: Shit, shit. 
LIAM: Get wrecked. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MARISHA: No! 
MATT: He's going to land there. That's all of his movement. He's going to unload two attacks on Caleb and one on Yasha. 
LIAM: All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm getting left alone, apparently. All right. 
LIAM: Good stuff. 
MATT: So for you, it's going to be a 13. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Laughing at-- 
MATT: Rolling like shit. 
SAM: He's not even looking at me. 
LIAM: I go (yelps) and I jump to the side. 
MATT: Jump to the side? As you duck to the wide side, the other one, it's going to be a 26. 
LIAM: 26? (grunts) 
MATT: So one goes wide, but as you duck out of the way, his other fist is coming from that direction-- 
LIAM: Definitely take that. 
MATT: -- and is going to slam you for 11 points of bludgeoning damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Then against you, Yasha. 
MARISHA: Ronin's going to get to middle school. Is just going to laugh along with the other boys. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: 20. 
ASHLEY: That just hits. 
MATT: 20 just hits, okay. 
TALIESIN: Hey man, really? 
MATT: You take-- 
SAM: Disgusting. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what we were just talking about. 
MATT: -- 13 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to six. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That's his turn. He's right on the edge. This is where you guys landed, so you're right on the cliff edge there. 
LAURA: Every time we do, it's been great. 
MATT: That's going to finish their go. 
MATT: Feskuls're going to go. 
LIAM: Or maybe it'll be like the-- 
ASHLEY: Feskuls! 
LIAM: -- old woman in cartoons where they pretend to suddenly be holding-- 
MATT: This one's going to-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, Veth! 
TRAVIS: Veth! 
MATT: While this one's going to fly down. 
SAM: I'll be fine. I'll be fine! 
MARISHA: Can you bamf or something? 
SAM: I'm try-- No! 
MATT: To parry the two of you. 
LIAM: How about running? 
SAM: I'm trying to! There's people all around! 
MARISHA: Your legs are so short. 
SAM: I need to survive to get my 50 gold. 
MATT: The one that's near the two of you is going to do a tail scythe attack. It comes down low and takes its wings and spins in space as its tail unfurls, and there is a hooked blade at the tip of it that strikes across. Hits all creatures within 10 feet of it. Both of you need to make dexterity saving throws for me. 
TRAVIS: Okay, you have a plus five to your dexterity saving throw because I have Aura of Protection. 
MATT: That's true. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
LIAM: That's just for you, Jester. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's just one. 10, six, 21. 
LAURA: 26. 
MATT: Both succeed. You take half damage. You both only take 19 points of slashing damage. 
LAURA: So that wasn't a melee attack. 
MATT: No, it's a radial spin, and you guys have to try and avoid it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But it has to roll to recharge that on future turns. 
LAURA: What was the damage? 
MATT: 21, I said, right? 
TRAVIS: 21. 
LAURA: Halved? 
MATT: Yeah. That is it halved. It would've been 43. 
LAURA: Holy moly! 
TRAVIS: No, it was more than-- Yeah, whatever. 
MATT: I think that was it. But that finishes that one's go. The one against you, Veth, is going to attack twice, once with its claws and once with its bite. 
SAM: No thank you. 
MATT: The claw attack is going to be 18 to hit you. 
SAM: No! 
MATT: Misses. The other attack is going to be a 19 to hit you. 
SAM: That is my armor class. (dodging whoosh) Ah! 
MATT: What's the order I said? Claws and bite, or bite and claws? 
SAM: I don't remember. You usually do the big one first. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Copy that. (laughter) 
SAM: Did he believe me? (laughter) 
MATT: I believe I did it in the order that it's on the sheet, which is claws then bite, which means that bite would be the second one. So that does hit you for-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He believed you. 
MATT: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: Okay, 32 points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: I rolled really high on 2d12. 
LAURA: Yowza! 
SAM: I don't have Uncanny Dodge anymore. 
LAURA: Because you don't-- 
SAM: Because I used my reaction. 
TRAVIS: Veth's up there all by herself. Is that a problem? 
LAURA: Sheesh. 
MATT: All right, so that finishes the feskuls' go. Fjord, you're up. 
LAURA: How close to us is this thingy? Is it within-- 
MATT: It's 10 feet from both of you. 
LAURA: 10 feet. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to use Hexblade's Curse as I start to fly, but getting our feet off of the rock, and I'll fire two of them at the juggernaut that's engaged with Beau. That's a 20 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful. Second one, not so great. 17 to hit. 
LAURA: That hits. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Oh great, amazing. Okay. Those first two-- I remember you said it was rough, so maybe we'll get lucky. 
MATT: The first one does-- 
TRAVIS: Eight plus five is 13 points. 
MATT: 13 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: The second one is seven, 13, 19 points of damage. 
MATT: The second one hits, and you see him stumble back, get his fists in the air, and get a little dizzy and stumble off-- 
TRAVIS: Hey! 
MATT: -- and then fall off the edge. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: (laughing) Yes! 
LIAM: (Arnold Schwarzenegger) See you at the party, Richter! 
TALIESIN: Did I see that happen, out of curiosity? 
MATT: You did. You see it tumble off the edge. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I didn't see it die, though? 
MATT: Technically, the shot is what killed it, and it stumbled off. 
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case-- 
MATT: So it did die in the moment. It died and then fell off the edge, so it fell while already gone. 
TALIESIN: Is it you? How are your HP? 
LIAM: I mean, I have very few to begin with, so maybe Yasha's hurt more than me. 
TALIESIN: She can take it, though. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I can take it. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the Keeper of Souls and I'm going to, however many hit dice that creature had are now your HP. 
MATT: Nine. You gain nine points. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
TRAVIS: I have two more Eldritch Blasts, but because the Hex killed him, can use my bonus action to shift the Hex up to the-- 
MATT: Oh yeah, you can do that. 
TRAVIS: The flying bitch. 
MATT: Feskul. Yeah, you got it. 
TRAVIS: Feskul, thank you. I'll send the next two towards him. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: First one is-- 
LIAM: Four Eldritch Blasts. That's cool. 
TRAVIS: -- 18. 
MATT: 18? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Misses. 
TRAVIS: Misses. The second one is a 23. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Okay. That one's a tougher boy. 
MATT: It's got armor plates that are bolted to it, bits of bone and metal and chain links. It's armored to be a defensive creature. 
TRAVIS: That's 27 points of eldritch damage. 
MATT: 27 points of damage. 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
MARISHA: Holy shit. 
MATT: All right. So as you blast it with a blast, parts of its armor breaks and falls off from the sheer impact of your blast. Its armor class has been reduced permanently. 
SAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: Yay! 
TRAVIS: I use my speed now, and I'll say: Hold on! We're going to fly over to where Beau is. 
LAURA: Okay, Fjord! 
SAM: ♪ Hold on to the Fjord ♪ 
MATT: You both land over on the ledge-- 
LAURA: Yay! 
MATT: -- next to Beauregard. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MARISHA: What's up? 
LAURA: Hi. 
SAM: Aren't all these guys just going to follow us into the hole? 
LAURA: Probably. 
TALIESIN: That's why we got to book fast. 
SAM: But, but, it's a big hole. 
TALIESIN: It's dangerous. A lot of them are going to fall. 
MATT: That finish your go? 
TRAVIS: Ye.... Yes. 
MATT: Okay. The Blade Baron, let's see if it recharges its Blade Storm. 
SAM: I am the Blade Baron! 
MATT: On a six, it does! So it's going to move its three blades 30 feet around Gaz. 
SAM: Oh no, Gaz! 
LAURA: No, Gaz! 
SAM: He's gone through so much. 
MATT: Gaz now has to-- 
LAURA: You and Gaz. The two of you. 
MATT: -- make a-- 
LIAM: That was a good call. 
MATT: -- dexterity saving throw. It's a natural 18, so he succeeds. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: So the 8d10 slashing damage is reduced. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to look at where we are. 
MATT: Actually, a lower roll than last time. (blows raspberry) One, three, three, one. 
TRAVIS: No! (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh, we're just in there. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. 
MATT: So 24 reduced to 12. He only takes 12 damage. That's a bad roll. That is not good damage rolls. 
ASHLEY: What is in there? 
LIAM: Watched and loved as a kid show. 
MATT: Gaz takes 12 points there. 
TALIESIN: We're in no-man's land. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: The Blade Baron sees, sends his blades over and he's trying to-- Gaz (parrying clangs) parries a lot of the attacks-- 
LAURA: Whoa! 
MATT: -- and is like, "Oh, that's cute. Let me show you how to use a real blade." 
TRAVIS: Yeah! Let's go! 
MATT: The Blade Baron goes, and is going to run. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
TRAVIS: "Yeah, that's cute." 
LIAM: What happens to his blades? Do they continue to float right there? 
MATT: Yeah, they still float there. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Actually, no, they, because he moved, they move with him, so these would actually, he's going to drag them. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to go, guys. It's been cool. 
MATT: So Blade Storm ability lets them, either they move with him on his turn, but the Blade Storm lets him move them an additional time if he wants to, so he can cover a closer distance. So he drags them 30 feet back with him. So he's fleeing and the blades go (whooshes). Fleeing with him. 
LIAM: Just panics so they're like. (clanks) 
MATT: It's now Gaz's go. 
LAURA: Yay, Gaz! 
MATT: Gaz goes, "(laughs) You're not going to get away that easy." Leaps over the wall. (whooshes) 
LIAM: Yes! 
MATT: (booms) 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Actually, he has enough movement to cover that distance (booms) "(tongue clicks)" and he's going to strike him. 
LIAM: Take that head off. 
MATT: Three attacks against the Blade Baron. 
ASHLEY: Tsk, tsk. 
LIAM: Ah-ah-ah. 
ASHLEY: Ah-ah-ah. 
MATT: That's pretty good. 
TRAVIS: Didn't say the magic word. Ah-ah-ah. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Didn't say the magic word. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Ah-ah-ah. 
MATT: Last one just barely hits. So it has a higher AC when its blades are nearby. The blades are there to defend him, but they all three hit, so it's going to be three strikes against the Blade Baron from Gaz. Each one of those is going to be-- (hisses) It's going to be 23 damage on the first hit. Second one. Same. 23 points of damage, and 20 points. Gaz just, (clashes) and with the two blade carves, the Blade Baron pulls his blades up, all three, to catch the third strike. As he pulls, the blade goes. (clashes) "Nice parry," and stabs him-- 
TRAVIS: Aw, yeah! 
MATT: -- in the stomach with the off-hand one. 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
MATT: Blade Baron, "(grunts)" and the floating blades go (clinks) on the ground, and crawls to the ground, destroyed. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Gaz! Gaz! 
ALL: Gaz! Gaz! Gaz! Gaz! Gaz! Gaz! 
MATT: This guy who's been here begins to run this way. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Gaz is awesome. 
MARISHA: That's right. 
MATT: Finishing that go, Veth, you're up. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
SAM: Do I want to disengage? 
ASHLEY: Come on, babe. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: But then I can't move as much. 
LAURA: That's true. If you just take off. 
MARISHA: Aww. Just try to risk it, you mean? 
LIAM: You'll take a hit, maybe. 
LAURA: But it's a bonus action to disengage, and then you can dash and move. 
SAM: No, I can still move 60 feet. I just can't move 90 feet. 
LAURA: Right, right, right, right, right. 
MATT: Your call. Do you want to risk it? 
SAM: Is it a risk? It's a risk. It's a risk. 
MATT: You feel like gambling? 
LAURA: Well, yeah. 
MATT: You going to play the game? 
MARISHA: Those guys hit pretty hard. 
SAM: They do. I just got 32 points. 
LAURA: They hit real hard. 
LIAM: We only have two clerics and one of them heals. 
LAURA: (cackles) 
SAM: Let's roll the dice. I'm going to just go. 
MATT: All right, so moving 90 feet? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: You're going to have to say please, though. 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Are you moving? Oh, you can make it all the way over to the edge. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: So you like (whooshes). As you run, it's going to take one swing at you. 
LIAM: Come on. 
SAM: (screeches) 
MATT: With its claws. 
LIAM: Come on, Catherine Zeta-Jones. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Scooch under. 
MATT: That is a natural five for a 15. 
LAURA: Yay! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Which you're lucky, because the attack it used, the claws could have a chance of grappling you. (groaning) If it did, then you wouldn't be able to flee. So its claws streak out towards you as you run and hit the stone wall next to you instead and (scrapes) streak across the stone as it angrily growls to itself. You run past Gaz, who's like, "Hey, put one out there." (laughter) (clap) Yeah, all right. 
TRAVIS: Put one out there. 
SAM: Oh, now my hand's covered in honey. (laughter) 
MATT: It's all on his blade handles now. 
LAURA: I got a sticky hand! 
MARISHA: God. Oh! 
MATT: He's looking around for other combatant and he's like. (slurps) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You get to the edge, you still have 10 feet of movement but it is a drop to go down where you see there's another juggernaut that's currently now battling your friends below. You can leap and make an acrobatics check to try and not take fall damage or you can stay where you are. 
SAM: If I leapt, would I be right next to the…the guy? 
MATT: Pretty close, yeah. 
SAM: (moans and laughs) But they're already engaged with him? 
MATT: They are. 
SAM: Falling on him wouldn't knock him out or anything? 
MATT: No. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Not as his size. 
TALIESIN: We're going to be fine. 
SAM: I'll jump down. I want to move. Let's move. 
MATT: Make an acrobatics check. 
SAM: A natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MATT: If you want to land on him with a natural 20, I'll let you do that, if you want to. 
SAM: I'll do a cannon ball. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You'll just break your fucking tailbone. 
MATT: So you (booms) onto him. His blades are out. He's on the edge of the cliff and he's like, (grunts) where his fists are out, and you (bangs) as the helmet closes over his face "(groans)" Veth's clutching the top of him. 
SAM: (screeches) 
LIAM: Took him out with the big old ass. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Finishing Veth's go. 
MARISHA: You want some cake? 
MATT: Beau, you're up-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- with Caleb on deck. (laughter) 
MATT: Beau, you're up. 
MARISHA: Ah, it is me. 
MATT: Caleb on deck. 
LIAM: Oh. 
MATT: With Caduceus thereafter. 
MARISHA: All right, let's get the fuck in the tunnel. 
LIAM: Hear me out. 
MARISHA: I'm running-- 
LIAM: Gaz Tomo. 
MARISHA: -- towards this guy. 
LAURA: That's not a "hear me out." (laughs) 
MATT: You can leap and catch them there. 
LAURA: That is a just a "yes." 
MATT: Make another acrobatics check. 
MARISHA: Do I get a bonus if I flank him, or is he on the edge of the cliff? 
MATT: He's on the edge of the cliff right now. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Acrobatics. 
MATT: To flank him would be off the edge, so. 
MARISHA: Let's use this one. 
LAURA: I just-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: -- had a flashback. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Acrobatics you said, right? 25. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You land. (impacts) You see him now. The juggernaut's there, who's swinging his fists, trying to grab at Veth, who's screaming and grabbing onto his helmet from the top. 
MARISHA: Boof, boof. Pop-pop, baby. 
MATT: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Le boof. 
MARISHA: Shia LaBeouf boof. Okay. That's going to give us a 20 and a 22 to hit. 
MATT: Both hit. 
SAM: Look at all of us. 
MARISHA: d12s. Sorry, sorry. They don't get used that much in here. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry, sorry. All right, that's-- 
LIAM: I'm so sorry. 
MARISHA: -- super fun. So that's going to be a 18 for the first one. 
MATT: Okay, 18 damage. 
MARISHA: Then a seven plus five is 12 for the second one. 
MARISHA: Then a seven plus five is 12 for the second one. 
MATT: Okay, so bam, bam. Two hits from that point. 
TRAVIS: Drink your milk. 
MATT: He's looking hurt. 
MARISHA: Hurt, but not like (moans). 
MATT: Not on death's door, but showing some definite wear and tear. 
MARISHA: I just don't want to blow through-- 
TALIESIN: (mumbles) Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- many of my ki points. 
LIAM: There are a bunch of us here now. 
TALIESIN: And he's on a cliff. 
MARISHA: I'll hold onto them. 
LIAM: Could whale on him. 
MATT: Okay, so you still get a free bonus action attack without using a ki point from Flurry. 
MARISHA: But that's, yeah, just one extra, one bonus is-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: But it's not two attacks, which Flurry would be. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it. 
MATT: Standard damaging attack? 
LIAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Well, it wouldn't matter. 
MARISHA: Natural one. 
MATT: Natural one. Cool. All right. Finishing Beau's go, Caleb, you're up, with Caduceus on deck. 
LIAM: Very cautious, I'm going to disengage and-- Oh, that's my action, right? If-- 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: I'm going to trust in my friends and stay put and I'm going to throw a bolt of fire into his crotch. 
MATT: Let's go. Now, you are in melee with him so you have disadvantage on a ranged attack. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay, so that is a 23 to hit. 
MATT: That still hits, roll damage. 4d10. 
LIAM: Great ball of fire in his crotch. That is 16, 26, 27 points of fire damage. 
MATT: 27 points of damage. 
LIAM: To his nuts. 
MATT: That'll do it. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: So you fling it right into his crotch as he's trying to grab for Veth. (fire whooshes) He then now is grabbing Veth and grabbing his crotch and was like "(moans)" screaming into the head armor as the flames begin to curl up and consume him. Veth, you see this as a sign that you should probably disembark. 
LIAM: I reach up and grab her hand and walk her down to the floor. 
MATT: Get her down as he-- 
SAM: Thank you, sir. 
TRAVIS: Never wants to be the only fire crotch. 
MATT: -- steps off the edge of the cliff. Each one of them has been destroyed by knocking them off a cliff or killing them at the edge of a cliff, and so he falls again and tumbles, burning into the distance below. 
ASHLEY: Ruidian barbecue! 
TALIESIN: Well, that worked out well. 
MATT: All righty. That finish your go, Caleb? 
LIAM: Oh ja. 
MATT: Caduceus, you're up, with Yasha on deck. 
TALIESIN: Ain't much happening right now. 
LIAM: Well, if he's dead, I'm going to back up 15 feet. 
MATT: You got it. 
TALIESIN: Are we heading out? 
MATT: Closer to the tunnel. 
TALIESIN: Are we? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, I'm heading in. 
LIAM: Yes. I'm heading to the-- 
TRAVIS: Ja, ja. 
MATT: Okay. So with that, all of you are starting to head into the tunnels there. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, Yasha's doing the same. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Wait. Beau, throw some ball bearings behind us so they can't follow. 
MARISHA: Good idea! (rattling) 
TRAVIS: Where are they all going? Oh! (laughter) 
MATT: You leave a bunch of ball bearings behind you? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Great. 
MARISHA: Why not? 
ASHLEY: Say hello to my little ball bearings. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: It's the best. 
SAM: I hope Gaz doesn't trip. 
MARISHA: Also, Jester-- 
LAURA: Oh no, Gaz! 
ASHLEY: Oh, Gaz! 
SAM: He's be fine! 
ASHLEY: He'll be fine. 
SAM: He'll be fine! Ball bearings are worth it! 
MARISHA: Too late now. (laughs) 
MATT: This cannoneer is going to move over here to try and get sight. Does get it. All three are going to be striking at Beau and Jester-- sorry, Fjord and Jester, since they're the ones who are currently out in the open and visible to them. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
TALIESIN: Damn it. 
MATT: So with that, that's going to be two shots on Fjord from that guy up there. Oh, not great. 21 and a 16. 
TRAVIS: 16 misses, 21 hits. 
MATT: 21 hits. You take nine points of piercing damage and make an intelligence saving throw for me. 
TRAVIS: You got it. 
LIAM: You making her run? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: (high-pitched noises) 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 23, 25. 
MATT: 25. Success. Oh, (laughs). You take three psychic damage reduced to one. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Two shots on Jester from the other one there. Oh man. 
LIAM: Sucks. 
MARISHA: An 11-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) and a 20. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: All right, the 20, no. That does seven points of piercing damage to you and make an intelligence saving throw for me. 
LIAM: This map is so cool. 
ASHLEY: I love it. It's just-- 
LAURA: 11. 
MATT: 11. That's a fail. So you take nine points of psychic damage, and the last one's going to fire one on each of you. Against you, Fjord, it's cocked. That's going to be a 24 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
MATT: You take 12 points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
MATT: And make another intelligence saving throw for me. 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. 
TRAVIS: 11, 16 plus intelligence. Intelligence save, right? 
MATT: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Plus eight. 24. 
MATT: Yeah, that's a success. So you take, instead of 12, six points of psychic damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: The last shot against you, Jester. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Ouch, that hurt. 
MATT: That's going to be a 14. 
LAURA: ♪ That doesn't hit me ♪ 
MATT: That misses. That finishes their go. 
TRAVIS: That's a strong-- 
MARISHA: Did he decide to not hit me? 
MATT: Jester, you're up. 
LAURA: Oh gosh, we're still going, huh? 
MATT: Yep. 
LIAM: You got to catch up. 
LAURA: Fuck! 
LIAM: Yes, pruck. 
MATT: Now, you could, the levels down here, so if you wanted to walk over and leap down to join Beau, you can do that and then dash in. You just have to make an acrobatics check to catch yourself. 
LIAM: So they can walk on the CR symbol? 
MATT: Yeah, right here is the edge. 
LIAM: Got it. 
MATT: Don't have much to connotate that. I'll put-- 
LIAM: No, that's fine. 
MATT: Just to make it easy. 
LIAM: I can imagine. 
MATT: This here is the ledge. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: Since the battles ended up happening in this core section there, we're making the shift go. 
SAM: ♪ Makin' shift go ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Sss-ure. Yeah, I'll do that then. 
MATT: Okay, so you run and leap down. Make an acrobatics check. 
MARISHA: In no way makes sense anymore. 
TRAVIS: No. 
LAURA: That's cocked. It's a one. 
TRAVIS: Never do. 
LAURA: One. 
MATT: A one. 
LAURA: I fall on the ball bearings? 
MATT: Ha. You do. You leap and land and (bangs) your feet get caught in the ball bearings, taking seven points of bludgeoning damage. 
SAM: Why would you come up with that idea? 
LAURA: Bludgeoning damage? 
TRAVIS: Who's throwing fucking ball bearings! 
MARISHA: I kind of forgot-- 
TRAVIS: Who's throwing ball bearings? 
MARISHA: -- that they weren't with us still. 
LAURA: Did you put these here? 
MARISHA: I thought you all were going to fly over. I thought you were flying. 
LAURA: What the shit? 
SAM: I told her not to do it! 
MARISHA: Shut your mouth-- You bitch! 
LAURA: Do I still have any movement left? (laughter) 
SAM: I'm not here. I'm a ninja. 
MATT: No, would've been 30 feet to get there. (laughter) 
MATT: Technically, you are prone from the one and the ball bearings, I'll say. You can spend half your movement, you can spend an action to dash, get up, and still move 15 feet, if you want. 
LAURA: Okay, sure. 
MATT: Okay. That'll get you almost-- 
LAURA: I can't see anything over there. I think that's fine. 
TRAVIS: You're good. 
MARISHA: You're with us. 
TRAVIS: You're good. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Jester's so gracious. 
MATT: All right, finishing Jester's go. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Juggernauts are all destroyed. The feskul. This one's going to (whooshes). 
MARISHA: Goddamn it. 
MATT: Swoop over to here, and it's going to attack Gaz with its claws. That's only going to be a 14. That misses. Then with its bite. That's going to be a 16. It just hits. So with that, okay. 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: "Okay." 
MATT: This will be, that's 3d12. That is a bad roll. Well, it actually is pretty average. So Gaz takes 22 points of damage on that bite attack. That finishes that one's go. This one is going to (whooshes) fly over to harry you, Fjord. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Harry me ♪ 
MATT: Since you've Hexed it. 
SAM: ♪ Harry me-- ♪ 
MATT: It's going to attack you with a bite. 
SAM: ♪ My wayward son ♪ 
MATT: Oh my god, that's a 12 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Misses. 
MATT: The other one is going to be 19 to hit. 
TRAVIS: 19 hits, but I'll use Armor of Hexes, and with a four, he misses. 
MATT: (whooshes) No impact. No worries. All righty, finishing the feskul's turn, Fjord, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Amazing, I'll take two, yeah, I'll take two Eldritch Blast shots at the thing. 11, so that's 25 to hit on the first one. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Second one is a two. That's going to miss. I'll take a third one. That's a natural 20. 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: (claps) 
TRAVIS: That'll probably do it. I'll do this. 
MATT: The first one is-- 
TRAVIS: Is 12 plus 10. 22 plus five is 27. 
MATT: 27, all right. 
TRAVIS: The second one-- 
MATT: The crit is-- 
TRAVIS: -- is the crit, which I don't double that die, but that's all. (laughs) Four, four, eight. 
MATT: You double all dice on it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Four, eight. Six, 12. So 20 plus 10 is 30, plus five is 35. 
MATT: 35 points of damage. (groans) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Tumbles and falls out of the way. The creature is destroyed, blasted out of the sky. 
TRAVIS: Amazing, and before I leave, the shrike that's up on the tower just had eyes on me and not everybody below him, right, for that? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Okay, so I don't need to, I won't transfer my Hex towards him. I'm going to fly off and join the others. 
MARISHA: Watch the ball bearings. 
LAURA: Avoid the ball bearings. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I just hover. 
MATT: Great. Finishing your go. 
TRAVIS: Just like Essek. 
MATT: It's now Gaz's turn. Gaz steps away. 
LIAM: Gaz! 
MATT: Attack of opportunity against him. Natural one. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: Lucky fucker. I was going to try and grapple him. Just. "Jumping!" 
MARISHA: Watch the ball bearings! 
LAURA: Watch the ball bearings! 
MATT: He's going to acrobatics check with disadvantage, because the ball bearing. 
TRAVIS: (rumbles) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Even with disadvantage, gets a, actually with a bonus to dex-- 
LAURA: He smashes the ball bearings. 
MATT: It's still 14. That's fine. He catches himself. He catches like. "(grunts)" (thuds) "Oh man, they really got to fix this place." 
TRAVIS: Literally jumped on a bunch of LEGOs. (laughter) 
MATT: Yep. Stands there and goes, like-- 
LIAM: Pulverize them. 
MATT: "All right. You guys go. I'll cover your rear." (whooshes) Blades in the front. 
ASHLEY: Yes! (applauds) 
TRAVIS: I love it. 
MATT: "Don't worry." 
LAURA: Sexy Gazzy. 
MATT: "I'll catch up." 
LAURA: He's not a "Hear me out." He's just a yes. 
MATT: "Let me just finish off some of these--" 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MATT: "-- some of these bad fellas." 
ASHLEY: Yeah, sure! 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! Gazzy! Ow! Ow! 
LAURA: Get it, Gazzy! 
SAM: Are you sure? This is seeming like suicide. 
LIAM: Turn around for us. 
TRAVIS: Come on, Gazzy. 
MATT: "Oh, don't worry." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes! (laughter) 
MATT: Blades at the ready, as he blocks off the entrance, and you can hear the shots firing in the distance and the other shots of soldiers. He gets himself ready to hold the stand, to hold the line, as the rest of your troop begins to-- 
LAURA: As we leave, I take out my honey and I leave it for him. 
MATT: He goes, "(sniffs) (huffs) Looks like the world's kind to me today." 
LAURA: For after your victory. Then I'll take off. 
MATT: He licks his lips and goes, "I like you, Honey Miss." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Honey Miss! 
LAURA: Fjord, you have to call me "Honey Miss" from now on. 
MATT: He turns back on around and goes-- (laughter) 
SAM: Single again! 
MATT: "None of you are getting a single bite!" Blades drawn, you all charge into-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "A single bite." 
MATT: -- the core of the Arx Creonum and what dangers await you from within, and we're going to end there for tonight. (cheering and applause) 
TALIESIN: We're excited! 
TRAVIS: That was so good! 
MATT: We'll pick up with the rest of this assault on the fortress, and eventually, the Weave Mind next time. Thank you so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? (cheering) 
MATT: Good night.

Cooldown[]
TRAVIS: Amazing. So good!
LIAM: That was sweet.
LAURA: Would we have been able to stealth this--
TRAVIS: What a great map, man.
LAURA: --and not have them attack us at all? But they saw us coming.
MATT: The ones that were climbing were noticed as soon as they got to the top. There could have been ways to deceive them, to jump out of the way, and-- what's the word I'm looking for?
SAM: Distract.
LAURA: Divert.
MATT: Divert, to distract. Or sleight of hand, the type of, what's it called?
LIAM: Misdirect?
MATT: Misdirect. Thank you. My brain was not working.
LIAM: Shart.
MATT: Yes. To shart past them. To misdirect, to maybe go into a stealth mode since most of you weren't seen from below. But also, it made for a fun encounter. Got to take out a bunch of bad Reiloran Weave Mind defenders and watch Gaz do some of what Gaz does best.
LIAM: I was impressed by the enemy juggernaut natural 20ing across that chasm.
MATT: That was rad. If he had rolled low enough, he would've been like: (leap) (descending scream)
TALIESIN: If nothing had happened, I was saving the Command spell specifically for: "Oh, wow. Again."
MATT: That would have been awesome!
TALIESIN: That was my: "Oh god, I think I can make this." If it would have failed, it would have been awful.
MATT: But it would have been funny. Still funny. That was awesome, guys.
TALIESIN: That play was nuts.
ASHLEY: That was so fun.
LIAM: Boy, playing one character feels so basic now.
MATT: Next campaign, everyone makes three characters and you play them all, all the time. Oh my goodness.
ASHLEY: Can't wait to go back to Bells Hells.
LAURA: Oh my gosh!
TALIESIN: It's going to be so much fun. It's so sad.
MATT: Oh yeah, all those dice--
LAURA: What a fucking cliffhanger for them.
SAM: Oh yeah, your mom! So we have an hour to get to her?
LAURA: Yeah, that's because it takes an hour to get absorbed, potentially.
MATT: An hour at most.
ASHLEY: Is it just an hour of pain?
LAURA: So she might have already been starting to be absorbed by the time she--
MATT: Could be.
TALIESIN: Or that could have been the end of it.
ASHLEY: It might have been the end of it.
MATT: All those random dice that I was having you roll over the previous sessions were essentially her perpetual deception checks to try to keep Ludinus at bay while she was trying to figure out how to use the Occultus Thalamus to get the message out. Which, she's been able to keep that from hitting the people of Exandria. So there were enough successes--
LAURA: Oh, that's good!
MATT: --so the messge never got out. But the decep--
TALIESIN: I've been wondering why.
LIAM: You're basing that story detail off of Laura's rolls? That's fucking cool. 
MATT: Yeah, off of those rolls was her mom being able to convince him like, "I haven't figured out how to disseminate this through the ley lines yet. I'm still working on it." He's like, "I need you close because I don't want to leave you out of sight with these things."
LAURA: And then my last roll that I rolled was--
MATT: "But keep trying on it." Because Ludinus is Ludinus, it progressively got harder and harder until eventually there was disadvantage imposed.
LIAM: What a fascinating random generator for you as a DM to see what would happen, just off of--
MATT: I could just decide a roll on my own, but also it's fun to-- I've done it before. I like having you guys roll dice not knowing what it's for and having that effect on things that are in other stories.
LIAM: A lot of people would just say, "This is what happens."
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: But you had checks to see what would happen, which is really cool.
MATT: Yeah, because if she had failed earlier, this message probably would have come sooner--
LAURA: It would have just gone out.
MATT: -- and there would have been no chance to get to her in time.
LAURA: Oh, gosh, and now at least there's maybe a maybe?
MATT: Now there is a chance, and-- no, I'm not going to say what could have happened if you had continued to succeed because that's not fair. That's a post-campaign topic.
SAM: We have up to an hour. I'm going to suggest that we take a short rest, though.
LAURA: She would have been able to help us in the battle if I had succeeded.
SAM: I need to get my hit dice.
MATT: Might still be able to if you get there in time and save her.
LIAM: We should also definitely continue trying to wound Beau as we go.
MARISHA: Jeez.
LIAM: For sure.
MATT: It's nice to know that I have an additional villain in this story.
MARISHA: Petty competition to the very bitter end.
SAM: Uh-huh.
LIAM: We can make room for it.
LAURA: We don't know how close we are to the Weave Mind now that we're entering the building.
MATT: You don't at the moment, though you do know a good portion, this whole area that was collapsed inward, you're able to straight shoot pretty deep into it, even just a glance down this one immediate hallway, because all the defenses are scattered outside if they haven't already been destroyed and injured and are rushing to help the injured who are still around and look for where the assaults are coming from. And they're coming from multiple places, because the other assault teams are also coming in from the other detonation points, and there's multiples across the entire stronghold. This is a moment of chaos intentionally to give you the best chance to get as far in as you can before you hit too much resistance.
SAM: But even then, we don't know other than "go in". We don't really know where we're going.
MATT: No, you got to figure out how best to learn, ascertain, or sense where they are. That's going to be part of the journey next time.
LAURA: I feel like I've got Locate Creature.
SAM: Do you? But do you know what they are?
LIAM: I like that our allies here on Ruidus are like, "We got this dope projectile cable plan. It's going to be awesome." We're like, "That's so fucking awesome!" And then in five seconds it was like: (cable snapping)
MARISHA: It just automatically--
MATT: I know!
LAURA: What fucking dumbasses.
MATT: I was like, "Okay, it's seven rolls, there's a good chance at least it's going to happen once, which will make for a fun challenge. You guys are level 20. You have all these different abilities. It'll make for a fun epic moment to save somebody at the last minute.
TALIESIN: Was it three ones?
LAURA: No, I rolled a three.
MATT: A 1 to 3 was the failure of a harness. A 4 to 6 would have had a mounted feskul come and attack you, harry you on the string, which would have done damage with a chance of grappling and pulling you off, and it would have joined this battle when you got there. On a 7 to 10 was when the soldiers began throwing spears. 13 to 18, nothing happens, and on an 18 to 20, Gaz has a moment of mental clarity and his psychic ability pulses and you actually gain speed and skip two more rounds. So it had a spread of things that could have happened, but that's how the dice rolled.
TALIESIN: It was pretty funny.
MARISHA: The Action Park version.
LIAM: (as a Bormodo) "We only weigh 30 pounds, you all-- What do you eat?"
MATT: The Action Park version? Pretty much, yeah.
TRAVIS: Are you throwing away that dice, Johnson? The black one that you had?
TALIESIN: No, she's never going to do it.
ASHLEY: No! Because I rolled it again when I was attacking and it did great.
MATT: It's like the numbers are random!
LAURA: I have these dice and I'm in love with them, but I never, ever, ever use them because I have all the other character dice and these ones don't make sense for any of my characters.
TALIESIN: That's a really pretty die.
LAURA: But they're perfect for Yasha! Look at them!
ASHLEY: But I love it. Watch, it's going to roll so good right now.
LAURA: Okay, but look at it for Yasha and tell me what you think about it.
ASHLEY: I just rolled a 19.
SAM: That means it's good.
ASHLEY: Maybe if I rolled it on the wood.
TRAVIS: Now the roll counts. Now it's real serious.
ASHLEY: 19.
MARISHA: Maybe you just need to not roll it in the tray.
ASHLEY: I think that's what I'm going to try to do.
SAM: Or while we play.
TRAVIS: Or while we play.
MATT: "Or while we play."
LAURA: Look at this dice, though! How "Yasha" are these dice?
ASHLEY: I know.
MATT: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: These are very Yasha.
TALIESIN: It's hand painted.
LAURA: Right?
LIAM: Are the numbers legible?
ASHLEY: They're legible!
TALIESIN: Then they're not for you.
SAM: By the way, you guys just missed that she rolled it a third time, didn't like it, and ignored it.
ASHLEY: Can you read them?
SAM: She just went like this. (rolls, grimaces, ignores)
MATT: Confirmation bias, is that what you're referring to?
MARISHA: In action.
LAURA: Is it rolling okay?
ASHLEY: It is, it is.
TALIEIN: It's rolling nice and nimbly.
TRAVIS: Matt, this is one of the heavier maps I've seen. Are the levels solid or are they hollow on the ends?
MATT: These are hollow, but that is solid. All those are solid. I've been working out to hold this map, essentially. I was like, I built it. 
TALIESIN: That's a really nice set, actually. Those are gorgeous.
MARISHA: Is it made of foam?
MATT: No, it's solid dwarvenite. Because this whole section is just floor, floor, floor [etc.]. Stacked high.
LIAM: Oh, it's half inch stack all the way to the top? Yeah, I've got all these pieces. They're a lot.
MATT: They're pretty dense, too. They're not usually meant to stack this many densely, but to me it was just a good challenge. I didn't realize that until I built it and went like: "I'm happy with this. (grunts) Okay, this'll be fun."
LAURA: Then your fingers got pinched underneath it when you set it on the table.
MATT: Yeah, because I was like, okay, how do I do this without shaking it too much to make it not hold together?
LIAM: It looks great.
MATT: I'm really happy with how it turned out.
TRAVIS: Look at that precipice. Matt, that's great.
MATT: I've always wanted to make cliff side stuff like this. It's fun.
MARISHA: Something I've been thinking about--
TALIESIN: Ashley, can I see your funky die? I promise I won't-- I just want to see how it reacts to--
MARISHA: --since the last game. It has pinged in my mind, but obviously we navigated away from Vox Machina. There's a beacon in Grog's bag of holding now, right?
MATT and LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Oh shit!
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Now mind you, it is--
MARISHA: Because we grabbed it and we were like, we'll deal with that later.
LAURA: Put it in the bag.
SAM: Oh god.
MARISHA: Then we went back to Whitestone.
LIAM: In an extradimensional space.
MATT: Oh, yeah.
TALIESIN: I'm going to do some cool shit with it.
MATT: You've hidden beacons in extradimensional spaces before.
LAURA: Yeah, Percy's going to go ham with that beacon.
TRAVIS: Who's that, Ashton or Caduceus?
LAURA: Percy.
LIAM: He's dropping some shit on us.
MATT: Now mind you--
TALIESIN: Percy's got a beacon. Exandria's over. That's the end. Thankfully, using the beacon, I'm going to convince you that that's a great idea. Sorry, anyway.
LIAM: I want to hear what the DM was going to say.
MATT: I was going to say there are many factions that know there's a beacon there. Aside from the altruistic political reasons that the Kryn Dynasty was definitely part of this alliance, knowledge of this strange object that was utilized in the creation and running of the Malleus Key definitely piqued their interest as well.
LIAM: ♪ Give me my beacon back, beacon back, beacon back ♪
TRAVIS: Grog with the beacon.
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?
TRAVIS: And would go, "No."
SAM: But wait, do they know we have it?
TRAVIS: The tower fell.
MATT: The tower fell.
SAM: Yeah, but nobody saw us take it. 
LIAM: They might want to ask us some questions. You're in charge of the story.
TRAVIS: Yeah, and Grog doesn't know any better. Chetney's going to try to turn over Ashton to the Dynasty.
TALIESIN: I'm into it.
LIAM: They just want his head.
MATT: These are all fun bits to explore when we get there.
TALIESIN: Oh, Percy's ruined.
SAM: Are we meeting anybody else in this hole or is it just us now?
LAURA: It's just us now, I think.
MATT: It's just you and--
TRAVIS: Tony Stark and arc reactor.
MATT: There are other assault crews that are going through that you might encounter depending on the paths that you take and the order of arrival, if they even make it. I'll be making rolls; I'll probably be having you guys making rolls for the other assault teams to see their progress as well.
LIAM: You said where we landed there were a couple of other floors where there were enemies, but we flew into an unoccupied--
MATT: Correct. And they saw you go in there, so they were probably preparing to go, but Gaz definitely plugged a hole and is using himself to hold them off for the time being to give you a running start.
LAURA: We didn't have any information about if the Weave Mind was high in the citadel or low in the citadel?
MATT: No. But that's part of the fun of searching, investigating, and figuring out how best to get there.
SAM: Can we sense psychic energy? Or sense... We don't have any mind readers.
LAURA: We don't have any mind readers.
MATT: The best you know is it's believed their main chamber exists in the core of the Arx Creonum.
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: So as long as you're moving towards the heart of the construct itself, you're likely moving in the right-ish direction.
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: That's the most you have.
LAURA: Where can we duck in and take a long rest?
SAM: You can't! Your mom will die!
LAURA: Hey, that's Imogen.
SAM: Oh, it's not your mom.
LAURA: I'm talking about Jester.
SAM: You're right.
LAURA: Where can the Mighty Nein duck in and take a long rest?
MATT: I mean, anywhere. It'll be a really short long rest before you all wake up and are slaughtered.
TRAVIS: Yeah, because the other team is in the middle of a fight.
SAM: Maybe there's some privacy rooms, like for breastfeeding, that we can find.
MATT: Oh, there's like 14 of those throughout the citadel, yeah, and they are very strict about their rules there.
TALIESIN: Honestly, just ten minutes for a little heal would be great, because I can at least throw some hit points at everybody if we have 10 minutes.
MATT: Well, let's see what you can do.
TRAVIS: All right, we got episodes to review. Good game, y'all!
MATT: We'll figure it out.
LIAM: Wait wait wait. When are Beau and Yasha and Veth going to have a date night in the tower?
MATT: Oh my god. You folks.
TALIESIN: That was amazing.
MATT: All right.
