Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons & Dragons! (garbled nonsense) 
MATT: Yeah, but we have some announcements to get through before we jump into tonight's game. So, let's begin with our first sponsor tonight is Thorum, makers of truly unique wedding bands. Sam, what you got there? 
TRAVIS: Shh. Matt, can't you see Sam is asleep? 
MATT: He has to read the ad. Wake him up. 
SAM: (mumbles softly) 
MARISHA: No, Matt, shh. Oh my god. Do you know how long it took to get him down, okay? He's finally down. Yes. There we go. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, with the Legend of Vox-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN, LAURA, and ASHLEY: (shushing) 
TRAVIS: With the Legend of Vox Machina season three launch, him playing Braius, Veth, and Scanlan, not to mention how long it takes to brush his giant fucking teeth-- 
MARISHA: They're so giant. 
TRAVIS: -- Sam has been so tired and cranky. 
MARISHA: So tired. 
TRAVIS: He needs this nap. 
MARISHA: This is better for all of us. 
MATT: But Thorum paid for this sponsorship. 
MARISHA: It's okay. It's okay, it's fine. I'll just do it. Okay. Thorum makes unique wedding bands out of everything from meteorite to whiskey barrels-- 
TRAVIS: This is very ASMR. 
MARISHA: -- and new minimalist watches featuring Hawaiian Koa and California Redwood. And, they make super cute little pendant necklaces. [phone ringing] (gasps) 
SAM: (sleepy groans) 
MARISHA: What? No, no, no! 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (shushing) 
MARISHA: No, Liam! 
TALIESIN: Liam, what the fuck? [phone ring warbles and ends] 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
LAURA: (muffled) It's okay. 
SAM: (sleepy groans) 
MARISHA: Well that worked great. That was great. 
ROBBIE: (suppressed laugh) 
TRAVIS: Thorum ships every single ring for free, has over 10,000 five-star reviews, and every purchase includes a free silicone activity band and walnut wood ring box. 
SAM: (sleepy) Hmm? 
MARISHA: Don't you do it. 
TRAVIS: Don't fucking-- 
ROBBIE: Don't you-- 
LAURA: (winding up for sneeze) 
SAM: (sleepy groans) 
ASHLEY: (exhales relief) 
ASHLEY: (massive sneeze) 
MARISHA and ROBBIE: Oh! 
SAM: (startles) (wails) 
TRAVIS: No, it's okay. No, no. No, it's okay. 
MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no. It's okay. 
SAM: (wails) 
MARISHA: Here, here, here. What do I do? What do I do? 
TRAVIS: Swaddle, swaddle, pacify. The five S's, the five S's. 
SAM: (continues wailing) 
MARISHA: (shushing) There you go. There you go, there you go. 
TRAVIS: It's okay, it's okay. Back to sleep, back to sleep. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, we're good. 
TRAVIS: It's okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, that's great. Okay, so whether you need a wedding ring, an anniversary ring, or just an awesome ring, head to Thorum.com and use code Critical Role for 20% off anything. 
TRAVIS: Matt, shh to you. 
MATT: Okay, yeah. Now that happened. Well, we dried off the table and we're going to jump into our next bit. Travis, you got something to talk about? 
TRAVIS: Oh, Sam disappeared. This is incredible! 
SAM: I'm over here! I'm over here! 
MARISHA: We have space now. 
TRAVIS: It's amazing! You guys, all 12 episodes of the Legend of Vox Machina season three are available now on Prime video! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: You got to catch this season, it's madness. The VODs for both our mid-season and finale wrap parties are also now available as well, so be sure to check them out. 
ASHLEY: Ow! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: And, if you didn't hear, look forward to details about season four! 
MATT: Yeah! (cheering) 
LAURA: I got to roll and see if I get a four. Nope. 10 seasons. 
MARISHA: 10 seasons-- 
MARISHA and ROBBIE: and a movie. 
MATT: There you go. 
ASHLEY and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: Sam, you got an announcement to make. 
SAM: My announcement is that some of us, many of us, can sing. 
TRAVIS: No. 
ASHLEY: What?! 
LAURA: Say what? 
LIAM: Most of us. 
SAM: Those of us that can sing have granted you all a musical Critmas gift. Four original holiday tracks embodying the spirit of Critmas. 
ROBBIE: No! 
SAM: Performed by us! 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: What?! 
SAM: With the help of an amazing producer named Peter Habib. 
TRAVIS: Habib! 
LAURA: He's amazing! 
SAM: Enjoy our dulcet tones with tracks like "Winter's Crest Festival Time" and "It's Critmas." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: ♪ Critmas ♪ 
ASHLEY: ♪ It's Critmas ♪ 
LIAM: Oh!

ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: I want to tell you about our new item from the Vox Machina collection: Scanlan Shorthalt sleep set. 
SAM: What! 
MATT: What is it? 
TRAVIS: Sleep set? 
MATT: Sleep set? 
SAM: What is that? 
ASHLEY: This is amazing. 
LAURA: It's some boxers! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Yeah! So these have been opened before. These ones are super wrinkly right now, but they're like-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: I should've worn these in the bit! 
LAURA: You should've worn them! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: They would've been so teeny on you. These are so small right now. 
ASHLEY: Those are so small. 
MATT: That wouldn't stop him. 
LAURA: You guys, there's little secrets. Wait. 
SAM: Secrets? 
ASHLEY: Secrets?! 
TALIESIN: Secrets in your boxers? 
ASHLEY: Secrets underneath-- 
SAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: In the crotch. 
ROBBIE: Oh, that's funny. 
SAM: There's a cube! There's a cube! 
LIAM: Yes they do! 
LAURA: Then you also get a sleep mask. 
MATT: It's not a secret anymore. 
SAM: Ooh, I use those. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's cute! 
SAM: And sunglasses! 
LAURA: Then there's a little-- Just check it out. There's little Easter eggs. (laughter) 
LAURA: Anyway, there's other cozy merch in the Critical Role shop now. Go check it out. 
MARISHA: So cozy. 
MATT: Thank you, Laura. 
LAURA: You're welcome. 
MATT: We are all so bad at this. 
LAURA: Yeah, well-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: 10 years. 
LAURA: You could've worn this too! 
SAM: I could've worn both of them. 
LAURA: Mother-- 
SAM: It would've been synergy. 
ROBBIE: When you pulled them out, I thought they were just briefs. 
LAURA: Well, I wanted to surprise you. 
SAM: You look ridiculous. 
ASHLEY: Mother bitch. (laughter) 
LAURA: Do I look as cute as I feel? 
MATT: I think so. 
SAM: I'm going to wear them on a plane to Australia. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
ASHLEY: We should all wear these on the plane. Okay. 
MATT: All right, friends. (laughter)

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off, Bells Hells and the Mighty Nein had traversed their journey through the hidden portal to Ruidus, had gone to the depths of the Ruidian capital city of Kreviris and made contact with the remnants of the Volition, set themselves up, prepared for the assault on the Malleus Key to commence and be the distraction they need to divide and hit their targets within the red moon. As they gave message, we cut to a short time before this, where the members of Vox Machina present in Vasselheim begin to collect the rest of their allies so they can be part of the spearhead of this attack on the Malleus Key and the fortress that has risen from the surrounding dust of the Tishtan Site in the Hellcatch. As you've went to Whitestone and gathered Percival De Rolo, Cerkonos, the Flamespeaker from Pyrah had joined you from Vasselheim, and the one member you had a hard time locating for quite some time seemed to be on a trek in Wildemount. Upon catching up with Scanlan Shorthalt himself and his troupe of traveling midlife crises-ers-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- who had transformed themselves into purple centaur-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: -- were making their leather jacket road trip across-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: -- that distant continent before you let him know that you needed his help once more. Upon him deciding to join, you all had a group hug as he mentioned that he had to tell the other guys and let them know what's going on. So here in the darkened, star filled night in the Barbed Fields of the exterior range of Bazzoxan in the plains of Xhorhas, the Wastes, you all disengage from your group hug and Scanlan, lower horse body and tail, the rest of your friends await you to join their band not far from where you currently converse. 
SAM: So I'm going over to talk to the boys? 
MATT: Up to you. Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) Or not. You could just leave them there. 
SAM: Silver Saddles, huddle up, guys. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (clip-clopping hooves) They all approach. 
TRAVIS: "Silver Saddles." (laughs) 
SAM: Listen, I hate to do this to you. We've all been looking forward to this road trip a long time, other than Keg, who we just met. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: But I'm going to have to bounce. 
MATT: "Ah, come on!" 
SAM: I know, I know. 
MATT: "That's bullshit, Scanman." 
SAM: I'm sorry. Doctor, Kent, Keg, Lionel, I'm sorry, guys. But you know, we had some really great times, you know? Jameson painted a lot of those times. 
MATT: (Jameson) "I'm still working on a couple ones there, Mr. Scanlan." 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. You can call me Scanlan now. No mister. 
MATT: "Scanlan." 
SAM: You've earned it. I mean-- Come on, we double teamed that woman in-- No, I'm kidding. I'm just kidding. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) That turned-- 
SAM: Kidding, Jameson. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
SAM: But hey, are you guys going to-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (whinnies) 
SAM: Are you guys going to be okay on your own? Do you need any money? Are you going to continue on or you going to call it off? 
MATT: Dr. Dranzel scratches his head and pulls the hat, his travel hat from his head and holds it to his chest. (Dr. Dranzel) "You know, Scanlan, we've been around the block a few times. Through these years, we've had many adventures together and times where we were guided across the length and breadth of Exandria by your light and sheer force of personality and times where you weren't around, and you know what? We got by either way." 
SAM: That's true. 
MATT: "After all, that's why it is my band." 
SAM: (laughs) That's true. 
MATT: "I got them. Don't you worry about it." 
SAM: Okay, but when you get to the end of the road, the end of the continent, please send me a message or make a painting of it or something. I really want to see what I missed. 
MATT: "Totally. Well, if you're not guiding us, who's going to be the navigator?" Turns over and Lionel goes like, (Lionel) "It's hard to explain, but I have kind of a natural instinct for--" (laughter) 
MATT: "-- weather patterns and directions. So I think I got it." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: All right. Fly true. 
MATT: Keg clops up. (horse trotting) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (Keg) "Hey, I'm Keg." 
ASHLEY: Hi, Keg. 
MARISHA: Hello. 
TALIESIN: Charmed. 
MATT: "Bye." 
MARISHA: Bye. 
TRAVIS: (neighing) 
MATT: (laughs) Just goes around. Doesn't seem as interested in your troop. 
TALIESIN: I like her. 
MARISHA: Fair. Okay. You don't know her. 
MATT: Kent Plucker-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's why I like her. 
MATT: Kent Plucker comes up to the side. (Kent) "Hey, hey, Scanlan. So you're going where the adventure is, huh?" 
SAM: It sounds like it, yeah. 
MATT: "Maybe we could be a team." 
SAM: Oh, you-- 
MATT: "Maybe the two of us." 
SAM: Oh, you want to come with us? 
MATT: "Well, I mean, you know my capabilities, right?" 
SAM: Yeah, I mean... 
MATT: "It's about time that we truly showed the world what we can do, shoulder to shoulder." 
SAM: Listen, you're great on rhythm guitar and stuff. But you know, I'm the lead, so I don't know if you can sort of jam-- 
MATT: "Yeah, fuck you." (laughter) 
SAM: Sorry, Kent. 
MATT: Turns around and is just like, "Anyway, I hope you all have fun," totally switches up his accent. He's like, "Hope you all have fun, whatever you're doing. We're going to have an even better time out here going east. (laughs derisively) (razzes)" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I like him. 
SAM: Yeah, he's something. 
ASHLEY: You probably will have a better time than we're having. We're going to have. 
LAURA: We could always use extra bait. 
SAM: Oh, yeah, no. They are steeds and they're built for this. They need to keep running. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: (Dr. Dranzel) "We are stallions, wild and free here in the-- I can't even finish the phrase." (laughter) 
MATT: "Just keep yourself alive. Good to see you all. We'll pick you something up if we can find something fun." 
SAM: Please do. Thank you so much. Appreciate you guys. 
MATT: "All right." 
ASHLEY: Good to see you, Dranzel. 
MATT: "You as well, Vox Machina." Puts his hat back on. 
TRAVIS: Watch out for bears. 
MATT: "There are bears around here? There are actual bears?" Lionel's like, "(sniffs) Could be, I don't know." Kent Plucker's like, "I-- I have a thing with bears." 
TRAVIS and SAM: (laugh) Dranzel's like, "We'll be fine." Keg goes, "I'll handle them." 
SAM: Thank you. 
MATT: "They're a bunch of dick wits." 
SAM: You're in charge, Keg. 
TRAVIS: Dick wits. (laughs) 
MATT: "All right. All right, boys. Keg's in charge. This is my band now. Fall in line." They're like, "Yes, miss." 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) They all come in behind her. They all start taking off into a mild trot and begin continuing their path into darkness. 
SAM: (clacks coconuts) 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: Oh my god! (laughs) 
SAM: (continues clopping) 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY and SAM: (clack coconuts) 
MATT: This was a mistake. 
MARISHA: Wow. Oh wow. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: A cold wind blows past here in the cold night air. But there stands a Scanlan. 
SAM: Okay. They're gone. It's just us. We can go. Do we know where we're going, what we're doing? 
ASHLEY: Are you staying like this the whole time? 
TALIESIN: That was my question, actually, yes. Is this a thing now? 
ASHLEY: Is this the new you? 
SAM: I mean, it's a pretty powerful spell and I don't want to just waste it. 
LAURA: I mean, you look fabulous. 
SAM: Thank you, I've gotten used to it over the past several weeks. I'm quicker. I'm a little higher up. I get a better perspective on things. People seem to respect me a bit more. Hey, Grog, what's up? 
TRAVIS: I have question. So when you need to go boom boom, you just rock nasty? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: It does save time because sometimes I don't even stop walking. I just kind of do it. 
TRAVIS: No way! 
SAM: Yeah, I do have to stop to pee for some reason. 
TRAVIS: That's strange. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It doesn't make a lot of sense. 
SAM: No. 
ASHLEY: Do you have to lift the tail up a little bit? 
TRAVIS: Stop the train for the wee wee. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. But you're not an actual horse. I mean, you still go to a restroom. 
MARISHA: How is he going to fit into a restroom? 
TRAVIS: He's a real horse. 
TALIESIN: Do you back up into it? 
LAURA: Back his butt into it. 
TRAVIS: He's as much of a horse as anyone else. 
LAURA: Is he going to drop shit around our castle. 
MARISHA: He might as well go into a horse stable. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you just free will shit now or do you have to like-- 
SAM: We're in the land of beasts and it wasn't looked down upon. I haven't really been in high society like this in a while. 
ROBBIE: If these questions are making you uncomfortable, I can stop them. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Is it still cerulean? Does it have that blue tint still when it comes out or is it changed? 
SAM: My poo? 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
SAM: No, that was a magical spell. 
TALIESIN: Oh right. 
SAM: My horse poo just comes out like horse poo. 
ASHLEY: Cerkonos? 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: How would you stop us? How would you stop us? Please tell me. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
MARISHA: Okay. This is getting heated over horseshit. Literal horseshit. 
SAM: If it bothers you, I can use a bathroom. 
LAURA: I'd rather you use a restroom, yes. 
SAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: I'd love to see that. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: The front end's going to be sticking out. I'll run interference. I'll be your legs. (laughs) 
LAURA: How are you on stealth, if necessary? 
SAM: Well, I was never really great at stealth before, but-- 
LAURA: But better than as a horse, I imagine. 
SAM: You know what? I haven't tried stealthing. 
LAURA: Try it right now. See how well you do. 
SAM: All right. Turn around, turn around and I'll try to sneak up on you. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh dear. 
SAM: I trot off a little bit and then I'm going to try to double back. 
MATT: Could you quietly make a stealth check for me? 
SAM: With disadvantage? 
TRAVIS: We're on grass, right? We're on grass. 
LAURA: We're on sand, I thought. Are we on sand or grass or where are we? 
TALIESIN: Are you wearing shoes or are you barefoot? 
LAURA: He's in horseshoes, right? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
MATT: You can use your stealth skill. 
TRAVIS: He's in the raw. 
MATT: Whatever you have. But what's your dexterity normally? 
SAM: My dexterity is zero. 
MATT: Correct, so it's the same as a riding horse. So roll your stealth. 
SAM: Okay. Okay, that's an eight. 
LAURA: Yes-- 
MATT: Ashley? 
ASHLEY: Oh. (clopping) 
SAM: Here, you do it. 
LAURA: No, I like it both because there's two sets. (laughs) 
MATT: He's only bad at stealthing. He's drunk. 
TALIESIN: I suppose we could put all four of his feet in a potato sack of some kind. 
TRAVIS: Maybe we need to pad him a little bit. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: You can hear me? You can hear me? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Absolutely. 
TALIESIN: I could literally hear nothing else. 
TRAVIS: -- a rock or a stick. 
ASHLEY: We're on grass and we can hear you. It's crazy. 
TRAVIS: Crunch, crunch. 
SAM: Maybe I should-- 
MARISHA: You're a loud breather now, too. It's so weird. Everything about you is more loud. 
SAM: Maybe you could fashion me some sort of sandals? Or-- 
LAURA: Oh, Grog makes shoes! 
SAM: Wraps? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: He can make some fine leather boots for your horse feet. 
TRAVIS: 100%. I could make some hoof boots. 
SAM: That would be great! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh, my god. One of a kind. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: There's no bad ideas, by the way. Feel free. You seem invested. 
ROBBIE: I'm just enjoying the show. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Wait, wait. I feel like we're getting distracted. We're supposed to be doing something. 
MARISHA: Yes, it's the-- 
ASHLEY: It's the end of the world. 
MARISHA: The end of the world. Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Yes, so-- 
ASHLEY: But by all means, let's get Scanlan some shoes. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (heavy sigh) 
SAM: Pike, I'm sorry. 
LAURA: Should we head back to Vasselheim, then, since we have everyone? 
MARISHA: I don't think we go back to Vasselheim. I think we go there. 
TRAVIS: Go where? 
MARISHA: To the Hellcatch Valley. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: That's a good name. 
SAM: Do we know that-- Well, are we meeting people there? 
LAURA: Is Allura meeting us there? 
TALIESIN: I believe so. If I recall. 
MATT: What you do recall is they are the armies-- There are people there, but majority of the assault armies are currently setting up in Vasselheim to be transported at the moment of the assault. 
LAURA: So back to Vasselheim? 
MARISHA: Do we-- So we need to go back? 
MATT: Likely. 
LAURA: Do we need to go back? Do we need to go back? 
TRAVIS: If I had to guess, we probably need to go back to Vasselheim. (laughter) That's just an uneducated guess. 
MARISHA: I feel like we know that. 
ROBBIE: I was going to say, didn't we orchestrate this? 
MARISHA: Yeah, this is her fucking plan. We should go back to Vasselheim. (laughter) 
MARISHA: They're waiting on us. 
LAURA: Thanks, Keyleth. 
TRAVIS: Tempest. 
MARISHA: Thank you, shi-- Mm. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Fucking A. 
LAURA: Such a leader. 
SAM: She's still got it. 
LAURA: You've really grown. 
MARISHA: Okay, all right, let's go through a damn tree, like always. Like good old times! I walk through a tree. 
MATT: (laughs) The rest of you follow or-- 
LAURA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Oh, wait! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Did we just leave you behind? 
TALIESIN: No, I figured we'd all be like, yeah. Oh shit. This is a six-second one, isn't it? 
MARISHA: It is, yeah. 
MATT: Which tree are you emerging from? 
MARISHA: In Vasselheim? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: Is it weird if we go through the big Birthheart tree? 
MATT: That's where you came here from. So it would be just returning to where you came from, yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Foomph, foomph. 
MATT: You all emerge once more from the Birthheart, whereas the-- 
LAURA: Foof. I can't do it. 
ASHLEY: Foomph foomph. 
LAURA: Foop foof. 
MATT: It's still kind of middle of the night, maybe the wee hours of the morning here in Vasselheim. Maybe a number of hours from daybreak. The city is still kind of quiet, but there is still arriving figures from outside the city. You can hear the occasional calls off and you can see the wall side braziers that mark the shifting guard along the exterior, perimeter wall still keeping watch. The shadows of the sky floating and chain docked skyships, all clustered around the sky dock, as well as the number of them that sit on the outside of the walls, anchored to some of the tallest trees or other various watchtowers that sit on the perimeter of the city and beyond. But the city is yours. Is there anything you wish to do to prepare for the evening before resting for the morning? 
TRAVIS: Actually, yeah. I'll reach into the bag of holding and I'll bring out a leg. It's covered in medium leather armor. 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: I strip the leather armor off the leg. I guess I put the leg back in the bag and I start working on making some horse booties. 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: You've never seen anyone work as diligently on these little booties as Grog. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm envisioning dog Crocs. You know, the dog-- 
TRAVIS: That's even better. (laughter) 
LAURA: That's so cute. 
TRAVIS: The little hoof silencers. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. Now there are the rooms that you all had kept as traveling political visitors and guests here in Vasselheim, not too far from the Sanctuary itself. Of course, Cerkonos, you have your tent estate with the Fire Ashari of Pyrah. But you all can head to your chambers for the night. 
MARISHA: I'll actually go by Vex and Percy's chambers. 
MATT: Okay. Certainly, they're within the same structure as you as other guest chambers. (knocks) 
MARISHA: Are you naked? 
LAURA: Not yet. 
MARISHA: Can I come in? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. I'm tying my robe shut. 
MARISHA: Hi. (sighs) 
TALIESIN: Hello. What lovely timing. 
MARISHA: Hi. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Hi. 
MARISHA: I don't know how to-- Whatever. Are you sure that you all want to do this? 
TALIESIN: Come in, sit down. Oh dear. 
MARISHA: I just-- I don't know, seeing-- You all and seeing you with your kids and-- Out of all of us-- You all have the most to lose. They, your children, have a lot to lose and-- You know, I don't have any children. I don't have a spouse. Pike and Scanlan, they're just as much of wild, crazy hot messes of this, they've always been-- As long as Grog is with us, I think he's fine. But-- 
LAURA: We've been talking about it. They're older now, Keyleth, you know? If this was 10 years ago, I don't think I'd feel the same way, but-- Vesper's almost 30, you know? 
MARISHA: That's crazy to think about. 
TALIESIN: Horrifying, yes. 
MARISHA: Yeah. But I mean, even young Gwendolyn. I just saw the look in Vax Junior's face when you all left. I just want to make sure that I'm not being selfish, that we're not-- 
LAURA: It's not. 
TALIESIN: Dear, I know it may look like we have more to lose, but that's just not true, and that's not the point. If something happens to us, our children, they'll be taken care of, I would assume, hopefully, partially by you. You are family, and I expect you to take care of them long after I'm gone and after she's gone. With a little hope and luck, I would like you to help guide our family for generations. You are just as much of an investment in our future as they are. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Just because we have this one focus doesn't mean we have anything less or more to lose than you. It's everything. 
LAURA: Put my arm around her. 
MARISHA: Snuggle in her voluptuous bosom. 
TALIESIN: They are nice, aren't they? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (sighs) I guess you're right. 
LAURA: Your antlers though, darling. They just make it really hard to snuggle. 
MARISHA: Sorry. I just haven't had a lot of-- I'm a little touch starved. 
LAURA: I'm just going to-- When was the last time you-- 
TALIESIN: I've got that, dear. Thank you. Yep. 
LAURA: I take the antlers off. 
TALIESIN: Put that over-- 
LAURA: You really should allow that to happen more often. 
MARISHA: Well, heavy is the head, I guess. 
LAURA: You're family. You are our sister. 
TALIESIN: We have responsibilities as well. We understand. They're smaller, but we do understand. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: This is few and far between, but-- I'm going to bamf Trinket out. 
MARISHA: Oh! (laughs) 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LAURA: Old man Trinket. 
MATT: (Trinket softly growls) 
LAURA: I know, dear. 
MATT: (ursine moaning) 
LAURA: Darling, I want you to spend the night over with Keyleth tonight, all right? She needs a good snuggle buddy. 
MARISHA: Hey, buddy. 
MATT: (nuzzles) 
MARISHA: Oh! Oh, your breath is-- 
LAURA: Just even worse than before. 
MARISHA: Just even worse. Yeah. 
MATT: There's a few missing teeth on the side. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Aw! 
MARISHA: Is he all gray and stuff? 
LAURA: Yeah, I keep him in the locket as long as possible because it's helping extend his life. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MARISHA: What? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Hyperbaric chamber, yeah. 
TALIESIN: She's phenomenal at letting go. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Goodness, buddy. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to end up in there. Don't think I don't know that. 
LAURA: Don't think I haven't thought about it. 
TALIESIN: I'm well aware you've thought about it. 
MARISHA: That is a "Black Mirror" episode. Anyway. (laughter) 
MATT: Black Mirror Exandria. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Okay. I just wanted to-- I just wanted to check in. 
TALIESIN: We trust you. 
LAURA: And we're going to make it through. And we're going to get my brother safe, sort of. 
MARISHA: I'm still trying not to think about that too much. I feel like I've got to stay focused. Whatever happens, happens. He's still bound by the Matron, you know? 
TALIESIN: That is true. Although, strange times. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Anything could happen. 
LAURA: Well, maybe she'll be so grateful. 
TALIESIN: Maybe she won't make it through. 
LAURA: Predathos comes out, he eats one god. What's the harm there? 
MARISHA: (laughs) Strange times. All right. We should get some rest. 
LAURA: Love you, darling. 
MARISHA: Love you. Good to see you. 
LAURA: Try to get some sleep. 
MATT: (Trinket huffs) 
MARISHA: Come on, buddy. 
MATT: Trinket lumbers up beside you and leans into your scratch. (satisfied grunts) 
MARISHA: All the scritches on the-- 
MATT: (slobbery shakes) 
TALIESIN: That's right. 
MARISHA: Just cuddle up, tuck into him for the night. 
TALIESIN: Lock the door. 
LAURA: Lock the door. No kids! This is wonderful! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: No kids. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Pull your dick out! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: They're all gone. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We've won. (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Show it to me. (laughter) 
MATT: Make sure he needs to use that cane. (laughter) All right. Anyone else have any events for the evening they wish to-- 
SAM: I'm going to go stop on Pike's door and see if she'll come to the door. Hello? (coconuts clacking) 
TRAVIS: (snores) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Hello? 
SAM: It's me, Scanlan, your ex. 
LAURA: Are you in the room with Pike? 
ASHLEY: Hello. 
SAM: Should we keep it down so we don't wake him up? 
ASHLEY: I'm pretty sure he'll sleep through anything, but yes, absolutely, we should keep it down. 
SAM: I just wanted to find you and say that, you know, 
SAM: I just wanted to find you and say that, you know, sorry I haven't reached out or talked to you recently. I just was, you know, giving you your space, and-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's fine. We're not together. You don't have to answer to me in any type of way, and I don't have to answer to you. 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah, we're free, right? 
ASHLEY: We're free. You're free. 
SAM: Free to-- 
ASHLEY: I'm sure you're dating and I'm sure you're, you know, a man about town and-- 
SAM: Well, I-- There's no dating. Why? Have you been dating? 
ASHLEY: I mean-- I mean, I haven't closed up shop yet. 
SAM: Are you seeing someone? 
ASHLEY: Not really. I'm not really, no. No. I don't know. Sometimes, yes. 
SAM: Well, do I know them? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) I don't know. I don't think so. 
MARISHA: Is it Whitestone Andy? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Notches in the belt. 
LAURA: He'd be just the right age. 
ASHLEY: No, I don't think so. 
SAM: What's he like? 
ASHLEY: It's not anything serious. It's not anything serious. There's no marriage bells or anything like that. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: It's just a companion in alone times. 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: But the kids are doing great. 
SAM: Oh yeah, you-- 
ASHLEY: Haven't talked to them in a minute. 
SAM: -- heard from them? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. How's Junie? 
ASHLEY: Junie's great. She's doing great at seminary. Wax is killing it at school. 
SAM: He was always-- 
ASHLEY: Top of his class, taking after his Uncle Percy. 
SAM: Does he have a girlfriend yet, or boyfriend or anything? 
ASHLEY: No, he doesn't. 
SAM: I mean, he just needs more game, more confidence. He's great with book stuff, but he's not-- 
ASHLEY: I know. 
SAM: He needs some swagger. 
ASHLEY: He doesn't quite take after his dad. I don't know why that didn't end up working out. 
SAM: You know what, I should have taken him on the road trip, shown him the world. 
ASHLEY: You should take him on a road trip. 
SAM: Maybe we could just go, just me and him. Sow his wild oats. 
ASHLEY: You should do that! That'd be great for him. 
SAM: Should I make him a centaur? 
ASHLEY: If he wants it. Make him a centaur. I don't give a shit. How's Kaylie? 
SAM: Oh, Kaylie's good. She's running the business still. 
ASHLEY: Meat Man and the Sexports? 
SAM: Imports and Sexports. 
ASHLEY: Imports and Sexports. Very sorry. How's the business going? 
SAM: Yeah. I think fine. I get a check every month. 
ASHLEY: Cool. Where are you sleeping this evening? 
SAM: I hadn't actually thought about that. 
MARISHA: The stables. 
TALIESIN: The stables. 
SAM: Where are we right now? We're in Whitestone, right? 
ASHLEY, TRAVIS, and MATT: Vasselheim. 
SAM: No, Vasselheim. Who decides where I sleep? 
MATT: No one gave you a place to stay. You were brought here by them, and if they didn't assign you a chamber, then you literally have nowhere to sleep. 
ASHLEY: Do you want to sleep in here? There's an extra bed. 
SAM: Oh yeah? 
ASHLEY: Not in my bed. There is an extra bed. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Is it big? I'm big. 
TRAVIS: (snores) 
ASHLEY: I mean, Grog fits in one. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Currently, Grog is-- 
ASHLEY: You're certainly not bigger than Grog. 
MATT: -- barely fitting in that bed. 
ASHLEY and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Limbs are draped over all sides, dragging on the ground. 
SAM: Are you sure that's okay, for me to sleep so close to you? 
ASHLEY: Grog is in the middle of us. It's fine. There happened to be three. I see three twin beds. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: You can sit by the one by the door. 
SAM: Well, okay. 
ASHLEY: Sleep by the one by the door. 
SAM: All right. Well, thanks. I will. 
ASHLEY: How are you otherwise? 
SAM: I'm good. You know, I think about you from time to time. I don't know. I miss you. I miss you. 
TRAVIS: (whimpers) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (snores) 
SAM: Is he awake? 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm pretty sure he's awake. Grog? 
TRAVIS: Yeah? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Are you awake? 
TRAVIS: No. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Scanlan brought a full keg of beer. 
TRAVIS: Huh?! Wha? (sniffs) Oh. I fell for it again. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You probably want some privacy. 
ASHLEY: No, no, it's okay. It's okay. 
TRAVIS: Okay. (resumes snoring) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Well, are you ready for this? 
SAM: I don't really know what we're doing, but-- 
ASHLEY: I don't either. 
SAM: It's great to be with the gang again. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it is good. 
SAM: I hope we're okay at this. We're older, you know? I'm a little rusty. 
ASHLEY: I'm so tired. 
SAM: Are you? 
ASHLEY: I'm tired. It hurts everywhere. I fucking break my-- 
SAM: Have you been taking your vitamins? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I take all the vitamins. I take all the supplements. It hurts. My joints make noise. I bend over, my back goes out. 
SAM: Well-- 
ASHLEY: I'm a little rounder around the middle. 
ASHLEY: I mean, you look great, but would it help if I gave you one of my foot rubs? 
ASHLEY: No, it's fine. 
SAM: Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry. 
ASHLEY: Just go to bed. 
SAM: All right. 
ASHLEY: Go to your bed. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to be over here. 
SAM: (coconut clacking) 
ASHLEY: That is so annoying. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
SAM: The bed's kind of small, so I'm going to put my two front legs on the bed. 
TRAVIS: But it bends in this way. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
SAM: Kind of get my head down close to the pillow. Back legs are-- 
MATT: Perfect. 
SAM: -- on the floor. (laughter) 
SAM: Well, good night. 
ASHLEY: Good night. Night, Grog. 
SAM: Good night, Grog. 
TRAVIS: Night. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to say a quick prayer, hold my symbol. 
SAM: (whinnies) 
ASHLEY: Everlight, please be with us. I don't know what's coming for us, but please help us. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'll try to go to sleep. 
MATT: All right. Anybody else have anything they want to do for the night? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, I feel like before he went to see Pike, on the way over when we were walking and talking, Cerkonos was intent on filling Scanlan in about everything that was going on. 
SAM: Oh, is that so? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) The whole time, maybe a little too much. 
SAM: Uh-huh? 
MARISHA: (laughs) Such a fan boy. 
ROBBIE: When he broke away to go away, excused yourself on the way to see Pike, I would like to say that in the shadows, I secretly followed you a little bit. 
SAM: Oh god. 
ROBBIE: Through the camp into the thing. I saw you knock on the door, open the curtain, and then Pike opened and let you in, and I saw you go in as Pike let you in and I just went: (chuckles) Yes! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: The Scanman! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Then I went back to my tent, super happy. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Incredible. (laughter dying down to sighs) 
ASHLEY: He's all about it? 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: I like to imagine in Pyrah, he's got a collection room that has all his vinyls and shit on the walls. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: He's still got it! 
MATT: Tickets he eBayed from his shows in different continents he couldn't make it to. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Just like how I thought he'd be. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. As you all rest through the night, rest finds you best it can, given the events to come, and the energy of the city coming to an early morning brings a certain din, a certain vibrancy to the movement of soldiers and people alike that seems to wake you all probably earlier than you would've wanted. But you do get your night's rest, though probably a bit groggy as the day progresses. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (sparse chuckling) 
MATT: Preparing yourselves by gathering your things as the morning crests onward-- 
TRAVIS: (squeaks) 
LAURA: What'd you do? 
TRAVIS: I'm Grog, but those were the dice. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
SAM: He could have died. 
TRAVIS: That would've been it. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: No! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
ROBBIE: No! 
TRAVIS: I'm Grog, though. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: This just happened! 
TALIESIN: Somewhere, Chetney had a scare. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Seriously?! 
TRAVIS: Trip zeroes! 
TALIESIN: Chetney stops breathing. 
ROBBIE: No way! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: Dude. 
TALIESIN: Just for a minute. (chokes to consciousness) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Somewhere else, Chetney's like: (yelps) 
MARISHA: On the moon. 
TRAVIS: (halted breath) (relieved sigh) (laughter) 
MATT: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
ROBBIE: That's wild. 
TALIESIN: That would've been amazing. 
MARISHA: I knew it, I knew you were going to roll trip zeroes at some point, just didn't know it was Grog. 
TRAVIS: But not as him. 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
MATT: Oh my god, Travis. 
MARISHA: Holy heck. 
TALIESIN: Dancing on that grave. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: As you all begin to emerge and find each other for the morning, the streets are alive with chatter, shouts, and preparation. You can hear the sound of metal on metal clinging as armor is being pulled from various storage houses and armories, soldiers getting in line and being outfitted, gambesons upon breastplates and armor. You can see various troops sent from all across Exandria, their banners high in the air, their generals walking the line as their men are waking up and prepping themselves for the day. There are talks and prayers being passed around left and right. You can see the clouds begin to part, giving that cold blue sky here. While the snow has not fallen and the sun is out, the temperature is still chilly enough where everyone can see their breath, like a perpetual fume of smoke from the veritable chimneys of every person around you. You can hear the numerous birds in the distance shifting, moving from one cluster of trees to the next. All manner of holy warriors have begun to step through the perimeter of the multiple encampments with censers swinging on chains, the incense and smoke cleansing the air as they mutter their prayers to their various deities as they go, the smells mutually pungent at times and nice as they pass and disseminate through the surrounding air. You see the townsfolk of Vasselheim throughout different regions emerging to watch this extremely rare event for this generation. Families bringing their children out to see off these soldiers to war. The griffon riders themselves are finishing running their various practice rounds over the city and gathering at the various roosts on the edge and far walls. You glance over, Vex'ahlia, from your vantage point, and can see the banners of Syngorn and their forces gathered on the western side of the city, at your behest. You can also see the banners of all the familiar gathered countrysides that have been part of these various political gatherings and discussions and plottings. Kryn soldiers and dunamancers from the Dynasty sit not too far from the base of the Heaven's Stair Mountain, their gray and lavender banners and beautiful, almost crystalline flanked tents emblazoned with their unique sense of battle attire as these various soldiers; dark elf, orc, human, the motley crew of culture that is the Dynasty stepping forth and donning their armor, some signified of Kryn warriors, and a number of the trained elite wearing the chitinous form of their impressive, terrifying, almost bio-armored selves, their tattered cloaks dangling behind as they themselves are anointed in the light of the Luxon. The Bright Queen herself and her guardian compatriots walking along and briefly making eye contact with your troop as she nods and continues on, talking to her generals for what's to transpire. The skyships have begun to unmoor from the sky dock and the exterior and have gotten low to the ground, numerous elite troops being loaded onto and prepping for their destinations far from here in the time to come. 
LAURA: We should say something to the Whitestone troops before they head out. I'm sure it would boost their morale. There would be a small contingency of Whitestone troops, yes? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. You have two Pale Guard. I guess whatever you could spare without leaving Whitestone completely exposed. 
TRAVIS: Regiments? 
TALIESIN: It would probably be-- I mean, the Pale Guard tend to work better, I won't say on their own, but not as a solid group. But giving them two various regiments is just having one available. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Since they are specialty fighters. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So there'd probably been about five to six of them, I suppose. 
MATT: Okay. Any rifle corps, or are they staying with Whitestone? 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: I think rifle corps should-- Ah, I feel some rifle corps should come here. 
TALIESIN: Mm... S-s-sure. (laughter) 
LAURA: It's the end of the world, darling. 
TRAVIS: It was perfect. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that's 30 years of marriage. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LAURA: I want to defend Whitestone, too, but I think we should defend the world. 
TALIESIN: Every time we leave, something terrible-- Yes, of course, dear. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: The world I suppose-- 
LAURA: We've grown the troops in this-- 
TALIESIN: The world is important, too. 
LAURA: -- time. 
TALIESIN: I understand. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Uh, you are correct. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: So yes, there would be probably a nice, a single battalion, I suppose. 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to remember sizes of-- there would be a contingency, a contingent of... 
MATT: Okay. As you are doing the rounds to the scattered Whitestone representative troops that you've assigned to a number of gathered armed forces, a messenger comes through to quickly come to you, specifically, Keyleth, and say, "There's to be a gathering of leadership at the base of the Heaven's Stair shortly before the the army is to move out. Your presence is requested." 
MARISHA: Of course. I'll be right there. 
MATT: Then darts off into the rest of the morning chaos. 
ASHLEY: Can we help you with anything? 
MARISHA: If you want to come along. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
MARISHA: You're more than welcome. You're all leaders in your own right. 
SAM: Cerkonos, are you going with Keyleth or-- 
ROBBIE: I should, yes. 
SAM: Did you sleep well last night? 
ROBBIE: I always sleep well. 
SAM: Hmm. No nerves? 
ROBBIE: A peaceful mind. I'm ready. 
ASHLEY: What must that be like? 
ROBBIE: It's pleasant. 
LAURA: (laughs) Peaceful. 
ASHLEY: Peaceful. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
SAM: I did not sleep well last night. Uh, it's just very-- 
ROBBIE: Why not? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Buddy, come on. 
ROBBIE: Oh. (gasps) (laughs) Yes. 
SAM: (wheezes) 
ROBBIE: (laughs) Yes. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Holy shit. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Did you take a little trip outside of the room when Grog and I fell asleep? 
SAM: Uh, no. No, dear-- 
ASHLEY: Hmm? 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Dear? 
SAM: Oh, I'm-- It's just instinct, sorry. Just, uh-- 
TALIESIN: Whew. 
ROBBIE: A confused look sweeps over Cerkonos' face, but he keeps it to himself-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: -- for the moment. 
LAURA: ♪ Every time they get together ♪ 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Let's go. 
MATT: (whooshes) A shadow swoops overhead and (whooshes) carries off towards the base of the Heaven's Stair. As you see a wide winged, somewhat dark gold, brass-colored, scaled wyrm of massive size-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: Scoots (wings flapping) and then perches just in the outskirts of the staircase that rises towards the Sanctuary itself. 
MARISHA: Do they still make you nervous? 
LAURA: Oh, no. Just headache. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
LAURA: I'm fine. 
MATT: You watch as the contingent of representative Ank'Harel soldiers here. Small, given that you know that the majority of them are currently stationed in the outset of the Hellcatch. But there are some that have been here to show faith and a sense of alliance here amongst the people of Vasselheim. You also note that there are banners that you are familiar with, but not had much to deal with. You see a banner that has a cold blue coloration to it, and it looks to be peaks that spear into white where atop, a single-- looks like a throne back greets the clouds, you know to be the symbol of the Stratos Throne, the southernmost-- 
LAURA: Mm. Mm-hmm. 
MATT: -- political dynasties of Marquet. Across the way, a twin army that wears the banners of Aeshanadoor. Two factions that were in murderous war with each other not too long ago, now stationed side by side as allies for the first time. 
TRAVIS: Mm. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
MATT: In some time, keeping to themselves mostly, but still in odd presence, acknowledging the history and what truly seems to be at stake in these modern times. As people begin to gather and some of the forces begin to shift, it looks like there's a particular order or a placement to where the forces are being stationed on the far western wall. In previous conversations with Allura, you recall that there is going to be a period where a number of gateways are to be opened and those gateways are going to lead essentially near the front lines of the fortress. 
LAURA: Awesome. 
MATT: A direct and immediate delivery upon the site. There will be one in the sky for the skyships, and then numerous below for the actual ground forces to advance. 
ASHLEY: That's cool. 
MATT: The ground forces to go first, and then in that chaos, the skyships to use that to their advantage. 
ASHLEY: (exhales sharply) 
MATT: As you all begin to head towards the base of the Heaven's Stair, you can see the numerous signal braziers all across Vasselheim that are usually utilized with vibrant white and orange burning flame to signify threat, imminent attack are all burning a gentle bluish green color signifying a unification within the city. Importance, but not necessarily immediate danger. A ceremonial acknowledgement of some sort of gathering or moment to happen. As the various leadership begins to meet here at the base of the Heaven's Stair, you can see Pa'tice and a number of the Earth Ashari of Terrah have been conscripted briefly to raise a platform from stone. (crashing) You watch as a dais lifts up about 25 or so feet from this open market way with steps that emerge and allow anyone to ascend, really. At this, all the various leadership: the Clovis Concord, the Dwendalian Empire, the generals and leaders that represent the length and breadth of Exandria. Lyrengorn, the Council of Tal'Dorei all begin to gather around the base of this platform. The massive brass dragon that sits perched on top settles down and strikes a regal pose. Its darkened eyes and burning coal-like pupils looking down upon the surrounding gathered forces. 
LAURA: Nod at them. 
MATT: The dragon nods as everyone begins to settle, whispering to each other, waiting for some sort of moment. Three darkly dressed, veiled women familiar beings approach from out of the crowd as the veiled coven of leaders of the Matron of Ravens Temple here in this city approach. Helmed by a very familiar face. Though one who had ventured with you long ago, the relations had been necessarily distant for some time. Lieve'tel, if you would like to come to the table, please. 
TRAVIS: Lieve'tel! 
LAURA: Oh! (laughter) 
ALL: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Aw, yeah. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah! 
TRAVIS: There she is. 
ASHLEY: There she is. 
MATT: Like to describe how-- 
LAURA: Hello. 
MATT: -- Lieve'tel is adorned this morning. The morn before war. 
LIAM: Did you describe her as veiled currently? 
MATT: I'd say the three of them approach veiled just the standard veil. But the rest of the attire is up to you. 
LAURA: This is happening post-Bells Hells with her? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: So as the three of the Coven of the Veil step forward the figure at center steps forward and out from the other two. One hand comes up and unpins a veil which trails away and down. And it's been years since you've seen her face, but it has not changed a bit. It is still-- Her hair is artfully pinned up and back from her very pale face. The hair is jet black, beautifully clothed and she, for the first time, is wearing a shining black breastplate. You notice black metallic bracers on both of her forearms. There's a string of black beads trailing down from one hand as it rises out to you. Vox Machina, you are well met. 
LAURA: Lieve'tel, good to see you again. 
LIAM: Flamespeaker, winds watch you. It is a pleasure to see you as well. 
ROBBIE: He's like transported by her. 
LIAM: She is elegant and languid at all times. 
ROBBIE: Okay. (clears throat) (coughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Are you prepared for your journey? 
TALIESIN: Prepared as we can be. 
LIAM: Well, looked for or no, Raven's Crest means to have its hand in this day of consequence. 
LAURA: Wonderful. 
MARISHA: You'll be joining us. 
LAURA: Us? Again? 
MARISHA: Is that what you're saying? 
LIAM: If you will have me, yes. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. She joined when you guys were trying to-- 
LAURA: Find you. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yes-- 
TRAVIS: She was all unconscious when I woke up. 
LAURA: Which reminds me-- Oh, I do need to speak with you in private when we have a moment. You probably already know. This is not so private. Maybe this is the worst time. Bertrand. 
LIAM: Mr. Bell. 
LAURA: Mr. Bell. 
TALIESIN: Oh dear. 
LAURA: Yes, he-- he's passed on. 
LIAM: I have seen this, dear. 
LAURA: I figured as much. All right, my bad. 
LIAM: In my dream. 
LAURA: He's at Whitestone, if you ever want to pay a visit. 
LIAM: We should all be so lucky. 
TALIESIN: Indeed. 
LIAM: To take that time. He will be missed. 
TALIESIN: Very much so. 
LIAM: Beautiful man he was. 
SAM: Well, we're not going to die. We're going to live. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Big time. 
SAM: Yeah, we don't need to-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, of course. 
SAM: To go over there. 
ASHLEY: She's giving me the-- 
LIAM: If you will let me, I will see to it. 
ASHLEY: -- creeps, a little. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Raven's Crest will not sit above the weave of history. Like all faith, it is woven into the very fabric of it. And our lady will no longer abide the abuse of her champion at the hands of this power hungry little man's game. 
LAURA: You hope to get him back. 
LIAM: We will get him back. 
LAURA: Join us. Welcome to the group. 
ASHLEY: Have you heard at all from him? I don't know how it works. 
LIAM: Different for all of us, sister. 
TRAVIS: That's a no. 
ASHLEY: I don't know what that means. 
TRAVIS: That means she didn't talk to him. Oh. 
ASHLEY: All right. (sighs) 
ROBBIE: Winds watch you. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh, is this not-- 
LAURA: Just have you-- Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, this is Cerkonos-- 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: -- the Flamespeaker. 
LIAM: Her hands, which are very cold-- 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: -- wrap around yours. 
LAURA: I thought he was celibate or something. Is he not? 
ASHLEY: (garbled speech) Yeah? 
SAM: He might just be nervous-- 
TALIESIN: Maybe-- 
SAM: Because she's really creepy. 
TALIESIN: Maybe he just has no game. 
LAURA: I don't get creepy vibes. 
TALIESIN: I'm not sure. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Does Cerkonos have no game? 
SAM: I'm going to find out after we're done here. 
MARISHA: Um. (clears throat) 
LIAM: Tempest. 
MARISHA: Hello, Lieve. I, while still a bit uncomfortable with your presence, am grateful for you joining us. I am not sure any of the rest of Vox Machina is equipped to potentially release the champion of the Raven Queen. 
LAURA: Yeah, I thought we were just going to grab it and try to, you know-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, honestly-- 
LAURA: Yeah, that would've been terrible. 
SAM: Crack it on a rock? 
MARISHA: We would just try to-- 
LAURA: It would have been a horrible. 
MARISHA: -- figure it out. 
ASHLEY: Break it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. What if we break it? 
TALIESIN: Just blow it up. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, when in doubt. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, when in doubt. 
LAURA: But you probably know. So, has the Matron talked to you? You have like a ritual, you know, something to release him? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: The Matron-- 
LAURA: Yes. 
LIAM: -- is in my mind. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: We will unbreak his bonds. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
LIAM: And set the Raven free. 
MARISHA: Okay, so maybe you can be on Raven freeing duty. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Maybe that's-- We can talk more later. 
ASHLEY: But do you have a plan for that? How does that even-- How would that even work? 
LIAM: I would rely on all of you. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: To bring us close. And once on the ground, our lady will make her hand known. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. I mean, we'll have a lot of other things to do. 
SAM: But that's a top priority. 
LAURA: That's a top priority. 
SAM: Yeah, we're going to get him back. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I just, you know, once again, I'm trying to be mindful of everything else we have going on. 
LIAM: Allow me to take one problem off of your plate, Tempest. 
MARISHA: (sighs) Thank you. 
TRAVIS: I'll handle-- 
LAURA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: -- the getting close part for you. 
LAURA: There's the whole thing happening. I look up at J'mon. That is J'mon, right? 
MATT: It is Devo'ssa, specifically, the dragon that is also J'mon Sa Ord. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: You also hear the sound of hundreds and hundreds of marching feet getting louder and louder. As part of this gathering has now grown rather dense, you can see whole regiments of holy warriors beginning to emerge from the different sectors of Vasselheim, adorned and emblazoned and polished holy armor of different metals and colors, wearing holy symbols and jeweled beads, and themselves holding off large banners that wrap in the cold morning air of Vasselheim with the symbols of the various Prime Deities here represented. Amongst them, you see incredibly awe-inspiring and dangerous looking warriors that fight in the great light of their gods. Amongst them, massive, muscular, hooded entities, metal masks, eyeless emblazoned on their face and holy tattoos written across their arms. The Judicators have been called to war as well. 
SAM: Woo. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
TALIESIN: Oh my. 
ASHLEY: Yikes. 
MATT: They begin to encircle-- 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: -- and fan out. 
LAURA: They creep me out. (sighs) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Are the banners blowing in the wind? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Can you make the noise? 
MATT: (banner swooshing) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's the little things. (laughter) 
MATT: That was for you. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
MATT: As everyone begins to gather, ascending the central platform. The heads of the different main temples here begin to step with High Hierophant Ophera coming to the forefront of this temporary-- 
MARISHA: (sighs heavily) 
MATT: -- stone platform. As she steps up, you can see her armored shoulders and her own vine tangled cloak itself seeming to slowly-- almost in slow motion against the wind, begin to flap before parts of it reach out and take root into the stone like it's its own living organism. She places her staff on the ground, which then also takes a root and holds itself there as she lets it stand on its own. She puts her hands up and as she does, the wind begins to pick up but grow warmer. (wind whooshing) As wind begins to gather, smells, sweet smells of fruit and summertime vegetation begin to mingle. The mood of the landscape begins to change from a chilly, northern, snow dappled space to a journey of sense that bring you through the different realms of untouched nature of Exandria. You can't help but be brought to memories of traversing the different landscapes far beyond. And just as quickly as it was there, the wind dies. 
LAURA: I lean over to Keyleth. You really need to work on your entrances. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. You're right. 
LAURA: Yeah. Just something to keep in mind. 
MARISHA: The public speaking thing, I've had to-- I'm better at it, but it's still not great. 
MATT: "Today, we stand all on the threshold of change. This world, this beautiful realm, molded, shepherded, and protected by the great divines stands united, stalwart, unbreakable. The light and grace that guides us under their sight empowers us with their strength, sharpens our minds with their wisdom, and emboldens us with their justice. We live as so very many before us have, embracing the many gifts and joys the gods have granted us, shown us comfort and community against the chaos and threat of oblivion, granted guidance and inspiration where we might find ourselves lost and without hope, lifted us up from our darkest moments, and revealed paths to better selves and blessed us with miracles to defend those we love and ensure a better tomorrow for our children." As she says this, you've been looking at her, but there's the light of the day seems to be growing faintly brighter, more golden, like there's a warm haze to the air, though there is no fog. Folks in the crowd almost blink instinctually. There's an energy buzzing to the landscape around. "Today we have the chance to show them the same kindness. We have the chance to rise and to protect those who have protected us since the dawn of history. We can be the salvation for those who are salvation, and in doing so, ensure the generations to come can walk in the golden light of righteousness, love and faith. Today we go to war, not for ourselves, not for our gods, but for the very future of Exandria. Just as this city has never fallen, our faith will never waver, our shields will never crumble, and our spirits will never wane. You are all chosen as holy warriors this day. Bring that light with you to our destiny. They will be watching." As she says that, doors of golden light open and you watch as winged celestials step through. (impressed oohing) 
TRAVIS: What? What! 
MATT: Armored chests, golden and blue skin. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: Glowing holy blades from celestial realms beyond held forth, an army of angelic forms rising out-- 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: -- to fly and hover above. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) What? 
MATT: "Allies from realms beyond, a beacon of hope and power to bolster your job this day." She smiles and steps back. The other leaders of the temples hold their arms out as if to ask if anybody else wishes to speak. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. All right. I adjust my antlers. Let's see if we can take a less religious approach. Voice of the Tempest steps up. She's getting a little sweaty, a little moist under that cloak. (exhales) Fuck, my heart's racing. Jesus. 
MATT: As you step to the precipice of this platform, the other temple heads relinquish the space and you quickly find yourself solitary across this platform. As you stand, the wind blowing your mantle and cloak of ever color- changing leaves around you, you see the world, the shadow of the titan in the distance, hundreds of mounted griffons and dragon riders swirling in the sky and perching nearby, the angelic forms now summoned, all looking upon you with their celestial gaze and thousands upon thousands upon thousands of warriors from all over this world. All eyes on you. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Why'd you have to say that? 
LAURA: I'm going to hop on the broom and fly up above the crowd so I'm eye-level with Keyleth and meet her eyes. Keyleth. Just look at me. 
MARISHA: Okay. There's a little bit of that fog that goes in Keyleth's ear. She can hear the blood pulsing. She takes a big inhale and exhale and even in trying to calm her own nerves, that exhale creates a warm gust from behind her that floats across all of the armies of Exandria. Exandria. Once again, we stand united against an existential threat. United again, as we have many times before, against beasts and behemoths, demons and demigods. Once again, we will overcome this pervasive play for an unjustified power, for Exandria does not belong to a single entity, or individuals, or even an entire council of deities. Exandria belongs to us. Once again, we will reclaim that ownership for Exandria. (shouts) Fuck shit up! 
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: (shout) Fuck shit up! 
MARISHA: Question, question. Can I use my inspirational leader feat? It's technically for six people. 
LAURA: I personally feel really inspired by that. 
ASHLEY: I feel so inspired right now. 
MATT: Here in the grace of the gods of Exandria, their intention beyond the divine gate pressed down upon the masses of warriors that head out to fight in their honor instead, you, taking this brave moment as leader of people, not just Ashari, but of the people of Exandria. You feel even in your, perhaps, not as a faith in them as beings and entities, their will is still with you. With that, you feel your words ring out as you shout to the sky, words to be written in the history books for years and generations to come. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT and LAURA: Fuck shit up! 
MATT: Whereas the holy arrival of angels left a crowd stunned and in awe, your words brings a rousing war cry and cheer. "(cheer)" The din, the entire city of Vasselheim itself, cheers around you. Birds (wings flitting) flicker off in the distance. 
MARISHA: You hear a thunder clap that emanated from nothing, like heat thunder. 
MATT: (thunder booming) Echoing throughout and beyond. You look around you and see your friends amongst the crowd shouting and cheering. You see Allura looking up and smiling and nodding. You look over at Vex'ahlia on her broom, smiling and cheering. Glancing across to one of the leafless trees, a single raven seems to look in your direction before (wings flitting) taking off. 
LIAM: It's swallowed up in the roar of the crowd. But when that noise finally starts to die down, only Vox Machina and maybe a few other people in proximity of Lieve'tel can hear the tiny little tingle of a silver bell on a string hanging from Lieve's hand, watching the Tempest. 
SAM: Mm! 
LAURA: (whispers) She's so weird. 
MARISHA: She's so weird. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: So as part of your Inspirational Leader feat? 
MARISHA: So the feat is you get my level plus my charisma modifier, which is zero-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: -- temporary hit points. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: So 20 temporary hit points. 
MATT: So all of you and most of the soldiers in immediate proximity. 
MARISHA: That's why I was curious. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MARISHA: Everyone gets 20 extra HP. 
LAURA: That's great. 
MATT: 20 temporary hit points to you all. 
TALIESIN: Great to have 
TRAVIS: My god, I just hit a guy. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You're so amped up! (laughter) 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (boof) 
TALIESIN: Ooh, he's out, he's out. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, bro! Oh man! Sorry. Oh, you're all right. 
SAM: Something just happened to my character. 
LAURA: Oh no. What happened? 
SAM: I just gained 40 hit points somehow. 
TALIESIN: Well done. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Perfect. 
SAM: Whatever, I'll fix it later. 
MATT: "I'll fix it later." 
TALIESIN: That's great. 
MATT: As the troops begin to scatter weapons at the ready, the energy of the battle to come is imminent. With that, you watch as the various war encampments begin to close down, tent flaps shut, soldiers gathering their materials, finishing their sharpening. Everyone begins to march westward toward the staging ground of the assault to come. 
LAURA: I fly back down. We should do some sort of prep. We need a Heroes' Feast. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: It's a big day. 
ASHLEY: Lieve'tel? 
LIAM: Yes, dear. 
ASHLEY: Do you have Heroes' Feast? 
LIAM: I could provide sustenance if you desire it. 
MARISHA: I could as well. (coos) 
LAURA: I can shoot an arrow very well. 
SAM: I've seen you do it. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
SAM: So your aim is-- 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: -- pretty good. 
LAURA: I appreciate that. 
TALIESIN: We also can buy things. 
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes. But I need-- 
SAM: That's your superpower. 
LAURA: -- magical somethings. I don't think there's anything for sale here in Vasselheim anymore. 
TALIESIN: Wealth is always magical. 
LAURA: Is there time just quickly to fly over to the Dawnfather's temple? 
MATT: Sure, yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to go over and pop on in real fast. 
MATT: Very well. 
LAURA: Does he have a shrine? Does he have a sort of-- 
MATT: Oh, there's a shrine for the Dawnfather, most definitely. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: It's a three-tiered temple that has a bell that sits at the front, a large bell that is rung at the zenith of the day. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: It's made from an enchanted metal that is somewhat translucent and gives off its own glow like a beacon at night that always just faintly gives you a point of reference as to where the nearest refuge would be. But yeah, as you scoot over towards it, you can see there are many civilians that are inside praying for those who are leaving this morning. Indeed, you see about three priests that are on hand immediately that are conversing and keeping the folks themselves led in prayer and giving them guidance. 
LAURA: Can I fly over to the bell? 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: And fly over to it and ding, ding, ding on it with my ring. 
MATT: (bell deeply clangs) 
LAURA: I'll put my hand on it and lean in. All right. Big day for you. Let's bring that big dick energy, shall we, and help make things happen. I have your back. I need you to have mine and my brother's. All right. 
MATT: As you finish your prayer, there was some broken clouds that obscured the distant horizon. But right as you finish your prayer, the cloud that had mostly obscured the sun breaks and a bit of that golden warm light catches your cheek on the one open side, that direction of this temple top belfry. Could be an answer, but you feel the warmth. 
LAURA: I fly back. 
MATT: As you all begin to gather, you can see now another massive silver dragon that emerged from the platinum sanctuary itself has also joined the gathering forces at the front. A number of Ashari are raising elementals. You can see as massive earth beings clamber out from the ground as Flamespeaker, you notice a number of your various Pyrah generals themselves are raising smaller fire elementals that are being set up and prepared for their assault to come. Spells are crafting strange summoned entities from different realms beyond Exandria, whereas you can see various automatons and golems that have been enchanted and prepped for the coming fray themselves are being lined up by their enchanters and various owners. Allura catches up to your troop as you're heading that direction. "Good morning, Vox Machina." 
SAM: Hey. 
MATT: "I guess it's that time again. I'm going to introduce you to your ship for delivery. "As is the intent this day, the ground forces are to be delivered first and foremost. There is about a five minute buffer when they begin the assault to draw the forces to the outer edges of the fortress, after which the fleet of skyships are to cruise into a summoned storm that will give you some cover. Once you feel you are within proper central locale from above where the fortress is, you and the other skyship's payloads are to be dropped in to land as close as you can to the key so as to give them very little chance to stop you and with the least amount of resistance to come and prevent you from achieving your task." 
TRAVIS: (guffaw) 
SAM: D-d-dropped in? 
MATT: "Dropped in, yes." 
LAURA: Right over? 
MATT: "Yes." 
LAURA: Isn't that what you did before? 
MARISHA: Well, it wasn't me. It was Bells Hells and they tried to throw a whole-ass airship on top of it. 
LAURA: No, and then you said you dropped in as a meteor, right? You went Keyteor and then got demolished? 
MARISHA: Yes, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: To be fair, Ludinus was there and I don't think he's there this time. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: So. 
LAURA: Can your little horsey legs take that? 
SAM: You mean jumping out of a skyship? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: No, but neither could my gnome legs, to be honest. (laughter) 
SAM: Do we have a way of slowing down? 
LAURA: I've got a broom. 
TRAVIS: Probably not. This is it. Kamikaze style going in. Oh, and we're going to buy the whole farm, yep. 
SAM: I don't know if that's a great idea. 
TRAVIS: Is that not the plan? 
MARISHA: I mean, most of us have ways of getting down, right? I mean-- 
TALIESIN: No, no, of course not. 
MARISHA: You could always take a ride on me. I don't know if I could carry a horse. 
SAM: Well. 
LAURA: I could leave-- 
SAM: Oh wait. 
LAURA: -- Trinket here. 
MATT: "We have ship-based mages that will help you decend safely." 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: "We're not going to just throw you into--" 
TRAVIS: You got to lead with that. I was imagining the best and the worst. 
LAURA: I mean, we can make it happen. You know, we have ways. 
MATT: "I understand." 
SAM: I have hands. 
TALIESIN: I was enjoying the panic. 
MATT: "Do not worry." 
MARISHA: Yeah, we flew all the time back in the day. 
SAM: It's just been a while since we've flown. 
ASHLEY: It's been a minute, it's been a minute. 
SAM: ♪ It's been a while ♪ 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Do you have Trinket? 
LAURA: I have Trinket. I just, maybe he shouldn't come, you know? 
SAM: Yeah, maybe he shouldn't. 
LAURA: Listen. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Well, maybe you should keep him here just to keep him safe. 
LAURA: I mean, he can't drop. 
ASHLEY: No, that, no. 
LAURA: He's so old, you know, when he bites a tooth might even fall out. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't, I think you should leave him. 
TRAVIS: I mean, unless you want to, you know, ask him. Because this is going to be glory on top of glory. 
ASHLEY: That's true. Give him a choice. 
LAURA: You're right, I should give him an option. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: All right, I'm going to pop Trinket out. 
MATT: (fluffy thudding) 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Old ass bitch? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Look how much gray! Trinket. 
ASHLEY: Oh! Trinky! 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
LAURA: I know, he's tired. 
ASHLEY: He has so much gray. What a distinguished gentleman you are. Ooh! 
SAM: He's not. 
MATT: Like, sits on his hind legs. 
LAURA: I know. So, you know, it's a big-- I have Speak with Animals, so he can understand me. I don't know, we can probably edit it. It's a big day. We're going to be going into battle. I know it's been a long time since we've done that, dear, and we might be able to get Vax a little safer than he is. Do you want to join us or would you rather stay here? 
MATT: "Is it dangerous?" 
LAURA: It's very dangerous. And, you know... 
MATT: "And I have to protect you." 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: Buddy. I just-- see, this is why I can't let-- 
TRAVIS: All we're hearing is a bunch of grunting. 
LAURA: He's just the sweetest boy. 
TRAVIS: I think we know that. 
MATT: You all hear, (bear grunting) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, okay, then you're coming, you're coming. And I'll protect you and you'll protect me. 
MATT: "Good." 
LAURA: Yes? 
SAM: This seems like elder abuse. What are you doing? (laughter) 
MATT: As soon as you say that. (slurps) 
SAM: (groans) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah! Trink! 
SAM: Blech! 
MATT: "(huffs)" 
SAM: All right, yeah. 
LAURA: He's tough. He's still so tough. Yeah, look, Grog's got silver, he's still super buff. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, silver fox. Gimmee paw. 
MATT: "(roars)" (heavy impact) Big old claw cracks down your hand like (scratch) 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: It scrapes the gauntlet. 
TRAVIS: Let him come! 
LAURA: Yeah, he's fine. He's fine. 
ASHLEY: He'll be fine. He'll be fine. He'll be fine. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "(huffs)" (magical swoosh) (laughs) 
LIAM: Above the table, Liam would know this, but I don't, so above the table, do we know that our travels are going to get us there in under 24 hours, 12 hours? Like how fast are we arriving? 
TRAVIS: Oh my god, is this the OG? ALL (except Sam): No! 
TRAVIS: You can't drink from there! ALL (except Sam): (shouting) No! (screaming) 
MATT: No! Why did we save that? 
TALIESIN: I looked into the abyss. 
TRAVIS: I don't know what's sicker, the bottom or the inside. 
LAURA: You put something in there, right? You're not drinking that. Oh thank god. 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) 
SAM: But, you guys got to smell this thing. 
ALL: No! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Get that away. 
TRAVIS: Is it like a cast? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm not smelling that right now. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wait, now I want to smell it. 
TALIESIN: No! What is wrong with you? 
TRAVIS: No, don't get your whole nose in it. So you don't get close. 
MARISHA: Oh! Oh. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: She's giving it a second whiff? 
TRAVIS: It's like melting plastic mixed with decay. 
MARISHA: It's like-- 
MATT: Oh no. 
MARISHA: It's like the grossest toilet in a public pool. 
LAURA: Are you going to barf? 
MATT: Oh. 
TRAVIS: I went too hard. 
TALIESIN: Anyone else feeling like delighting themselves with an olfactory experience? 
LAURA: No! I will not! 
ASHLEY: I kind of want a little bit to know. 
MATT: Tragedy struck in Los Angeles this past week as... 
MARISHA: It's like a rotting Six Flags. 
ASHLEY: So gross. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: A rotting Six Flags. 
SAM: It's like it's been cleaned a lot, but it hasn't worked. (laughter) 
LIAM: Guys, we almost made it to 10 years. (laughter) 
LAURA: That's it. That's what did it. 
TRAVIS: I could change diapers, but that's-- 
LAURA: That's why you rolled triple zeros today. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
MATT: My god. 
MARISHA: Okay yeah, how long's it going to take us to get there? Because-- 
MATT: Oh, I mean, when everyone's set up, it'll be a couple hours before the armies are in place and then it begins. 
LAURA: Okay, so we have time for the feast. 
MARISHA: But no time to rest and regain those spells. 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: We should rest. 
LIAM: The flight itself, a couple of hours to prep before leaving. Then once we're airborne... 
MATT: The gates send the sky ships directly above the fortress. You are arriving. You are magically warping into battle. You are fucking "Battlestar" season three, just going in. 
LIAM: Here for it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Talking dirty. 
MARISHA: Could we say that we did a Heroes' Feast last night? 
SAM: We can say it. 
MATT: I'll allow it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: Phew! 
TRAVIS: Fucking gracious. 
MATT: You guys have been prepping for this for a while. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: I thought we were going to have more time. 
ASHLEY: I did too. 
MARISHA: Great. 
MATT: So, with the Heroes' Feast-- 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That is 2d10 max hit points? 
LIAM: That would be less than-- Is max different than temporary hit points? 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Those buffer together. 
TALIESIN: You roll 2d10. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. 
LIAM: So temporary hit points don't stack-- 
LAURA: We'll add those to the max hit points. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: -- but max hit points and temp are cool together. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Sweet. 
MARISHA: But temp on temp is bad. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I don't like how accommodating he is. This is going to be fucking rough. 
LAURA: We could die. This could it it. 
LIAM: Lieve'tel had some wine last night, I will say that she prepared for this as well. 
MARISHA: Is that an advantage on-- 
TRAVIS: Don't worry, you're just-- 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
LAURA: What'd we get? 
MARISHA: Those are above average. 15. 
LAURA: 15. 
MATT: So everyone gets 15 to their maximum hit points. So whatever you have currently, add 15 to it. 
ROBBIE: Oh, whoa. HP modifier? 
MARISHA: Max HP modifier maybe. 
ROBBIE: That's what I did. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MARISHA: Let's do that. 15. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: I've tried that before and I don't think it-- 
TALIESIN: It'll do it. 
MARISHA: 182? Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, it worked. 
TALIESIN: You just have to put the full number in there. 
MARISHA: Great. 
MATT: The full number. 
LAURA: Wait. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
LAURA: What was my hit points before? 127? Was it 120-- 
SAM: Get your shit together. 
ROBBIE: It'll show it in little brackets. 
MATT: It was 143 previously. 
LAURA: Then why did it-- It just totally changed. 
TRAVIS: But why? 
LAURA: Shut up. 
SAM: Mine also changed. 
LAURA: It changed my max to less than what it was before. 
MATT: (sighs) I don't know, man. 
TALIESIN: You have to put the full number in temporary hit points. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: Cerkonos. 
MATT: Just put 158 as your current hit points. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Cerkonos, I noticed earlier when you were talking to Lieve'tel. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
SAM: You seemed a little nervous. Is it because she's creepy and creeped you out? 
ROBBIE: She's very pretty. 
SAM: Oh, oh, pretty, because she's pretty. 
ROBBIE: Pretty creepy, but also pretty pretty. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Sort of in that sort of goth kind of dangerous way? 
ROBBIE: I feel like I botched it, Scanlan. 
SAM: No, no, you didn't. You didn't. (laughter) 
SAM: That was-- No. (laughter) Believe me, I've met women where I've been covered in shit and stunk and bleeding. 
ROBBIE: I should cover myself in shit? 
SAM: No, no, no, what I'm saying is, I've-- 
ROBBIE: Oh, okay. (laughter) 
SAM: I made a lot of really bad first impressions, even on Pike. All these guys, really. I made terrible first impressions, but I still won them over. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
SAM: You're not done. Just come up with an approach for your second conversation. 
ROBBIE: I feel like the end is nigh and there's certain things in life I've missed out, and being around you has inspired me in a way. 
SAM: What's something that you're really good at? Really confident. 
ROBBIE: Fighting. 
SAM: Fighting? 
ROBBIE: Fighting. 
SAM: Fighting. 
ROBBIE: Fighting. 
SAM: Okay. Just fighting. Just straight up fighting. (laughter) 
SAM: Yeah, okay. So we're going to do that. So you'll get an opportunity to show her that. But is there anything else, like a cool fire spell that you know? 
ROBBIE: Yes. Many. 
SAM: Well maybe have one ready so that if she's like: I need cover, you can be like: I'm there. I've got you. 
ROBBIE: I will prepare the coolest spell you've ever seen. 
SAM: Make it into a cool shape or an image or-- 
ROBBIE: I'll think about it en route. 
SAM: Yes, please do. Also-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: -- just pick one detail about her to compliment. Could be anything. 
ROBBIE: One? 
SAM: Yes. Your eyelashes are really beautiful. 
ROBBIE: Eyelashes. 
SAM: Or like, oh, that dress-- (laughter) 
SAM: That dress is really, that dress is really cute. Does it have pockets? 
ROBBIE: Does it have pockets? 
SAM: Yeah. Just one specific detail, anything, could be anything, and go for that. 
ROBBIE: Pockets. 
SAM: Okay. 
ROBBIE: He's muttering "pockets" as he walks away-- (laughter) 
ROBBIE: -- from the conversation. 
MATT: I love it. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: As a refresher, Heroes' Feast, you get your plus 15 HP, advantage on wisdom saving throws, and we are immune to poison and frightened. 
MATT: Scanlan, your total max hit points should be 198 now. 
SAM: Yes, I got that. 
MATT: Cool. 
SAM: I reduced mine by 37 and added the 15. 
LAURA: Did you already add your-- 
TRAVIS: Anybody got any additional max HP points they want to give me-- 
LAURA: Did you change your max? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- so I can sit at an even 300? 
LAURA: Okay, then you're fine. 
MATT: (laughs) Oh my god! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Fucking HP-- 
ROBBIE: I have buffs, I have buffs. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I got an axe ♪ (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Advantage on wisdom saving throws and can't be frightened. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I want to play ♪ (laughter) 
MARISHA: Advantage on wisdom and then you're immune to poison and frightened. 
TALIESIN: All right. Advantage on wisdom saves, no poison, no frightened. 
MARISHA: Correct 
MATT: As you all are heading towards the front line and prepping yourselves, having your Heroes' Feast and mentally getting ready for what's to come and what might be on the other side. Some of you have been to the Hellcatch. Some of you have only heard or seen in stories or visions, and even then it's changed since your last arrival. So there is a gathering of intel from those who have been there recently and being shared amongst the front lines. As this is happening, two figures approach. One of them, let me see if I have it worded. Where the fuck did I write it? There it is, sorry. One of them, you see a gentleman, short beard, robes, a standard looking middle aged gentleman, maybe reddish brown, approaches. Looks to you. You recognize this as archivist Seth Domade. 
MARISHA: Oh! Oh. 
MATT: "Voice of the Tempest." 
MARISHA: I know him. 
MATT: You do, you do indeed. 
MARISHA: Seth Domade, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "I just wanted to confirm, the Mighty Nein have made their trek to the moon, correct? Safely?" 
MARISHA: Yes, they were accompanied by Allura. She helped them get to their rallying point before they went over. A bunch of the Ashari were there as well to help see them through the gateway. 
MATT: "That is all I needed." 
MARISHA: Why? Have you heard from them? 
MATT: "Not yet. We are getting everything prepped for when the word comes through." 
MARISHA: Okay. And Bells Hells, have you heard? 
MATT: "Not yet." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: "But as soon as we do, I'm sure it will be disseminated." 
LAURA: Are you going to be with us, so we'll know? 
MATT: "I will not be. I will be helping in my way." 
MARISHA: Why do you-- Are you all right? You seem unsure. 
MATT: "I'm fine, I just, there is--" 
MARISHA: We don't have a lot of time, Archivist. What is it? 
MATT: "I have-- I'm fond of members of the Mighty Nein and wanted to ensure that they've traveled safely." 
MARISHA: Oh. I'm sure they're just fine. They're a very capable bunch. 
MATT: "Thank you." 
MARISHA: Insight check? 
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check. 
TRAVIS: Is this Sino? 
ROBBIE: No. 
TRAVIS: Who is this? Archivist? 
SAM: Archivist. Seth Rogen. 
LIAM: Yeah, it's-- 
MARISHA: It's not the Chetney fanboy. 
LIAM: -- Essek in disguise. 
ROBBIE: Essek, Essek. 
MATT: No, this is Essek in disguise. 
LAURA: It's Essek! 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MARISHA: Essek! 
TALIESIN: Did you guys not figure it out? Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right! 
MARISHA: That's right. I tried to remember. 
ASHLEY: We made such fun of Seth! 
MARISHA: Seth! 
ASHLEY: That's right, that's right. That's right, that's right. 
MARISHA: Okay, but also insight check him. 
LAURA: I'm like that Vox Machina's like: Who the fuck is this guy? 
TALIESIN: How did I know that? 
MATT: And they are. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: 20 total. 
MATT: 20 total. 
LIAM: Accent. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You know this figure is trusted with Allura and has spoken highly of him. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: What you gather from this is that there's a genuine nervousness. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Not any sort of deception per se, but an individual that is worried. 
MARISHA: Okay. Right. 
MATT: "Sorry. I appreciate that. Anyway, I wanted to introduce you to someone who will be helming one of the other skyship assaults, should you meet on the battlefield. This is a figure from the Kryn Dynasty, one of their various championed warriors who has been part of this, Verin Thelyss." 
MARISHA: Oh. Oh! 
TRAVIS: From Den Thelyss? 
MARISHA: From Den Thelyss? 
TRAVIS: What was the first name? 
MARISHA: Verin? 
ROBBIE: Verin? 
MATT: Verin. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You see a-- 
TALIESIN: We got a lore screech. 
ASHLEY: Verin Thelyss? 
TRAVIS: How do you spell Verin? 
MATT: V-E-R-I-N. 
LAURA: Is this Essek's brother? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Oh, this is-- 
MATT: You see a dark elf of lavender skin, long white hair that is bound and braided tightly in the back. 
LAURA: Hot boi number two! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Kryn helmet under one arm. 
TRAVIS: (sneezes) 
MATT: Bless you. 
ASHLEY: Shh! 
MATT: Broad shoulders, but lithe and tightly muscular. You can tell from the way he holds himself. Carrying in one hand to the side, an intricate glaive that climbs with beautifully crafted Kryn design to it into this large, slightly curved and pointed glaive blade at the tip. (Verin) "The pleasure is mine. Indeed, I am representing the Kryn interests for the skyship incursion, and I will be myself seeing a number of Kryn warriors to be arriving within the midst of the fortress. I just wanted to make sure we saw each other face to face, where should we meet on the field of battle, we know each other to be allies." 
MARISHA: Your support and all of the efforts from the Kryn Dynasty are very appreciated in this time. 
MATT: "Of course." 
LAURA: So wonderful to see you in person. I'm sure we won't be forgetting your face anytime soon. 
TALIESIN: Enough. 
MATT: He stops and goes, "Actually, look more for the helmet," and he holds the helmet out there. I'll be wearing this. This would be more important to look for, because if you see this, it looks a bit spooky, but that's intended by its design. But it's me, it's just me. 
LAURA: So intimidating. Really. 
MATT: Seth goes (smacks) and smacks him. He's like, "(clears throat) It is my honor to be fighting alongside you." 
LAURA: You as well. 
MATT: Shoots a glance over to Seth. "Voice of the Tempest." 
MARISHA: Yes? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, are you-- Yes. What? 
TRAVIS: Wow. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Smooth move, ex-lax. 
MATT: He steps forward and goes, "I don't mean for this to be presumptuous, but there won't be another opportunity." 
MARISHA: Is is this Verin saying this? 
MATT: This is Verin. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: "Would you do me the honor of signing this booklet for me?" 
LAURA: I thought he was going to propose or something. 
TALIESIN: It felt very heavy. 
LAURA: It felt like a moment. 
ASHLEY: What's that booklet? 
MATT: "This is a poetry book of the Air Ashari that I was gifted when I was younger and I've just--" 
MARISHA: Oh, lovely. 
MATT: "I've always cherished it. I figure--" 
MARISHA: Yeah, I didn't, you know I didn't write this poetry. 
MATT: "I know, but you represent the culture that created it." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: "Thank you." 
MARISHA: Do you want his signature, too? 
MATT: "Who is this?" 
MARISHA: This is Flamespeaker Cerkonos. 
MATT: "Do you write poetry?" 
ROBBIE: No. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: "Sure." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I see. (laughter) 
SAM: I write poetry. (laughter) (laughter) 
MATT: "That's fine." (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Burn! 
TRAVIS: No love for the horse. (laughter) 
MATT: "Thank you, Voice of the Tempest." 
MARISHA: Thank you. 
MATT: "And... kaitiake." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Kaitiake. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Laying it on thick. 
MATT: Puts the helmet on. Begins to walk off. 
ASHLEY: Damn. No. Oh! 
MATT: The Archivist is like, "I appreciate your candor. Good luck out there. (loud whisper) Verin, what the fuck was that?!" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "You fucking embarrassed me!" 
MARISHA: Okay. Where were we? 
LAURA: Oh, I think you were getting hit on. 
MARISHA: It was a friendly-- it was-- 
TALIESIN: I would swear that between the two of you they were going to distract him. 
MARISHA: Do you think that was hap-- no. 
LAURA: What are you talking about? 
SAM: Yeah, Keyleth. 
MARISHA: He just admires-- 
TALIESIN: He couldn't have fought for a week after flirting with you. 
SAM: Keyleth, can you sign my hoof? 
MARISHA: Ugh, shut up, Scanlan. 
SAM: I mean, you're so famous. Will you sign something for me? 
MARISHA: Oh my god! So, let's get the fuck out of Vasselheim please. I hate this city. 
ASHLEY: Keyleth, can you sign my tits? 
MARISHA: (grunts) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Do you need a pen, my liege? (laughter) 
MARISHA: All right. Okay. 
TALIESIN: There we are. 
MARISHA: It's a nice pen. 
TRAVIS: Keyleth, you're stupid. 
TALIESIN: I know. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh, that wasn't right. 
MARISHA: (laughs) (laughter) 
MARISHA: I will try to go find Allura. Is she still there nearby? 
MATT: She's actually rushing your direction. She's about two blocks up. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: She's like "(pants)" 
MARISHA: Great. Oh! I was just coming to find you. That's so funny. 
MATT: "We've received word." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: "They're in position." 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
MATT: "On Ruidus." 
MARISHA: Wait, now? Right now? 
MATT: Now. 
MARISHA: Oh, oh, oh. 
TRAVIS: Fuck it! 
MARISHA: Okay. Wait. We're not there. Is the timetable going to work right? They got there sooner than I thought. 
MATT: "We begin and we let them know when it's time." 
MARISHA: (huffs) Okay, okay. We got to go. They could be... sitting-- 
SAM: they let us know, and then we let them know, and then they let us know? 
LAURA: I don't think anything happens after we let them know. 
TRAVIS: It's more like (bong)! 
MATT: "Once you let them know, then they are going with the grace of whatever they pray to." 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Well, they could be vulnerable. We should go. 
MATT: Allura grasps her hands around and you see her fingers seem to grab the air, like it's some sort of a molasses, leaving these dark streaks of color behind as she swirls around. 
LAURA: Are we going, are we going? 
MATT: Gathering it like clay, and then (whooshes) thrusts it in the air. You watch as the streak of dark light, (intense boom). 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: Suddenly gives off this burst of bright green color. As it does, horns start going, (various tonal blares) the whole city begins blasting with various volumes of war horns. The symbol of war has been triggered. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: Soldiers begin to line up. Shouting begins to grow louder as people are lining up in places. You can see there are markers and makeshift archways that have been built at places where these gates are going to be anchored. Skyships are lowered. As everyone begins to get into place, Allura escorts you over towards one of the skyships, and goes, "All right. We're going to get you on board of the skyship where you've been assigned to. (huffs) I'm getting too old for this." 
LAURA: I hear you go over. 
ASHLEY: My sister. 
TALIESIN: Everything hurts. 
LAURA: I go over and I stand in front of Percy and I give him a kiss, and I get really close, and I go: T-t-the children, they'll be safe. This is the right choice. This is the right choice. 
TALIESIN: They'll be better than safe. They know what they're doing. They're leaders. In the worst case, they're going to save them all. 
LAURA: (deeply sighs) 
TALIESIN: We did very well. 
LAURA: We did very well. 
TALIESIN: Let's go save your brother. 
LAURA: Okay. I love you. 
TALIESIN: I love you. 
SAM: I go over to Grog and touch his face. 
TRAVIS: Oh? 
SAM: Is the beer going to be okay? Are we going to have enough when we get back to celebrate? 
TRAVIS: Yes, in another dimension. 
SAM: Is anyone watching it for us? 
TRAVIS: No, I've already got it in the bag. 
SAM: Okay, good. Okay, good. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you scared me. Oh man. I should check it. 
SAM: Yup. (laughs) (poofs) (pops) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You want a swig? 
SAM: Yeah. (glugs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (glugs) (whooshes) 
SAM: Did you make me any hoof sandals? 
TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah! 
MATT: Yeah. Now quickly roll for me. Roll either performance or dexterity. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I got a plus seven to my performance, bitch. 24! (cheering, laughter) 
MATT: Describe to me what you present to Scanlan. 
TRAVIS: I reach in with my one hand, and on four fingers-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Come out little bitty hoof covers, but they've got a leather strap that runs through little perforated holes around the edges. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: They zip shut like a little dice bag. I present thy hoof. 
SAM: Whoa, they're-- (whooshes) 
SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (squeals) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: They're like little hoof condoms. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Your next foot, and I walk around each foot. (whooshes) 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: The laces are just a little bit too long, so you have to wrap them twice around the ankle. 
TRAVIS: With a bow, almost like a ballerina slipper. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: They got tassels on the end of them. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: I mean, they are braided-- 
SAM: Do they slip and slide, or are they, did you score them? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, they're already pre-scored, but the more you wear them, the more they'll adhere to your foot and become like a second skin. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Grog, these are amazing. 
TRAVIS: I know. 
MARISHA: You've gotten more talented. 
TRAVIS: I mean, I have nothing but time to practice. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: You need a girlfriend. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I've got plenty of them. 
SAM: Oh! Nice. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Free city, bitch. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Should have franchises! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to very quickly, just in the last few minutes, saunter up beside Keyleth. 
SAM: I saunter. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: (thwacks) 
TRAVIS: That canter. 
TALIESIN: Canter. 
TRAVIS: That's it. That's good. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Fuck! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Is it fair, dear, to say that among us you would feel that I knew you as well as anybody on Exandria knows you as a person, deep down? 
MARISHA: At one point in time, I would say that's true. You know more than most. 
TALIESIN: I want you to know I will follow your lead to the ends of this world, my liege. 
MARISHA: (gentle laugh) 
TALIESIN: I hand a tiny little flask. 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MARISHA: (sighs) 
TALIESIN: Little courage. 
MARISHA: To the future of Whitestone. 
TALIESIN: Yes, milady. 
MARISHA: Lord de Rolo. I give him a hug. I stab him in the eye with my antlers. 
TALIESIN: Nope. Nope. Yeah, that's always, I'm going to just, I know to move left and right. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oof. (sighs) 
TRAVIS: Let's do this. 
TALIESIN: Let's fuck some shit up. 
LIAM: Lieve will glide out in front of Lady de Rolo and the Tempest. My lady has afforded me glimpses of your raven. Though the future is unwritten, it is not without hope, and that word, hope, rings in your ears, and Lieve casts Power Word Fortify and I divide between the two of you 120 temporary hit points, so you each have 60. You have to erase the 20 you got. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
LIAM: You instead have 20. 
TALIESIN: What? 
LAURA: You mean, wait. 
SAM: Oh, 60. 
MARISHA: 60? 
LIAM: 60 temporary hit points, so that 20 changes to a 60. 
LAURA: Instead of the 20? 
MARISHA: (gasps) Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
LIAM: She then-- 
SAM: Wait, who gets that? 
LIAM: The Tempest and Lady de Rolo, and then she rests-- 
TALIESIN: Tempest and Lady de Rolo, yes. 
TALIESIN: Just the girls. 
LIAM: -- rests her palms-- 
LAURA: On our titties. 
LIAM: Just above your titties. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: And casts Death Ward on each of you. 
MARISHA: ♪ What does that do? Tell me what that does. ♪ 
LIAM: When you're down to zero, you go to one instead of zero. 
MATT: Mark that Death Ward on both of you. 
TRAVIS: It's a defibrillator. 
LIAM: Then Lieve casts Power Word Fortify on herself, giving herself an extra 120 temporary hit points. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Whoa! 
LIAM: And turns to Cerkonos. Flamespeaker, your arm, please. I believe it's time to board our ship. 
LAURA: She always gets lucky with whoever is with our group. 
ASHLEY: She does. Damn, she's creepy-- 
LAURA: She's got some game. 
ASHLEY: -- but she's got some game. 
TRAVIS: Yup, she pulls. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
LIAM: She pulls you into her wake. 
LAURA: Thank you for the titty protection. 
SAM: Say something! 
ROBBIE: Your skin is pale and moist. 
LAURA: Ew. 
TRAVIS: (wheezes) 
ROBBIE: Then I hold out my other hand to her and (laughs) I cast at 1st-level Goodberry. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: In my hand, 10 tiny berries go, (pops)-- (laughter) 
ROBBIE: -- and my hand fills with a little sad handful of berries. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: May this protect you on our battle. 
LIAM: She curls her fingers over the berries of your hand. You are a beautiful, beautiful boy. (laughter) 
LIAM: She pockets the goodberries. 
TRAVIS: Smears them all over. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: There's going to be goodberry juice in there. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
TALIESIN: It's going to be leaking in an hour. 
MATT: As you all step up on board and Allura guide you to the front, she points out the two mages that are part of your departure troop. Two younger arcanists that are both set up have some light ceremonial-looking armor over their robes, shoulder pauldrons that are more for decoration and presentation than actual protection, but they let you know at the moment of your necessary departure from the ship, they will guide your safe descent towards the fortress. Also, she turns to the captain and you see up at the top, cackling, looking over, a big captain's hat brimming on a hairless top of the head. a big captain's hat brimming on a hairless top of the head. A tiefling with tattoos and big high-collared captain coat turns around. "Hey there! Vox Machina, right? That's what you're supposed to be? I am your captain, Xandis. I'll be seeing you to your destination on this day. Pleasure to meet you. I know you're legends in your own right. Today, I become a legend alongside you. Don't forget it. Welcome to the Key Breaker. I hope you're comfy. We're about to return to the place where I crashed my last ship to victory!" 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Nice to meet you, captain! 
LAURA: You crashed it. You crashed it? 
MATT: "Intentionally." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, this is the-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Xandis! 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: "Xandis Keybane. Captain Esquire." 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ooh. 
LAURA: Keybane. 
MARISHA: Oh, you added Esquire to my title. 
MATT: "Just did right now." 
MARISHA: Okay. Whatever makes you happy. 
MATT: Allora goes, "They're--" 
TRAVIS: That's right? 
MATT: "They are a very skilled captain, and at the very least, help pass the time with a bit of unique personality. Thank you, Captain Xandis Keybane, and may you see these legends safely to their destination." (Xandis) "Wouldn't have it done any other way. (laughs)" 
TRAVIS: He's a little crazy. He'll fit right in. 
ASHLEY: Where are you from? 
TALIESIN: Captain? 
ASHLEY: I can't place the accent. 
MATT: "Oh, I'm from all over." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: "Just kind of a military brat. Just sort of, you know, family went around, picked up here, picked up there. Just, you know, just trying to help. Hope it works out." (laughter) 
SAM: "You know." 
ASHLEY: "You know." (laughter) 
LAURA: I love him. I love him. I feel like we're in good hands. 
MATT: "It's them, but I appreciate it." (oohing) 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, them. 
MATT: "Not to worry. Get comfy. It's going to be a short and bumpy ride." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Just like you. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) That's right. 
TALIESIN: Hey, I'm getting better at that. 
SAM: Yeah, you are. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you. 
SAM: That's a joke. 
ASHLEY: We doing this? We doing this? We doing this? 
LAURA: We're doing it. 
ASHLEY: We're doing this. 
MATT: As you all get settled up on the ships, the horns go off a few minutes later. (power humming) The braziers that are all bright blue burning now go to a vibrant white light-- 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MATT: -- across the entire city of Vasselheim. 
TRAVIS: DEFCON one. 
MATT: You hear cheers from the surrounding populace that becomes a strange hissing din. Hundreds of sparkling bits of arcana begin to be conjured all down below the deck of the ship, and you watch (arcane illumination) as gates and portals begin to open up. Immediately, darkened ruddy dust and brown dirt blows through the portals from a wind across the way, and you watch as these armies, these clusters of troops, warriors, and soldiers begin to push through in a sprint, (whooshes) vanishing through these doors and gateways. You watch the celestial angels gather up, themselves (portal whooshes) coasting through at their own pace. The mages that are atop your ship glance over the side and give themselves a small signal down to the ground below, and within but a fraction of a second, (rumbling) a massive gateway opens up maybe about 120 feet ahead of where your ship, the Keybreaker, sits. There you can see (forceful windstorm) the rushing of some sort of a low-intensity dust storm seems to be awaiting you on the opposite side. 
LIAM: We're already up into the sky at this point? 
MATT: Yeah, the skyship is just slightly off the ground. 
LAURA: ♪ Into the sky ♪ 
TRAVIS: Grog's standing up at the front of the ship and you see that he's adopted a red cape. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: It's been there the whole time, tucked into the back of his pauldron strap. But he pulls it out and he's letting it flap in the wind, majestic as fuck. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
TALIESIN: Is it just one of the short capes that goes to here, or is it one of the-- 
TRAVIS: No, it goes all the way down to my mid-knees. It hides my back fat. 
SAM: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Nice look, Grog. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. I just figured it was time for a new addition. 
SAM: It's very colorful. 
TRAVIS: Yup. 
SAM: Won't it get in the way of your bloodlust? 
TRAVIS: No, I hear capes are perfect in combat situations. They're not a hindrance in any way. 
SAM: Sure. Right. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: I dig it. 
LIAM: Lieve'tel leans into Cerkonos a little bit and muses on this other group, the Mighty Nein and Bells Hells, and she remembers the day, as she still hangs that little bell on a string from her finger that Bertrand Bell gave it to her as a gift. As they move forward towards this gate to insanity, she wonders on what far-flung plane Bertrand Bell's soul rests in now. 
MARISHA: Aw. 
MATT: As the skyship ever so slowly continues towards this gate, waiting for its signal, (flares fire and burst) the secondary flares detonate, signifying the time for the sky orders to progress. Before the ship's brumestones can kick into high gear, you watch at some of the dragons in waiting skim the top of your ships and vanish through the various portals. The brumestones on the outside of your ship (energy humming) begin to glow brightly as it picks up immediate speed, cruising towards this darkened expanse beyond. There, you are suddenly met with clustered shadow. Making a couple of presets here as I do so. 
SAM: Ooh, these are new. We haven't heard this song, have we? 
TRAVIS: It sounds like "The Last Airbender." 
SAM: I know, I know, but like-- 
TRAVIS: I don't know if it's-- 
MATT: (intense portal whoosh) 
SAM: That's good? 
MATT: You shift through the portal as the wind hits, your eyes instinctually pulling tight as the dust and wind strike you from all sides battering. You only have visibility for about 50 to 100 feet beyond where the ship currently sits. It immediately lurches as it continues to push. 
ASHLEY: Oh shit! 
MATT: You can see the shadows of the various flying dragons (wings beating) disappearing into the storm below. You have no sight of where you are. But then as quickly as it was there, you watch as faintly spectral green fingers seem to emerge from the storm, conjured from some unseen place. It tears the storm apart, like parting a cluster of dirt from a marble floor. Some sort of nature magic itself parting the dust before you, and now you look below 150, 200, 300 feet. You can see the expanse at the top of the fortress. Its high walls, somewhat ragged and broken in places, risen and rebuilt from the ruins of the Tishtan people long ago in the forgotten ancient history of Exandria. You see all manner of sparkling and glowing defenses emblazoned upon the tops of these walls, structures, and towers. The bright red light of the bloody bridge in the distance, flickering and flaring, giving off this reddish, deadly hue that seems to be a beacon of dark foreshadowing amongst the distant storm where it has not been pulled back. Other skyships just beyond where the storm was parted, just darkened shadows. You can hear through the wind, shouts and detonations muffled below. (distant explosions) Xandis is at the helm. "All right, we're not there yet. Almost, just hold on tight!" The ship lurches and begins to go into a slight declining angle. You all grab tight at the sides as you do, the mages strapped in. You now see as the robes are blown back, they have harnesses on and they're strapped to the side of the ship so they don't get pulled or blown overboard, and they're all nervously awaiting a moment. At this point you can hear (incoming projectile) one massive blasting arc of crackling purple energy shoots past, flung from below. Glancing over the side, you can see there are built siege defenses all around this fortress, (projectile attacks) firing off, and a few others that haven't fired yet. Their coloration different, like a dull, pale blue-white spark that seems to be warming up and humming. 
LAURA: You can dodge that, right, Xandis? 
MATT: "I can certainly try!" (laughter) 
MATT: Begins to turn the ship as another one lobs upward and the ship-- "Hold on!" - goes to a tight right. You watch as the two mages get pulled against the edge and all of you, I need you all to make a strength saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: Strength saving throw. 
TRAVIS: First roll! 
LAURA: With advantage, everything's at advantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay? 
MARISHA: Everything's at advantage? 
LIAM: No, just wisdom saves. 
LAURA: Shit balls. 
MATT: That's the Vex'ahlia I know! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Eyy! 
ROBBIE: Woo! 
TRAVIS: Fucking A. 
ROBBIE: Let's go! 
MARISHA: Not great. 
LAURA: Saving throw. 
MATT: All right, what we got? 
LIAM: 18. 
ROBBIE: 27. 
MATT and LAURA: Woo. 
MARISHA: 10. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
SAM: Natural one. (gasping) 
LAURA: You're a horse! 
TALIESIN: You're a horse! 
LAURA: You can't-- Ugh! 
SAM: Still rolled a one. 
MATT: Grog. 
TRAVIS: 33. 
ROBBIE: Woo! 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: 14. 
MATT: 14, okay. 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: 18, okay. 
LIAM: 17. 
MATT: All right, so communally, there's a couple of close calls as some of your friends on the trip begin to slide off to the edge, but together as a troop, you grab and hold each other. As the ship just barely hits around the side. (laughter) The blast itself looks like it's about to impact and one of the side mages throws up a shield on the side as it deflects and splinters off, blasting the energy itself, lighting the area around you and a deafening cracking explosion causes your ears to ring for a second as it does. You now hear (screeching) and emerging from the nearby storm, three large, crooked-looking winged creatures. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
MATT: Descend out of the clouds towards the front of the ship. At immediate glance, you think these are wyverns or some sort of strange creature, but where their heads would be are these weird stalks with a blackened eye. You see these red leather-scaled wings. You've not seen a creature like this as they begin to swoop towards the top of the ship. 
LAURA: I'm aiming for the eye. 
MATT: Aiming for the eye, roll an attack. 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LAURA: Ah shit, okay, wait. Oh, there's so many things. Okay, I'm going to do Sharpshooter so I can do a really long distance attacks. 
MATT: Yep, without taking disadvantage. 
LAURA: But I'm going to take a negative five to the attacks. 
MATT: Okay, let's go. 
LAURA: Okay. Oh wow. 28. 
ASHLEY: Yar. 
MATT: 28 hits. 
LAURA: All right. So that's-- Oh god, okay. 1d8, I didn't prep any of my little thingies. Four plus nine is 13 plus 10 is 23. Would that be a sneak attack? 
MATT: Nah. 
LAURA: Damn it. 
MATT: It definitely knows you're present. 
LAURA: Oh, and I didn't Hunter's Mark it, that's okay. 
MATT: You can Hunter's Mark it now, if you want to. 
LAURA: Hunter's Mark it! 
MATT: All right, as you slam it with the arrow and then, "God, it's been a minute." You Hunter's Mark it as it's swooping towards you. 
LAURA: Do I get the d6 for Hunter's Mark damage? No. 
MATT: I'll allow it, sure. 
LAURA: Four extra. Did I tell you all the whole damage on that at all? 
MATT: You said 23 originally, so now it's 27. 
LAURA: Okay, 27. 
MATT: All right, that's your one attack, do you get a second one? 
LAURA: I get another attack! 
MATT: Yeah, you get two arrows here. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: That's 13 to hit. No, wait! I only said Sharpshooter for the first one. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: So that is 18 to hit. 
MATT: 18 misses. 
LAURA: Aw, fuck. 
MATT: (chuckles) 
MARISHA: Aw. 
TRAVIS: Aw, fuck. 
MATT: Because you're a sharpshooter, the intensity of the storm is not knocking the arrows free, but this one gets lost in the chaos. One of them gets struck in the eye, (screeches) skids, impacting on the deck of the ship and scoots before it lands and stops on the ground. 
LAURA: Grog, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Dibs! 
MATT: Its wings are flapping and it has claws, and you can see these massive talons are reaching for-- It's getting itself back up to its feet while the other two swoop down. They're both going to make strikes at-- I'd say that the two most prominent would be the horse man. 
SAM: (neighs) (laughter) 
MATT: I'll probably say, you got a cloak on. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, bitch, I am prominent. 
MATT: It's going to go for you. So the one's going to strike for you. 
TRAVIS: Time for a warmup. 
MATT: Ooh! 27 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Me? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MATT: You take... that's going to be 18 points of slashing damage and make a strength saving throw. 
TRAVIS: You got it. That is 22. 
MATT: It slashes down and tries to pick you up with its might, but you pull free from its grasp as it picks back up in the air. The other one's going to come for you, Scanlan. Ooh, that's a 28 to hit. 
SAM: Oh my god. Yeah, that hits. 
MATT: All right, and you take 16 points of slashing damage. I need you to make strength saving throw. 
SAM: Yikes, yikes, this is not going well already. Six. (laughs) 
MATT: Six. While Grog knocks one off the other one swoops down, slams its talons, one into the Scanlan's shoulder, the other into the back of his horse body and lifts him from the-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- top of the skyship. 
LAURA: No! 
TRAVIS: Is he within five feet of me? He's not. 
MATT: He's not at the moment, but you haven't gone yet. Now the rest of you can go. We're taking this action as it comes. 
TALIESIN: I would like to take a quick action here. 
SAM: (frightened neigh) 
TALIESIN: I want to do a quick Fast Draw and I'm going to take a shot at-- I'm going to take a shot at this creature and I'm going to, do I have to call if I'm using a Grit beforehand or? 
MATT: Yeah, you say if you're using a point to do something, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm going to use a disarming shot. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: And see if I can get them to drop the horse! 
TRAVIS: Attaboy. (laughter) 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: Pulling it out, I'm going to use-- 
LAURA: Oh, and it was an extra 1d4 because I forgot I have Fenthras. 
MATT: Yeah, you did. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Animus. 
LAURA: Three lightning damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: So-- 
MATT: Plus three. Roll for an attack. Now, you are at disadvantage because of the storm. 
TALIESIN: I'm at disadvantage because of the storm. 
MATT: Ranged weapons in the storm. 
TALIESIN: Is there anything I can do to counter that? I can counter that by taking a-- No, negative five just gives me a plus 10 to attack. Yeah, fuck it, I can't counter it at the moment. 
MATT: That's okay, go for it. 
TALIESIN: Disadvantage is 22 to hit? 
MATT: 22 hits! 
TALIESIN: Okay, so that is-- 
LAURA: Oh, I should be rolling my Whitestone dice. 
TALIESIN: That is-- 
LIAM: What's wrong with you? 
LAURA: What is wrong with me? 
TALIESIN: That is 14 points of damage and five points of psychic damage. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
MATT: Ooh, all righty. 
TALIESIN: That's also thanks to that, they also-- 
MATT: Strength saving throw? 
TALIESIN: I believe so. I'm double checking. Strength saving throw DC 20. 
MATT: DC 20, they rolled an 18. So as it picks up Scanlan just a few feet off the ground before the shot rings out and it shrieks off and releases, you tumble to the ground and catch yourself on your hooves. 
SAM: Onto the ship or am I free falling? 
MATT: Onto the ship still. It only just got you up briefly, another moment later it would've pulled you off the side. But he quick shot and (gun fires) full on caught it out of the air right as it began to pick you up. 
SAM: Thank you, Percy! 
TALIESIN: Right. 
MATT: It picks up in the air. Who else? 
LIAM: Let me set the next person up quickly. Channel Divinity, Lieve'tel raises a hand and twists it at the one that just dropped Horse-Scanlan and I use Path to the Grave. 
LAURA: (laughs) Horse-Scanlan. The creature is cursed and the next attack that hits it, it has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Then the curse ends. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Done. 
MATT: Who wants to go next? 
MARISHA: I'm going to go into my air elemental form. 
MATT: Okay. (whooshes) You turn into an air elemental. You watch as Keyleth shifts into this churning form of rapidly whirlwind tornado. 
MARISHA: I'm going to go up and so, it's hovering, yeah? 
MATT: It's just picking up. It gets shot and is recovering itself. So it's briefly hovering before it continues the rest of its flight. 
MARISHA: I'm going to try and do a whirlwind attack and see if I can fling it down back to the deck of the ship. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Right into Grog's arms. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: ♪ Into my arms ♪ That's pretty good. (hums) ♪ What do I do here? ♪ Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: 21 to hit. 
MATT: 21 just hits 
MARISHA: 21 just hits. Okay, he has to make-- Oh wait, I'm sorry. He has to make a strength saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Don't you apologize. 
MATT: Saving throw, oh, that's a seven. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he fails. So he's going to take 3d8 and then he gets flung. One, two, three. 
MATT: This is a saving throw so it's not an actual attack roll, so it doesn't trigger the Path to the Grave yet. 
MARISHA: Okay, so that is-- Sorry, 18 damage, and then he is flung 20 feet away from me and is knocked prone. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, so it starts swooping up after it gets shot by Percy and you immediately start up it. Wham! Slam it right down to the deck of the ship. 
MARISHA: He takes bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet he was thrown, which is doubled for the vulnerability from the curse that Lieve'tel just hit it with. 
MATT: Oh. 
TALIESIN: That, or is it weapon attack? 
LIAM: Any damage. 
MATT: Any damage it takes? 
LIAM: So all of that attack's damage. 
MATT: Right, attack's damage, so not a spell, but that was technically an attack. 
MARISHA: It's an attack, yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, okay, so it would be 18 doubled. 
MARISHA: Doubled. 
MATT: So it would be 36. 
MARISHA: Then does he get bludgeoning damage from being flung down? 
MATT: Correct, I'll say it's 20 feet, so 2d6. 
MARISHA: Okay, six. Another six damage. 
MATT: That's 42 points of damage on that. Heavy. Wham! Hits the ground. Grog, Keyleth has knocked it right into your periphery. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll be like, (grunts) I was wondering what my warmup would be. You'll do! (yells) I will go into a rage. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: All right, I'll take two swings with my bloodaxe. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful, that is a 28 to hit. 
SAM: Jesus. 
MATT: 28 definitely hits. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful, second one. 
ASHLEY: Get it, Grog. 
TRAVIS: Is a 22 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah, that hits. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. Look at this d12 doing its shit. Ha ha, you bitch! (laughter) That's 19 points of slashing damage on the first one. 
MATT: Great. 
TRAVIS: Second one. Eight, 10, 18... 23 points of slashing damage on the second. 
MATT: Grog, how do you want to do this? (cheering) 
TRAVIS: I take the blood that I got scratched out of my titty when he swung at me and I swig it across my face. I take the axe, boom! Once on the head. But just when you barely take off the turkey's head the turkey and it's hanging by a thread. Then I rip it off, I take the axe and I split it open and I rip the rib cage open, just spray it everywhere. (laughter) (grunting) 
MATT: The two mages on the side of the ship go-- Just look terrified and Xandis goes, "(laughs) That was crazy!" 
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby! 
MATT: "You're crazy!" 
TRAVIS: You're crazy! 
MATT: "I like crazy!" 
TRAVIS: I like you! (laughter) 
MATT: The two other ones that have swooped up are turning around and attempting to come back for a second strike. As they spin around, suddenly out of the left field, you watch as a silver dragon-- (cheering) snatches one in its jaws and breaks it in half as it does. It screams its death cry while the other one gets knocked on the side and spins down and begins to plummet down into the storm out of sight. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
SAM: Woo! 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) (grunting) (groaning) 
ASHLEY: A little rusty. 
SAM: This was rough, that was rough. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was rough. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Keyleth is going to run to the front, to the bow of the ship. 
LIAM: ♪ Bow of the ship ♪ 
MARISHA: That's the front of the ship, right? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to look over. Do I-- 
LAURA: Can we see down? Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, do we see more projectiles that are about to head our way? 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
LAURA: How close are we over the Key? Can we see down into it yet? 
MATT: We're going to find out with this perception check. 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: You can roll as well, if you want to. 
MARISHA: That's a natural one. 
MATT: Oh, you look over, right as you glance over a bit of the dust (wooshes) right in your eyes and you're like, (grunting) 
LAURA: I rolled a 30. 
ASHLEY: That's better. (laughter) 
MATT: That's a spectrum. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Just rigging you're caught-- Yeah. 
MATT: As some of the storm has been parted, it's not keeping it all at bay, but it's enough where you get glances of the fortress below, there are a number of things being fired upward in your direction and to the clouds nearby. You can see the glowing spark of the Bloody Bridge and the Malleus Key pulsing through the dust, and a little bit of it, you can see the central part of the fortress where it sits. 
LAURA: If I shot an arrow, would I be able to get it arced down into the-- 
MATT: It would have to be a very good shot. Honestly, the wind is so strong that it would likely be carried away by the storm at that distance, because once it lost strength, it would just get lost in the wind. You're not quite that close. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You're probably, looking down now that you have a better perspective, what first looked like you were right above the fortress, it's hundreds of feet away from you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I forgot, because I killed a beastie with the bloodaxe, I regain 10 temporary hit points. 
MATT: You do. 
ROBBIE: Nice! 
MARISHA: Oh yeah! 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
MARISHA: Amazing. 
MATT: All right. So as you're glancing and seeing this down the side, you watch as other sparks (shooting flare) fire up. That pale blue white spark that flickers, (ignites) releases slow at first (shooting arc) (projectile picking up speed) and almost seems to pick up speed like a rail gun in the direction of the ship. 
LAURA: Can I see it coming and shout to Xandis? 
MATT: Yeah, sure. 
LAURA: Bank left! (laughter) 
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
MATT: "All right!" And is going to turn the ship. I need you to roll for Xandis trying to avoid it. 
TRAVIS: Break free! 
MATT: I'm going to roll for this siege weapon. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! Siege weapon! Oh shit! 
LIAM: Rock on! 
MATT: Yeah, defense weapon. 
LAURA: Is it a dexterity roll or just roll a-- 
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and roll. For Xandis, it's going to be a plus eight. For the weapon, it's going to be a plus five. 
LAURA: 13. 
MATT: Six. That's going to be an 11. 
LAURA: Oh! Phew! 
SAM: Hey! 
MARISHA: Let's go, Xandis! 
MATT: It banks heavy left with the second. Now all of you are prepared for it now, after hearing the shout, hold tight. (groans) Tighten your bodies as it (skyship rumbles) shifts to the left. 
ASHLEY: I'll try to go to one side. All go to one side of the ship. 
LAURA: To help it bank? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) As it curves out of the way, this (whooshes) shoots off and (distant pop) evaporates, no big effect. 
LAURA: Do you have any idea what that could have done? 
MATT: You can make an arcana check, if you'd like. 
LAURA: I have shit arcana, but I can try. 
TALIESIN: I'll make an arcana check, just because we're running around. 
LAURA: Nine! 
TALIESIN: 23. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: 23. It's hard to tell in the midst of this chaos the specifics of it, but it feels like the coloration and the release of its effect is abjuration based likely. 
LAURA: What does that mean? 
TALIESIN: Wizard? 
LIAM: I'm not a wizard. 
TALIESIN: I know. I'm asking-- 
LIAM: Protectiony shield. Protectiony shieldy stuff. 
TALIESIN: Protectiony, Yeah, okay. 
LAURA: Okay. Oh, okay. 
TALIESIN: Some sort of shielding protect-- Maybe some sort of battering ram. I'm not sure. Hard to tell. 
TRAVIS: It's magic! 
MATT: You watch as another one of those strange sparkles 
MATT: You watch as another one of those strange sparkles (shooting flare) starts up, and you can see overhead one of the other skyships emerging from the cloud, and it (impacts) gets hit by it. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MATT: (electric flare) It sparkles. 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: No damage to the ship, but the Brumestone goes dark. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ALL: Oh! 
LIAM: It dispelled the brumestone! 
TRAVIS: EMP, baby! 
MATT: These are-- 
LIAM: Mega dispel! 
MATT: Distant dispel shots. 
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: Oh! 
ROBBIE: That's so cool! 
TALIESIN: Look at that, I was incorrect for the first time today. 
MARISHA: Fuck! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wait! Shit! 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: The ship is now-- (sinking rumbles) 
SAM: Can we save the ship? 
TRAVIS: Take us down! 
LAURA: How close are we do it? 
MARISHA: No! 
MATT: "(frantic bumbling) Let's go then! I'm going to go!" You're going to cruise down-- 
TALIESIN: No plan! 
MATT: What are you doing? 
LAURA: Can we get close to it? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. We got to go lower. 
LAURA: I don't know. Got to go lower. 
LAURA: Is anybody we know on that ship? 
MATT: It's too far away to see. 
LAURA: How far away? 
MATT: Maybe a good 200 feet or so. Xandis is like, "All right, We're going in to help or we going into the key? What's your choice?" 
SAM: Dive side by side with that ship! 
LAURA: Dive side by side? 
MATT: (skyship maneuvering) Now it's going full blast. Now the ship is coasting, and its sails are keeping it not from a-- 
LAURA: Okay, so it's not going to crash. 
MATT: -- stone plummeting. 
SAM: Oh, it's going to crash. 
MATT: But it is heading towards a crashing scenario. 
TRAVIS: If we got flyers, you should go get them. 
MARISHA: Do we have Air Ashari on board? We've got other Air Ashari? 
MATT: You have a handful of Air Ashari that have probably come along with you, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to turn to the other Air Ashari and be like: We got to go! And, once again, go back to my air elemental form and signal them to do the same to see if we can-- 
MATT: (poof) They transform as well, and the three of you (whoosh) arc off in that direction. Cerkonos, do you want to join or you want to stay behind with them? 
ROBBIE: Can I do that in my form? 
MATT: Hmm? You can-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah? Yeah! 
MATT: You, in theory, can transform into any elemental you wish. Your fire elemental form is your best. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Baby! 
ROBBIE: Oh my god! I was reading all that and I didn't know. I'll become air with you! 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I didn't know it was on the menu! 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I'll order one, please. (laughter) 
MATT: Now Cerkonos, describe to me how the Flamespeaker's air elemental differs from the Air Ashari elemental. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah. I mean, I think the difference would be there's embers inside and it almost has, there's something in the air that isn't pure air. 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
ROBBIE: It's almost smokey, in a sense. 
MARISHA: Little smokey? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: It's like a tornado that blows through a forest fire. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah! 
MATT: It picks up that burning. 
MARISHA: Cool! 
MATT: That's awesome! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: So you dart off with them. 
ROBBIE: Light the ship on fire. 
MATT: As the ship is trying to come into, not a collision course, but definitely trying to cut off its direction along the side, but they are traveling much faster than the ship is able to correct course in the middle of this dust. So we watches the two Air Ashari, Keyleth and Cerkonos, arc over towards it. As you head over to this airship, you can see the captain is screaming, "We're going down!" And is holding onto the side, trying desperately to pick it back up. One of the arcanists is back there with a rope tied to its arm and tied to the edge of one of the brumestones and it has its hand on the thing and is like, "Come on, come on," and is trying to spark it with some sort of spellcraft, but the brumestone is (throbbing). It's not getting enough magic from this one source. You can see towards the back, holding the edge, there are a number of Kryn soldiers that are wrapped to the side, including Verin Thelyss, who you met earlier, is at the back-- 
SAM: Oh shit. 
LAURA: Shit! 
MATT: -- over the side. 
LAURA: We got to save them! 
MATT: They're all just holding on. 
TRAVIS: We just met him. We just met him! 
SAM: How many? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: How many soldiers? 
TRAVIS: Fucking shmuck, who cares? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Just on the surface that you can see here, there's about 10 total. 
SAM: 10 total. 
LAURA: Can I go from my broom, too? 
MARISHA: Yeah. I just tell the Ashari: Going to slow the descent! Then I'm going to come up and see if I can do a concentrated gust burst into the sails to slow it down. 
LAURA: That's smarter than saving everybody. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to toss you a rope as you go and I'm going to start tying it off to-- 
LAURA: I'm going to go and try hook the rope to the side so people can get across. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. 
LAURA: Like "Air Force One." Isn't that what they did in the movie? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah! 
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: I forgot about that! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
MARISHA: So yeah, we're just trying to stabilize it and slow it down. 
MATT: Okay. For that case, I'm going to need a spellcraft check from you. Are you helping, Cerkonos, with-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah, I'll help. Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so both of you roll a d20 and add your your spellcasting modifier. Which both of you use wisdom, so just add your wisdom modifier. You, I need you to roll a-- 
MARISHA: Is this a check or a save? 
MATT: This is a check. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: This is just a standard check. I would say a dexterity check to try and see if you can manage to-- A dexterity or acrobatics. 
MARISHA: It's all right. 
LIAM: Come on, rogue! 
MATT: Actually, let's go acrobatics because you are trying to maneuver this broom with the rope as fast as possible to loop it through the facets of the ship and then head it back to yours. 
LAURA: 29. 
MATT: 29! Woof! Rapidly going through the air. Describe to me how you, on this broom with incredible, legendary speed, manage to get this rope affixed to the ship and helmed back to where yours is going to be coming from. 
LAURA: I mean, I'm the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: I tie ropes. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: Can confirm. 
LAURA: -- yell at Verin as I come over and throw one handle of the rope so he can wrap it around the mast of the airship. Is there a mast? 
MATT: For this? This one, it doesn't have a mast in the center of this one. It has masts to the side and back. So there isn't a center one. 
LAURA: A big giant wooden pillar. 
MATT: Yeah, there's one to the side on this. 
LAURA: So I'm going to have him grab it and throw it back to me really fast as I tie it around. 
MATT: "I got it!" Catches it, (whooshes) throws it around. You see him quickly affix it to-- He actually takes off a part of his gauntlet and puts the rope through it so it has some weight, and then he flings it around. So you catch it on that side. 
MARISHA: Cool! 
MATT: Wrap it in. The ship is (rumbles) listing further down and you can see people having to hold on. It's starting to get that downward intense angle. 
LAURA: Get to safety! 
TALIESIN: Move, move, move! 
SAM: Can I Polymorph into a brass dragon? (laughs) 
MATT: If you'd like. Wait, using True Polymorph? 
SAM: No, just Polymorph. 
LIAM: That's beast only. 
MATT: Polymorph can be beasts only, unfortunately. 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: Challenge rating maximum. 
SAM: Not creatures. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Nope! 
SAM: Poo! All right. 
MARISHA: You're thinking of True-- 
LIAM: It's actually pretty great. 
MATT: Now what did you both roll for your-- 
SAM: I could be a T-rex. 
MARISHA: Not great. 15. 
ROBBIE: Dogshit. Seven. 
MATT: 15. Seven. (groans) Right now, as you're trying beneath there, the two Ashari aside are going to try and help as well. 
MARISHA: Yeah, come on! 
LAURA: I'm going to have Xandis drop low. 
MATT: Yeah, Xandis is trying the best they can. (controlled intensity) As the ship is pushing down, they are losing direction. They are starting to go into a nose dive-- 
LAURA: Xandis? 
MATT: No, the ship that's lost power to its brumestone. At which point, two crackling bursts of purple (missiles launch) launch up in the direction of the current listing ship. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MARISHA: Towards the ship or other ship? 
MATT: A four and a two! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
MATT: Lucky fuckers! Okay. 
TRAVIS: Thank the Everlight! 
MATT: Both go-- Actually, I'll say both of them come arcing towards and there is a flash of golden light, like golden burning wings seem to almost extend from the front of the ship and (powerful flap) just barely deflect them as they bounce and cross off and then vanish in the distance. 
ASHLEY: She came! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: But, you're unable to concentrate enough wind to give it any sort of real push from beneath, and it's continuing to head into that nose dive. It's only maybe 150 feet above now. 
LAURA: Is anybody getting off of the ship? Are they using the zip line? 
MATT: Yeah, the Kryn soldiers are trying to get across. However, the ship is now pulling down and the rope is starting to-- 
LAURA: That's why I'm saying: Xandis, drop lower! Drop lower! 
ROBBIE: It's pretty bad. 
TALIESIN: Once everybody's on-- How many people do we have on the rope at this point? 
MATT: Xandis. (groans) Only a four. Low rolls! The ship is trying to get lower, but at the speed it's going, the listing ship is now matching its speed. The rope is taut and you have the inclination that with any sort of shift and wrong movement in the ships, that rope is going to snap. 
TALIESIN: Do we have everybody on the rope? 
SAM: No. 
LAURA: No. How many people are on the rope from the-- 
MATT: Right now, there are four. 
ASHLEY: How many are-- 
TALIESIN: Keep moving, we have to cut it soon. 
LAURA: (frustrated groan) (sighs) I don't have any wind abilities. You're trying to lift it from below? 
MARISHA: I'm trying to, yeah, just stabilize it more than anything. 
TALIESIN: See if you can pick up anybody. Everyone we can get off that ship the better. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, because we'll eventually have to let it go. 
LAURA: I'll gave Verin and move him from-- I'll be flying back and forth on the broom to try to get people up and over. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Grog, I'm going to need you. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: All right. I'm trying to get the rope in any position where, when it snaps, we're going to be able to reel it in real fast, real hard and we're going to be using that one for that. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: I am not doing the pulling. 
TRAVIS: (whooshes cape) 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: The cape comes off. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (smack) Ah! (struggles) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Look alive, Percy! (laughter) 
MATT: All right. Verin's like, (Xandis) "It's already at terminal velocity! I can't quite keep up with it, not without losing our trajectory and the entire mission! I'm going to have to pull away!" 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: Just give it one more second. You got this! You're the best flyer I've ever seen in my entire life. I'm going to inspire him. 
MATT: Them. 
SAM: Them. Sorry. 
MATT: It's okay. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
SAM: Yes, you've just got to try. I'm sorry. One more try. I will sing to them to inspire them. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
SAM: ♪ Been thinking about me every day-o ♪ (laughter) 
SAM: ♪ Because of my sweet little lasso ♪ (laughter) 
SAM: ♪ Be inspired, baby ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ That sweet SS, yo ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: Xandis goes, "It's hard to describe why it's so uplifting, but I can't help but feel incredibly ready to go! All right, we're going to try going for it, but it's going to be a dangerous coin flip!" 
ASHLEY: Come on, Xandis! 
MATT: Continuing to follow alongside, (skyship rumbles) going quickly. You now emerge from the higher bit of the dust storm in the sky, which now you can see there's about 100 or so, 100, 150 feet below the bottom part of the clouds and the top of the fortress. Immediately, you get a glance of the war that is engaged around here. You, in a flash, can see thousands of soldiers surrounding the fortress from all sides, detonations, magically and otherwise, (echoing explosions) around, numerous shadows and creatures and other things streaking different ways, arcing flaming arrows coming off in clusters of hundreds heading towards the sky before being swallowed by some sort of vortex magically crafted on the other end. You can see, skittering around the outer walls, massive insectoid creatures, vidulches, that are climbing over and carving through the front lines of various military embankments as they push forward. You can see multiple defensive weapons and massive arcana ballistas and all sorts of strange, protective enchanted embankments all along the outside of this fortress. The towers themselves seem to be-- now you can tell the source of these strange dispelling devices that are glowing. There's these little orbs at the top of these towers that are (pulsing) building up to those streaks. This is a hellscape of destruction. You've been to the hells before, and this is the closest you've seen anywhere on Exandria to even evoke that memory in this moment. You hear the screeches and screams of familiar and unfamiliar and alien creatures all echoing throughout the landscape as numerous strange spells and death cries fill the air around you. (skyship rumbling) The ships are coming in quickly towards the bottom. Xandis is going to try for one final pull up from here and that's a d-- 
ASHLEY: Guidance. I'm going to go up to him and Guidance. 
MATT: All right, that's a d12-- 
LAURA: And a d4. 
MATT: -- and a d4. 
MARISHA: Come on, Xandis. 
MATT: All right, that's going to be a 13 plus eight, 21 plus three, 24, plus eight. That's going to be-- 
LAURA: Oh, that's great! 
MATT: 32. 
LAURA and LIAM: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: So Xandis, with that sort of a roll, instead goes, "I got an idea!" And as opposed to keeping up with it-- 
MARISHA: Do a barrel roll! 
MATT: -- rams into the side of the ship and impacts, not heavy enough to damage it, but enough to (bumps) knock it slightly off course. When it does, follow it to the side, the deck of the Key Breaker is now flush with the other. 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
LAURA: Run! 
MATT: The ones that were on the rope have already climbed up on the side, and the rest jump over the edge, and the arcanist, who is strapped in on the other brumestone, sees this happening and realizes-- 
LAURA: Go, go, go! 
MATT: "(panicked panting)" Cuts the rope and goes running right as the ship begins to pull away and is going to try and go and run for a leap to try and catch your arms before the two ships diverge. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: Get ready with my broom. 
MATT: Natural nine. They're not very-- 
LAURA: Can I to try to grab them? Catch them on the broom? 
MATT: All right, make an athletics-- No, no. That is a dexterity saving throw to see if you manage to quickly reach out and grab them before you lose them. 
LAURA: Dexterity save. Oh! 20! 
MATT: 20! Just barely catch them by the forearms. They dangle below the broom, trying to keep itself in the winds here. Not as heavy as the storm above, but still wild in the sky above. You clutch them. They look up at you, the youthful face of this, maybe early twenties adept, the youthful face of this, maybe early twenties adept, who was conscripted into this, looks up at you with this look of fear that then washes over into they're looking into the face of a beautiful legend and just are dumbfounded. 
LAURA: I've got you, darling. Let's go. 
MARISHA: Vex, are we clear? 
LAURA: We're clear! 
MARISHA: Ashari, pull back! 
MATT: You all withdraw and pull back at the ship as the secondary companion airship (whooshing descent) (explosion) scatters and explodes against the far western side of the fortress, slamming into one wall, crumbling it into the next wall, partially crumbling it before it leaves this flaming waste around it. Numerous combatants, uncertain of which side they belong to, are crushed beneath its rubble and flames. 
LAURA: That was going to happen regardless. 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Honestly-- 
MATT: But as your ship picks up, looking down, you're not too far from where the central portion of this fortress is. Where you see in the direction of where it is, a number of those towers encircle it that are all starting to (pulsing) alight. 
LAURA: Wait, what are we doing here, Xandis? 
MATT: "Well, apparently, I think we're about close to your off point. You should get the fuck out of here. I'm going to turn around." (laughter) 
MATT: "Lest we also become that and my second crash becomes a reality. Mages! You ready? Get them off the ship!" (laughter) 
MATT: The two mages go, (startle). They rub their hands together and look at all of you expectantly, waiting for your signal to just trust and go. 
SAM: Saddle up! 
LAURA: So we go? 
MARISHA: Is Allura there? 
LAURA: You want to get on the broom? 
TALIESIN: Certainly. 
TRAVIS: No. No, she's back there. 
MATT: Allura? No. She's-- 
TRAVIS: She's not with us. 
MATT: -- not on the ship. 
MARISHA: She stayed back. 
LAURA: She's on the ground level. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. All right. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
ASHLEY: Let's fucking go. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MARISHA: All right. Send us down. 
MATT: "No, you're going off the side!" 
SAM: Okay! 
LAURA: We're jumping off the side. 
MARISHA: I was talking to the mages! 
MATT: (laughs) Oh, gotcha. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Xandis shouts, the mages are like, "Right." They all look at you and, "You have to jump first, that's how the spell works." 
TRAVIS: I just grab Pikey in the back, and we're like-- (charge and leap) 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MATT: (laughs) You both leap over, arcing into the air. The rest of you following suit? 
LAURA: Right before I leap-- 
TALIESIN: Do we want to leap, not broom? Or do we want to-- 
TRAVIS: (mockingly) Do we-- (laughter) 
LAURA: We'll hold the broom and then leap and then, yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: Hold my hand? 
TRAVIS: Chardonnay or--? 
LAURA: Right before we leap, though, I'm going to invoke the Blessing of the Dawnfather and I'm just going to light up. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: (vibrant glowing) Awesome. 
LAURA: The gods are with us. (leaps) 
TALIESIN: (sighs) Help us all. 
ASHLEY: Get off the boat already! (laughter) 
SAM: I'm going to gallop across and just fall off the end. (laughter) 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (awkward centaur leap) 
SAM: (tumbling fall) (laughter) 
MATT: The mage on that far side's like, "Oh god!" Casts Feather Fall-- 
ASHLEY: When you biff it off the diving board. 
MATT: -- on the troop that is leaping. 
TRAVIS: (clumsy tumble) 
MATT: Watching as Grog and Pike, as you leap off the edge, it's like (leaping arc) off the edge, the ship now vanishes below and it's just the two of you over this ever sprawling site of destruction below. Plumes of smoke of all colors rising above you, flames and sparks and flashes. You begin to slowly glide down at a rapid, but safe pace. 
TRAVIS: I should have kept the cape on for this. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that would've been cool! We can just use mine. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: To the end, Buddies. 
MATT: At which point, you glance over your shoulder and see Scanlan's centaur form ass over the tea kettle floating as well. (laughter) 
SAM: (awkward neigh) 
TRAVIS: What are you doing? 
LAURA: Stupid. (laughs) (laughter) 
MATT: If you're still in your air form as well, you can easily glide off the edge without issue. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fine. 
LAURA: Lieve? 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Without a word, she just silently steps off into an eerie free fall. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: As it should be. 
MATT: The other mage is like, "(gasps)," catches you with a Featherfall and you all glide down. One of the purple defense cannons shifts in your direction. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: You have a better glance at it now. These are strange brass cylinder contraptions with a heavy seat. They look almost like the-- What were they called? The navigators in "Alien." The big old massive "Alien" scrapped ship with the guy sitting reclined. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: But it's just arcana spirals on it and you can see as he's-- It shifts around (massive turn). 
LAURA: Is there somebody manning it? 
TALIESIN: There's somebody manning it. 
LAURA: Is there somebody sitting in it? 
MATT: There's somebody inside with a protective shield and you can see a massive stone automaton that is actually turning it. It's not by controls. They're actually rotating it physically. As it spins this way, you watch as the coils (energy buzzing) light up purple (projective firing) and it lobs one of these massive sparks towards you and Pike. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: I'm not the one glowing gold over here. 
SAM: You've only got 300 hit points. 
ASHLEY: We're fine, we're fine! What is happening? 
MATT: Both of you make dexterity saving throws for me, please. 
TRAVIS: Not a problem. 
ASHLEY: No, that's fine. Guidance. Guidance for us both. 
LIAM: Are there multiple iterations of this type of weapon? 
SAM: I don't think you can. 
MATT: At a quick glance, you see maybe 30 of them around the stronghold. 
TALIESIN: It's a six-second action. 
LAURA: As we're on the broom-- 
ASHLEY: I know. 
TRAVIS: "Saving throw advantage on dex effects you can see while not blind." 
LAURA: Should we try to hit some as we fall? 
MATT: Yeah, you have advantage on that. 
LIAM: I was going to ask, from where we are in the sky, can we see a person in each of those from this distance or is it too far? 
MATT: The one that's nearest to you that's aiming at them, you can see a person inside. The others you do not see, but you can assume. 
TALIESIN: How far away is this would you say? 
MATT: Right now as you're descending, about 120 feet. 
TALIESIN: Only 120 feet? All right. Once this is over, I've got obvious plans. 
LAURA: Same. 
LIAM: Lieve utters a Word of Radiance and any creatures that I can see have to make a con save or take radiant damage. 
MATT: That is going to be 17. 
LIAM: (searching noises) New spell. 18. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: 18, all right. 
LIAM: So 4d6 radiant damage. Oh, that was good. 20. 
MATT: 20, okay. There's a flash in the odd cockpit of this strange arcane cannon, and while it's already released its payload, you imagine the person inside is currently hurting and will likely have to recover a moment before they can fire again if they're even still alive. 
LIAM: It's like a bug zapper. 
MATT: Indeed. So Pike, would you roll? 
ASHLEY: Natural 20. 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: Woo! 
LAURA: Okay! 
MATT: And Grog? 
ASHLEY: For 21. 
TRAVIS: 11. 
LIAM: Is that the first of the-- 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: With advantage? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah? 
MATT: Oof! 
LAURA: What'd you roll? 
TRAVIS and SAM: 11. 
SAM: He's going to lose some of his 300 hit points. (laughter) 
LIAM: Yeah, I gave myself 120 extra hit points, still way low below Grog. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Can I try to grab his, whatever those would be called, the straps? 
SAM: The cape holders? 
ASHLEY: The cape holders that aren't there and try to switch him around in the air. 
TRAVIS: Don't you have wings? 
ASHLEY: I have wings, but I don't think they do anything. 
LAURA: What do you mean? You can fly. 
LIAM: You fly. 
ASHLEY: I can't! 
SAM: You're Pike! 
LAURA: You have wings. 
SAM: Of course you can fly. 
ASHLEY: I think they're just there-- 
MATT: The blessing you have from-- We'll talk about this shortly. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, because-- 
LAURA: Your blessing-- Mine wasn't in either. 
MATT: But nevertheless, you dodge out the way. 
LAURA: You have to look it up. 
ASHLEY: Oh okay. 
MATT: Yeah, so you dodge out of the way. Grog, however, is a stone. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
ASHLEY: (grunts) 
MATT: You try and pull as much as you can, but it blasts into his side, sending him from a controlled descent to a (whirlwind), spinning. You, holding on are like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Like your parachute went out just slightly wrong and now the wind's spinning you around rapidly as you descend. 
TRAVIS: As I'm falling, is there enough time to go into a rage? 
MATT: Well, you were still raging from before. 
TRAVIS: Sure, that's right. 
MATT: You can hold your rage for as long as you want. 
TRAVIS: That's right. That's my secret, I'm always raging. 
MATT: (laughs) That is going to be 28 points of force damage. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful. Down to 14. Oh force, yeah, it's not-- 
MATT: Force you do not take half. 
TRAVIS: Not halved. 
LIAM: We're not leaving now. 
MATT: But you're both (whirlwind spin) now starting to spin out of control. The rest of you are carefully descending towards where you're hoping to go for the Key, but you watch as Pike and Grog (whooshing) just a little off course, landing back about two walls away, (plummet) dust plume as they hit in the middle of this courtyard. 
MARISHA: Can I help once again guide them from an air elemental perspective? 
ASHLEY: Maybe I can pull him a little bit in there since I got a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Oh, we hit. We're down. 
MATT: Natural 20 avoided you taking the damage as well. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, that's right. 
MATT: All right, make a spell save. Go ahead and roll d20 and add your spell modifier. 
MARISHA: Okay. Oh god. 11! 
MATT: 11. 
MARISHA: Level 20! 
MATT: I know, it's the dice roll. You try and catch them with the wind, but unfortunately, the blast set their descent a little bit off kilter and you're unable to quite help them as much as you'd like. They still impact about two-- 
ASHLEY: Blow us farther? 
MATT: -- walls away from the core. 
LIAM: Basically gods. 
LAURA: You hit the wall? 
MATT: But the rest of you see where they land not far behind you. Do you want to land where Pike and Grog are? 
ROBBIE: Are there any other soldiers outside of this dispel cannon that we can see enemies in the area or-- 
MATT: You see-- 
LAURA: Yeah, as we're coming down. 
MATT: -- hundreds of enemies scattered throughout the fortress grounds, along the tops of the walls, inside the courtyards, between the ruins, you see all manner of soldiers. Too distant to make out much detail, but you see fighting going on. You see, at this point, some of these walls have already been breached or figures have delivered themselves towards the core, not from above like you have. They're just starting to push into the center area and there is conflict already sparking all around and below you. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. We're descending together in our air elemental forms. I'll drop it as we're flying down. I'll go: I'm sorry, it was never my best form. I'll turn back into Cerkonos in his human form, and then you feel that extra density of his weight as he pulls his spear from his back, and tries to make himself go faster as he goes down. 
MATT: (rapid descent) 
ROBBIE: As he does, he picks one guard as close to the shooty thing as he possibly can. Right as he's falling, when he gets within 30 feet, I'm going to wing my spear at him. 
MATT: Go for it. As you're like (directed plummet) coasting down, the wind blasting past you. You see him in front of your gaze. He's not even paying attention to you yet. You see he has this nasty looking crossbow and the red attire of the Ruby Vanguard. 
ROBBIE: Oh, all right. 
MATT: What'd you roll? 
ROBBIE: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20? Yeah, that'll definitely hit. Doesn't even notice until all of a sudden he hears something and glances up just as you (forceful thrust) lob the spear. It strikes and then (sizzling) sizzling and burning. Go ahead and roll damage. 
ROBBIE: Cool. Oh! Eight, 10, 18. 
MATT: 18 points of damage. He is not a strong figure. As it hits him, it spears through him and pins him to the ground. He's embedded at the top of the wall where he stands. 
ROBBIE: If the spear reaches him before I reach the ground, I'll immediately do my Blink after my attack action. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
LAURA: Nice. 
ROBBIE: He zips out of existence and he lands on top of his spear, still holding onto it. 
MATT: So the momentum that would've splattered you against the top of that wall is negated as you instead apparate where the spear was, clutching it as the light leaves his eyes. 
ASHLEY: Cool! That is cool. 
TRAVIS: Get out of here. 
LAURA: Sick, sick, sick. 
TRAVIS: Dope. 
ROBBIE: Fun fight. 
TALIESIN: Do I have enough time falling down to take out Bad News? Oh, we're already going? 
LAURA: We have the broom. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: So we can slow our descent, and I want to help take out one of them, too. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a second to get a nice good look at that machine and see if there are any obvious weak points other than just the pilot. 
MATT: Sure. You'd have to probably get pretty close to-- 
TALIESIN: Well, I have the magnifier up to-- 
MATT: That's true. All right, make a perception check. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Perception or investigation, would you say? 
MATT: Actually, no. 
TALIESIN: They're fine. Either way. 
MATT: Well no, this would be arcana because you're trying to figure out if there are weak points in an arcane device. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MATT: You can see it okay, but this is at a glance to see if you can understand its function. 
TALIESIN: I'll take an arc-- 
LAURA: Can I help with that because I've got my Inquisitive Rogue ability so I can make an insight check against-- No, it's An Eye for Detail. I can use a perception check to look for a hidden object as a bonus action. So I could probably use it to hone in on something. 
MATT: So you make a perception check, he makes an arcana check, and between the two of you on that broom we'll see if you can discover something. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 18. 
MATT: 18. Okay. 
LAURA: Perception? 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: (searching tongue clicks) 22. 
MATT: 22, all right. First off, the person in the seat is currently trying, is in the process of wiping their eyes from ash and divine fire that scalded them within their seat. The source being from the great plummeting Lieve'tel. But you do see where they hold the device. There is some sort of a crystal orb that they're clutching in the middle, this polished marble orb that as they turn, they pull back and then they release it to fire what's there. You imagine that device, if it were damaged or removed, would make it inoperable. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a shot precisely at that with Bad News. 
MATT: All right. as you're arcing over to try and get a view perspective on it, the golem behind it is (rumbling) rotating it to follow you, but the person who's helming it is currently not quite ready to focus. I want you to make an initiative roll against the person who's in the seat to see if they clear their eyes to try and fire at you before you fire at them. 
MARISHA: Oh, I thought it was better. 
TALIESIN: Well no, it is. That's really good. Sorry. 19, 20, 21. 
MATT: Natural four, for a six. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Great. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: So yeah, roll for an attack. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend a point for advantage, just because I can. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
LAURA: I've got to pee so bad. 
TALIESIN: Here we go. Yeah, here we go. Spend it for advantage. Oh, almost amazing. That's 34 to hit I think, something like that. 
MATT: Roll damage on that. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA: Almost amazing. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Almost amazing. 
TALIESIN: One more and it would've been-- I crit at 19. 
LAURA: Oh man. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: d12. Where are my 12s? There you are. 
LAURA: So does Trinket, it must be-- 
MATT: Runs in the family. 
LAURA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: 19 points of damage. 
MATT: (shatter) It shatters in their grasp and actually the shards spread out and the person screams. "Ah!" as they get blasted with bits of broken marble. 
TALIESIN: I was also, just for fun, going to put in 1d6 of lightning damage from the cloak and actually see if I can make it even a little worse. 
MATT: Sure, you arc and then they get shocked in place. 
TALIESIN: Just a little. 
MATT: The golem continues to spin them-- 
TALIESIN: Five more points of electric. 
MATT: -- but the device is inoperable. 
LAURA: Sweet. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
ROBBIE: Sweet. 
MATT: With that arc, you land, as well as the Ashari and the rest of your troop to gather around the site where Grog and Pike have impacted. Not enough to take damage, but enough to hit the ground, Grog catching her and your feet (banging) impacting the ground-- 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MATT: -- crater slightly as it does, and as you all stand up and look, you can see the massive, jagged walls of the Tishtan fortress that was risen and reformed by the Weave Mind to protect the Malleus Key. The multi-level tiers themselves jagged with spikes of metal that jet out the sides. The ancient dust and sand still clung to it in places. You can see parts where it's broken off and different levels set. You can see the ruins between it rising up as crumbled stonework still seems to hold tight in places. One of the large towers erupts from the nearby rock where it pulses a glow where that strange Dispel bolt had originated in multiple other places previously. Around you, the sounds of battle commence as dozens of soldiers on both sides seem to be immediately battling around you. And that's where we're going to come back after the break. (groaning) 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
TRAVIS: We're in the shit. 
SAM: We're in the shit. 
ASHLEY: We're in it! 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. Oh my god! 
LIAM: This is it! 
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll see you shortly. 
TRAVIS: Ooh!

(epic music) (mysterious music) 
MARISHA: Oh, hi. Sorry, I must've nodded off for a moment. As you may have heard, we're just getting started with tons of new content, and of course our Daggerheart Critmas Live show, on December 7th in Not-Quite-Philadelphia. It's just over the bridge in Jersey. But it's been a lot of work, and honestly, it can be exhausting. But, you know, with 2025 and our 10 year anniversary just around the corner, we're not planning on slowing down. Oh no. In fact, we are just getting- 
TALIESIN: Things are heating up. 
MARISHA: No, no. That's not what we're saying. 
TALIESIN: Things are heating up. You wanted live shows, and you're getting live shows, starting this April with a live show in, drum roll please. 
MARISHA: No, I'm not- 
TALIESIN: Don't care. Chicago. That's right. We're returning to the Windy City for a very special event, where you, the audience, gets to choose whom your adventurers are. Selecting from your favorite campaigns: one, two, and three. So mark your calendars, because it all goes down Thursday, April 10th, 2025 at Wintrust Arena in Chicago, Illinois. Things are just- 
MARISHA: Getting started. 
TALIESIN: Heating up. 
SAM: The adventure continues. You heard me correctly. You're probably wondering why I'm upside down. Well, it's because I'm training. Training for an adventure down under! (grunts) That's right, Australia. We heard your requests, we've seen your fan videos, and we're taking the gang abroad with not just one, but two Australian shows this summer. Or is that your winter? I don't know how your country works. But what I do know is, we're coming to your neck of the woods on Thursday, June 19th, 2025 at the ICC Sydney Theater in... Sydney And then Wednesday, June 25th at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. Think of these shows like a double header, which is like a hockey term. Matt's cooking up an adventure where two of our main campaign parties cross paths in a pair of entirely separate, but narratively connected one shots. Tickets for both shows are available down under me, right there. So slip another shrimp on the barbie, because- 
MARISHA: We should probably stop with the Australian stereotypes. 
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, I think they call them prawns. 
SAM: Oh, slip another, anyway. I have no idea how Australia works, but I have a few months to figure it out, as do all of you. Because after we tour Australia, guess what? 
MARISHA: We're just 
TALIESIN: Heating up 
SAM: The adventure begins. 
LIAM: The hits just keep on rolling. 
MARISHA: No, you guys can't all make up new catchphrases. 
LIAM: Oh, yes, we can. Because the Critical Role cast will be rolling into Indiana on August 2nd, 2025 at the Fishers Event Center, just outside of Indianapolis. As you may have heard, Daggerheart will be releasing early next year, and this will be our first one shot set in the world of Exandria, utilizing Daggerheart as our game system. So get planning, 'cause 2025 doesn't end in August, which means the hits just keep... 
LAURA: We're just getting started. No, we did that one already. Can we go again? 
LIAM: Oh shit, yeah. Which means the hits just keep on... 
LAURA: 'Cause these dogs are off the leash. That works, right? Someone let these dogs out, and we're barking our way to the Big Apple in October. We're coming to Radio City Music Hall New York, New York, on October 7th. It's the final stop on our massive, globe-spanning 10-year anniversary live show tour. And what's the Radio City Music Hall show gonna be about, you ask? Well, remember when Fjord proposed at the London Live show? and Jester was like, "Yes, I will." Well, you're all invited to the wedding of the century. Move over Royals, there's a new power marriage going down. Five brand new live shows. And we still have tickets left for the upcoming Daggerheart Christmas show. Critmas show, in Camden, just outside of Philly. Critmas. That's six live shows around the globe, all in the next 12 months. And a lot of these will also include appearances by your friendly neighborhood CR cast. 
MARISHA: That's us. (laughs) 
LAURA: At conventions like C2E2 and the New York Comic-Con. The New York Comic-Con. Stay tuned for more information about that later. 2025 is gonna be the biggest Critical year yet. And as always, Beacon members get early access to tickets. So strap in and strap on because... 
LAURA: The dogs are 
SAM: The adventure 
LIAM: The hits keep 
TALIESIN: We're just 
TALIESIN: Heating up! 
MARISHA: We're just getting started. 
LAURA: These dogs are off 
LIAM: The hits just keep 
SAM: The adventure begins 
MARISHA: We're just getting started. 
TALIESIN: Things are heating up 
MARISHA: You guys. It has begin. 
(bright music) (cheerful holiday music) (mysterious music) 
18 points of necrotic damage, bringing him to two points of health. Heera, make a Wisdom saving throw. 17. A feeling that seems unrelated to the events in the chamber overcomes you. The hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You get that sensation once again that there is somebody with their eyes on you. Afraid to meet their gaze, Heera simply says, "Help my friends, and I'll give you whatever you want." 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. (gasp) Could anything be more perfect? Ooo so comfy cozy. The cuteness! It's overpowering. Check it out. Look. It has pockets. Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself. Oh my gosh, it's so amazing. This is a lot of stuff, you guys. We have so many cool things right now. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
You fought well, princesses. But you didn't think winning the throne was gonna be that easy. Did you? [laughter] No, no, no. Midnight draws on. But this battle is just getting started. [laughter] I can't wait to see how this turns out. 
KLAUS: In play, it felt so good. MOHAMAD: Everybody's engaged at the same time. ALISON: The Hope and the Fear mechanics are a wild role-playing ride. MATT: The game is called Daggerheart, our own fantasy tabletop RPG we've been developing. It's a unique 2d12 dice rolling system that ensures that every roll of the game has some sort of impact on the game itself. DANI: It really fosters that collaborative role-play aspect. DARIUSH: Character building lets you do your own thing and organically be like, "Actually, I'll take a little of this, a little of that." CAI: You can be an unlikely combination of things. The Hope and Fear mechanics to me really feel more like the score of a good film. NATE: Mounting fear, just added a different layer of tension to the game. HANNA: The tactileness is really exciting for me. I just feel very represented in this game. EVAN: I would absolutely play again. TRAVIS: Daggerheart is fun as hell to play. RICH: I absolutely love Daggerheart. MATT: It's going to be something real special and it's just the beginning.

(posh orchestral music)
TALIESIN: (British accent) This week on "Critical Roadshow," we've traveled to one of several sets in the Critical Role studios. This particular set is where "4-Sided Dive" is filmed, along with other famed productions, such as that one Critmas Promo, that other Critmas Promo, as well as several other promos. We've brought in our finest antiques dealer to evaluate and appraise items that have been brought in from every corner of the building. We go now to our first item. 
MATT: As I understand, there's an interesting story about how you came into possession of these items. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I was playing a game of street dice in Macau, and the stakes got pretty high, I almost lost some fingers, but I didn't. And, you know, I came out on top. Won a Soviet submarine. No big deal. 
MATT: This is a rare find. These keys, user manual, and, most importantly, signal beacon, are from the Shchuka-class Project 671RTM. And while they had a payload of Zircon hypersonic and Onik anti-ship missiles, they were never able to provide an exclusive Discord, pre-sales for live events, or 10% off merchandise. I'd appraise a functional military sub of this era at about $400,000,000. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! It is docked in Vladivostok right now, but I'm going to go pick it up and bring it back here. No problem. Yes! 
MATT: Truly a rare find. So what do we have here? 
JARED: Well, I heard that you're giving away tons of cash for people who bring in cool stuff, so I brought this. 
MATT: Is that a photo of Kevin Beacon? 
JARED: I'm sorry, did you say Kevin Bacon or Kevin Beacon? 
MATT: Wonderful actor. Classic photo and signed. However, unlike a Beacon membership, it does not provide instant access to all new content. So, I'd estimate this between $6 to $7. 
JARED: That's it? Okay, fine. I'll take the money. 
MATT: Oh, I don't buy any of the items. I just estimate their value. 
JARED: And you get paid for this? 
MATT: Yeah. 
JARED: Wow. I need to become a voice actor. 
MATT: Truly a rare find. Now, this is a truly exciting discovery. 
TRAVIS: (sad and offended noise) 
MATT: This beacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich is exquisitely crafted, beautifully designed. While you can enjoy a meal like this for a few minutes, a Beacon membership unlocks thousands of hours of entertainment, now available on desktop and mobile. 
TRAVIS: I'm trying to eat my lunch. 
MATT: Truly a rare find. 
TRAVIS: (intimidatingly chews) 
MATT: And what do we have here? 
MARISHA: Yeah, you said you needed stuff with the word "beacon" on it, so, I found this prop from an old Beacon promo. 
MATT: Ah, yes. Beacon promos are great and well-written content. But Beacon also has a number of original series such as "Re-Slayers Take," "Critical Role Cooldown," and "Crit Role Abridged," as well as more to come, all available when you have membership to Beacon. I'd value this record at 75 cents. 
MARISHA: Okay. I think you can dial it back, sweetheart. 
MATT: Truly a rare find. And what did you bring? 
SAM: What? No, I didn't. I'm looking for Jared. He took my signed Kevin Bacon picture? I signed it myself. Jared, no? Not ringing a bell? He's our Junior Lorekeeper. Jared. Jared, I think. Maybe. I'm gonna say, Jared. 
MATT: Truly a rare find. Now, this may be the find of the day, a Beacon membership. (chuckles) May I hold it? 
LAURA: Yeah. Just be careful. 
MATT: Of course. Of course. (sighs happily) The craftsmanship, the design, the understated beauty! A Beacon membership is only $5.99 a month, but is absolutely priceless. Truly irreplaceable-- (glass shattering) 
LAURA: Dude. 
TALIESIN: Well, that was most interesting. But please do become a Beacon member because the poor sap who wrote this has added this text to the teleprompter to say that they will get sacked if this ad doesn't do well. The end. The end? Who writes "The End" at the end of a teleprompter feed? Don't let whoever did that touch the teleprompter ever again. Worst writing ever. God! Jeez.

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, players, come to the table, please, and we will jump into this mess you've arrived in. (murmuring) 
TRAVIS: Whoa! (laughs) No way! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What?! 
MARISHA: It's big. 
TALIESIN: I'm waiting, I'm waiting. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to wait, too. 
LIAM: That's a lot of miniatures, Matthew. 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
SAM: Oh shit! What the heck?! 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Oh man! 
ROBBIE: (grunts) 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Friend or foe-- 
ROBBIE: My goodness. 
TALIESIN: -- I'm going to murder everything on this board. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
ROBBIE: Mamma Mia, what is happening? 
TRAVIS: (cackles) 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: That's so many miniatures! 
ROBBIE: Yo! 
LAURA: This just got so real. 
ASHLEY: That is-- 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: So many miniatures. 
TRAVIS: Matt, this looks so good. 
ROBBIE: It doesn't even fit in the frame. 
MATT: To set the stage here-- 
LAURA: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: This is one of the dispel towers. 
LIAM: Yeah? 
MARISHA: One of them. 
TRAVIS: Which one is it? 
MATT: Right here. 
SAM: That's not the Malleus Key? 
MATT: Pike and Grog landed here. 
LAURA: That's not the Malleus? 
LIAM: That's not the Malleus Key. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit, we're-- 
MATT: The Malleus Key is this way. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
ASHLEY: We haven't even made it to the Malleus Key yet? 
MATT: No, because Pike, because you guys landed kind of off center. 
LAURA: Because you guys fucking suck! 
ASHLEY: Damn it! 
SAM: How are we going to complete this mission in less than an hour? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) (laughter) 
MATT: So Pike and Grog have landed here. You guys can place yourselves in their vicinity as to where you would want to be-- 
TRAVIS: Look at that big boy! 
MATT: -- before we end up rolling initiative here. 
LIAM: Holy shit! 
MATT: But there are three main troops here, is how I'm categorizing it. There are some allies of yours scattered amongst, it's up to you to try and suss out who's what. Things with red colorations generally mark themselves as Vanguard, as well as of course for Reilora. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
MATT: Where would you like to be in this vicinity of Pike and Grog who just landed here. 
TRAVIS: Look for allies. Look for minis that might be allies immediately. 
LIAM: Past it all. 
TRAVIS: Get eyes on them. 
LIAM: Past it all towards the Malleus Key. 
ROBBIE: Is that the guy in the top, in the shield that you hit? 
MATT: No, that was off that way. 
LAURA: I can't tell who's ours and who's not. 
TRAVIS: Who do we think that is? 
LIAM: We got a bunch of these jumping-- 
LAURA: Those might be ours. 
ASHLEY: It looks like somebody we know. 
MATT: So you're floating down at this pace. 
LIAM: Okay, you got a Kryn there. 
MATT: Where do you want to land? Oh my gosh. 
MATT: You tell. Where'd you say you wanted it? 
LIAM: Oh, you're asking me first? 
TALIESIN: There's a pulse of anti-magic, right? 
MATT: Well, you said you wanted to land past-- 
SAM: Is that Carmen Sandiego? 
LIAM: No, I was being a dumbass. 
ASHLEY: That one's got to be good. 
MATT: (laughs) More or less. 
LAURA: Those look like good people. 
LIAM: I want to land at the end. 
TALIESIN: There she is. 
LIAM: No, I don't know where I want to land yet. 
MARISHA: So we pick where? 
TRAVIS: God, it is-- 
MATT: Whereabouts in this vicinity do you want to land based on how you were all coming down? 
LIAM: Shit. 
MARISHA: I was trying to help them. So I imagine I would be near them, wherever makes sense. 
MATT: Are you maintaining your elemental form? 
LAURA: I'm staying on the broom. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm still air elemental form as of right now. 
MATT: Here. While you guys figure this out, I realize I need to get the air elemental mini out. 
LIAM: You don't necessarily need the air elemental mini. 
SAM: You almost did. 
TRAVIS: (snarls) 
MARISHA: Ah! 
LAURA: But we can't pass fast if both of us are on it. 
TALIESIN: I'll drop off, then. 
MARISHA: Delayed reaction. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'll just take my-- Yeah, I'll drop. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Probably against the wall. Because I have Spider Climb still. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what is this again? 
LAURA: That's a dispel tower. 
TRAVIS: Dispel tower. 
ASHLEY: So we have to get rid of that? 
SAM: Probably. 
LAURA: Probably. 
ROBBIE: But the one that you were targeting-- 
ASHLEY: I want to touch it. 
ROBBIE: -- is it somewhere else? 
ASHLEY: Does it zap? 
SAM: Your sleeve, Ashley! 
TALIESIN: That's a different machine. 
TRAVIS: Your sleeve is going to know over these minis. 
TALIESIN: That's a whole different machine. 
ASHLEY: I'm watching, I'm watching. 
ROBBIE: A different machine? 
ASHLEY: I was just leaning it up. 
TALIESIN: It pulses out anti-magic. 
ROBBIE: Oh, okay. Not the one that was targeting shit. 
SAM: Are we on right now? 
TALIESIN: If you have spells up, this thing will knock them down. 
LIAM: Yes. Yes. 
SAM: Hey, by the way, everybody, this combat is brought to you by WizKids Minis. 
TALIESIN: Actually, I'll come over here. 
SAM: Bells Hells Minis. Unpainted miniatures available now. Bring Bells Hells to your tabletop with new upcoming unpainted primed minis. Get them today at your local game store or wizkids.io/crunpainted. 
MATT: That'll be Cerkonos and this will be Keyleth who is a larger elemental because she is of the Air Ashari. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: That'll help designate. 
TRAVIS: Those are dope. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. So with you both off the side at the moment. 
TRAVIS: All right, you guys, you go ahead. Pike and I got this. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'd love to be stuck right behind here. I've got Spider Climb, so. 
MATT: You do, but you're descending with Vex on the broom. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Wait. All right, so that's too far to the right? 
MATT: Huh? 
TALIESIN: Now, I'll go on the-- 
MATT: You both can fly where you want off to the side. Just let me know whereabouts you want to be right now. 
LAURA: I think Percy wanted me to drop him off. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Hopping right over there. 
LAURA: Before I flew back up. 
MATT: Okay, got it. And Percy would be right about here. 
TALIESIN: I'll do it. Yeah, I got it. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: This is insane. 
LAURA: I would be-- 
LIAM: Holy shite. 
LAURA: -- probably floating up. 
TALIESIN: Look at my boy. My pretty boy. 
MATT: You're floating up-- 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: About there? 
LAURA: That sounds good. 
LIAM: Oh, it's the Vex miniature. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Oh! 
ROBBIE: It's so cool. 
MATT: All right, who is next? We have two air elementals. We have a Centaur-Scanlan. 
SAM: Sure, yeah. 
MATT: Where would you like to be? 
SAM: I don't know. I guess-- 
TALIESIN: Stuck on the tower at the top. 
SAM: Foot of the stairs, maybe? 
MATT: Right here? 
LIAM: ♪ Stuck in the middle with you ♪ 
MATT: There's currently two figures right there who look like they're in the middle of battle. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: So you descend, catch yourself and then (clopping) onto the ground. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Lieve'tel? 
LIAM: Oh, my gosh. I'm going to wait and trail behind the two behind Cerkonos and the Tempest and land near them. That's what I'm going to do. 
MATT: Well, they're flying. 
LIAM: Oh, they're hovering. They're not coming down? 
MATT: They're air elementals. They are, but you are falling-- 
LIAM: Past them. 
MATT: -- rapidly but safely. 
LIAM: Understood. 
MATT: Which means you have a little less-- You're gliding a parachute, essentially. 
LIAM: Now I understand. Okay, so then I will fall like 20 feet back from Grog, Pike, and Horse-Scanlan. 
MATT: Like right about there? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: You got it. 
SAM: You can just call me Scanlan. 
LIAM: I don't think I can do that. 
MATT: All right. Then the two air elementals over here. The two Ashari, where would you like to be? 
ROBBIE: Well, I had dropped my form when I speared that dude. 
MATT: Oh, that's right, you did. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. So I think-- 
MATT: You would've speared him probably up over here would be where it was. 
LIAM: Did you make me a little Wednesday Addams miniature? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. I like that. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: (awe-filled sigh) 
ROBBIE: Somewhere near the-- 
MATT: So you just speared the guy up there. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Okay, cool. I'm good with me. 
LIAM: She's got a mini. 
LAURA: Oh gosh. 
ROBBIE: That's sweet. 
LIAM: She's got a real mini. 
MATT: And landed right behind you, as you land, you hear heavy impacts and look and see a Reiloran Juggernaut currently in the middle of brawling with a Vasselheim Judicator. 
SAM: Are we sneaking? 
TRAVIS: Where's the Judicator? Point it with your finger? The Judicator, point with your finger? 
MATT: Right there, and is currently getting flanked. 
ROBBIE: Look at that bad boy. 
MATT: There's another one up there. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. So those are ours? 
TRAVIS: Well... 
LIAM: Well, this dude's surrounded. 
MATT: Both of them are surround. 
LIAM: They're all in the mix. 
MARISHA: Oh, can I plop down-- Does this look like Reiloran or-- 
MATT: That looks Reiloran. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: That's the trouble. 
SAM: Where's the other Judicator? 
MARISHA: Do you have my fire elemental mini back there? 
LIAM: I don't know. I can't-- I don't know about over here. 
ROBBIE: But that's the Judicator there. 
SAM: Okay. Got it. 
MARISHA: You can also still use that. 
MATT: I can get a fire elemental mini. You can turn into too many things, Keyleth. But that's okay. 
MARISHA: Yes. I know. That is a problem. 
TRAVIS: This is known. 
MATT: Do you want to land and then transform into a fire elemental? 
MARISHA: Yes. As I come down, I ignite and switch to my fire elemental form. 
MATT: Are you going to stay in fire elemental form for a little bit? 
MARISHA: For now. 
MATT: I'm going to go get that. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: You're going to make him get another one. 
MARISHA: I mean-- 
ROBBIE: He only pulled one for me! 
SAM: All these guys bad guys here? 
TALIESIN: So you're double teaming. 
MARISHA: Get the earth elemental while you're at it! 
ROBBIE: It's literally the one thing I can see back there. 
MARISHA: Is your one elemental. 
ROBBIE: Is my one fire elemental. 
TALIESIN: So we'll be both going at this one. 
MARISHA: Oh, are you up here, too? 
TALIESIN: I'm right here. 
MARISHA: Oh, fantastic. Yeah. That's great. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Whoever gets up. 
ROBBIE: I'm not in the biggest one. 
MARISHA: In fire elemental form? 
TALIESIN: Sure, you are. 
ROBBIE: I am the smaller air guy. 
MARISHA: Just, you know, I'm a bigger air guy. 
ROBBIE: I saw it. I got a little tiny guy. 
MARISHA: Yeah. But you know? 
LIAM: But if you were two fire guys, you'd be the bigger fire guy. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: For sure, bro. 
MATT: All righty. So as you descend over this way you land. 
MARISHA: I'm assuming you have my earth elemental back with you? 
MATT: I do have that one at the moment. 
MARISHA: Okay, good. (laughs) 
MATT: I had your classics already, but you also can turn into a lot of things and there's a few I missed. That's on me. 
MARISHA: I know. I'm sorry. 
MATT: No, it's on me. All righty. So now we've all chosen our places. Roll initiative! 
ALL: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: No, not you! 
SAM: ♪ (singing) ♪ 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: Let's go. 
LAURA: (cackles) Oh shit! 
TRAVIS: Ah, to have advantage on initiative once again. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god! Shit! Fuck! 
TALIESIN: It was a 20. 
TRAVIS: Fuck you! 
TALIESIN: -- for half a second and then it went, "No." 
ROBBIE: I'm going to make it flat. 
LAURA: Natural 20. 
MATT: Natural 20 for--? 
LAURA: Plus seven. 
SAM: Also natural 20. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
SAM: Plus three. 
MARISHA: Wow. Wow! 
MATT: All right. Vex. 
MARISHA: What's happening? 
MATT: Anybody above 23? All righty. 
MARISHA: What did you-- No! 
TALIESIN: So what's the order so far? 
MARISHA: Druids, baby. 
LAURA: Vex, Scanlan. 
MATT: All right, so 23 to 20. 
TALIESIN: 20. 
MATT: 20? All righty. 
MARISHA: Okay, so wait, so you guys went-- 
TRAVIS: Vex, Scanlan, Percy. 
MARISHA: Vex, Scanlan, Percy. 
MATT: All right. 20 to 15. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MATT: 17 for Grog. 
MARISHA: 16. 
MATT: Keyleth? 
TRAVIS: Spell it with a G. 
LAURA: You said anything with red coloration, looks like it would be bad guys? 
MATT: I tried to mark-- 
ASHLEY: That looks like a lot. 
MATT: The Vanguard attire is very red themed. 
LAURA: Okay, so this whole group right here is bad guys. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: I'm going to go for them. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: 15 to 10. 
LIAM: 13. 
MATT: 13. 
MARISHA: Keyleth, Lieve'tel. 
MATT: All right. 10 to five. 
SAM: Where's Cerkonos? 
ASHLEY: Six. 
MARISHA: He's here. 
ROBBIE: You shut the fuck up. 
LIAM: Smelling like a one. 
MATT: Five to one. Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: So check me: Vex, Scanlan, Percy, Grog, Keyleth, Lieve'tel, where's Pike? 
SAM: Pike, after Lieve'tel. 
MATT: Vex, you are up first, with Scanlan on deck. What you got? 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast-- 
MATT: There's a whole mass of slithers here that are running with the figures over here. You all descended and visually arrived in this place and you could see a lot of these troops are now swarming over in this direction. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at 4th-level. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at 4th-level. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Warm it up. 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Warm it up. 
LAURA: I'm going to activate my blazing bowstring. 
LAURA: I'm going to activate my blazing bowstring. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Yes. These words, I've heard these words in a past life. 
LAURA: I'm going to use Sharpshooter. So negative five to the attack. 
MATT: Awesome. 
LAURA: I'm going to aim-- How many things is in five feet of that guy? I can't tell how many because of the big guy. 
MATT: This guy? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Three. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: There are four in five feet of this guy. This guy would hit the most. It'd be five guys you would hit with this, but you wouldn't hit the big guy. 
LAURA: Right. I want to hit the big guy first. 
MATT: Okay, so you want to hit him and get three in that range? 
LAURA: And three in that range. Okay. 
MATT: You got it. All right. So roll for an attack against him, against that Reiloran Juggernaut who's like (slamming), and rushing towards Grog and Pike. 
LAURA: That is 21. 
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
LAURA: Great. Okay. Okay. I got to figure this out. 
SAM: Grab my hand. 
LAURA: Okay, so that's 12. Would this be a sneak attack? 
MATT: No. Because he did see you approaching. He's not next to a friend. 
LAURA: All right. That's fine. 12, three lightning. Then he needs to make-- Oh say-- wait, wait, wait, wait. 22 plus three lightning. 
MATT: So 25. 
LAURA: Then he needs to make a dexterity saving throw and all of those creatures within five feet. 
MATT: He fails with a seven. So it does 1d10-- 
LAURA: 4d10. 
MATT: 4d10 damage. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: So roll damage and I'll roll for each of those guys. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: That's incredible. 
LAURA: Two. Sorry. 
MATT: Scanlan, you're on deck. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Three and four. Ooh. Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo! 
SAM: I wasn't paying attention. Who's Laura going after? Them over there? 
LAURA: 32. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Extra points. 
MATT: 32 points. 
LAURA: Oh, plus another 10 for the blazing bowstring. 
MATT: That's true, yeah. So 42. 
SAM: You can move, right, Grog? 
MATT: 42 and then those three there. Fail-- 
SAM: Because I'm going to take all these guys-- 
MATT: -- fail-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: -- and fail. 
SAM: I want you to hit something. 
MATT: All them take-- 
LAURA: 32 points. 
MATT: Those three. Like as the arrow hits, (impacts) (explodes) it explodes into this massive sphere of sharp, magically enhanced wooden spikes that jut out in the air. All four of those entities (groans) fall the ground. The guy in the middle who took the hits is starting to look pretty weathered already from the first two hits. The creatures around him all look pretty dang hurt from just the blast radius of that. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: That was your first attack. 
LAURA: That was my first attack. I'm going to try to hit him again. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LAURA: Also with Sharpshooter. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: That definitely hits, that's 17 plus-- 
MATT: Oh yeah, go for it. 
LAURA: Okay, so that is-- Jesus Christ. 
TRAVIS: Malleus Key is that way. 
MATT: This way. Yeah. 
LAURA: Seven plus nine is 15 plus three is 18 plus 10 is 28. 
MATT: 28. 
ASHLEY: Excuse me. 
MATT: He's looking real hurt. (impacts) (groans) He falls to one knee almost and gets up and is like (snarls). His jaw with the sharp teeth opens up and you can see his head armor that covers his eye. He looks like a brutal warrior who's now taking the pain and turning that into fury and he's getting ready to charge forward in your direction. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. Do you want to move or stay put? 
LAURA: I'm going to move a little forward to where if I fall, I'm not going to-- Well. I'm going to fly over this way. 
MATT: How far? 
LAURA: There towards you. 
MATT: Over there? 
LAURA: No. Above him. I'm going to go towards the stairs. 
MATT: Okay. Over here? 
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to kind of parallel. There. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I want to end up there. 
MATT: There you go. 
TRAVIS: I love it. 
MATT: All righty. Releasing arrows. Scanlan, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Got a lot of high powered friends. 
SAM: Okay, I will-- (coconuts clacking) (laughter) 
LIAM: What's your movement now as Horse-Scanlan? 
SAM: I don't actually know, we never talked about it. Right now it's 25, but I don't know-- 
MATT: No, the speed of the horse is 50. 
SAM: Nice! Then I'll go towards that rock and then bank right a bit. As I go, I will inspire Cerkonos. 
ROBBIE: Oh, baby. 
SAM: Yeah, that's good. 
MATT: You can get there. Cerkonos, you inspire, so d12 and your ready. 
ROBBIE: A 12? Oh. 
MATT: Level 20 bard, baby. 
SAM: Yes. I will sing to you. I will sing ♪ C-E-R-K-O-N-O-S ♪ ♪ Light it up ♪ you're hot to go ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: We got there. We got there. (clamoring) 
ASHLEY: Bit of a stretch! 
MATT: You rush past this guy out of his melee range and as you go by, he glances over, and ignores you and keeps-- Now you notice he's wailing on the nearby Vanguard figure there. 
SAM: He's a good guy. 
MATT: That guy right there with the massive shield and sword, he seems to not be against you. 
SAM: Don't kill that guy. Then I will cast Reverse Gravity on all those people. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (clamoring) 
MATT: Damn! 
ROBBIE: Damn! 
ASHLEY: Let's do it. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Yes. I'll hold out my hand and say: ♪ There's some horse ♪ in this house ♪ ♪ There's some horse ♪ in this house ♪ (cheering) 
MATT: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Bring it back, baby. 
LIAM: Oh man! 
MATT: Holy shit. 
LIAM: The king is back! 
TRAVIS: (cackles) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: "The king." 
TRAVIS: There's some horse. 
LIAM: Wow. 
MATT: God. Okay, so was the DC on that? 
SAM: 22. 
MATT: 22. All right, I'll start over here. 
TALIESIN: There's a problem down there. 
MATT: I'll start on the Reiloran Juggernaut. 
TALIESIN: There's a problem down there. 
MATT: Reiloran Juggernaut rolled an 18. Failure. That other Blade Warden, failure. 
LIAM: Get wrecked. 
MATT: That one there. Failure with a three. One in the middle, sorcerer. Two, failure. Next to it. 17 plus three is 20. Failure. 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
MATT: The gentleman with the staff. 19 plus three. 
SAM: Oh, 22. 
MATT: 22. 
SAM: Meets and beats it. 
MATT: Meets and beats it. One guy manages to make it. The guy with the shield fails. The two in the front fail with a three, and a two fail. All but one fail. So you watch as suddenly every single figure but this one all get flung straight up into the air. How far up in the air? 
SAM: It says a hun-- ♪ Oh ♪ Oh wait. Top of the cylinder. 
MATT: They are all-- 
SAM: It's a hundred feet. 
MATT: -- just floating way up here. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Amazing. 
LIAM: 10d6 fall damage. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Should you choose. 
SAM: Should I choose. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: I'll leave them up there a bit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: They're all (rapid rise) floating in the air now. 
TRAVIS: (dramatic screaming) 
SAM: Although they're sorcerers, so they might be able to spellcast. 
LIAM: Oh, I love casters! 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: This guy goes over here. 
TALIESIN: That's actually a really good reason to drop. 
MATT: He reaches down and grabs onto an old root that stuck out of the ground and holds it and his legs go up, and he's still holding onto the ground. The spell is still happening, but he's holding tight. 
SAM: Gotcha. 
MATT: All right, that's your movement, a spell. 
SAM: That's it. I'm done. 
MATT: Bonus action. You're good. All right, end of your turn. The third troop over here is going to go. They are all going to dash. They see that happening that way. They're going to run-- 
MARISHA: Take the guy out next to me first. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: -- up this way and get into battle with a Kryn troop over here. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we're trying to get that way. 
SAM: A single trooper? 
TRAVIS: No, it looks like-- 
MATT: No, there are multiple ones and a few other allies-- 
LAURA: Kryn troop? 
MATT: -- in the area. 
TALIESIN: They're a big problem. 
MATT: This guy's going to leap. This guy has-- 
LAURA: Is that a Juggernaut? 
MATT: Yeah, the Juggernaut's going to leap, but it's going to take his whole move and action to do that. This guy's going to stay back and start casting. 
LAURA: What the fuck is that? 
MATT: A few of them get up to there. Here's what I'll say. Someone roll for your allies, I'm going to roll for them. We're doing mass rolls here to not take up too much time. 
TRAVIS: I'll roll for an ally. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Just one or all of them? 
MATT: Roll 1d20. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
TRAVIS: Oof, nine. 
MATT: Natural three. (excited exclaiming) 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: So, I'll say back and forth between the three there in between, averaged out, half of that would be three. So you watch as three of the standard soldiers here get cut down-- 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: -- by the Kryn soldiers. 
LAURA: That's good. That's good. 
MATT: The Vanguard figures get cut down as the Kryn are (flurrying blades) an absolute whirling blade storm in front of them. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: The Juggernaut lands behind and they get worried, glancing over their shoulder, but they are trained warriors at the front. They haven't even noticed your presence yet, they're trying to carve and fight through to open enough of a path for you to keep going. But that's going to finish that troop's go. Percy, you're up with Grog on deck. 
TALIESIN: All right. Well, I'm going to hop over the ledge here. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Boop! 
TALIESIN: Flip right up, and I'm going to flank this, yep, this poor person for a second. 
MATT: Okay, as you step over, you see your first experience engaging with a Reiloran. As you step over the wall, you see this red-fleshed humanoid creature, thin, long arms dressed in robes, chains hanging from a headdress. As it looks around and spins towards you, its black shark-like eyes and sharp teeth, you immediately feel pressure in your brain. What are you doing with your turn? 
TALIESIN: I've felt pressure in my brain before. 
MATT: That's true. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: En garde! I'm going to tap my walking stick that I pull right off, and suddenly hundreds of tiny little razors appear all around the shaft going up and down. I'm going to take three quick slashing attacks at advantage. 
TRAVIS: What?! 
MATT: Three or four? 
TALIESIN: Three! I'm holding that fourth to see what happens. 
MATT: Okay. Got it. Let's go. 
TALIESIN: All right, first one is nat 20. (excited exclaiming) 
MARISHA: Let's go, baby! 
MATT: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I don't get a lot of the gun advantages, but I think I get a grit point back? No, I don't. Well-- 
MATT: On a crit, you get a grit point in general. 
TALIESIN: All right. So that's-- 
MATT: I'll double check. It's fine. We'll go with it, why not? 
TALIESIN: I'll go with it. That's 1d8 plus seven. Where's my d8s? I really should have this together. Here we go. Hmm! 
MARISHA: Ho! 
TALIESIN: That's eight, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 points of damage. 
MATT: 23 points of damage. Oh, by the way. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm? 
MATT: Before I forget, make a wisdom saving throw for me, please. 
MARISHA: You have an advantage. 
TALIESIN: I do. Thank you. ♪ Da da-da da-da ♪ 
TRAVIS: Because it's a Reiloran? 
MATT: A particular kind. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use one of my things to reroll. 
MATT: Indomitable? Roll one more. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: You don't roll the advantage, you just roll one more dice. 
TALIESIN: Well, I rolled a 19 and a 20, so... 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. 
TALIESIN: I'm fine. 
MARISHA: Jeez Louise! 
MATT: Okay. Yeah, so-- 
TALIESIN: I'm back! 
MATT: As you step over the wall and start doing this with your staff, you feel these whispers attacking your brain, like some sort of, that pressure your brain becomes: (eerie, tangled whispers) It's like something is trying to push its way through your thoughts. But you resist it and continue to strike. So that was 22 points of damage on your first strike. You have two more to swing at it. 
TALIESIN: I was born for this. Second attack is 15, Second attack is 15, 28 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. (laughs) Welcome back to level 20, y'all. 
TALIESIN: Man. 
TRAVIS: Razor blade walking stick. 
TALIESIN: Yep! 
TRAVIS: Is this new? 
TALIESIN: 13. Yes. 13. 
MATT: 13 points of damage. All right, third strike. 
TALIESIN: Third strike. 18, 28, 29, like 31 to hit. 
MATT: That hits, yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Here we go for the next. 13 points of damage. 
MATT: 13 points of damage, all righty. So three strikes on it, and it takes the slices, (breathy snarl) and it looks like it's showing some wear and tear, but it's not on death's door or anything. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: But it's bleeding. It's also flanked between you and the fire elemental. 
TALIESIN: Five, 10, 15. This is about 15 feet, I would say? I'm clever. I would know. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's about 15 feet? 
MATT: More or less. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. After three slashes, I take it back and I go for a stab. 
MATT: Mm-mm. 
TALIESIN: Then I pull the trigger. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Of your sword? 
TRAVIS: What?! 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: Your sword has a gun? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: You have a gun sword? 
TALIESIN: I do! 
ASHLEY: What?! 
LIAM: Old man Percy. 
TRAVIS: A gun sword?! 
LAURA: Of course it does! 
TALIESIN: A gun cane! 
MATT: This is Percival de Rolo! 
TALIESIN: A gun cane. 
TRAVIS: Gun cane. 
SAM: Gun X Sword. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: A peppercane. 
MARISHA: A peppercane! 
TALIESIN: I'm burning a point for a pushing attack. 
MATT: You got it. Okay. 
TALIESIN: I can do that in a second. 
LIAM: Cool. 
MARISHA: Ooh, push it into me. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the plan. 17-- 
LAURA: Excuse you? 
TRAVIS: That's what she said. 
TALIESIN: 17 plus, it's 20, 32 to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. That hits. 
LIAM: Your monocle expands and becomes a saw blade. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah! Terrible. That's just eight points of damage. 
MATT: Go, go Gadget pepperbox! 
TALIESIN: But-- 
MATT: Eight points of damage. Strength save. 
TALIESIN: But it also means they make a strength save I believe versus 20? 
MATT: 11. 
TALIESIN: Yep! 
MATT: It's pushed 15 feet. 
TALIESIN: 15 feet through a fire elemental, I might add. 
MATT: Yes. Are you going to let it pass through you or are you trying to block it? 
MARISHA: No, it's going to pass through. because he catches on fire. 
MATT: Indeed. Okay. So he goes (forceful shove) gets blasted backwards through you, catches fire, and is now currently burning. 
LIAM: You will pass through fire. 
MATT, SAM, and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: All the way through and should drop, in theory. 
MATT: He does, he drops. Then starts floating in the air. 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! Cool. 
TRAVIS: These motherfuckers. 
MATT: As the Reiloran Thought Eater itself-- 
LAURA: These motherfuckers can fly. 
MATT: -- glides up. 
LIAM: ♪ Too many mother 'uckers ♪ 
TALIESIN: Click, click, reload. 
LIAM: ♪ 'Uckin' with my shit ♪ 
TALIESIN: Put the stick back, and then I'm going to take a little bit of a defensive stance right there. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: Was he engaged with the fire elemental creature, or is that an ally, too? 
TALIESIN: That's Keyleth. 
MATT: That's Keyleth. 
TRAVIS: Oh. Fucking, okay. 
MATT: So, ally. Maybe. 
TALIESIN: Plus fire damage, also. So yeah. That's everything! 
MATT: Roll insight. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh no! 
MATT: Grog, you're up, with Keyleth on deck. 
TRAVIS: Who's that? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Could you give me a distance check from the magic user that saved the Reverse Gravity? Is that 50 feet from Grog? 
MATT: That is probably about 50 feet, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Great! Can I run over there-- 
MATT: Yeah, it's just 50 feet from you. 
TRAVIS: Can I jauntily-- (heavy breathing) I got a question! Want to die? (battle cry) I'll take a swing. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) "Then I'll just take a swing." 
MATT: So he's holding onto a root and his legs are up in the air and he's clutching, gravity is pulling him up. 
LAURA: Oh, don't run into it? But it's Grog. 
MATT: You run and rush-- 
SAM: It's Grog! 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MATT: -- and as you pull the axe in, your feet (gravity reverses) out from under you. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! (laughs) 
MATT: Make a strength saving throw for me. (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I have advantage on these. 
MATT: You do, because you're raging. 
TRAVIS: 27. 
MATT: 27. You catch the same root that he's on. One hand on the root, the other hand on your axe. He's like, "(nervous noise)" You're both floating mid air there. You can still take your attack. 
TRAVIS: (strained, struggled grunting) (shouts) (laughter) 
MATT: Go for it. 
SAM: Don't let go of your axe! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: This is standard rage or is this-- 
TRAVIS: This is, yeah, this is-- 
MATT: -- a frenzied rage? 
TRAVIS: No, persistent, but not frenzied. 
MATT: Okay, got it. 
TRAVIS: Not the third. 
MATT: Got it. 
TRAVIS: This is, oh my god, that's 23, 33 to hit? 
MATT: 33 hits. 
TRAVIS: I should have made it Great Weapon Master, that's so dumb. Can I make the second one Great Weapon Master? 
MATT: Yeah, go ahead. 
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. Let's do that. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Bow ♪ 
LAURA: ♪ (random scatting) ♪ 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 12, 28 minus five. 23 to hit? 
MATT: That hits, yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: All right! Great. 1d12 plus... 10, 15-- [furniture rattles] 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: -- 19-- 
MARISHA: Did you pull a Taliesin? Is it the seat? 
ROBBIE: It's the seat! 
TALIESIN: That's what we're calling it now? 
MATT: I think that's what it, yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: 23 points of damage on the first one, but four points are necrotic because of the axe. The second one. Oh sick! 12 plus 10, 22, 26-- 
TALIESIN: He's also going to have resistance to something. 
TRAVIS: Oh, and six! 32 points of damage. Six points necrotic. 
SAM: Damn! 
MATT: So this is my favorite visual so far in the battle. You carve into him once, pull back, and a second time you hit him, his body lets go because he ragdolls. You killed him, but the gravity sends his body (whooshes) up into the air. He ragdolls-- 
TRAVIS: Just a blowing piñata. 
MATT: (whirling body) (body thuds) Way over there! 
TRAVIS: But does he also spray all his good crimson everywhere? 
MATT: Oh yeah. But he's full arms, legs out, like the poor raccoon that got chucked by the monkey. He's just (flailing). 
TRAVIS: Now I'm hanging from this root-- 
MATT: Now you're holding onto this root. 
TRAVIS: -- my feet up in the air! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Fuck! I forgot how this magic works, Scanlan! 
SAM: Sorry! (laughter) 
MATT: That finish your turn, Grog? 
TRAVIS: That's it. (laughs) 
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up. 
MARISHA: Okay! 
LAURA: Oh, but if you stand up you could catch him with your axe when you come flying back down. 
TALIESIN: Fuck this motherfucker up. Or whatever you're going to do. 
MARISHA: So he technically took 1d10 damage as soon as he entered into my shit. 
MATT: Right, you didn't roll damage for that yet. 
MARISHA: By catching on fire, so I haven't done that yet. So seven fire damage and he is on fire. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That Reiloran. 
MATT: He's looking pretty hurt now. 
MARISHA: The fact that he's-- He is? Can I jump and do a combo attack? I've got reach with him. 
MATT: Yeah, I'll allow it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to vault off. 
MATT: You could leap to this next lower platform over there, if you want to. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's sick! Yeah, let's-- 
MATT: Catch him as you're leaping down with reach. 
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to do my multi-touch attack. 
SAM: Ooh, boy! What the fuck are those things? 
MARISHA: That's good. Okay. 
ROBBIE: Where? 
SAM: Those little heads. 
LAURA: Oh, those little critters. 
SAM: I didn't even see those! 
LAURA: I was trying to hit them. 
LIAM: They're the little-- 
MATT: Those are slithers. 
SAM: You hit a bunch of them, right? 
LAURA: I hit three of them. 
MATT: They're all hurt pretty bad. 
LAURA: They're almost dead. 
LIAM: They're alien doggies. 
MARISHA: 22 and 20. 
MATT: 22 and 20. Both of those hit. 
MARISHA: Beautiful. Okay, the first one is 11 damage on the first one. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Nine damage on the second. 
MATT: All right. You reach up as you leap in the air, the first flaming slam strikes him and he burns even further and spins around, trying to focus on you, but the fire's getting in the way of his face. You land on the platform, reach both your arms out and strike with a double elemental clawed strike. As you do, his body immediately incinerates and he crumples to the ground, a burning pile of cinder. 
MARISHA: (laughs maniacally) Can I tell if these people over here are with us? 
SAM: One of them is Opal. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Shh! Shh! 
TALIESIN: Not clear. 
MATT: Looking at one of them, one of them is dressed in Kryn armor and the other is dressed in reddish leather armor, and they look to be in the middle of a conflict. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I got 10 temporary hit points with the kill. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: So, just to confirm, above table, we are going to move this way. We're moving with haste. 
SAM: Yeah, and kill all the people in red. 
MARISHA: And kill all the people in red. So I've got 50 feet of movement. 
MATT: Mm-hmm? 
MARISHA: Can I run through her space as I haul this way? 
MATT: Yeah. She'll get an attack of opportunity on you. 
MARISHA: That's okay. 
MATT: You can definitely do that. 
MARISHA: ♪ Dee dee-dee dee-doo ♪ She's on fire. 
MATT: 50 feet will get you right about there. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: (laughs) (flames bursting) Ignited. 
MARISHA: So wait, that's-- 
SAM: Matt, is the sand, is that corn meal or sand? 
MATT: No, that is actual sand ballast you get from hobby train stores for terrain. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
SAM: Nice. 
MARISHA: She took a point of fire damage. That's not a lot, but she is on fire now until otherwise. 
MATT: That's good to know. 
TALIESIN: ♪ Bow-now ♪ 
MARISHA: Then, yeah, moving my speed as far as I can in this direction. 
MATT: Another 50 feet? 
MARISHA: I can move-- 
ASHLEY: 50 feet? 
MARISHA: I can move 50 feet total. 
MATT: Right. Well, you leapt down to hit it. So 30 feet will actually put you past them there, or 50 feet will get you there, then you can move the rest of your 50 feet to get over about here. 
MARISHA: Great. That sounds good. 
MATT: All right, so you move up to there. You see back there, there is some sort of a, it looks like a robed figure who's in the process of casting a spell that's enhancing the weapons of other Reilora who are currently battling the Kryn on that side. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: But that's what you get. All right, ending Keyleth's go, it is now, well, it would be the Thought Eater's turn, but it was just slain. 
TALIESIN: Thought Eater? 
SAM: Whoa. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: That brings it to Lieve'tel. 
LIAM: Quick question. Rule question. So my beads of prayer, those beads are used-- 
LAURA: Beads of love. 
LIAM: -- as a bonus action, but could I use one as a bonus action and one for my action? Since they're bonus actions? 
MATT: Generally bonus action is a bonus action from a rule standpoint, but what are you trying to do with it? 
LIAM: Well, I can cast something where I can do-- Well, here's what I want to do. Forget the question, I'm going to stride forward so that I get past Pike, so that I am within close range to Pike, Horse-Scanlan, and Grog. 
MATT: 30? That's your 30-foot movement. 
LIAM: Okay, that's fine right there. Within... 
TRAVIS: I can't believe I ran right into-- 
SAM: That's Grog. 
ASHLEY: That's amazing. 
MATT: It's perfect, Out of the gate. 
LIAM: I'm 30 feet from Pike, Horse-Scanlan, and Grog, right? 
MATT: You are-- Grog is just out of your range. 
LIAM: Just out? Could I have gone on a diagonal, so that I was a little more-- 
MATT: Unfortunately, no, because even at the biggest diagonal, he's one space away from you. Your movement's slightly under. 
LIAM: Okay. So instead what I'm going to do is use a bonus action to grab one of the beads that hangs from her wrist-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: -- and summon a massive three-headed white raven using Planar Ally. 
MATT: Okay! 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: Let me see what I got back here for that! (laughs) 
LIAM: That's a bonus action. 
TRAVIS: Three-headed white raven? Awesome. 
LIAM: It's a Planar Ally. 
TRAVIS: Cool! 
MATT: Here, I'll-- 
TALIESIN: Do you have anything Planar? 
MATT: I'll use a griffon for it. 
LIAM: That's great. That's great. 
MATT: I'll use a griffon for that. 
LIAM: I love that. 
TALIESIN: This is so dumb! 
MATT: Where do you want it? Where's a good place? 
LIAM: Close enough to me to scoop me up. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh cool! 
LIAM: My command to it is to usher me over this din as we make our way to the champion. 
LAURA and MARISHA: ♪ Makin' our way ♪ 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
MATT: Okay. So you helm this creature. All right. So it's summoned. When does it take its turn? 
LIAM: Oh, that's a great question. Rule of thumb-- 
SAM: Okay, next turn. 
LIAM: Oh no, I don't know. 
ASHLEY: Do we want to attack the tower? Or are we just trying to get out of-- 
ROBBIE: There's also something-- (whispering strategy) 
LIAM: (rapidly reading spell description) 
LAURA: Where? What? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, but I don't know if it's good or bad. 
LIAM: "As a rule of thumb, a task can be measured..." 
TALIESIN: What color are their robes? 
LIAM: "If the task were aligned--" I don't know that it says it in here. 
MARISHA: Oh, I see. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ROBBIE: I don't know if good or bad. 
LAURA: That might be good. 
MATT: Okay, you know what? Roll initiative for it, if you don't mind. 
LIAM: Okay. You got it. 
TALIESIN: Purple might be Kryn. 
LAURA: Yeah, I think that's Kryn. 
MARISHA: Yeah, purple. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
LIAM: That is-- 
LAURA: I think it's Kryn. 
LIAM: -- a 12. 
MATT: A 12? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Okay then, yeah, so it goes right after you. That was probably the best possible option you could. 
LIAM: Okay. Then I will, I wanted to Bless Grog, but instead I will Bless me, Pike, and Horse-Scanlan. (shouting playfully) 
LIAM: Oh, I died! 
MATT: Well, here's the thing. Does the item say lets you cast a spell through it? 
LIAM: It says you can-- I don't know what it says. It says-- 
MATT: Let me see the item? 
LIAM: -- that as a bonus action-- Yeah, hold on. 
MATT: Sorry, because there is the-- 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: -- the turn-by-turn action economy. 
LIAM: Here. 
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you doing? (laughs) 
ROBBIE: I'm looking. 
MATT: Okay, I'm sorry. 
LAURA: These ones are with the Judicator. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Then there's these fellas up here, fighting, I think, Kryn soldiers. 
LIAM: If the economy doesn't work, I will just take the Planar Ally. 
MATT: You can cast it as a bonus action, so in doing this, you're casting the spell. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Which means as your action, you cannot cast another level spell, you can do a cantrip. 
LIAM: Then I will stay on, I will just take the ride. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: You can still do a cantrip if you want to hurt something or do another-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Sacred Flame or something like that. 
LIAM: Sure. I will Toll the Dead. 
MATT: The ones that are nearby that are injured are these three slithers and that-- 
LIAM: I'll hit the big boy. 
MATT: Big boy? All right. What's the save? Is it constitution? 
LIAM: 19. It is-- ♪ (humming) ♪

SAM: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: It's great. 
MATT: We'll see how long it lasts. 
TRAVIS: This is fucking great. 
LIAM: Okay, spells. Toll the Dead. 
MATT: Constitution, I believe. 
MARISHA: Toll the Dead! 
ASHLEY: Toll the Dead! 
MARISHA: I'm just think of Jester. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
LIAM: Wisdom. Wisdom save. 
MATT: Wisdom. Okay, great. Well, he rolled a three regardless. 
LIAM: A three. 
MATT: So yeah. So, roll that. 
LIAM: So it's 4d12 since he's injured already. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Correct, so it is d12. 
LIAM: So higher, 12. One, two, three. Mm, nope! And four. Okay, nine, 14, boo, 15.

MATT: He's like, (aggressive stance) and he sees Scanlan charging up and he's now bloodied, angry. Roars and rushes forward, and as you leap onto the back of your summoned ally, you focus outward with the hanging bell in your hand. As the bell rings, ting, ting, ting, ting, he goes-- (crunching crumbles) 
ASHLEY, LAURA, and TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: You watch beneath his armor, his eyes (bursting splatter) and he-- 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MATT: -- falls down, destroyed.

LAURA: Percy, are you good back there? Do you need help getting farther? 
MATT: Do you want it to dash? 
TALIESIN: I'll take some distance, if you have it. 
MATT: Or do you want to stay above in that space? 
LIAM: I think that I will hover over the Tempest. 
MATT: Okay, so you will dash and move over here? 
LIAM: Yeah. It doesn't need to be directly above, but yeah. Within range. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. All right, that finishes your go. Now, this first troop that just lost its juggernaut is going to go. All of these slithers (rapid slithering) swarm in around Scanlan. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
ROBBIE: Oh boy. 
MATT: (slithering) 
SAM: There's enough of me to go around, boys! 
MATT: Also, this one moves over here. Over here. You are now swarmed by seven slithers. 
TRAVIS: Scanlan! 
LAURA: Those things are tough. 
MATT: All right. So-- 
SAM: I've had giant sperm attack me before. It's okay. (laughter) (laughter) 
SAM: I don't mind it. 
MARISHA: There it is. 
SAM: High in protein! 
MATT: First one's going to attack you. That's going to be a 13 hit. 
SAM: Miss! 
MATT: Furthest one. Next one. Ooh, that's going to be a 23 to hit. 
SAM: Hit! 
MATT: You take, and this is straight damage here. It's going to be 14 points of piercing damage-- 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: -- and you are grappled in its vice bite. 
SAM: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
SAM: Jesus. 
MATT: The other ones do extra damage to one that is grappled-- 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: -- with their shredding jaws. 
MARISHA: Shit. 
MATT: All right, so the next one's going to attack you. There's five more. 
SAM: Five more! 
MATT: That's going to be a 12 to hit. Misses. 
SAM: Misses. 
MATT: Next one. Natural one. Oh my god. 
SAM: Amazing. 
MATT: So three more. 
SAM: (whinnies) 
MATT: That's going to be a 24 to hit. 
SAM: Hit! 
MATT: You take 21 points of piercing damage. 
SAM: And I'm double grappled. 
MATT: The last two, 15 to hit. 
SAM: Miss. 
MATT: And natural one! Jesus Christ. Okay. 
SAM: Yes! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: I'm slippery! 
MATT: But now one of them has you in its jaws and it's langolier-style, its teeth are grinding into you while multiple other ones are snapping and pulling at you, like a massive piranha frenzy. That finishes their go. Okay. There's this (thrums)-- 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: -- this weird vibration in the air, and you can't help but glance up. The top of this-- 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: -- begins to glow that weird light blue-white color, and for a second, you swear you see the mystical shape of some sort of ceremonial, armored, high-crested, robe-covered Reiloran, with weird symbols and shapes of its armor and its crest behind it. Some extremely-- 
LAURA: We got to take that out. 
MATT: -- powerful looking ghostly image of some massive ancient Reiloran there. As it hovers in front of it, you see it lift its hands as it glows brighter and brighter. Something is psychically operating that remotely. 
SAM and MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: And it is now (thrumming). 
SAM: So we do have to take it out. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: It's beginning to go. It will have until the next round before it fires. 
LAURA: Oh, jeebies. 
MATT: The secondary troop over here-- 
MARISHA: Where? 
MATT: Up here, (laughs) flails. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Roll for heart attack? 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Okay, so Reverse Gravity. Yeah, they're just up there. They got nothing to hold onto. 
LAURA: They're just up there. 
TRAVIS: (claps) 
SAM: Yay. 
ASHLEY: They're just up there. 
LAURA: They're just up there. 
ASHLEY: Hey guys! 
TRAVIS: How large is the area that you affect? 
SAM: It's up to 50 feet, or it's a 50-feet-- 
TRAVIS: Circle? 
SAM: -- circle, right? It's not a 50-foot radius, is it? 
LAURA: Wow, that's a big radius. 
MATT: It's a 50-foot radius. 
SAM: Radius?! Oh god, that would've gotten-- 
MATT: Yeah, that would've been good to know. 
SAM: -- a lot of stuff. 
LAURA: That's a lot more. 
TRAVIS: Oh-oh. 
MATT: 50 foot would've been-- 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: -- from where you placed it-- 
TRAVIS: Everybody going up. 
LAURA: Well, Lieve'tel would've avoided it. 
MATT: Hold on, 50-foot radius would've been from there. 
SAM: I would've put it-- 
MATT: You would've put it somewhere else, right. 
SAM: So that it wouldn't get me. 
MATT: Right. So-- (laughs) It's not going to hit any of these guys, but it's definitely going to affect Keyleth, and Lieve'tel technically is flying, so the gravity isn't affecting her too much. 
SAM: What about these two? 
MATT: They would also be affected. 
MARISHA: That's actually-- 
MATT: They make it. The one that's currently on fire actually rolls a 23. 
SAM: Oh, so they're fine. 
MATT: Okay. And a 24. They actually are both holding onto the edge and still fighting, but they're starting to lift off the side awkwardly. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Keyleth, would you mind rolling a strength saving throw for me, using-- 
MARISHA: I get advantage on magic effects. 
MATT: You do, and-- 
MARISHA: And what? 
SAM: Garbage. 
MARISHA: Oh, is my ellie? 
MATT: It's your strength. 
MARISHA: My ellie's-- 
MATT: Your elemental's, yeah, strength. 
MARISHA: Probably doesn't matter. 
ASHLEY: Ellie! 
LAURA: Wouldn't you have run around it, though, if you'd have known it was up? Because you made that run after he already cast it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: You're uncertain of what the radius would be necessarily. 
LAURA: That's true. 
SAM: It's not visible. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure I fail. 
MATT: Okay. So you are now floating 100 feet up in the air. 
MARISHA: Wee! 
TRAVIS: Hey! 
SAM: Can't you fly in that form? 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's honestly not a big deal. If anything, this might be better. (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Now, does a fire elemental have flight? I don't think-- 
MARISHA: No, it doesn't, but-- 
MATT: Just consider yourself 100 feet up with those guys. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Consider yourself ♪ 
MATT: There you go. 
LAURA: ♪ 100 feet in the air ♪ 
LIAM: Can I ask a question? 
MATT: Sure. 
LIAM: I just started looking at all the stuff for Planar Ally. It's really up to the DM's discretion. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: So it just needs to be a celestial. It could be a planetar, it could be a deva, it could be-- 
TALIESIN: I got to see this little problem we have over here. 
LIAM: -- solar, deva, or a planetar. Planetar and deva are a little more OP. Solar is massive. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: So maybe do you want to do a deva, which has 136 hit points? 
MATT: Yeah, let's do deva stats. 
LIAM: That seems the right size to me. 
MATT: So, deva stats. You got it. All right, so that finishes their go. Those troops are caught up here, they can't do anything. That's starting to glow. Pike, you're up, with Cerkonos on deck. 
ASHLEY: Okay! Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right. 
MARISHA: Let's go, Pike. 
ASHLEY: All right, so-- 
LAURA: Where are you, Pikey? 
ASHLEY: Back there. 
MATT: Pike is over here. 
ASHLEY: Bonus action. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to start with, am I-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: I don't care. 
MARISHA: I'm just trying to figure out what to do. 
ASHLEY: Am I within 60 feet of Scanlan? 
MATT: You are definitely within 60 feet of him. 
ASHLEY: All right, so I'm going to cast-- 
LAURA: ♪ It can only be Scanlan ♪ 
ASHLEY: -- Shield of Faith on Scanlan, which gives you +2 to your AC. 
TRAVIS: Wow. That's why I went to her. 
SAM: Honey. 
LAURA: Did you? 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: +1 to your AC. 
ASHLEY: +2 to your AC. 
TALIESIN: No, I was just being an asshole. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Because you have a low AC. Then I am going to cast Guiding Bolt. 
TRAVIS: There we go! 
LAURA: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: There we go! 
ASHLEY: To get Pike started. 
MATT: Now, those are both-- 
TRAVIS: Everybody take a shot. 
MATT: Those are both leveled spells, right? 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can't. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh shit. 
SAM: Ashley's back.
ASHLEY: Hang on. I know. (laughter) 
MATT: Sam! 
LAURA: Fuck you, Sam. 
ASHLEY: I torry! (sorry) Okay, wait. Shield of Faith is a 1st-level. Oh, I see what you mean. 
MATT: Yeah, so you can do a cantrip, if you'd like. You could do Sacred Flame or-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's right, that's right, that's right. Okay, so then what I will do-- 
TALIESIN: Hmm, interesting. Okay. 
SAM: You don't have to get me. It's okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. See you later. 
SAM: (laughs) We broke up. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: We did, we did. 
MATT: So no more on him? 
ASHLEY: So no more on him. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: So I am going to cast-- 
MATT: He's got it. He's fine. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, Guiding Bolt at the ball. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Right there? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at-- 
MATT: What level? 
LAURA: Get it! 
ASHLEY: Get it, get it, get it, get it. 
SAM: The ball doesn't have a butt. 
MATT: So this is the-- 
SAM: Can't go up the butt. 
LAURA: I know. 
MATT: -- Everlight special. High-level Guiding Bolt. 
ASHLEY: Everlight special. 
TALIESIN: It's all cheek. 
MATT: (radiant boom) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it-- 
SAM: Just one big cheek. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I will do it at 5th-level. 
MATT: 5th-level. All right. Roll for an attack. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: That gives advantage on the next attack? 
ASHLEY: It does give advantage on the next attack. Should I go higher? 
MARISHA: No. Save your spells. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's what I was thinking. Okay. 19. 
MATT: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, all right. So, we got-- 
MARISHA: It's a ball. 
ASHLEY: All right, help me with math. We've got, I think it's eight. 
TRAVIS: How many what? 
ASHLEY: 8d6. Okay, so we've got-- 
LAURA: Here's some more d6. 
MATT: Those are such small dice. 
ASHLEY: I have dice. 
MATT: Every time. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: I like it. It's cute. 
ASHLEY: Should've used yours. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
ASHLEY: 17. So that was-- 
TRAVIS: That was five. 
ASHLEY: So I do two more? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Ugh, what balls. 
TRAVIS: 22. 
ASHLEY: 22. 
MARISHA: What balls? 
TALIESIN: Qua? Qua balls? 
MATT: You blast it, (booms) and the energy shimmers for a second and it looks like there's a scuff and a bit of a crack to it. It looks damaged, but not deeply damaged. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: But there is now that glowing, it's already giving off its glow, but now there's a bit of Everlight-guided flamelike golden glow that's pulling attention from your allies towards it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So that's your action. Do you want to stay put or keep moving? 
ASHLEY: I'll just try to tuck behind. 
MATT: Over here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, behind the--

SAM and TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yes, let's go! 
ROBBIE: But I can, at 4th-level, I can cast it not just as a wall, but I can make a radius up to 20 feet. So since they're in a perfect circle, I'd like to cast it perfectly around Scanlan. I'd like to cast it perfectly around Scanlan. Literally on the tops of the heads of these guys. 
MATT: Right. 
LIAM: Yes! 
ROBBIE: But then I can also control-- 
LAURA: Can you still get that other guy? 
ROBBIE: Well, I think so, because I can control what side of the damage comes from the wall. So where normally you would think it would be inside, it would be to the outside. 
MATT: Right, no. Pike is right here. 
ROBBIE: (sighs) 
ASHLEY: It's okay, it's okay. 
SAM: She's strong, she's strong. 
ASHLEY: I'm very strong. 
LAURA: She's fire resistant. 
TALIESIN: She's also fire resistant. 
MATT and SAM: She's fire resistant. 
ASHLEY: I'm fire resistant. 
SAM: She had to be married to me. She's strong. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. You're fine, You're fine. I knew I would be getting it. 
ROBBIE: Okay, I'm going to do it. 
ASHLEY: I knew getting close I would be-- 
MATT: (flames erupt) Wall of Flame shoots up around it. 
MARISHA: Hell yeah. 
ROBBIE: Oh, and it's a, sorry, it's a 19 dex, and then halved if-- 
MATT: Right. You're casting at 4th-level, so 5d8? 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll-- 
ROBBIE: d8. That's 5d8. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll 5d8 damage. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby. 
ROBBIE: Okay. Oh, not bad. Five, nine, 14, 20, 27. 
MATT: 27. 
LAURA: On all those little-- 
MATT: Fail. 
LAURA: -- sperm? 
ROBBIE: All the little guys, yeah. 
MATT: Fail. 
TRAVIS: Two failed. 
MATT: Fail. 
TRAVIS: Three fail. 
MATT: The three that were already injured from Vex incinerate as the Wall of Flame-- 
TRAVIS: (Italianish) That's a hot meatball! 
MATT: -- shoots up around. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Destroyed. This falls over. This guy is still here. Right there. That's fine. The other ones-- 
ROBBIE: Don't hurt my boy. 
TRAVIS: Do it, all out. 
ROBBIE: No, no. I don't have to. 
MATT: Fail. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MARISHA: Come on. 
MATT: Fail! 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
MATT: Fail. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: I'm rolling dead 10s this whole way. This last one here, natural 20. One of them does make it for half damage. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: One scrappy little bastard. 
ROBBIE: Of course. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: This isn't so bad, right, guys? 
TRAVIS: Timmy, Tommy, Johnny, Bonnie, and Brandon, talk to me! 
MARISHA and LAURA: Guys? 
TRAVIS: Brothers! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: So they're all (engulfing flame) charred and quite injured, except for one of them took a little hit, but they're still there in the middle of the flame wall. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: That's your action. Do you want to move at all? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. How far am I from Scanlan? 
MATT: From Scanlan, you are about 40 or so feet from him. 
ROBBIE: 40 feet. 
TRAVIS and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
ROBBIE: All right, then I will use my Blink staff, because it can cast magic and I'll teleport right down next to Pike. 
MATT: Do you have to hit something to Blink them, or you just do it? 
ROBBIE: What'd you say? No, no. It just happens. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MATT: Great. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. I'm going to double check, but-- 
TALIESIN: That's fine. Okay. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: (whooshes) You appear right next to Pike. 
TRAVIS: He's so badass. 
MATT: Spear at the ready. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Then I would say-- Yeah, I can just do it 30 feet. 
MATT: Great. 
ROBBIE: Unoccupied space. Then because I'm so scared for Scanlan, I'll just let it drop. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: I'll let the Wall of Flame go. 
MATT: (flames dissolve) 
SAM: Oh. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
SAM: What just happened? Cerkonos, how did you get there? 
TRAVIS: What if other baddies come running up? 
SAM: Don't worry about me, man! 
ROBBIE: I'm not going to Forcecage you, I promise. 
SAM: Impress Lieve'tel! 
MATT: (laughs) That finishes your go? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that's it for me. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Did she see? 
ROBBIE and SAM: Did she see? 
SAM: Yeah? 
TALIESIN: She did! 
SAM: Don't worry about me! 
MATT: Top of the round. Vex, you're up, with Scanlan on deck. 
LIAM: She's actually the exact opposite of the tower and can't see anything that just happened. 
SAM: Goddamn it! 
ROBBIE: No! 
SAM: Cerkonos, what are you doing? 
MATT: (laughs) That's amazing! 
LAURA: All right, I'm going to shoot at the ball. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to shoot at the ball! 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT: Go for it. 
LAURA: I get advantage, right? Because it's lit up. 
LIAM: Work the ball. 
MATT: You do. 
LAURA: Can I do-- 
TRAVIS: I'm going to break the ball better than you! 
MARISHA: (laughs) I was like, that's one of our lines, right? 
LAURA: I'm going to do Sharpshooter. 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: Oh, natural 20! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Vestige! 
MARISHA: Let's go, bitch! 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Queen shit. 
MATT: Roll damage on that crit. Let's see what you do. 
LAURA: I mean, it's not a lot, because I don't have any extra shit. 
LIAM: When you say I'll do Sharpshooter-- 
MATT: You said Sharpshooter though, so it's extra-- 
LIAM: -- are you adding the extra damage to it? 
LAURA: Sharpshooter adds just a 10 regardless. 
MATT: Plus 10. It doesn't double the 10-- 
LAURA: It doesn't double the 10. 
MATT: -- because the modifier's after the crit. 
LIAM: On top of a crit, though. 
MATT: Yep. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: That was the doggest shit of a roll. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Wow. Is there anything else I'm adding? Am I doing Sneak Attack to it? (goofy laugh) 
MATT, TRAVIS, and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Nah. 
LAURA: (groans) (laughter) 
LAURA: It's not like he saw me coming! 
TRAVIS: The tower? 
MATT: It's-- 
LIAM: You're floating in the sky. 
MATT: It's not a creature you can sneak attack, unfortunately. 
LAURA: Whatever! 
MATT: It doesn't have any vitals to strike at. 
TRAVIS: The tip is always very sensitive. 
LAURA: 15, 25. 25. 
MATT: You're right. 25 damage? 
LAURA: 25 damage. 
ASHLEY: That's great, that's great. 
MATT: (whooshes) It strikes in where the initial impact from Pike's Guiding Bolt was and you watch (spreading cracks) cracks apparate around, and the ghostly visage of this extremely powerful psychic alien creature flickers for a second. You watch as it (shifts) focuses on you, and you hear in your mind, "You will not interfere!" 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: Straight in the middle of your mind. 
LAURA: What the shit? I'm going to hit it again. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LAURA: That's a Sharpshooter, too. I don't know if this is going to work, though. That would be 20. 
MATT: 20 just hits. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Oh man. 
ASHLEY: Wait, but don't you also get advantage? 
MATT: The first one she did. 
LAURA: I don't get advantage again. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's better. That would've been great on the crit. 29. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: (shattering) 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: The top of it shatters and explodes. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: The glow dissipating it. And you hear in your mind, (creature screaming) as the ghostly image is dispelled and sent off somewhere else. 
LAURA: Fuck you, ghost. 
SAM: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Fuck off, ghost. 
TALIESIN: Problem number one contained. 
MATT: All right, those are your two strikes. You want to move? 
LAURA: For my two strikes? Yeah, I'm going to move towards Percy because he is going to need to move faster than-- Right? 
TALIESIN: How far do you, how fast do you fly? 
MATT: 60, right? 
LAURA: I guess it would-- Wait, wait, wait, before I do this. 
MATT: Yeah? 
TRAVIS: Got to be. 
TALIESIN: I move at 30, but I could be fine. I also-- 
LAURA: You can dash. 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
LAURA: And if I have you, then I'm going half speed, so I'm not-- 
TALIESIN: So it doesn't matter. So I'm going to-- I'm going to be taking attacks as I go, so I'll be probably okay for now, but-- 
LAURA: Then I'm going to bonus action Hunter's Mark. What is this little dude? 
MATT: Which one, right over here? 
LAURA: No, the one that's-- That guy. 
MATT: There? 
LAURA: What is that? 
MATT: That guy? He hasn't gone yet. 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. So he is Hunter's Marked. I'll put a little Hunter's Mark, the black mark, on him for you. All right, that finishes your go? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Scanlan, you're up. 
SAM: I'm going to try to get some of these sperms off me. 
LAURA: I'm going to fly, I'm going to fly. I'm sorry. I'm going to fly as far as I can over this way, zoom. 
MATT: This way? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, 60 feet. 
LAURA: And I want to go higher so that thingy can't hit me. Whatever that-- there. 
MATT: About there? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: You got it. All righty. 
SAM: I will cast Thunderwave. I'll strum on my lute a powerful chord at 2nd-level I'll strum on my lute a powerful chord at 2nd-level and try to knock these-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ "Dueling Banjos" ♪ 
SAM: I think I can only get the three in front of me. Right? It's a 15-foot cube or something. 
LAURA: Can you do it all around you? 
SAM: Yeah. A 15-foot cube originating from you. What is that? I never understand what that means. 
MATT: Meaning it has to be adjacent to where you are. 
SAM: So it can't be all around me. It has to be in front. 
MATT: Correct. You can get two this way. You can try and if you want-- (chuckles) No, you can't, you're grappled. Yeah, you can't move. So you can hit two of them with it. 
SAM: I can't get the three in front of me since they're 15 feet? 
MATT: Unfortunately-- 
SAM: Five, 10. 
MATT: Unfortunately, no, because it's a 15-foot cube, which means it's those two there. They're arranged in a way. Or you could blast this and the guy that she just Hunter's Marked. 
LAURA: But it's a 15-foot cube around you. 
TALIESIN: No, it's from you. 
MATT: It originates from you. So it's bordering one of your squares. 
LAURA: Got it. 
TALIESIN: Like chess bishop, kind of. 
SAM: But it's not a 15-foot cube this way. It's diagonal. 
MATT: No. 
SAM: That's stupid. (laughter) 
MATT: There are spells that are, you know, radius from you, but this is not one. This is right in front of you. 
SAM: Let me-- 
LAURA: I love that it's a giant cube, though. 
SAM: It is. It's good. It works for me. 
MATT: Thematic. 
SAM: I'm going to see if there's anything else that's better than that. There is, but they're all stuff that I'm saving. So let's do that. Let's aim for two, the two in front of me. 
MATT: All right. It's a constitution save. 
LAURA: It was a Weave Mind, I think. 
MATT: Four, it's a fail. 
LAURA: Controlling it. 
MARISHA: For sure. 
MATT: And a fail. 
SAM: Yay. So that's 3d8, I believe. 
MATT: That was a Weave Mind. 
LAURA: Yeah? 
ASHLEY: It was? 
SAM: 14 points of damage. 
MATT: (magic blasting) 
SAM: Oh, nice. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Those two, (magic blasting) get sent off to the side. One splatters against the rock. The other rolls and stops moving. 
SAM: Amazing. So they're both gone? 
MATT: Yeah. You're no longer grappled, because the one that had you grappled was the one you destroyed. 
SAM: Great. If I move, they'll attack me. So do I move? What's in front of me? I can't see. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, go get-- 
ROBBIE: Not-- 
TALIESIN: Take a look. 
SAM: But if I move, they'll attack me. 
TALIESIN: That's true. 
SAM: But I'm here for glory. 
MATT: That's what it's about, baby. 
SAM: So I slap myself on the ass and I (neighs). (laughter) 
MATT: Oh, for the record, I do need to have you roll some constitution saving throws. I forgot because we were concentrating on the-- 
SAM: Oh, I'm going to drop them. 
MATT: Okay, so yeah, so it doesn't matter. 
TRAVIS: Tally ho. Oh, they're going to drop them? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Fuck. 
SAM: Incoming, Grog. 
MATT: Okay, roll 10d6 for me. 
SAM: Uh-huh, 10d6. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: You want some spare d6s? 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Roll big, roll big. 
TRAVIS: Can I make a dex save? 
TALIESIN: There's four. 
SAM: That's all I need. 
MATT: You trying to get out of the way? 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Yep, I'll allow it here in a second. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Terrible. Well, some are good. Okay. 12, 24, 28, 32, 36. 
MARISHA: ♪ It's raining men ♪ 
MATT: As the spell drops-- 
LAURA: ♪ Hallelujah ♪ 
LIAM: My name's Jennifer. 
MATT: Hold on. 
SAM: These yours? 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: As the spell drops, they all (creatures shouting) plummet. Grog, make a dexterity savings throw. with disadvantage because you are holding on. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Oh, that was a natural 20. 
MATT: Actually, it'd be a straight roll because you have advantage with things you see. 
TALIESIN: One of these is not mine. 
MATT: Just make a roll, sorry. 
TALIESIN: This is not mine. 
TRAVIS: 12-- 16. 
MATT: Yeah, you manage to roll out the way. 
LAURA: Can one of them land on his axe? 
MATT: Well they-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Every single one of them splats. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Oh. (cheering) 
MATT: Opa. 
TRAVIS: Like that. 
MATT: Yep. All of them splats except for these two that fall, injured on the ground. 
TRAVIS: The big boys. 
TALIESIN: You got them. 
TRAVIS: (grunts) Huh? 
LAURA: Oh, they're prone? (laughter) 
LAURA: Amazing. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Time to go gardening. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: They are definitely injured and (groans) on the ground. Lost their whole turn. Alright, Scanlan, does that finish your turn? 
SAM: I'm going to trot forward. 
MATT: Trot forward. Full movement? 
SAM: Yeah, getting to the next set of baddies. 
MATT: Okay. Actually, before I give you the full engine, they're both going to get attacks opportunity on you. 
SAM: Of course they will. 
MATT: That first one is-- Ooh, that's only a two. For 10. He misses you. The other is a six-- 17. 
SAM: Hit. 
MATT: 17 hits you? 
SAM: Hit. 
MATT: It grapples you as the bite the vice grip. 
LAURA: Oh, come one. 
SAM: Unless... Can I Cutting Words him? 
MATT: You certainly can go for it, yeah. 
SAM: I will Cutting Words his attack. I will neigh at him. I'll say: ♪ Watch me trot, watch me neigh ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Watch me trot ♪ 
MATT: Roll your dice. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Watch me neigh neigh ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: d12. 
SAM: It reduces his attack by two. 
MATT: Two. That's enough, right? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: 15. 
ASHLEY: Yes, that's right. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: It's going, "What the fuck?" 
MATT: You go running by. Coming around the way, you can see this fight happening here. That finish your turn? 
SAM: That finishes my turn. Yes. 
MATT: Awesome. All right. 
TRAVIS: Incredible. 
MATT: You see coming around this way-- 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
MATT: A bunch of Vanguard come rushing in from off that way filling the gaps here and coming around this cleric fellow here who's in the middle of casting a spell. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: The ground begins to quake in the space around here. The sand shudders. Then bursting out of the ground, these massive, blade-like insect arms. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: Sending them scattering off into the air screaming. Some of them cut in the middle of the air. You see sand and dirt go flying. 
TRAVIS: Ruby Vanguard goes flying? 
MATT: Yeah, this whole troop-- 
LAURA: Wait, what? 
SAM: What? 
MATT: Gets thrown. (explosion) 
SAM: Is this a good guy? 
MARISHA: One of those-- 
LIAM: Big bugs. 
MATT: Set her off. 
MARISHA: -- big bugs. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, but those are our bugs. 
TRAVIS: Big bug save me! 
MATT: As the dust begins to settle in, (creature thumping) a full grown battle vidulch itself. (shouting) 
TRAVIS: Show me! 
LIAM: Oh no. 
LAURA: Just destroy-- 
ASHLEY: Bring it out! 
LAURA: -- their own troops? (shouting) 
TRAVIS: What is that lobster? (shouting) 
TRAVIS: What's happening?! 
MARISHA: Oh, shit! 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
LAURA: I want to touch it. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
LAURA: Oh, he's sharp! (gasps) Can I pick it up, Matt? 
SAM: Rock lobster! 
LAURA: Can I look at it? 
MATT: Oh sure, if you want to. 
LAURA: I want to see the bottom of it. 
MATT: The shaking. 
LAURA: (groans) 
ASHLEY: Oh, he's a biggie. 
MATT: He's on this side. This figure-- 
TRAVIS: Jesus. - goes to run this direction at the shaking. I'm going to roll. (laughs) Not with a 10, you're not. This guy here is running. All of a sudden the ground bursts open. He goes flying up-- 
LAURA: (gasps) Another one? 
MATT: Another mandible catches him-- 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: --and devours him, as he lands on this side. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Don't let him get you, you guys. 
ASHLEY: What the hell are those? 
MATT: A second one emerges on this side right there. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Holy moly. 
LAURA: Percy. 
TRAVIS: We got to get the fuck out of here. 
LIAM: Matt, question. 
LAURA: Spider Climb, quick. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: When this one burst through and people all died there, am I within 60 feet of those? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: They are. 
LAURA: Actually, it's good you're flying. 
LIAM: Then I will use-- 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Well that was my other question, did you-- 
LIAM: -- Keeper of Souls. 
MARISHA: You dropped your shit. 
LIAM: To draw some life force from one of them to the Tempest. 
MARISHA: That's okay. 
MATT: Sure. 
LIAM: That's the number of hit dice contained in that rando. 
MATT: Six hit dice. 
LIAM: Six hit dice, so six hit points. 
MARISHA: I get, wait, I get? 
LIAM: You get six hit points. 
TALIESIN: See if you're down any. 
LIAM: Somebody died and you-- 
MARISHA: I'm not down any. 
LIAM: -- took their life force. 
TALIESIN: I think none of us are down yet. 
LIAM: Sorry, I need to practice. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's an interesting-- 
MARISHA: For sure. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, back and forth. 
MATT: So this vidulch that arrives, is going to charge forward-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: Filling the gap right there. It's going to make five attacks with its scythe claws and razor mandibles. 
LIAM: No. 
ASHLEY: Five attacks! 
LIAM: That sounds-- 
LAURA: Five attacks? 
LIAM: -- like a mistake. 
TALIESIN: On who? 
LAURA: Five attacks. 
MATT: Well the first few are going to be on Grog. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
TRAVIS: Got a plaything. 
MATT: (laughs) 13. 
TRAVIS: Misses. 
MATT: That's going to be 23. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: Hits. You take 29 points of piercing damage. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Nine, 11-- 
MATT: Reduced to half, so that's only-- 
TRAVIS: 14. 
MATT: 14. 
MATT: As one of its scythe claws strikes you from behind. The third attack is going to be a 19. 
TRAVIS: That's my AC. 
MATT: So it does hit you. You take another 29 points of-- 
TRAVIS: 14? 
MATT: -- slashing damage. 
TRAVIS: Sweet. 
MATT: That's a scythe claw attack, sorry, that was-- My apologies, my apologies. Both of those should have been 13. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Oh 13 total and then halved? (music playing from Ashley's phone) 
MATT: Correct, so that would've been, so you take 13 total from the two of those. 
SAM: I'm so sorry. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: My bad. Now it's going to come at you with its razor mandibles. That's going to be a 14. (laughs) Misses you. 
TRAVIS: Misses. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: It's going to go ahead and spin around and attack Pike with two of its scythe claw attacks. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Pike, no! 
MATT: That's going to be a 27 to hit. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: That hits. 
MATT: You take 13 points of slashing damage. 
ASHLEY: I'm resistant to slashing. 
MATT: Alright, so you take half of that. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Six. 
MATT: So that's six. The last one, a two, he's rolling dog shit. 
SAM: Hey. 
ASHLEY: Fuck out of here. 
MATT: Then he's going to finish off with the corroding spray, which is a 30 foot cone. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Excuse you. Excuse you. 
MATT: Is going to-- 
LAURA: Excuse! 
MATT: (acid spraying) - spray in this direction. 
TALIESIN: Bullshit. 
MATT: Turns it mandible that way to get both of them, and one of the Vanguard figures over there, indiscriminately. Dexterity saving throws, please, from-- 
SAM and TALIESIN: Robbie and Marisha. 
MATT: No, Robbie and Pike, I need you to make dexterity saving throws, please. 
ROBBIE: Dex save? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: (grunts) Hiyah! Oh. 
MARISHA: (shouts) 
ROBBIE: Yes, it's so bad today. 
MARISHA: Team Ashari. 
SAM: You have Inspiration. 
ROBBIE: (sighs) All right. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. You want-- 
ROBBIE: It's so bad. 
SAM: It's a 12. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, it's a 12. Ooh, where's it at? 
TALIESIN: You want to take it. 
ROBBIE: Oh my god, where's a 12? There it is. Ah. 
MARISHA: Oh, what the fuck? My god. 
SAM: Wow. 
ROBBIE: It went from an eight to a nine. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. Rough. 
MATT: 24 points of acid damage. 
ROBBIE: 24? 
MATT: Yes. Pike, you take 24 points of acid damage. 
TRAVIS: Are we getting out of here? 
SAM: Let's kill them. 
MATT: That's going to finish that guy's go. This one over here is going to, (creature skittering) skitter up this direction and-- Oh, you've actually fallen because you're-- 
MARISHA: I have fallen. 
MATT: Yeah, you are, so you plummet to the ground. You take 10d6 points of-- 
SAM: It was 36. 
MATT: It was 36 points of damage, you're right. So you take 36 points of bludgeoning damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Halved? 
MATT: Are you resistant to bludgeoning damage as a Fire Elemental? 
MARISHA: Let's find out. 
TRAVIS: Just on principle. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm probably right? Damage-- I am. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: So 36, half-- 
SAM: 18. 
MATT: So you take-- 
MARISHA: 18. Great. Beautiful. 
MATT: You land, it's going to go ahead and she doesn't have to get that close. Well no, it will, because it wants to bite you with it's mandible. It's going to shift up to you there.

MARISHA: So dope. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah, it'll shift around this way. 
LIAM: Feel you from in my insides, is that it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: So, you Keyleth. 
MARISHA: ♪ My whole existence is claws ♪ 
MATT: 16. Does a 16 hit you? 
MARISHA: Oh, oh, oh. 
TALIESIN: ♪ I'll get you close to my maw ♪ 
MARISHA: Yes, it hits me. 
TALIESIN: Carry on. 
MATT: 13 points of slashing damage. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
MARISHA: Halved? 
MATT: Are you resistant to slashing as well? 
MARISHA: Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. 
MATT: Correct, yeah. So-- 
TALIESIN: Oh my. 
MATT: -- you take six. 
LAURA: Amazing. 
MATT: That's a natural 20. 
LAURA: Oh my. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
MATT: So for that you would take... so that would be 20 points of slashing damage, reduced to 10. 
LAURA: Who was the last-- 
MATT: Third strike. 
ASHLEY: I think Scanlan. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
SAM: I did. 
MATT: A 28 to hit you. That's another 13, reduced to six. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to figure out-- 
MATT: That's going to be an 18 to hit you. 
MARISHA: Yeah, all these hit. 
MATT: That's another 13 to hit. Now its mandibles are going to strike down towards you. 
MARISHA: Let's go, baby. 
MATT: That's going to be a 19 to hit. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: Take 29 points of piercing damage. 
MARISHA: Halved, so that's-- 
MATT: Plus... 
MARISHA: Wait 29, half-- Wait. 
SAM: 14. 
MATT: Yeah, 14. Plus-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: 23 points of acid damage as its digestive juices get you in its mandibles there. 
MARISHA: Wait, say that again. 
SAM: 23 points of-- 
MARISHA: Of acid. 
MATT: Acid damage. 
MARISHA: Which looks like that hits. 23, you said. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: And then it's going to finish with the corroding spray, (acid splashing) which is going to get Lieve'tel, the Planetar, raven, and you, Keyleth in your form. I need you both make dexterity saving throws for me, please. 
LIAM: Lieve and the d-d-deva. 
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
MARISHA: Are these good rolls? Natural 20, baby. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: All right. So 56 points of acid damage reduced to-- (shouting) 
MARISHA: 56. 
MATT: -- 28. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Are we trying to kill these lobsters or we getting out of here? 
ASHLEY: Sheesh, lobstrosities. 
LIAM: Lieve got 14 and the-- 
SAM: Tell them to kill each other? 
LIAM: -- deva that I'm using got a 19. 
MATT: 19? The deva takes 28 points of acid damage. You take 56 points of acid damage. 
LIAM: 56. Got it. 
MATT: (acid splashing) Sprayed in that space. 
SAM: This isn't the final fight. 
MARISHA: So I had 102 hit points as a Fire Elemental and he dropped me. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: With one hit. I mean, one turn. 
MARISHA: Four-- One turn, but he unleashed-- 
MATT: So how much extra did you take from that? 
MARISHA: Three. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Three damage and Keyleth is back on the board. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, these things are here to kill anything, not just us. So we should probably get the fuck out of here. 
SAM: Yeah, we got to get the fuck out of here. 
LIAM: Why wouldn't they follow us towards the Malleus Key? 
TALIESIN: They don't know that we're-- 
LAURA: Well they'll probably-- They don't know our plan of attack. They're going to fuck up everything. 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Should probably continue to attack and move, attack and move. 
MATT: Well, that finishes their turn. Troop three is gone. Percy, you're up with Grog on deck. 
TALIESIN: Questions. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Would I know-- 
MARISHA: Questions. 
TALIESIN: Questions. 
MARISHA: Questions. 
TALIESIN: Questions. Percy's back. 
MARISHA: Oh, good sir. 
TALIESIN: Would I know whether or not they were likely to have keen vision or keen hearing in order to move around? 
MATT: You have never seen this creature in your entire life. 
TALIESIN: From an insectoid point, knowing that they-- Having a notion of it-- 
MATT: Make a nature check. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Make a nature check. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Ugh. 
MARISHA: Ew, icky. 
TALIESIN: 11. 
MATT: 11? No idea. 
TALIESIN: No idea. 
TRAVIS: It looks like a crustacean. 
MATT: These are deeply alien. There is insectoid aspects to it, but you've never seen these creatures before. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: Oh, man. This is rough. 
TALIESIN: That's fine, I assume we're all fucking booking. I'm going to get 30 feet in this direction as best as I can. 
MATT: You guys fought the baby before. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's a big spider. 
SAM: Whoa. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to head this way 30 feet. 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: So I guess that's-- I'm trying to read the-- five, 10, 15, can I make the leap? 
MATT: You can leap down, make an acrobatics check. 
TALIESIN: All right. (groans) 15. 
MATT: 15? Yeah, you catch yourself. 
TALIESIN: All right, and I might try and do one more leap. 
MATT: Sure. Make another acrobatics check. 
TALIESIN: If that's okay. Much better. 
MATT: Yeah. So you leap down to the bottom. 
TALIESIN: 27. 
TRAVIS: Got your semen all over the front of them. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: You do not lose any movement in the falling, so you have five more feet after that. 
TALIESIN: I have five more here? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's 30 feet? 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Then, since I'm there, I'm going to take four pot shots-- 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: -- at that jerk. 
SAM: Percy's in a whole other county. 
LAURA: I know. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Are you shooting from your cane? 
TALIESIN: No, I'm shooting from Animus. 
SAM: His pocket watch is a bazooka. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's 23 to hit. 
MATT: 23 to hit definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: That's a-- 
LAURA: His pocket watch is something else entirely. 
TALIESIN: Man, you don't want to know about the pocket watch. 
TRAVIS: My goodness. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's 14 points of damage with-- Where did I put my--? With four points of psychic damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Does it seem like psychic damage is doing anything, by the way, or no? 
MATT: It seems to be hurting them, yeah. This is just a Vanguard figure, by the way. 
TALIESIN: Number two. I'm going to reroll that because that was a one, so I am using-- No, I can only reroll saves. So gun breaks. 
MATT: Misfire on Animus. 
TRAVIS: No! 
LAURA: No. 
MARISHA: ♪ Tale as old as time ♪ 
TALIESIN: I take four points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Mm! Then I'm going to use a bonus action to try and fix it. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: Which, what is the fix? 
MATT: It's-- 
TALIESIN: No, I'm looking it up. Let's see. Sorry, I know. 
TALIESIN: I think it's tinker tools, proficiency. Proficiency bonus plus your dex or intelligence. 
TALIESIN: Dex, I think. 
MATT: Yeah, so dex plus your proficiency, that'd be 12, plus 12. 
TALIESIN: Six, 12, plus tinker tool. Yeah, so-- 
MATT: Well, with the tinker tools, it would be plus 12, so roll and add plus 12. 
TALIESIN: Better, 13. 
MATT: Repaired! 
TALIESIN: All right. (whooshes) 
MATT and TALIESIN: (click click) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh wow! 
TALIESIN: That's a bonus action. 
SAM: Oh, dorks, dorks. 
TRAVIS: Oh wow. Hyaaah dorks! 
MATT: "Keeping those guns repaired over there. Got to clear the chamber." 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my last two shots and see how this goes. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: Don't break. 20-ridiculous to hit. 
MATT: That'll hit. 
TALIESIN: That's these two. That's 15 points of damage with five psychic. 
MATT: This one takes the blow and tumbles off the side of the ruins and out of sight. The Kryn that's currently fighting it notices it fly off, looks at you and gives a nod. It gets its blade ready and it's about to leap down to join the other side of the fray. 
TALIESIN: Reload, put it away. 
MATT: All right, that finish your turn, Percy? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: All right, Grog, you're up, with Keyleth on deck. 
TRAVIS: Right, we're fighting these fucking--? 
SAM: Oh shit. 
TRAVIS: Boy, oh boy. 
SAM: Should we hobble them so they can't chase us? Just take out their legs? I don't know. 
TRAVIS: I don't know how much fucking damage they can take. All right, I'm going to go-- No, that's dumb. Yeah, I'm going to take two attacks, why not? Actually, I have B-b-boots of Feral Leaping-- 
MATT: You do. 
TRAVIS: -- that gives me-- Boobs. 
SAM: Boobs of Feral Leaping? (laughter) 
MATT: Boobs of Feral Leaping. 
TRAVIS: Boobs of Feral Leaping. I've let myself go the past three years. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Can I try to jump up on its arm and climb up onto its back like "Starship Troopers"? 
MATT: You certainly can, yeah. Make an athletics or acrobatics check, your choice. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll do athletics. That's a 21. 
MATT: 21, yeah, you (grunts) leap up onto its back 
MATT: 21, yeah, you (grunts) leap up onto its back and eventually clamber onto its carapace up this way as you're clutching onto the side of it there, riding it. 
TRAVIS: Hey, you big beastie, yee-haw! I'll swing down with my axe. Not Great Weapon Master on the first one. 
MATT: Okay, go for it. 
TRAVIS: That's cocked. 
TALIESIN: Oh, does that count as enough of a death to get a point back or no? 
MATT: Yeah, you killed it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a 32 to hit. 
MATT: 32 to hit, definitely hits. 
TRAVIS: I'll do the second one with Great Weapon Master. 19, 35, 30 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: That's crazy. Okay, first one is-- 
ASHLEY: Go, buddies. 
TRAVIS: 10, 20. 
ASHLEY: Take them out. 
TRAVIS: 24. 1d6 for necrotic. Four points of necrotic for 28 points of damage on the first one. 
MATT: Nice. 
TRAVIS: The second one is, yes! 12 plus 10, 22, 26, and one point of necrotic. So 27, one point of necrotic. 
MATT: That was with the plus 10 from Great Weapon Master? 
TRAVIS: No, 37. 
MATT: 37. 
TRAVIS: The last one, the other one should be 42. 
TRAVIS: The last one, the other one should be 42. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Got it. So plus 20 on both of those. 
ASHLEY: How dee doo dee doo dee? 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: Crack, crack, your axe is coming down and starting to cut through some of its outer armored shell, but it's still pretty hardy. You can see blood coming from where the crack is there and it's (squirming) as it's trying to recoil, some of its claws are trying to strike back towards you and many of its underneath spikes shift and move with the pain it's taking. 
TRAVIS: Frenzied Attacks make me incur a level of exhaustion, right? 
MATT: When you're done raging, yes. 
TRAVIS: When you're done raging, got it, okay, I'm saving it. 
MATT: You have to be done raging. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I'm good. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your turn? 
TRAVIS: I'm done, yep. 
MATT: Keyleth, you're up. 
SAM: Are we going to try to kill these things? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
LAURA: I don't know. 
TRAVIS: That was 70-something points of damage? 
SAM: That's great. 
MATT: Yep, a little over 70. 
TRAVIS: But they don't-- 
ASHLEY: Barely hurt. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't think so. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Or it's just his outer-- 
LAURA: Yeek. 
MARISHA: This is probably a bad idea-- 
LAURA: I feel like dragons, these are fucking-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MARISHA: -- but we're going to try it anyway. 
TRAVIS: They look massive. 
MARISHA: Because Grog gave me an idea. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. Being able to cast something at will-- 
TALIESIN: That's the worst phrase. 
MARISHA: -- means I can do it at will, right? It's not an action? 
MATT: That's what it means, yeah. 
MARISHA: Great. 
MATT: Well, well, well, it says at will means you can cast it, but if it's a spell, it still takes an action to cast it, it just means it doesn't use a spell spot. 
MARISHA: Okay, understood. Well then I'm not going to do that. I will however-- This is stupid. Why am I doing this? I'm going to do it anyway. 
MATT: I love it, I love it, let's go. 
ROBBIE: Is it going to be awesome? Is it going to be awesome? 
ASHLEY: Do it! Do it! 
MATT: What have you got? 
MARISHA: It's going to be awesome. 
MATT: Show me what you got. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I am going to try to Dominate the vidulch in front of me. 
LAURA: Yes. Yes. 
SAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
MATT: With what spell? 
MARISHA: Dominate-- 
TRAVIS: God, we're just dumping all-- 
MATT: Monster? 
TRAVIS: -- all our spells onto these. 
MARISHA: -- Beast. Is this a beast? 
MATT: You don't know if it's a beast or not. 
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. 
LAURA: I feel like it's a beast. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: These are-- 
LIAM: It's pretty monstrous. 
LAURA: Yeah, but it could be a Ruidian beast. 
SAM: We don't know. Could be a beast. 
TALIESIN: Roast beast. 
MATT: Do you want to roll for me a nature check? 
MARISHA: Yes, I do. 
MATT: I'll give you a nature check to look at this to see if there's any inclination as a being that is so deeply connected to the nature of Exandria and the beast of its landscape to see if there is a thread of recognition in there. 
MARISHA: Don't fuck me. (grunts) 
LIAM: It's a brain in a vat. 
MARISHA: 13. 
MATT: 13. Tough to tell. 
LAURA: (groans) 
ASHLEY: Damn it. 
MATT: It's an alien beast you've not seen before. Only in visions, so. 
TRAVIS: Not without confirmation. 
LAURA: You think it's a monster? 
TRAVIS: Don't waste it. 
LAURA: What decides-- 
MARISHA: I know. 
LAURA: What chooses between a beast and a monster? 
TALIESIN: It does. No. 
MATT: Beasts and monstrosities? Beasts are creatures that occur naturally. Monstrosities tend to be creatures that were altered through magic, through alchemical means, through curses, all sorts of strange things. 
ASHLEY: Well, these happen naturally in the moon. 
LAURA: Yeah, but they've been altered. 
MARISHA: But they do so many-- 
LAURA: They've been altered. 
MARISHA: -- experiments. 
ASHLEY: Oh, they do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. 
MARISHA: So I'll go back to the good old faithful and do Firestorm. 
MATT: Firestorm, all right, let's go! 
MARISHA: Burn it all down! Okay, so I'm going to use my Spire of Conflux. I can make 10 10 foot cubes. 
SAM: Whoa. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
MARISHA: They all have to make a dexterity saving throw. 
MATT: Yep, 10. So where do you want to send it? 
MARISHA: Okay, so-- This map is so big. 
TALIESIN and MARISHA: ♪ (jaunty traveling tune) ♪ 
MATT: Here's your 10 foot cube, so we can mark it as it goes. 
MARISHA: Okay. If I stack them, he only has to roll once.

MARISHA: Okay, so in front of me, one. 
MATT: Yep, one. 
MARISHA: One. Two. 
MATT: Two.

MARISHA: Okay, so I'll do one, two, three. 
MATT: Three, okay.

MATT: Back here they are.

MATT: Four.

MATT: There we go. That's all in that vicinity. 
TALIESIN: Up there. I don't know. 
MARISHA: Can I-- Yeah, I can't. 
TALIESIN: Not that far. 
MARISHA: They have to connect. That's the only thing. So, boosh! 
MATT: All right, so roll damage, and it is a dex save, correct? 
MARISHA: Dex save. 
MATT: All right, so roll that, 7d10 fire damage. 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: What the fuck? 
MATT: Firestorm, baby.

MARISHA: Okay. Perfectly average, honestly. 19, 21, 23, 28, 28, 40, no 32, 28, 40, no 32, 48 fire damage. 
MATT: 48 fire damage, okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: For the vidulch, that's going to be 17, which fails. 
MARISHA: Fails. 
MATT: It takes 48 damage. The flame column hits and it pulls back a little bit. It looks definitely like the flames burned it. That's the first time that one's been hurt. Okay, so it definitely was hurt. These two guys over there fail with a 13. Fail with a 14. Both of these Reiloran are incinerated. 
LAURA: Nice. 
SAM: Bad guys? 
LAURA: Yeah those are bad guys. 
MATT: That guy there, incinerated. 
LAURA: Yay! 
LIAM: It hasn't been a full turn yet since I used Keeper of Souls. 
MATT: That guy. That's going to be a 16. Fails. He is incinerated. 
TALIESIN: Not quite. 
MATT: It has not been a turn, no. Those two Vanguard folks there fail and fail. (engulfing flame) 
MARISHA: Bish, bye. 
MATT: They all move that way. Over here, this Vanguard. 
LAURA: Oh you put it up there too? 
MATT: Fails. 
LAURA: Sick! 
MARISHA: I still had a little bit more too, but-- 
MATT: Well, I mean climbing up the cubes here, it would've been about enough to go that far away. Then that shrike over there. 
MARISHA: That's fair. 
MATT: That is going to be a 22 to hit. 
MARISHA: He saves. 
MATT: He saves. 
MARISHA: So he takes half damage. 
MATT: Okay, cool. So the shrike-- 
LAURA: So 44. No.

MATT: You would get right there, that's 30 feet. 
MARISHA: Is that right out of his melee? 
MATT: Hmm? You don't know. 
ROBBIE: Those are long legs. 
MARISHA: It's fine. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say if you never left his melee he wouldn't have gotten an attack of opportunity. 
MATT: When you went underground-- 
TALIESIN: That is out of his melee. 
MATT: -- you took it. So yeah. 
MARISHA: It's okay, it's okay. I've got five feet between me and him?

MATT: Yeah, she is full eight-limbed-- 
MARISHA: Spider Queen! 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MATT: -- and they all begin to swarm these entities. 
ASHLEY: Hell yes. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Oh! Well that's our chance! 
MARISHA and LAURA: We got to go. 
ASHLEY: We got to go. 
MATT: Attacks on this one. That hits for that, double there. Both of those hit from him against the other guy. Wow, they're rolling good. Now all the good rolls come on-- Fuck, I'm rolling terrible when they're against you, but they roll well for the-- That one misses. So three hits. Come over here. Those are all doing-- 
ROBBIE: Oh man, that's so cool. 
MATT: This guy's starting to look hurt. 
ASHLEY: (mimicking music) 
LAURA: Whoa. Is their guy hurting? 
MATT: Over there. 
ASHLEY: Who, the big one? 
MATT: The one that Grog's on top of. That one over there, that's a miss. That's a hit from him. 
LAURA: The other one that is in front of Grog. 
MATT: There, and then Opal's going to go wide with a flurry of strikes. First as a bonus action, she's going to Hex the entity. 
LAURA: So wait, that was after Keyleth? 
TRAVIS: Let's go, Matt Mercer. 
MATT: Warlock there. 
LAURA: Opal. 
ASHLEY: Damn, this is a lot to handle, Matt. 
LAURA: And devils. 
MATT: Doing the best I can. 
ASHLEY: You're doing so fucking awesome. 
MATT: Thank you. So it's six attacks from Opal. 
TRAVIS: (cheers) 
SAM: You can't spell Opal without OP. 
MATT: Two, two, three, five. 
SAM: Aw. 
MATT: Eight. 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: 19. 
SAM: Amy-- Jesus. 
TRAVIS: On the 20s? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LIAM: Wait, what happened? 
ROBBIE: Six arms flailing. 
MATT: I rolled a natural two, a natural two, a natural three, a natural five, a natural eight and then a 19. 
SAM: Jesus, why does Amy suck at D&D? 
LAURA: The eight might have hit, though. 
MATT: The eight, let me-- Here that will be-- Plus 10, that's an 18-- Misses. 
LAURA: Oh, what. (laughter) 
MATT: Only one-- I know. 
ASHLEY: He's right there. 
MATT: Well she's striking at it, but it's all hitting the heavy armor and the blades. 
LAURA: She's getting used to her six arms, you guys. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: She's figuring it out. 
MATT: Okay, so that one's going to take-- 
LAURA: A couple of her arms collided with each other. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: 14 points of damage on that. 
ASHLEY: Trying to rave dance. 
MATT: Going to unload on that. That finishes their go. That brings us now from Opal Twice-Crowned here to help represent the Betrayer Gods in that point. Lieve'tel, you're up. 
LIAM: The deva follows me, right? 
LAURA: I thought maybe Aimee was going to come in. 
ASHLEY: Me too, I got excited. 
MATT: No, you are on the deva. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Then on the deva's turn, at the end of your turn, then it moves. 
LIAM: Right, the deva goes after me in the initiative. 
MATT: Oh sorry, yes. 
LIAM: Yeah, so what I'm going to do is lean Lieve's head down between two of the heads and say, get me up and over and hover behind that thing's ass, and I'm going to hold my action to cast Bless when we are within equal range of The Tempest and Opal. 
MATT: You got it. So that finishes your turn? 
LIAM: I'm holding a spell. 
SAM: You didn't cast Bless on any of us last time, right? 
LIAM: No, because my economy conflicted. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: So once I'm within 30 feet of each of them, Lieve, hands out wide on top of this white, three-headed raven Blesses the Tempest, myself, and Opal. 
MARISHA: That's d4s, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: d4s to attacks and saving throws. 
ROBBIE: Oh, yeah! 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
LAURA: That's good. That's good. That's good. 
LIAM: Now maybe a little bit higher? 
MATT: Great. It's going to take you up, you said a little bit higher? 
LIAM: Actually, scratch that! 
LAURA: ♪ Can it take you ♪ 
SAM and ROBBIE: What? 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: ♪ Scratch that ♪ 
MATT: Finishing your go, Lieve. This troop here now, this is going to get up. This guy's going to get up. 
LAURA: Oh, bummer. 
MATT: This guy is going to go first. He's going to attempt to psychically pull you off of the back of the creature as a bonus action. I need you to make a strength saving throw for me if you don't mind. 
LAURA: You've got this, Grog! 
MATT: You have advantage on it. 
TRAVIS: I do. 19 plus 14, 33. 
MATT: You don't even budge and he's like (heavy breathing) 
LAURA: Ha ha. 
MATT: With that, it's going to-- 
TRAVIS: Taint. That's the whole insult. Taint! 
MATT: That's great. That's great. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, it's going to throw two jagged darts. It's going to like-- 
TRAVIS: T'aint going to pull me off-- There it is. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) There it is. Okay, okay, it's going to be 17 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Misses. 
MATT: Oh, and a 24 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: All right, so you do take-- 
ASHLEY: Did your ally go? 
LIAM: Yes, I just needed it to move me. 
MATT: Okay, it's going to be four points of piercing damage, reduced to two. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Not much. But didn't get you off. However, the juggernaut's going to leap up onto the back over there. 
TRAVIS: Should've killed him first. 
TALIESIN: Yay! You got a buddy. 
MATT: It's going to pursue you on the back of this creature. 
LAURA: Oh my goodness! 
MATT: You're both now having a gladiatorial battle on the back of a full grown vidulch. 
SAM: Pretty epic. 
MARISHA: That's so epic. 
MATT: All right, there we go, got to keep it-- 
MARISHA: Animated! 
TRAVIS: Those spikes suck. 
MATT: I know. 
TALIESIN: Are you in the mood for this fight or no? Well, we'll find out. 
ASHLEY: He's fighting you? 
TALIESIN: I mean, I could make him slow down pretty quick, but I like a little bit of fun. 
MATT: With that-- 
TALIESIN: I love having control aspects on-- 
ALL: Aw! 
ROBBIE: Ah, later. 
MATT: I know. 
MARISHA: More sticky. 
TALIESIN: More Play-Doh! 
TRAVIS: Maybe you can get him on that knee joint down on the lower right. 
MATT: Maybe that might be easier. Here, I'll just put it there for now. That'll work. You know where he is. Okay, so with that, he's going to unleash-- 
SAM: I don't understand how he can reach Grog from there, though. (laughter) 
MATT: It's so weird that he can reach you from there, though. (laughter) 
MATT: Top of his turn, he regenerates 10 hit points. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: He regenerates 10 points? 
LAURA: Whose turn? 
MATT: The juggernaut starts gaining some of its health back and makes three attacks against you, Grog, multiattack with its blades. It's going to be 25 to hit? 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
SAM: Yikes. 
MATT: 26 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: And a 20 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: All righty. All right, so with that, you take-- I'm going for the ease of here, I haven't rolled dice for this. 10 damage, 10 damage, and 10 damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Half, half, half. 
MATT: So half to 15. So you take 15 points of slashing damage. I need you to make a strength save because it uses a Telekinetic Combo. It hit you more than twice in one round. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Natural 19 plus 14 for 33. 
MATT: You're fine. So as it's blasting you, you feel like it's pressure pushing on you like some sort of psychic force, with each blow is trying to push you off your feet, but you still hold yourself strong against the back of this creature as you're both brawling and throwing weapons at each other on the back of this shifting massive insectoid vidulch. That finishes that troop's go-- 
TRAVIS: Can I use my reaction, retaliation? 
MATT: Yes, you can! 
TRAVIS: Get the fuck off me! Whack! 
MATT: (laughs) You indeed can. 
TRAVIS: 12, double 12s. That's a 28 to hit? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Okay, and that is 10 plus 10, 20, 24. 
LAURA: Ah! 
SAM: Don't need that one. 
LAURA: Jesus. 
TRAVIS: 28 points of damage, four points of that are necrotic. 
LAURA: Just things flying. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Keyleth, have you dipped under your temporary hit points yet? 
MATT: He's starting to look pretty hurt now after that. That retaliatory strike. 
MARISHA: By three. 
MATT: You strike him and he's like, (grunts) Gets some stuff up, the blades at the ready again, and he's just coming at you. 
TRAVIS: I'm not up here with you, you're up here with-- With-- 
MATT: The creature-- 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: The vidulch doesn't seem to be noticing him on his back, it's just focused on you. 
TRAVIS: Interesting. Because you're a flea and I'm-- Me. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Yay! 
TRAVIS: Eyy! 
MATT: Now these guys over here didn't go. I need someone to roll for both sides on this end. I'm going to roll for the one juggernaut that remains here. The rest can go, and that goes there. 
LAURA: I'll roll for the other guys. That was a 12. 
MATT: Natural 18. Divide those two, it's going to be six. 
LAURA: It's so cool, isn't it? It's like a cage. 
TRAVIS: No, it's not. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It looks like an apricot seed. 
MATT: So with that, the juggernaut tears apart three of the figures, including a dunamancer, who was in the process about to cast it and throw it into the air. 
LAURA: I'm sorry, guys! 
MATT: Slams one in the ground, crushes the other one's head, and then grabs the dunamancer and picks it up and just like Hulk to Wolverine, just bisects it and throws both halves in different directions. Finishing their go, Pike, you're up, with Cerkonos on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right! All right! 
SAM: Come on, Pikey! 
ASHLEY: Okay! So-- Um, um. Umumumumum. Mum, mum, mum, mum. All right, so Sacred Flame-- 
TRAVIS: Umumumumum. 
LAURA: Mum mum mum mum mum mum mum mum mum. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: -- is a cantrip. I can do-- This is 4d8. 
MATT: Yeah, 4d8. 
ASHLEY: That's a cantrip? 
MATT: Yeah! 
MARISHA: It grows with your level. 
ASHLEY: Shit! That's so cool! All right, I'm going to Sacred Flame the big-- Well, let's see. 
LAURA: You've got a guy right behind you, Pike. 
ROBBIE: That's me! 
LAURA: Oh, that's Cerkonos! You have a red base and it looks like villain. 
ROBBIE: Sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Can I do this? 
MATT: He's Flame Speaker. 
ASHLEY: Is-- 
MATT: Fire, red, yeah. 
LAURA: Makes sense. Makes sense. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I wonder, is that dumb? Is that dumb for me? Okay. All right. 
MARISHA and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to Sacred Flame the vidulch. 
MATT: Okay. Dexterity save or wisdom save? 
ASHLEY: Dexterity. 
MATT: Well, regardless, it rolled a natural five. 
ASHLEY: Okay! Okay! 
MATT: So roll 4d8. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. All right, so we've got eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. (mumbling numbers) 19. 
SAM: Pretty good! 
MATT: 19 points of damage. Flame bursts on its back. That's your action. 
ASHLEY: That's my action. Then-- So can I do Guiding Bolt now? Since it was-- 
SAM: That was a cantrip. 
MATT: Well yes, but they're-- 
ASHLEY: It was a cantrip. 
MATT: -- both actions. 
ASHLEY: They're both actions! Shit, then I shouldn't have done that. That was dumb. 
SAM: You'll get a free cantrip. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I know, I feel-- I'm so sorry. My brain is toast. 
MATT: It's all good, you also haven't played Pike in a long time. 
LAURA: You have a mace? 
MARISHA: Yeah, you can mace. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to fucking mace this stupid thing. 
MATT: Well, have a bonus action left. 
SAM: That's an action. 
LAURA: Oh, a bonus action. 
ASHLEY: Why did I do that? 
MATT: Would you like to take that back? 
ASHLEY: I mean, kind of. 
MATT: I'm giving some leniency because it's been a minute since you've done it. Yeah, if you want to. 
ASHLEY: Because I wouldn't have just done a cantrip. 
MATT: I was a little curious about that! 
ASHLEY: I thought I was going to be able to do that and then scratch that, all of that. I'm really sorry, thank you. 
MATT: It's been years. I'll take that back. So no damage on that. 
ASHLEY: Sorry! 
MATT: (rewind sounds) Okay, we're back. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: The Tatasciore rewind. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. All right! 
TRAVIS: (rewind sounds) I'm going to Guiding Bolt the fucking thing. 
SAM: Hey! 
MATT: Good ol' faithful. Let's go. 
MARISHA: ♪ Guiding Bolt up the butt ♪ 
ASHLEY: I'm so mad at myself. 
LAURA: ♪ Up the butt of the vidulch ♪ ♪ What does a vidulch ♪ butt even look like? ♪ 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's a natural 19. 
LAURA: Nice! 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
LIAM: Kind of like a dick. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll your damage for me. 
LAURA: Kind of like a dick! 
LIAM: A bad one. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm so sorry, you guys. 
LAURA: Like a Bad Dragon dick. 
MARISHA: How dare! 
ASHLEY: Four. 
LAURA: That's a new one, vidulch. 
LIAM: (sighs) Have you tried vidulch? 
TALIESIN: I have time, I'm not going to until-- 
MATT: What level was that? 
ASHLEY: Ooh, nice. Okay. Four. 
MATT: Four. Okay. 
ASHLEY: So we've got-- 6. No, 12-- 
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure. 
TALIESIN: Wild Shape is your friend. 
ASHLEY: 18, 19-- 
TALIESIN: Where are you right now? Oh, you're up there. Okay. 
ASHLEY: 31. 
MATT: 31 points of damage. Awesome. It is marked, and those guys over there still have to go. These fights still happening up here. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I shouldn't have done that. I thought he was close. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: You have any bonus actions? 
MATT: So that's your action. You have a movement and bonus action. 
ASHLEY: I don't understand how to do this, apparently because I'm just a fucking-- 
LIAM: Sure you do. 
SAM: You're great! 
LAURA: You're great. 
MATT: You're doing great. 
ASHLEY: That's my action. 
MATT: Okay, do you want to move or do you want to-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I want to move still going this way. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Just trying to, I have 25 feet, so-- 
MATT: There are all these guys here. 
LAURA: There's a bunch of people in front of you, so you'll have to run past them. 
LIAM: You could either run under its legs, that's fun, or through the group of people. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I see. 
LIAM: You were on that rock by Cerkonos. 
MATT: Or you can try and run through under its legs and come this way, up to you. 
LAURA: But he's going to get an attack on you, Were you already within his melee? 
ASHLEY: I'll stay. I'll stay. I'm going to stay. 
MATT: Okay. You're going to stay put? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: You got it. 
TALIESIN: And Groggernaut. 
MATT: Now because they didn't get these guys last time, they're going to swarm up. 
MARISHA: How would you help him? By shooting those guys? 
SAM: Swarm up! 
MATT: They're going to fill into there. This guy's going to move into there and this guy's going to move up to you, Cerkonos. 
LAURA: Oh, god, they're surrounding you. 
SAM: What the fuck is wrong? 
ASHLEY: I know! I know! 
MATT: All right, so now one's attacking you. 
SAM: Kidding. 
ASHLEY: (frustrated sigh) 
MATT: It's going to be a 16 to hit you. 
SAM: You're great. We love you. 
MATT: 16 hit? 
ASHLEY: 16, it does not. 
MATT: And an 11. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: Both of these slithers biting at you and they get the part of your armor, you knock it back with your shield and they're not finding any purchase beyond the Plate of the Dawnmartyr, which protects your physical form. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: The two other figures, they're going to swing at you twice. It's going to be a 19 to hit. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
TALIESIN: Stop it. 
MATT: And another 19 to hit. The other guy's going to come at you with two more strikes. 12. 21 to hit? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: No! You're like (metal clanging), beating their weapons back, holding the shield forth and knocking away as you're being assaulted. Nothing can get through. All righty, that finishes their go. Cerkonos, you're up with Vex on deck. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: There's advantage on big boy. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
SAM: Take him down! 
LAURA: Take him down! 
ROBBIE: I wish you had my vantage point because what I can see from the back is Scanlan galloping off into the distance. It just looks so epic! So that's what Cerkonos sees and he's like, "Yes!" Then I'm going to use my action to, I'm going to say to myself, "It's time." Then I'll use my action to take Wild Shape my Flame Speaker elemental form. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Bagoosh! Let's go! 
ROBBIE: This huge fire elemental springs into the space. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I want roasted lobster ♪ 
ROBBIE: That does require an action for me to take the form. 
MATT: Mm-hm. 
ROBBIE: But then I'd like to use my movement. In my fire form, I can move through a space as narrow as an inch wide, so I'd like to use that movement to (fire roaring) and take that form and put it to a little pinpoint and insert myself in the spiracle of the carapace of the abdomen of the mo-- 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: So I can also occupy the space of a creature with that movement. So I'm basically going to put myself in between the cracks of the armor of the-- 
MATT: The vidulch? 
TRAVIS: Vidulch? 
ROBBIE: The vidulch. 
SAM: So much dirty talk! 
ROBBIE: So basically, you can't see me, but I'm inside. Because I'm in that space, he's slowly lighting on fire from the inside. 
MATT: He catches flame! 
LAURA: He can't attack you because you're inside of him. 
MATT: Oh, he can still attack you. You're still in the area. This doesn't prevent you from being attacked. You do also get two attacks of opportunity from the two guys that were next to you as you move out the space. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: So the guy over there s going to attack you. So that was going to be an 18 plus, that's going to be a 24 to hit you? 
ROBBIE: Oh, sure. Yeah. 
MATT: The other one is going to be a-- Yeah, because I rolled twice on those. It's going to be a 14. 
ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: 14 hits you? 
ROBBIE: Oh no, no, no, nine. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: 19. 
MATT: 19. Okay, yeah. So that one guy hits you for-- That's terrible. Four points of slashing damage. 
ROBBIE: Oh no! 
MATT: Yeah. But you take half of that for two. 
ROBBIE: Oh, yeah. Great. 
MATT: You move by, he's on fire there. Cool, that finishes your turn? 
ROBBIE: Yep. 
MATT: Vex, you're up. 
LAURA: These guys are attacking Pike? 
MATT: They are. 
LAURA: But then this guy's attacking-- I feel like these ladies have this guy over here, so I'm going to help Pike out and I'm going to hit the guy from the back that I've Hunter's Marked. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: So I can actually use a Sneak Attack on him. 
MATT: You can, let's go for it. 
LAURA: (silly laughter) 
ASHLEY: Get him, get him, get him. 
LAURA: Does that give, wait. No, that doesn't give me advantage. 
LIAM: Rogue shit. 
LAURA: Sharpshooter! 
TRAVIS: Robbie, that was fucking smart, man. 
MATT: That was awesome. 
TALIESIN: Fucking brilliant. 
LAURA: 21 to hit? 
ROBBIE: Got to do something. 
MATT: 21 hits. 
ROBBIE: Cook him. 
LAURA: Okay. There we go, there we go, there we go. 
MARISHA: It's druid's bread and butter. Using the shapes to tank-- 
LAURA: Are you kidding? Okay, well, that's 11. 
TRAVIS: (wheezes) 
LAURA: 14-- 
TRAVIS: "Are you kidding?" 
LAURA: 14, 18. 22 plus nine is 31. Plus 10 is 41 on the first hit. 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
MATT: He just (impacts) and collapses to the ground. 
LAURA: Great! Then for my bonus action, I'm going to shift that Hunter's Mark to the vidulch! 
LIAM: You're going to do what to it? 
MATT: There you go. 
LAURA: And I am going to attack it! 
MATT: It has advantage on it because of Guiding Bolt. So the next strike has advantage. 
LAURA: Great! 
MATT: Which gives you-- No, you already done sneak attack. 
LAURA: I already got sneak-- yeah, yeah. Boo. 18 plus 15. Oh, Sharpshooter. 18 plus 10. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: So 28. 
MATT: 28 hits. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay, okay! 
TALIESIN: I thought you get negative five to hit and plus 10 damage? 
LAURA: Oh, seven plus three is 10. 
LIAM: It lowers your attack roll-- 
LAURA: Plus 10 is 20. Plus nine is 29. 
LIAM: -- and ups the damage. 
MATT: 29 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: There we are, yeah. 
MATT: It strikes it. You see it buckle under its legs and it is now looking quite hurt. The massive vidulch, it is massive and it has a decent amount of hit points. Its armor is pretty high, but you guys are pretty tough and it can deal out a lot of attacks and damage. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: It's hurt pretty bad. 
MARISHA: You hit that one? 
MATT: This one here. 
LAURA: I hit the one that is surrounded, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to fly this way and get over this vidulch. 
MATT: Okay. 60 feet. 
LAURA: Close to that one. 
MATT: Puts you about there. 
LAURA: Yeah, okay. 
MATT: All right. Coasting over there on your broom, that finishes your go. Scanlan, you're up 
SAM: The two or three people in front of me between me and the vidulch. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: Do I get a sense of who's good and who's bad? 
MATT: I mean, this is a juggernaut there. 
SAM: That's bad. 
LAURA: He's bad. 
MATT: Glancing over there, you recognize the Kryn armor of the individuals that you met in Vasselheim. These two do not appear to be wearing Vanguard attire. When you rushed up before they got burned by Keyleth's massive firestorm, they were fighting the Vanguard figures. 
LIAM: Are they champions? 
SAM: Gotcha. So they're goodies. So I'll position myself behind the gladiator. Not gladiator, what's it called? 
TRAVIS: Oh-- 
SAM: The juggernaut! 
MATT: Juggernaut. 
TRAVIS: Bitch. 
MATT: You are currently in his-- Behind him. 
SAM: Yes, and I will blast. I will whinny. (whinnies) 
MATT: The figure you see next to you has this massive flaming blade and pale, golden skin, white hair that flows in the air and their eyes are pure white, like they hold an angelic energy to them, like there's some sort of divine essence to their blood as they turn back and go, "Oh, thank goodness. You've arrived." 
SAM: I have and I'm here to help you. 
MATT: Then you whinny? 
SAM: I whinny and lightning comes out of my mouth. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes, does it? Yes! 
MATT: "Oh gods!" (laughter) 
MARISHA: That is nightmarish. 
MATT: "I'm here to help. (roars)" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (neighs and lightning crackles) 
MATT: What level are you casting? 
SAM: The one above the one, so 4th-level. 
MATT: 4th-level, okay. Dexterity save? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Vidulch, that's a 17. 
SAM: 22, yeah. Wins. 
MATT: All right, so it fails. 
SAM: So then that is that 9d6 or 10d6? 1d6 for each slot above third. 
MATT: How long is the range on that? 
SAM: Sorry, it is 100 feet in a straight line. 
MATT: 100 feet in a straight line. 
LAURA: So you can get the juggernaut and the vidulch? 
SAM: For sure! 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MATT: You just barely miss Keyleth. 
MARISHA: Me, I know. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (nervous laugh) I wasn't going to be mad, but-- 
TRAVIS: MVP. 
SAM: 9d6, I think? 
MATT: Oh, they both failed their dexterity saving throws. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: So 9d6 damage. 
SAM: 11, 14. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Not great. Then-- Oh, garbage. 26 point of damage. 
LAURA: Ugh! Pathetic. 
SAM: Awful. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: It arcs through, the juggernaut gets hit. Smoking, its whole torso (sizzling) it looks back over its shoulder at you. (growling deeply) The vidulch takes the blow and just shrugs it off. It takes the damage, but this one isn't as hurt as the other one. 
SAM: I will just rock around behind the angel. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Rocking around ♪ 
MATT: Okay, you will take an attack of opportunity by moving out of its range. 
SAM: Oh, shit balls. Well then I'll-- I don't want to get hurt, though! 
LAURA: Could you have not gone up right behind it? 
SAM: I mean, that's where I was. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to go behind the angel and behind that other guy. I'm really-- 
MATT: Okay, so you-- 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Around here? 
SAM: No, no, no. Putting both of them between me, behind the armor guy. 
LAURA: What do you mean? 
MATT: Behind here you mean? 
SAM: No, that corner. 
MATT: This corner? Okay. 
SAM: Yeah. So he's got to go through two people to get to me. 
MATT: All right, so he does take an attack of opportunity on you. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: He's going to take a big old swing with his bone scythes. Hoo! Natural two. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Eyy! 
MATT: For a 12. 
SAM: Hey! He misses! 
MATT: He turns around, (groans), goes to swing and you're already-- (clopping) 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: -- off that way. Great. 
SAM: Yeah, and I'll leave some poop as I go. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go? 
SAM: Yep. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: You didn't even hit. 
MATT: At the end of your turn, a dark shadow-- 
SAM: Oh no. 
LAURA: Another dark shadow? 
MATT: -- emerges from behind, as the dust (whooshes) opens up above, as you see brass wings spread out. 
LAURA: Yes! 
SAM: Eyy! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Devo'ssa! 
MARISHA: Devo'ssa!

LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MARISHA: What's up! 
MATT: It's going to do a massive-- 
LAURA: Just look at that! 
ASHLEY: That's so pretty! 
LAURA: Beautiful dragon! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TALIESIN: We are--

LAURA: Ugh! 
MARISHA: Yeah!

LAURA: We got to get to the fucking Key! 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: He's going to-- 
SAM: Jesus! Sorry. 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: Gets the devil in the way, (laughs) but doesn't care. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Shit happens. 
ASHLEY: Wow, that's so pretty. 
MATT: Devo'ssa's not a huge fan. (scorching flame) is going to burn past and just keep flying and is going to take back off into the sky. 
LAURA: So cool! 
MATT: So as they dart down, (whooshes) that direction, darts down. Going to roll dex save for both. For the devil, natural one. (laughs) 
LIAM: Uh-oh! 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh! 
MATT: Then for the vidulch-- 
TRAVIS: ("Price is Right" loss trombone) 
MATT: Vidulch is going to be 17, which is also a failure. They both take 56 points of fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
SAM: Damn. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: That vidulch is now starting to look pretty hurt and the-- 
SAM: Starting to. 
MATT: -- devil-- Put this here. 
TRAVIS: It was probably like 130. 
LIAM: For the vidulches, yeah. 
MATT: They are immune to fire, so it does nothing. 
SAM: Hey! 
TRAVIS: The devil? 
MATT: Yep. The devil. 
SAM: That makes sense. 
MATT: Immune to fire. 
LAURA: Oh, wow! 
MATT: So it (scorches) burns through. 
SAM: That makes a lot of sense. 
MATT: No affect on the devil, and Devo'ssa (soars) takes back off and is going to continue to try and breathe flame and carpet bomb people that are-- 
LAURA: We should just-- 
MARISHA: Run. 
LAURA: -- keep going. Yes. 
MATT: As you look across that way, other soldiers are rushing in this way and Devo'ssa (flames scorch) burns them as well-- 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
MATT: -- and is clearing out cavalry that are starting to rush in your direction now from different sides. So the dragon's swooping and keeping watch. That finishes their go. Percy, you're up with Grog, and then Keyleth. 
TALIESIN: We're fucking running. 
LAURA: Dash it. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Five, 10, 15, 20 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60. Five, 10, 15, 20 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60. I guess I'm going a full 60. 
ROBBIE: Where are you? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm the earth ellie. 
SAM: Can you squeeze off some shots? 
TALIESIN: Not while I'm dashing. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) I'm the giant fucking rock. 
SAM: Zero? 
TALIESIN: I'm running! 
LAURA: If he's booking it and we're trying to get to the next-- 
SAM: I'm not booking it. I'm killing these things. 
LAURA: Yeah, but you were further along. 
ROBBIE: Really? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm staying until the job's done. 
LAURA: Well, the job is to free my brother! 
SAM: Yeah, but-- Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. That finish your turn, Percy? 
TALIESIN: That's all I got. 
MATT: Grog, you're up. Keyleth, you're on deck. 
SAM: I was on vacation yesterday. 
TRAVIS: Fucking-- (roars) I'll turn around and I'm going to swing once into the-- What are the big guys called? 
MATT: Juggernauts? 
TRAVIS: The juggernaut behind me. 
MATT: Go for it. Roll an attack. 
SAM: Smack those jugs! 
TRAVIS: Smack them. 
MATT: Is this with Weapon Master or not? 
TRAVIS: This is Great Weapon Master, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, I should have said that. Thank you.

TRAVIS: Three, 10, 13, 17. 17 plus six is 23 with six points of necrotic. So 33 total. Six of those are necrotic. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
TRAVIS: There's only one space for this rodeo. Whack! I'll lob his head off. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: (slicing) The body crumples off the side, plummets, and the horned devil spears it, not knowing it's dead yet. Picks it up. (whooshes) Shucks it off to the side and gets prepared to stab the vidulch. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! Nice fork! Excuse me! I'm going to jump towards the Reiloran on the ground on the other side. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to come down with (battle cry) and swing down on him as I jump down. 
MATT: On him? 
SAM: Nice! 
MATT: Make an attack. 
TRAVIS: I gain 10 temporary hit points. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Thank you for that. 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Amazing! Great Weapon Master, this is 30 minus five for 25? 
MATT: That hits 
TRAVIS: Okay. 12... 
TALIESIN: That's what we're supposed to do to damage it. 
TRAVIS: -- 18, 22, plus six. 28, 38 points of damage. (slice) (bloody slosh) 
SAM: Ugh! 
MATT: Splits in half on that axe is taken out. 
MARISHA: Amazing! 
LAURA: Did you-- 
TRAVIS: What? 
LAURA: I'm letting him know. Did you have the vidulches go, because they were in line after Scanlan? 
MATT: Oh, you're right! Thank you. I'll do that in a second. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: They were, yeah. I'll reach down and I grab, since I split him down the middle, I'll reach down and find the spine and I start walking this way. 
SAM: Ugh. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MARISHA: Amazing! 
TRAVIS: So my boots of leaping did 15 feet plus 50, so 65 total I can start coming this way. I'll start walking towards this area. 
MATT: 60, 65 there. 
TRAVIS: Great. 
MATT: However, the vidulch, before, since it didn't take its turn before, is going to, first it's going to see if it gets its spray back. It does not. Now it's going to go full round of attacks on you as you're on top of it. Actually-- 
TALIESIN: Could've made that-- 
TRAVIS: Behind is tricky, right? Since I was on its back. 
MATT: Yeah. I'm going to say it takes two strikes at you and the rest are going to go after Pike. 
LAURA: Aw. 
SAM: Pike! 
MATT: The first one-- 
ASHLEY: It's all right, it's all right. 
MATT: It's going to be a 16 to hit? 
TRAVIS: Misses. 
MATT: That's going to be a 19 to hit? 
TRAVIS: That does hit. 
MATT: All right, so you take 13 points of slashing damage, reduced to six. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Then it's going to attempt to-- Nah, it's mandibles, it's going to go after Pike. You're just too hard to reach. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: It's going to spin around towards you, Pike. Pike, 18 to hit? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: Misses. Other attack, it's going to be a 23 to hit. 
ASHLEY: Just hits. 
MATT: You do take 13 points of slashing damage from one of its scythe claws. 
ASHLEY: That's halved, because I'm resistant? 
MATT: If you're resistant to slashing damage? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Resistant to slashing. 
TRAVIS: From non-magical attacks. 
MATT: Yeah. So yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Does that work? 
MATT: Yeah, so you take six points of slashing damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Sweet. 
MATT: The mandibles are going to bite down on you. 
LAURA: Ugh. That's the poison. 
MATT: That's going to be-- That's going to be a 29 to hit. 
ASHLEY: That hits. 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: All right, you take-- 
ASHLEY: That's piercing? 
MATT: - 29 points of piercing damage, reduced to 14. 
ASHLEY: Halved. Okay. 
MATT: And you take-- 
TALIESIN: (whistles) Yep. Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
MATT: 21 points of acid damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to finish its turn. The other one over there is going to swing around and do a few strikes at-- Well, let's see if gets its-- It does get its Corroding Spray back. 
MARISHA: Oh joy. 
LIAM: Ugh. 
TALIESIN: It can fart again. 
MATT: So yeah, it's going to do a few strikes at Opal and this other devil, since they're the closest to it. 
MATT: That's going to hit Opal. That's going to hit Opal. That's going to hit the devil. That's going to miss the devil. So it's going to be 13. 13. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: So the devil's 13. Its mandible strike is going to be against the devil. That's going to hit. The devil takes-- As well as... That's actually a really bad acid roll. That's 18 points of acid damage. 
TRAVIS: I hate bad acid rolls. 
SAM: (laughs) Yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: Yeah, just freaking out. 
MATT: However, it's going to arc its head back to where you are, flying overhead and it's going to spin its head around and (sprays acid) ejects the acid spray. I need you and your planetar to make a dexterity saving throw. 
LIAM: Okay. I am blessed, so I'm going to add a d4 to my roll. That is 20... Oh, dex. 22 for me. 
MATT: That's a success for you. 
LIAM: And the planetar, or the diva, deva-- 
LAURA: Deva diva. 
LIAM: Got a low roll. That is a 13. 
LAURA: Look at his dorky haircut. 
LIAM: That's not what I summoned. 
MATT: That's 42 points of acid damage that your ally takes. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: You take 21 points of acid damage. 
LIAM: 21. Okay. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes the vidulch's go. 
LAURA: It looks like a surfer bro. 
TRAVIS: Matt, can I ask you a question? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: If I was still on the vidulch's back when it was attacking Pike down there-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: -- I could use Sentinel to make one melee attack on it, which might-- 
MATT: Correct! 
TRAVIS: Depending on how hurt it is, it could take off that 14 points if-- 
MATT: If you want to, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Can I try? 
MATT: Sure, let's go! 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: Come on! Come on! 
TRAVIS: Six plus... 22 to hit? 
MATT: 22 just hits. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Let's see. 
TALIESIN: That's good to know. 
TRAVIS: Nine plus 10 is 19, 23. 23 and six, 29 points of damage, six necrotic. 
MATT: So after it unleashes attacks on you, how do you want to do this? (relieved cheering) 
MARISHA: You're racking them up, baby! 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
TRAVIS: So you can heal 14. 
ASHLEY: I take-- 
MATT: No, no. Technically, it attacked before you in the turn order. I was getting it to take its turn. 
SAM: That's right. 
MATT: So it still got the attacks. Then Grog got to go. 
ASHLEY: I'll leave it. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Nice! Great. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) (impacts, rewinding) (yelling, whacking) (laughter) 
MATT: There we go! Got it all. Perfect. 
SAM: We understood that. 
MATT: As the corpse of the vidulch collapses into the ground, the rippling flames of Cerkonos's advanced flame speaker elemental (flames lick) flicker up around its broken carapace. 
SAM: Because she can't see from her angle, I'm going to shout to Lieve'tel: Cerkonos, that was amazing! You totally destroyed that vidulch! (laughter) 
SAM: By yourself! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! (laughter) 
SAM: That's it. 
MATT: Okay. Great! (laughter) 
SAM: Just go with it, Grog! 
TALIESIN: We were not this obnoxious. 
SAM: Got to be his wing man. 
MATT: Perfect. All right, so finishing your go, Keyleth, you're up. 
MARISHA: Would you say that it is cloudy outside? 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: With a chance of meatballs? 
MATT: There is definitely a dust storm and clouds above, yeah. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Tuesday ♪ 
MARISHA: So if I wanted to Call Lightning, it would be a little juiced? 
MATT: Yeah, I'd say so. 
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to Call Lightning. 
MATT: What level? 
MARISHA: At 4th-level. 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Because then that will give me 5d10. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Don't understand ♪ 
MATT: Great! Let's go. 
MARISHA: Because if you're saying it's a little windy. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da. Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da. Make sure I can use this action. Call Lightning in one way or another. That's 100% true. So still in my earth elemental form, you see through the cracks of the rocky plating, an electric current starts spiking through as a storm cloud starts to roil above me, and the earth elemental punches, slams down, fist to the ground, and slams a lightning bolt right into the vidulch. 
MATT: Great. Dexterity save for the vidulch. Ooh! 19. 
MARISHA: Fail. 
MATT: Fail. All righty. 
MARISHA: Let's go, baby! 5d10. One, two, three, four, five. That is what-- Oh, I'm Blessed. That's attacks and sa-- Okay. Whatever. 10. 19. 28. No. 27. 27? 
MATT: 27? 
MARISHA: Lightning damage. 
MATT: Great. (lightning crash) It's looking quite injured and its body is buckling a bit. Its mandibles are clutching at the air. All right, so that's your action. Want to move at all? 
MARISHA: That's my action. I'm not in melee range with it, correct? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to move 30 feet back, continuing this movement, this direction. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: That's good right there. 
LAURA: I know, that's what I mean! Earth Keyleth got-- 
MATT: Oh, did you roll a concentration check for me, by the way, for your Bless? 
LIAM: Oh, no, I did not. Sorry. 
MATT: It's okay. 
MARISHA: I feel like this was a later addition. 
LIAM: Yep, yep, yep. 
MATT: 21. So half that. So just roll a 10 or higher. 
LIAM: It's at advantage. I rolled a 16 and a 19. 
MATT: You're fine. 
MARISHA: Damn, it's so close to being dead. I think that's it. I used my action to cast a spell. 
MATT: So with these figures over here. The shrike leaps down to attack these fellows here and get in the path where Scanlan was glancing over to possibly escape. The two figures turn around to start attacking it while this one's going to focus. The Kryn's going to back around to assault the juggernaut. 
TRAVIS: Come on, Kryn! 
MATT: Somebody roll a d20 for that troop there. 
LIAM: I'll do it. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: That's a one. 
LAURA: (groans) No! 
MATT: Oh, natural four. 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
TALIESIN: He beat me. Yeah. I was there. 
MATT: So it's going to-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you don't even want know how good that was. 
MATT: Plunk down this soldier who falls in battle. The juggernaut is holding it strange. 
LAURA: Look how empty this battle map is getting. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Other figures are starting to emerge from further in on this side and are starting to-- 
LAURA: Our guys or bad guys? 
TALIESIN: Those look like bad guys. 
MATT: Vanguard figures are starting to swarm in. 
LAURA: We got to go. Keep going. 
MATT: The devils looking back, blades at the ready, shields up, starting to hold the line on this end. These figures over here, I'd say yeah, (chuckles) on those two corners up there, they're surrounded, but these Judicators are holding their own. They are bludgeoning and smashing. 
TRAVIS: Awesome! 
MATT: I'd say probably two of these figures have gone down at that point as these guys swarm in. 
TRAVIS: Can we take one of these guys down? (nervous laughing) Sorry. 
MARISHA: Oh no! Baddy down! (coconuts clacking) 
MATT: I'll allow it. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, finishing with those troops going on that end, Keyleth done, Lieve'tel, you're up. 
LAURA: Opal and the devils were after Keyleth. 
MATT: Oh, that's right. Yeah. So with that, these devils here are going to go ahead. This one's going to actually-- 
MARISHA: That's a cool band name. 
TALIESIN: ♪ Opal ♪ 
LAURA: Opal and the Devils. 
MARISHA: Opal and the Devils. 
TALIESIN: ♪ Opal and the devils ♪ 
MATT: -- swarm in on these guys here. This one's going to go on this end and swarm into there. So Pike, as you're being swarmed by these handful of creatures, a massive winged horned devil looms over top of you and goes, "Go, we guard." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Dang! 
MATT: Puts the shield down in front. Is going to take two strikes at the two other slithers there. 
LAURA: Why are the devils hot? 
MATT: Both hit! Okay. Both of those slithers. Yeah. Shink, shink. Both of those slithers are taken out, which leaves a path for Pike to try and go. 
LAURA: Go, Pike! Go! 
MATT: Keeps this guy engaged here, over there. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: He's going to take two strikes. One of them hits. That guy over there takes a little bit of damage there for 15. Okay. Yeah, so they're all engaged on that end. That finishes their go. Now, Opal on this end and that guy's going to attack the vidulch twice. 
LAURA: They're going to get them! 
MATT: Both of those hit for-- 
ASHLEY: Get it, get it, get it. 
MATT: -- 14. Opal's going to unleash six attacks against it. Let's see if she does better than last time. 
LAURA: Come on, Opal! 
TALIESIN: Da da. 
MATT: Yeah, it's four hits. 
TALIESIN: Yay! 
MATT: Each of those is going to be-- I'll roll all of these here. Sixes for each of those. (chuckles) So after it's struck with lightning, the devil stabs it twice and backs up with the shield at the way. Opal leaps in the air, hands out. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MATT: You watch as webbing shoots out from the side of her jacket from the inside of her boots and webs up the vidulch beneath her, tightens it up. She lands on top and curls on its back. As she does, you swear you see these mandibles curl out from the inside of her mouth. All of her arms pierce into and underneath its armor, right behind where the back of its neck and head is. They all (whooshes) carve through and this spray of viscera from behind. The vidulch immediately goes from struggling to collapsing limp on the ground. 
ASHLEY: Yay! 
MATT: She stands over it, covered in its gore, and (pants) breathes heavy. At which point, more Vanguard are rushing in this way behind where Percy is. She says, "Go." 
SAM: She's creepy! 
MARISHA: She's cool. 
LAURA: She's cool! 
SAM: She's Madame Web. 
TRAVIS: She's got a few legs. (laughter) 
MATT: So with most of these threats gone or engaged, Vox Machina, you all, with your flame form and your help with the broom as well, you grab Pike and manage to get yourself out of the fray, rushing off towards the ominous red glow of the Malleus Key, beyond a series of these walls. Number of immediate dangers are currently engaged and you watch as another vidulch climbs up a wall to try and strike on you. At which point, you see a massive spined manticore creature leap onto its back. You're uncertain where it came from, but it distracts it just enough, to keep it from watching where you're traversing and sneaking around the side. Eventually, you push into this open, broken, ruin-covered, familiar space where there, flickering with the red glow of the Bloody Bridge, and surrounded by numerous soldiers of all kinds, (whooshes) others arriving across the bridge, the core of the Malleus Fortress. And we'll go there next week. 
TRAVIS: Oh man! That was so good, Matt! Holy shit, man! 
LAURA: That was so cool. 
TRAVIS: That was hectic, dude! 
MATT: That was fun. Just wait until next week, y'all. 
TALIESIN: I am so excited! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: It's the warm-up. 
LIAM: The next map is just going to be a bare grid map, though. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Old pen and paper. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say-- 
MATT: To bring it back home. 
TALIESIN: Just orange lines. Computer, run program! End program! Oh no! (laughter) 
MARISHA: I kind of love that, I'm not going to lie, if it was just the grid paper. 
LIAM: That's pretty cool. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Sharpie. 
ROBBIE: Shopping episode. 
MATT: So we'll pick up from there next week. 
MARISHA: Shopping episode. 
MATT: Thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? (cheering) Good night.

Cooldown[]
TRAVIS: Vox Machina, baby!
LAURA: This is so cool.
SAM: How long did it take you to make this map?
MATT: About an hour, maybe? A little less than an hour.
LAURA: But like--
LIAM: 3D printing all the shards of stone.
MATT: Planning, painting, printing, a long time, and with help from a lot of other folks, too. 
TRAVIS: Is the centerpiece a custom, or did it come like that? The tower growing into the rock? 
MATT: No, it came like that. I was looking for something that fit that sort of visual and found this certain kind of terrain, that-- this is a mixture of different types of terrain in a lot of cases. But I love all these pieces.
TALIESIN: Oh, that's stunning, that weird little Beetlejuicy thing.
MATT: Unless I misremember, this and this were both Keo painted, actually.
TALIESIN: It's got a sheen to it. Like it changes color when you move.
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's really pretty.
TRAVIS: It's so cool because you can see yourself running up one of the slabs of the rock or jumping onto the second ledge of the building.
MATT: My favorite kind of terrain.
ROBBIE: What a terrible place to set up a tent. Ooh! Who's having a nap in there right now?
TRAVIS: There's probably a health potion in there. We didn't check.
ROBBIE: Is it the mess hall?
MARISHA: They went to Fyre Fest.
LIAM: There's just been a guy like this for a full minute.
ROBBIE: Egg sandwich?
TALIESIN: This was not what I was expecting.
TRAVIS: He's just in his bed like--
TALIESIN: None of this was what was advertised.
MATT: This fortress is Vanguard turf when it's not under assault. That being said, still a bad place to put a tent.
MARISHA: Thought I was going to Burning Man.
ROBBIE: Someone is just peeping out of the flap.
TRAVIS: So the horned devils have an angelic appearance?
LAURA: They've just got wings.
MATT: No, they just have big leathery wings. These are just horned devils. This is a place where celestial and devilish powers are kind of working side by side. In the middle of this fray, all of that classic ancient hatred is set aside for the sake and survival of the gods themselves.
ROBBIE: It's very beautiful.
TALIESIN: Is that a new Opal print, by the way? Or is that the old Opal print?
MATT: That is the one that we used for the recent ExU. Then I just drew on the black dripping crown.
TALIESIN: I could see. I was like, that's got some good texture happening.
LIAM: Got to ask Carrero if her ears were burning.
MATT: I hope they were. I love that girl.
SAM: Lieve'tel's mini is really cool, too.
LAURA: Lieve? I love the stars.
ASHLEY: I know, the stars on her cape.
SAM: Where, where, where?
LAURA: They're really tiny, but they're like...
TALIESIN: Oh, there. That's right. That is fun.
ASHLEY: They look like a little under shirt.
LAURA: It feels so good to play as Vox Machina again.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm telling you.
MATT: It's been a bit. 
TRAVIS: These are our OGs.
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: But it's so fun.
MARISHA: I know.
SAM: It is.
MARISHA: I don't know. I was getting nostalgic, just, I don't know. It was a simpler time. When we were playing them. I'm like, "Oh, this is nice."
LAURA: It's nice to not have to worry about anything but go, "I'm going to shoot an arrow."
MARISHA: You're fucking doing some damage, though. One of those arrows--
LAURA: The arrows do some shit.
MARISHA: Yeah, dude.
TALIESIN: I've discovered I love control characters. It is so much fun to just be like, "No, I don't like that."
LAURA: Yeah, I don't like that, boom boom.
SAM: How down are you? How many hit points down?
TRAVIS: I mean, with the bloodaxe, every time I kill somebody, I get 10 temporary hit points, so I think I've only lost 16 points of health.
SAM: Damn.
MARISHA: Crazy.
TRAVIS: Maybe 20.
TALIESIN: I'm still in temporary--
MATT: Oh, I'll work on that next time.
TRAVIS: No! No! No!
SAM: Yeah, I think we did pretty well about not wasting, not using up our higher-level shit.
MARISHA: Not yet. I technically only used one spell.
SAM: I did one 7th-level.
LIAM: Carved down them.
LAURA: I only have 4th-level as my top and I used it, but...
SAM: That's okay.
LAURA: You know. That's okay.
TALIESIN: I got to use one new toy. I was so happy, I got to use one new toy.
TRAVIS: The walking stick?
TALIESIN: Yeah, the walking-- the gentleman's cane, yeah.
TRAVIS: The gun sword?
TALIESIN: The technical name is Briarsbane.
TRAVIS: "Briarsbane".
LIAM: (like Bane) Briarsbane.
LAURA: What was so impressive, Matt, was that there was so much on the board, but you moved the combat along so quickly.
MATT: That was my big challenge to myself, because I wanted this to be epic in the scale that the story deserved, but also running eight level 20 characters with allies simultaneously, with outside forces and things. It was a big challenge to myself and I wasn't sure if it was going to work, so I'm glad it worked out.
ASHLEY: You did it. That was really cool, Matt. (general agreement)
TRAVIS: The way that the different parties would engage and attack and the the different incursions into the map. The vidulches? Get outta here.
SAM: Yeah, it was exciting the whole way through.
TRAVIS: It was confusing.
SAM: I felt like everybody was in it the whole time, even though we ate burritos today.
MATT: That is a very important--
TALIESIN: It was the perfect amount of fog of war, too, where I was. There was an awful lot of: I want to shoot that bit, but I don't know if that's a great idea.
MATT: That was kind of the idea. It was a couple of visual inclinations with coloring here and there, but also with the lighting, hard to see. It's meant to be a challenge to suss out who's good and what's bad.
TALIESIN: The one in the far corner, he's all right, right? That guy sitting in the far corner right there? No, you went too far. He's just up in the stairs.
ROBBIE: The caster over there?
TALIESIN: You were talking about that.
ROBBIE: Been looking at him the whole time! Good or bad?
MATT: He's been just supporting these fighters.
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.
LAURA: They've just been going, yeah.
ROBBIE: I got to know about the red archer, top left. Good or bad?
SAM and TRAVIS: Carmen Sandiego?
TALIESIN: I kept thinking about this and Carmen.
MATT: Most everything here is focused on the Judicator right there. The Judicator's just filled with arrows and is just going and slamming and throwing people off the side.
TRAVIS: I know now why you cry.
MATT: Yeah, I wish I could've done a little more time showing the inside bits, but there's so much to organize between you guys and what you were doing. It just didn't fall into--
LAURA: I fully was envisioning this just like clashing the whole time. 
MATT: That was kind of the idea. It was meant to be just background stuff happening, but I didn't want to put too much focus on that one, I wanted to focus on you guys.
ROBBIE: But we could've-- but we didn't engage with 40% of it, which is wild. But we could've. But we didn't.
TALIESIN: We were smart and did not try to clear the board. You do not clear the board when this is happening.
LAURA: Yeah, just keep going forward.
TALIESIN: You just move through it.
MARISHA: Just carve a path.
MATT: Yeah. You have a goal.
LAURA: We could have moved forward much faster, if we'd just landed and kept going past all of it.
MATT: That was an option, but depending on how that goes, a lot of things also follow.
LAURA: This was all under like a minute.
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Three rounds.
TRAVIS: And Captain Xandis, they were down for the cause.
MARISHA: That was awesome. I kept imagining Keyleth at the front of the ship trying to hold it back, like Peter Parker in "Spider-Man 2". With the ugly face.
MATT: Bless Tobey.
MARISHA: Bless that Tobey McGuire face.
MATT: I love Tobey. He's great in those films, but he makes some faces, man. And I'm one to talk.
LAURA: And we know Essek's brother is still fighting. Wherever he landed when he jumped out of the ship.
MATT: Yeah, you guys saved Verin from a rough landing.
LIAM: People have been so curious about Verin and we could have just not gone after that ship at all, just been like, "Oh, that's sad." Then, poof.
TRAVIS: Dani Carr would have been sad.
ASHLEY: Dani would have been very sad.
MATT: He probably would have survived, but he would have been injured and on his own.
ASHLEY: That's Dani's husband.
MATT: It would have made for its own epic last stand or survival story with him.
SAM: Does he float?
MATT: He does not float.
TALIESIN: They all float down there.
ROBBIE: But that's what makes it feel like war. It felt like those are the stakes. You're in. You drop in and you're on the front line, and that's that.
MATT: Yeah, a lot of people aren't going to make it out of here. Present company possibly included.
TRAVIS: Shut your mouth, Matt.
LAURA: There's so much more over these walls that we don't know about yet.
MATT: Oh, yeah, this is just one square of this massive expansive fortress. It's all like-- well, the whole point of having the armies on the outside attack first was it would draw a lot of the power to the outer walls, so when most of you guys began coming overhead with the skyships, it would give you time to try and push for the center before most of the forces could try and come back to defend the core.
LAURA: So if we would have rolled better when we dove in, we could have hit the Malleus Key straight off?
MATT: You could have gotten closer.
TRAVIS: Maybe. But this is also a good warm-up because we hadn't done this in a minute.
MATT: Yeah, there were three different options depending on where the landing went, with all their different benefits and challenges. Because also landing at the Malleus Key...
LAURA: Could have thrown us into--
TRAVIS: Three different? Matt, that's crazy.
MATT: But I like the variety.
TRAVIS: You prep all that? Man!
SAM: I like to paint minis.
MATT: I like to make fun stuff for my friends.
TRAVIS: Can we also pour one out for the dual pistol reload between Taliesin and Mercer?
LAURA: That was amazing.
TRAVIS: The three-beater? Somebody make a fucking--
MATT: In my head, all I imagined was like old man Percy doing the Henry Cavill (punches).
TALIESIN: Based off of a real weapon.
MATT: Of course. Everything is.
TRAVIS: Well, tell us what it is. I don't know!
ROBBIE: You know you want to.
TALIESIN: Well. It's a combination of two weapons. They actually did put single-shot guns into the bottom of canes. There was a type of quick change, where you would get one good shot.
TRAVIS: Did you have to pull a hammer back for that?
TALIESIN: It was usually-- you could actually have it already sprung and you could just make a trigger shot. It did not go very far. Which is also why the range on that thing is terrible. But it was one little shot. And reloading was impossible. The other one is one of my favorites. It's a 19th century design, French design. It's like Les Diaboliques.
MARISHA: The devil's stick.
TALIESIN: Yeah, the devil's stick. It was actually meant to start riots. It's a cane that actually does-- when you give it a little bit of pressure, hundreds of little razor blades that are completely concealed in the wood grain pop out and it becomes a slashing weapon. So if someone grabs your cane, you go (cane click and blades ejecting) and pull it out and their hands are gone. Then you tap it again and they all vanish. They would use it to start riots in France during the Revolution by slapping the ass of horses in crowds, and then getting away by making their weapon vanish. It was one of three, really. 
TRAVIS: The French came up with some shit, man.
MATT: Yeah they did.
TALIESIN: It was illegal before they had finished the first one. They found out that they were-- and they were like, No. If you get caught, you're fucked. Yeah, the three evils.
TRAVIS: So Percy continues to make things that help and nourish the world.
SAM: Sure.
MATT: Oh, yeah.
TALIESIN: Wait till you see the other shit I made. I got some crazy shit.
MATT: I got an email from Taliesin being like, "So here's a lot of things that Percy would take with him." I'm like...
TALIESIN: You can say no to any of it!
MATT: No, but it all makes sense!
TRAVIS: The Mark IV armor?
MATT: Percy made this in a cave! No, I'm excited for the next episode, y'all.
TRAVIS: Matt, that was great. That's just the teaser. That was great.
LAURA: Good job, Matt.
MATT: You ain't seen nothing yet. All right, see you guys next time.
