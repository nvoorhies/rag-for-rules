Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
ALL: (random noises) 
MATT: All right, we do have some announcements to get through before we jump into tonight's episode, beginning with our sponsor, Warner Bros. Games, and their new game, "Mortal Kombat 1," which is the latest title in the acclaimed Mortal Kombat video game franchise developed by NetherRealm Studios. And here to talk about it is Personal Injury Lawyer, Sweet Sam. 
SAM: Oh, yes. Hold on. Oh, yes. Hello, it's me, Sweet Sam! Have you been injured by the leaping stomp of a four-armed, half-human, dragon man? Was your property damaged when an ice-wielding masked ninja froze your pipes? Were you forced to miss work when the Queen of Edenia's banshee scream cracked all the windows in your Kia Sportage? Then you'll need to call me, Sweet Sam, the Mortal Kombat Personal Injury Lawyer. I take the fight to the fighters and get you a flawless victory-- 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
SAM: -- in court. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
SAM: If Sonya Blade performed her classic leg grab on you without your consent, you may be entitled to compensatory damages up to $400. [cash register ding] And Sweet Sam will "Finish her!" in court. But don't take my word for it. Here's some testimonials from satisfied plaintiffs. 
TALIESIN: I was walking my dog when some guy named Scorpion yelled, "Get over here," and pulled me towards him with a chain. I got really bad whiplash, but I also got $280 [cash register ding] thanks to Sweet Sam's lawsuit. Thanks, Sweet Sam. Ow. 
SAM: I can turn your fatality into a celebrate-tality. 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. 
MATT: (pained laugh) 
SAM: How about this success story? 
LAURA: At college, I was studying for an exam when this guy named Raiden flew through the library yelling nonsense that no one could understand. It kind of sounded like, "Get back in the car?" Anyway, I was so confused that I flunked my test, but Sweet Sam got me an A+ in court [cash register ding] and $115 in compensation. [cash register ding] Thanks, Sweet Sam. 
SAM: You need a lawyer like me because more than ever, "Mortal Kombat 1" is out now. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Skipped a beat there, did we? 
TRAVIS: It's the event horizon! (laughter) 
SAM: Introducing a reborn "Mortal Kombat" universe created by the Fire God-- 
TRAVIS: Don't smile! 
SAM: -- the Fire God Liu Kang. (laughter) (horrified screaming) 
MATT: I hate it! (laughter) (laughter) 
SAM: Featuring reimagined versions of iconic characters. (horrified screaming) (laughter) 
SAM: Iconic characters along with a new fighting system, game modes, bone crushing finishing moves, and more. If Shang Tsung makes you a weak, pathetic fool, let's-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: Wait! (laughter) What? 
SAM: -- let Sweet Sam make you a weak, pathetic fool-- (laughter) [cash register ding] 
SAM: -- with $400 in your pocket. Call 555-FIGHT. (laughter) 
SAM: Give these characters a nut punch in court. (laughter) 
MATT: It's still going! 
SAM: "Mortal Kombat 1" is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Upgrade to the Premium Edition, which includes Kombat Pack 1, featuring Quan Chi, Ermac, and Takeda, along with guest characters Peacemaker, Omni-Man, and Homelander. 
ASHLEY: Woo. 
SAM: Oh, additionally-- (laughter) 
SAM: If you haven't already seen our "Mortal Kombat" one-shot, please make sure to check it out online. It's a lot of fun to watch, and you get to watch me play as Johnny Cage. Get the game today at mortalkombat.com, and thank you, Warner Bros. Games, for sponsoring this episode. Matt, back to you. (cheering) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: So glad I didn't look at that script before that. 
ASHLEY: Top five intros. My favorite is when you start laughing and you try not to and you let out-- 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: I know. 
LIAM: No! 
MATT: That is a nightmare. (laughter) 
MARISHA: That is so-- 
MATT: I appreciate prosthetic teeth that look just like your teeth. It's the most unnecessary thing ever. It's perfect. 
ASHLEY: They just stuck out a little more. 
TALIESIN: It's like a human shark. The next set is just ready to come in once they've gone. 
TRAVIS: A human shark. Grows teeth-- 
MATT: Oh god. 
LIAM: I always knew he had a second set back there. (laughter) 
MATT: Liam, you're up. 
LIAM: Oh man, we got book news. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's right, you're right. Go on. 
LIAM: What I got for you? I got "The Chronicles of Exandria Vol. II: The Legend of Vox Machina" from Darrington Press. We brought it back. Just like the last one, we brought it back. From Darrington Press, "The Chronicles of Exandria Vol. II: The Legend of Vox Machina" art book is available now. It has-- (cheering) 
LIAM: -- 250 pages of artwork from 100 community artists and includes a very cool three-panel foldout illustration by Will Kirkby who's a mad genius from the original printing. Plus, plus, plus, plus, the Darrington Press Edition has nine new pieces of artwork inside. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
LIAM: It's a mystery. Find it all on our CR shops, Darrington Press Guild Stores, and coming soon to other friendly local game stores. And that's not all. Look at that sexy piece of business. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: That's turn it in the light. 
LAURA: Oh my god, it's beautiful! 
LIAM: This is "The Mighty Nein Origins Library Edition Volume I" from Dark Horse. Our "Mighty Nein: Origins" graphic novels from Dark Horse are collected for the first time. This first of the two volumes collects the backstories of Jester, Caleb, Yasha, and Nott the Brave. Delve deep into their pasts and witness what led them to the Mighty Nein. Available now in our Critical Role shops.

MARISHA: Well struck, m'lord. 
MATT: Indeed. Laura.

LIAM: Ooh.

MATT: That's rad. 
SAM: Very comic book-y. 
LAURA: It's in all of our shops. 
TALIESIN: I love it.

LIAM: Mine's size accurate! (laughter) 
SAM: I can't wait to leave this on my couch, and then come home and find Rigatoni has ripped it to shreds. (laughter) 
MATT: That's viable. 
ASHLEY: Riggy. 
MATT: Little halfling ears on Orym. That's so cute. 
LAURA: We've had the prototypes at the house for quite a while, and Ronin is super in love with FCG, so. 
MATT: Marisha, you got announcements. 
MARISHA: The second episode of Candela Obscura: The Circle of Needle & Thread is available to watch right now!

MARISHA: It's available to watch on Twitch and YouTube and our podcast channels. So be sure to tune into the riveting, action-packed, and unmissable finale on Thursday, November 2nd since our live show will be airing on the last Thursday of the month, so this one's adjusting a little bit. Also, I was just going to say real quick, I've seen a lot of questions of people being like, "Do I jump in?" "Do I have to watch Chapter One?" "Do I have to--?" No, just jump right in. 
ASHLEY: Just jump right in. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, little stories. 
MARISHA: The different circles are their own little contained stories. So don't feel like if you've missed the first three that you have to wait for the second three. 
TRAVIS: Don't want to miss the end of this one. 
MARISHA: You don't, oh my god. You don't. Shit gets crazy. Shit gets crazy. Okay, Matt! 
MATT: Yeah, it's my turn now. We are delighted to be back at New York Comic-Con next week! Next week! Join us on Thursday, October 12th and Friday, October 13th for our panel, photo ops, and more.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's an explosion of air. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: So, last we left off-- 
LIAM: Ah. 
MATT: Bells Hells, in seeking answers surrounding Ashton's history, and possible opportunities to prepare themselves better for the coming showdown with the Ruby Vanguard, you find yourselves in the Shattered Teeth, a collection of islands left in the destruction of the once continent Domunas. Here, you've gone onto a ghost ship to find passage to the island of Kalutha. Upon taking this journey across the sea with them, you helped bring a long separate romance to a singular unit between the captain and their navigator. 
LIAM and ASHLEY: ♪ Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match ♪ 
MATT: (laughs) Had a celebration, and then were dropped off rather rapidly on the outskirts of the island you seek. As you peruse the black pebble beaches, you found a couple of caverns, one that led up to the actual clifftop surface of the island itself for a better view. Upon clambering through the caverns, a sight was missed on one of the creatures that apparently called it home, and you did a battle with a terrifying massive worm creature that was intent on making you its next meal. Surviving the encounter, destroying the creature, and gathering a few odd objects from its nest that gave you some clues as to the denizens of this island, you clambered out to the surface, where you could see the mist shrouded island stretched out before you. Not as dense as the central sea, and the previous island you had ventured towards, but still somewhat obscured by the shifting fog that seems to blow with the wind over the stretching jungles and rainforest before you. The mounting massive shadows of the three mountains that mark a central portion of this region of the island, seemingly a signifier of your destination. So, Bells Hells, having taken a short rest, stepping up into the late morning midday obscured sun, the disparate disseminated fog filled daylight that gives some visual perspective on the path before you, what would you like to do? 
LIAM: We're still pretty walled in with fog in all directions? 
MATT: It's mostly, it's much thinner here on the island. You can make out details and as it shifts with it, you can see more as it goes. It's not as choking as it was so close to the sea, necessarily, the further in you go. 
SAM: What's going on over there? 
TRAVIS: I was just asking if it quivers and shifts-- 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Oh god. Mm, mm, no. (laughter) 
SAM: We see it, our destination, right? It's just far away. 
MATT: You can see the shape at times of these large shadows of these three mountains. At times you have no visual sight, and at times as the mists move by, you can just make out the distant shape of them. 
SAM: I mean, we-- 
LAURA: Yeah, we head in that direction. 
SAM: -- go there, yeah? 
LAURA: How far away does it feel? 
MATT: You can make a nature check, or a perception check, your choice. 
LAURA: What about a survival check? 
MATT: Mm, not for this one, necessarily. 
TRAVIS: I'll assist you, pressing my nature ridden body all over you. 
SAM: My nature body. 
MARISHA: (laughs) My nature body! (laughter) 
LAURA: Get off me, Chet. 
LIAM: Quite-- 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: Quite the poet, Travis. (laughter) 
LAURA: A 14 plus nature? 
TRAVIS: Purple prose. (laughs) 
LAURA: Or what was the other one I could? 
MATT: Nature or perception. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
LAURA: 15. 
MATT: 15, okay. 
TALIESIN: I had a retort and then it died. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: It looks like it's about 25 to 30 miles off. 
SAM: Oof. 
LAURA: Seems like a lot. 
ASHLEY: It's far. 
MATT: Which, you know, it's a decent distance, but the travel between is very dense jungle and rainforest. 
LAURA: Even worse. 
MATT: So, it's probably going to be the better part of a two-day journey on foot, if unimpeded, and you're lucky. You have no idea what lies beneath the canopy before you. 
SAM: I could try to Teleport us there. 
LAURA: It's right there, I mean, you can see it. 
SAM: Does that work that way? (laughs) 
LAURA: Maybe. (laughs) 
SAM: How does Teleport work? 
LAURA: You can see the destination, I feel like it'd be easy. 
SAM: Yeah, right? 
LIAM: I think so. 
SAM: I'm going to just-- 
LAURA: Although I did hear-- 
SAM: I'm going to think in my magical knowledge if I understand that seeing where you want to go increases the odds of a Teleport working. 
MATT: It increases your familiarity, yeah. If you wanted to take some time, and scope it from a distance, if you had other spells-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- that could help in that-- 
LAURA: If we had a looking glass! 
TALIESIN: A looking glass of some kind! Which we don't know about. 
LIAM: None of you know that I took it, and-- 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LIAM: Are you saying this out into the air? 
SAM: I know-- 
LAURA: God, I wish we had-- 
SAM: I saw the last episode! (laughter) 
SAM: I watch. Unlike Sam Riegel-- 
TRAVIS: I was there! 
SAM: -- Fresh Cut Grass watches this show. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Insight check. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: 12. Never mind. 
TRAVIS: Remember there's woe steel, sacred to the Ossended Host. To the charm, okay. We could just hoof it, and see what we find for a little bit. 
SAM: Technically, I have a spell-- 
TALIESIN: We ain't hoofing it. 
SAM: -- that could, it just point-- It finds the path. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Find the Path is a great-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: That's a great spell. 
SAM: It's still 30 miles away. It's still a long path. 
TRAVIS: It's going to go-- 
LAURA: It's going to-- 
TRAVIS: -- that way. (laughter) 
LIAM: The mountain? 
ASHLEY: Straight ahead. 
LAURA: But doesn't it show you the path of least resistance? 
SAM: Technically. 
MARISHA: Fearne, could you shuttle us a little bit? 
ASHLEY: Well, I was trying to see if I could. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Can you shuttle? 
ASHLEY: Like a-- 
MARISHA: Shuttle? 
SAM: Like fly? 
LAURA: How? 
MARISHA: Fly? 
LAURA: Can you turn into one of those giant toads that... 
ASHLEY: Oh, I could try, and then you all could get in my belly. 
TRAVIS: In your mouth? 
ASHLEY: In my belly. 
LAURA: We get in Fearne's mouth. 
TALIESIN: I feel like without some infrastructure in there, it might get really acidic, but maybe that's just me. 
SAM: We could take some time, maybe build something. 
ASHLEY: Well, I could keep my mouth open the whole time, so you guys could breathe. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's going to be like those photos of people with 200 cigarettes in their mouth. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Oh jeez. 
TRAVIS: Guinness Book of World Records. 
MARISHA: If we had-- 
ASHLEY: I kind of love it. 
MARISHA: If we make a giant, you turn into a stork, and we make a giant little baby basket for us, and we all-- 
LAURA: I feel like-- 
TRAVIS: You mean a pelican or a stork? 
LAURA: We'd be so heavy for one. 
MARISHA: A stork. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Okay! (laughs) 
LAURA: One little old stork. 
SAM: I can get it for TikTok, and we could do it like those people who make camper vans on TikTok. 
MARISHA: Mm! 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: No? 
LAURA: What's TikTok? 
SAM: Oh, okay. (laughs) It's what my heart does. 
TRAVIS: Aw, man. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
ASHLEY: Storks. I mean, I could try to pick some of us up, and fly us. 
TALIESIN: But then there's a whole bunch of us that aren't going to-- 
LAURA: Yeah, let's just walk, let's just try to hoof it. 
MARISHA: There's a few rounds, you know? 
TRAVIS: There's a general canopy of vegetation, and trees, and such? 
MATT: Very much so, the mass jungle here as you see it, it's a smattering of deep verdant greens, light greens, yellows, and some other pale colors that create this wonderful patchwork rolling canopy that rolls out, that is occasionally punched through by hills of basalt rock that, some of them carry these long stretching points at angles that almost curve, and come to a stop. All these oddly angled protrusions that break from the canopy, some, the actual mountain itself erupting as well before it stops at a peak. There's a handful that you can see almost form a bridge, or might form a bridge from place to place. 
LAURA: Oh-- 
MATT: You aren't-- 
LAURA: So, we could up and over. 
TRAVIS: See, that would be cool, because remember, before the pirate ship, which feels like a lifetime ago, the last time there was shit in the air, flying through the clouds of a dramatic, dramatic size. 
LAURA: Also, we did hear that the magic here in the Shattered Teeth-- 
MARISHA: It's weird. 
LAURA: -- is very weird, and Teleporting might to rip us apart, we could end up all on different islands. 
SAM: I thought that we just heard that magic is weird everywhere. It's weirder here? 
LAURA: Yeah. Right? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: That's what we heard. 
MATT: The islands have weird magic about them. You're uncertain if that refers to it affecting magic as it's used naturally, or they're just oddly magical. 
TRAVIS: Think you're right-- 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: The islands are moving in different directions, so, shit is cray! (laughter) 
LIAM: So, we're hiking? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm happy to hike. 
LIAM: Sure. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: If I did fly, how do I, how far do I, how long do I think it would take? 
MATT: Depends on the speed of the creature you would transform into. 
ASHLEY: I mean. 
MARISHA: Because we could even do little short distances. 
ASHLEY: Do little short distances, yeah. 
MARISHA: You know, little-- 
LAURA: Just like-- 
MARISHA: Fly some of us 500 feet, come back, fly us 500 feet, then we creep forward-- 
TRAVIS: And separate the group? 
LAURA: I just, oh. 
MARISHA: Eh, why not? 
TRAVIS: Great idea! (laughs) 
MARISHA: Why not? We've done that so much, and it's always successful! 
TRAVIS: I was being enthusiastic. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (murmurs) 
MARISHA: I can't tell with your crotchety tones. 
TRAVIS: It's just my old-ass face. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Some of us can fly, some of us could-- 
ASHLEY: Right, well, I mean, I could be a giant toad, but it's that big enough to carry everything? 
SAM: How big is a giant toad? 
LIAM: That's like-- 
MATT: A giant toad? What size does it say the creature is? 
TRAVIS: Please say gargantuan. 
LIAM: It's like a Mini Cooper. 
MATT: On the upper left, it should say, large, huge. 
ASHLEY: Large beast. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: So it's about 10 feet wide. 
LAURA: Okay, so, maybe two or three people. 
TALIESIN: Easily fit a third of us. 
SAM: 10 feet can fit the whole group, remember the rafts? 
MATT: Yeah, it could fit Chetney and Orym in your mouth. 
TRAVIS: Ooh, and we're sitting there with a mini gun, and it'll be fucking dope! 
LAURA: In your mouth. Chetney and Orym could be in your mouth. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Then I could, some of you could be on top. 
LAURA: Mm-mm, I didn't say anything. 
ASHLEY: Carrying, maybe. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Then some could fly. 
LAURA: Then some could fly. 
SAM: A couple people could fly. 
TALIESIN: Walking it is, then. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Walking, walking? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Walking. 
ASHLEY: It's an option, it's an option. 
TRAVIS: We walk! 
LAURA: Let's just move, let's just start moving. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: We can discuss this while walking. 
LAURA: If it gets too hard, then we'll-- 
SAM: Yeah, we've got options. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, if it gets weird. 
MARISHA: We have options. 
ASHLEY: We have options, yeah, we have options. 
LIAM: Plus, we're on the Shattered Teeth, let's go look at it. 
TALIESIN: I want to see this shit. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's walk. 
TRAVIS: As we begin towards this, can I do a general, (sniffs) what's on the wind? Anything that's coming this way? 
MATT: Certainly, make a perception check for me. 
TRAVIS: Oh, sure, I would love to. 
TALIESIN: If we're saying that out loud, I was about to tell you to stop. My character. 
LAURA: Oh, mm. 
TRAVIS: 16. Hmm. 
LAURA: Oh, ow. 
MARISHA: I knew it was really, I feel like they always go for you. 
MATT: 16. 
MARISHA: They don't go for me. 
LAURA: (gasps) You know, I could be a-- 
SAM: You can. 
MATT: Yeah? 
ASHLEY: Why not? 
LAURA: A walking bug zapper. 
MATT: Honestly, you probably would be. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Just a little bit of zapping. 
TRAVIS: Crackling (electric charging) 
MATT: (bugs being zapped) 
MARISHA: I love this so much. 
TALIESIN: You would just be a disappointment to them at that point. 
MATT: Yeah, that's-- 
MARISHA: I am. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: All those suffering from mosquitoes. 
MATT: That's a passive cantrip if you want to keep that, yeah. 
LAURA: Yes, okay, yes, I want to do that. 
TRAVIS: That's playing up vengeance for the mosquitoes that plague the outdoors. 
TALIESIN: There's really only three of us that that would work well with. 
SAM: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Just the three of you. 
SAM: Only three of us have-- 
TALIESIN: It'd just be-- (hard clicks) 
SAM: -- consumable blood. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: That's true. 
LIAM: Your tail just swishing them away. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm just wiggling my tail the whole time. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: (swishing) 
MATT: As you all begin to crest down into the soft underbrush of the jungle exterior, first off, what's your marching order, and who is leading the trek? 
SAM: Hmm. 
LIAM: I'll go second. 
MARISHA: Chetney is leading. 
LIAM: Little guys up front. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: Chetney's leading. 
ASHLEY: I'll go behind. 
TRAVIS: Follow your nose! 
ASHLEY: I'll go behind Orym. 
SAM: I weirdly have-- 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: -- decent survival. 
TALIESIN: I'll go next to Fearne. 
ASHLEY: I do, too. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: You should-- 
LAURA: We'll be behind them, or I'll be behind them, I just assume-- 
MARISHA: I'll be next to Imogen. 
LIAM: We should put the-- 
MATT: All right. FCG is in the back? 
LIAM: -- casters in the back. 
SAM: I feel like Fearne should be up front, everybody. 
ASHLEY: Well, I feel like he's got a high survival, too. 
SAM: Not as high as hers. 
LAURA: A high what? 
SAM: Survival. 
MARISHA: He's-- 
ASHLEY: A good survival. 
LAURA: Oh shit! How did your survival get so high? 
ASHLEY: I don't know. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
ASHLEY: I just never use it. 
MARISHA: I love a survivalist just by dumb luck. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. (laughter) 
MARISHA: How have you survived all this time? I don't know. 
ASHLEY: I'm not sure. 
MATT: I've known a few people like that, actually. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: (spacey) Those trees look pretty groovy. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughter) 
MATT: Harley is definitely one of them. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh man. 
MATT: So, you're leading, or who's leading? 
ASHLEY: Oh, wait, no. I think Chet is, but I can assist. 
MATT: So Chet's leading the front. 
TRAVIS: This leg, yeah. 
MATT: FCG's the caboose. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'll assist you, Chet. 
SAM: Choo-choo. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: You're welcome. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: I won't track, I will listen for threats. Listen and look for threats. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, before we leave, can I see that amulet again, that we found? 
LIAM: Zwoop. 
MARISHA: The Aishio-- 
LAURA: Zoo-zoop. 
LAURA: Aishio? 
TRAVIS: Ratio charm? 
ASHLEY: Aishio. 
MARISHA: The Raito charm. 
SAM: The Raito charm. 
MARISHA: From the Aishio culture. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: The Ratio charm. 
MARISHA: You see, I think-- 
TRAVIS: Is it Raito? 
MARISHA: I think with-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: I think so, yeah. 
MARISHA: -- Delilah kind of being in my head again, I think I can read languages again. I switched out my eldritch feats. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Hey! Justifying it the story, yeah! 
MARISHA: Justifying it in the story, but I switched some stuff. 
MATT: I dig it. 
SAM: Seamless. 
LIAM: Why did you turn and start talking to that tree? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We've got to kill her now. 
MARISHA: Laudna just-- (laughs) Yeah! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (unsheathing sword) 
MARISHA: I knew this time would come! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We never talk about the fourth wall. There are rules. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, so you're-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: You're using-- 
MARISHA: Eyes of the Runekeeper. 
MATT: Eyes of the Runekeeper of your invocation. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
MATT: All right, so, taking this relic that you had uncovered, and rubbing some of the dirt off of it, and looking at the scrolling and script that surrounds it, it is Ywan, which is the base language of the Host. You watch as the symbols and carvings begin to take shape in your mind in a way that you can understand. One of the phrases reads, "My promise to Shotas." 
MARISHA: My promise to Shotas? 
SAM: Shotas? 
TRAVIS: Like a name, Shotas, or just? 
MATT: A name, Shotas. 
SAM: Shotas. 
MARISHA: S-H-O-- 
TRAVIS: My promise to-- 
MATT: S-H-O-T-A-S. 
SAM: ♪ Shotas ♪ 
TRAVIS: S-H-O-T-- 
SAM: ♪ At the Apollo ♪ 
MATT: Another one says, "My love of my children, Ro and Sakagi." 
LIAM: Oh, oh my goodness. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Aw. 
MARISHA: My children-- 
SAM: Sakagi. 
TRAVIS: Cool names. 
MATT: Another one-- 
MARISHA: And Shy-- 
TRAVIS: Shakagi. 
MATT: Sakagi. 
LAURA: I got that. 
TALIESIN: Sakagi. 
MARISHA: Sakagi. 
SAM: Chicago. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Another one reads, "My faith in the cycle of destruction and creation, endless." 
LAURA: (moans) 
LIAM: It's really tiny print. 
MATT: It is. The whole thing is covered in scrawlings. 
ASHLEY: My faith in destruction-- 
LAURA: In the cycle of-- 
TRAVIS: My faith in the cycle of-- 
MATT: Destruction and creation, endless. 
LAURA: Destruction and creation. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: This little, notepad's almost out. 
MATT: Another one reads-- 
MARISHA: Oh jeez. 
LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MATT: You wanted to read it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: "My guilt over my father, Gyodoba." 
LIAM: Gyodoba. 
MATT: In looking at it, all of these are inscripted into this polished, deep red stone. As you look back at the top of the chain, there is a single name that is inscripted along the cage encasing it, and that reads Iffodola. 
MARISHA: Iffodola? 
LAURA: Iff-- how you spell that? 
MATT: I-F-F-O-D-O-L-A. 
LAURA: Iffodola. 
LIAM: All right. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: So what do you get? What's the sense of this? Is this-- Well, what is this thing? What was it used for? 
MARISHA: So I mean, it's obviously deeply personal to-- 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: Iffodola, I'm assuming that's whom this belongs to. It's almost as if it's a promise. 
LIAM: It seems like a reminder of their priorities. 
MARISHA: Reminder, yeah. Almost not too different to people keeping lockets of loved ones. 
SAM: Do we know how old this thing is? No, right? 
TALIESIN: Doesn't seem that old, if I-- 
LAURA: Mm, I don't remember. 
SAM: Could these people still be alive? 
MATT: Make an investigation check, if you want to take a look at it. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: What its age may be. 
LIAM: I rolled pretty high on history, knowing about-- 
MATT: Knowing about it. 
LIAM: About it. 
MATT: There's a difference between knowing history, and being able to inspect an object, and see how long it's been sedentary. 
LIAM: Of course, but do, from my amateur knowledge of history, do I know how long the culture has existed on Exandria, or--? 
MATT: More or less. You know that the Ossended Host has been around for a number of centuries. 
LIAM: Centuries, okay. 
MATT: They are one of the cultures, the overarching culture that emerged after the destruction of Domunas, and the slow reclamation of the islands once the dust had settled from the destruction of the continent that came before. 
LIAM: One more follow up question. 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Is Orym's amateur knowledge that it's an ongoing culture, or something of history? 
MATT: I'd say, as far as you know, it's still present. You know, no one's said "the lost culture of the Ossended Host." 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You know, small relics and mentions of them still creep up from time to time, though people refer to them as a very, like a lot of things in the Shattered Teeth, things that are out there, but doesn't really encounter our life, so we don't spend too much mind to it. The place is a little odd and dangerous, and spooky, so-- 
LIAM: Thank you. 
MATT: We don't worry ourselves with it. That's a lot of the larger Exandrian vibe. 
TALIESIN: Like Oxnard. 
MATT: (laughs) Yes. 
LIAM: Never go to Oxnard. 
MARISHA: Can we discern, just based on how long-- 
LIAM: Sorry, Oxnard. 
MARISHA: -- it's been in the dirt potentially how old it is? 
MATT: You can make an investigation, yeah. 
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to shine my light on it and I'll say: Fearne, can you take a look at this and investigate it for age? Because I'm not that good at it. I'm going to help you by shining my bright lights on it. 
MATT: There you go. 
ASHLEY: I'm very not good at investigation. 
SAM: Okay, great. 
ASHLEY: Like a minus situation. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: You suck, don't you? 
MARISHA: Also, very mediocre. 
SAM: Chetney! 
TRAVIS: Yeah? 
SAM: Get over here and look at this thing. 
TRAVIS: I'm dope! Let me at it. 
LIAM: I'm so old. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm going to shine my light on it to help you. 
LAURA: He can't even see anymore! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm just staring at your armpit. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: It looks like, based on the layers of muck and sediment that were wiped off of it, and still remain in the nooks and crannies, it's probably been there for a number of years, possibly even a decade or two. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: But not centuries. 
LAURA: They could definitely still be around. 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. Yep. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 
MATT: All right, so-- 
LIAM: All right. 
MARISHA: All right, now we can walk. 
TALIESIN: Destruction and creation. 
MATT: Very well. 
SAM: We walk. 
TRAVIS: I don't think we ever did the (sniffs) smell check. 
MATT: No, we didn't get around to that. So a heavy sense of rich, healthy nature. The lands here, due to the presence of heavy volcanic rock beneath and surrounding the earth here is very, very mineral rich. The trees here are very vibrant and lively. The colors that you see that shift from tree type to tree type, though they intermingle often, they're lush and the smell of healthy vegetation fills the air deeply. There are all manner of vines that fall and tangle and wind from treetop to treetop. You catch visions of small creatures that scurry and dart off into the trees as you walk through the jungle in a non stealthy way. The occasional crunch or snap of twig and brush beneath your boots sends them curiously rushing off, but still looking back. That's apparently what you pick up. Nothing else that seems to cause any alarm or worry at the moment. 
TRAVIS: Does the heavy fog cover, does it diffuse the sunlight that's coming down or is it just low level so that it hits where it hits and where it breaks through? 
MATT: It diffuses it somewhat, as you get beneath the canopy. It's like there's a two-layered fog. There's the mist that settles over the top of the canopy. Then there's a low one that flows through the jungle floor itself. Only maybe about two feet off the ground and it's not very thick, but you can see the wisps passing through as you move. 
TRAVIS: Can we get a fog machine? Cool! 
MARISHA: Probably. 
MATT: So you are leading the troop? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll survival for me. 
ASHLEY: I was assisting you. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: You're welcome. 
LIAM: As a reminder, Orym's going to be on threat alert. 
MATT: Understood. 
LIAM: So, perception. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MATT: 17, okay. And your perception roll? 
LIAM: That'll be a 24. 
MATT: 24, great. The first leg of your slow march into this jungle seems relatively uneventful. You catch up and begin to notice there are some paths that are worn through here definitely. There are some walkways or hunting paths that look like they've been trekked enough over the ages to where the vegetation hasn't fully reclaimed that portion of the forest floor. They mostly run parallel from what you've come across now, which leaves you to wonder if it's the best choice to take and you're uncertain if that means if it's a safer route or just one that's more visible. But the choice is yours. You can attempt to follow one of these trails or you continue pushing through the jungle towards the direction of the mountains that you're seeking. 
TRAVIS: I think the beaten path sounds good. Only because shit's crazy here. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Yeah, sure. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll start that way. 
MATT: All right. To the right or left? 
TRAVIS: Right. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Do we want to flip a coin? 
LAURA: Did you say it looked like-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! Yes! 
LAURA: -- an intentional trail marked by someone or did it look like-- 
MATT: It looked like enough foot traffic has come through over time that the vegetation hasn't reclaimed the ground like it is in other. 
LAURA: Okay. I know what's happening. 
TRAVIS: FCG, do you think you could hook us up with the Changebringer and see if we could get a vote? 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: We could split up. 
SAM: No! 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: I will flip a coin and use Guided Grace. It says I can ask a simple yes or no question, but I'm modifying that. Heads right, tails left. Is that all right? 
MATT: I mean, if you're just flipping the coin for the sake of finding an answer. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Or you could say: Is the right the safer place and that-- 
SAM: Yeah, that. 
MATT: That would be how you would phrase it. It is still yes or no answer. 
ASHLEY: That one. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Well, I then don't need to-- 
MATT: Well, flip it because it's fun. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: Vibe check. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Wait. Is the right-- 
TRAVIS: Tails. 
SAM: -- the right path? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Heads yes, tails no? 
MATT: Heads. 
LAURA: Okay, so heads. 
SAM: It is heads! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: That's amazing! (laughter) (laughter) 
MATT: All right. Following the right beaten path, it does wind quite a bit. While it seemed to veer off in the direction you were going, about an hour of following it, it does begin to curve back in towards this valley. The valley is still descending. It's a very slow, gradual climb down. You can see at some points, you have to step down off of hill sides and slightly declining hillocks where the trees themselves are bursting through and occasionally come upon a massive basalt risen pillar that comes up and then breaks at a certain point, whether it was weathered or destroyed by something, you don't know. But you do notice that as you begin to descend, the canopy doesn't descend with you. The trees just get taller-- 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: -- and wider. While your view from the top, from the edge of the island looked like it was a pretty even, rolling straight shot, you get the feeling the more you go, that it's just going to get deeper and deeper into a valley bowl, the further into the island you go. 
ASHLEY: (breathy) Oh! 
LAURA: Shit. 
TRAVIS: It's like the Amazon. Canopy cover. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: The air itself does grow more dense with moisture, a cold moisture. You notice that the foliage in the trees shifts from a natural island jungle, and you begin to see signs of true rainforest peeking through. The trunks get wider and thicker. The sheer density of the natural foliage and life that affixes themselves to these trees become more and more present. You can see through the many branches the bit of diffused sunlight gets a little harder and harder to see. Some of these trees now climbing upwards 80, 100 feet and still climbing as you progress for a secondary hour, your third hour. You probably have, based on your memory, about four more hours of travel before you begin to lose sunlight. You gather you have another day or so of travel depending on how well you continue to follow this path or others as you go. 
LAURA: We're just descending? 
MATT: Just slowly descending and pulling through. You do also notice, you with your perception up as you go too, occasionally stopping because you hear some sort of a heavy grunt or a distant echoing guttural call. You stop everyone, and you can see some bushes in the distance move quickly. (foliage shuffling) You notice-- Well, the rest of you can hear the sounds. You see three large, heavy brown furred beasts traveling in a small troop of three, just galloping through the jungle. You get a quick glance and they have these massive hog-like heads. It looks like a massive boar as it trudges through, but its head seems wide at the front, like the skull spreads out like a shield. You do not see eyes from where you can see as it darts past. You have pretty high perception, but as much as you can see, they seem to be rushing through the jungle before vanishing off. Not noticing your presence, but definitely making you aware that they exist and others like them may out on the way. 
LIAM: When they came, did they come fast? 
MATT: They went pretty quick. 
LIAM: Okay. So there wasn't a lot of warning time. 
MATT: No, it was like a (quick gallop). You stop everyone and watch them again tear through and then vanish back off into the-- 
MARISHA: Should we be moving more-- 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Just to have. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: That's a good idea. 
MATT: This will slow your trek if you're going stealthily. 
ASHLEY: Oh. All right. 
MATT: Which may add more time to your journey. But it'll be safer. 
SAM: How long does it last? 
MATT: The call is yours. 
LAURA: But with Pass Without a Trace, can we move at a normal pace but still-- 
ASHLEY: It only lasts up to an hour. 
MATT: Let's see what it says. 
LIAM: Like a quieter normal? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Yeah, like a quieter normal pace. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: ♪ Pass Without a Trace ♪ 
SAM: What if we get a plus five and we move at a regular speed? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So you still make sound as you go, but if you choose to be stealthy, then you get the bonus to your stealth check. You also don't leave tracks, which is helpful for not being tracked, but you have to actively be stealthing in order to gain the bonus of additional stealth check. 
SAM: We don't know if we're in danger right now. Maybe we should save it for when we are. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe we should wait. 
LAURA: Yeah, save it. 
ASHLEY: Because it only lasts for an hour. 
LAURA: Okay, save it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, save it. 
TALIESIN: Save it at least until it starts to get dark out. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. For the next leg of this journey, I need you to roll another survival check for me. 
TRAVIS: Ah, ah! 
ASHLEY: Guidance, I'm assisting you. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh, Guidance. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: (grimaces) 14. No, 13. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LAURA: Even with Guidance? 
TRAVIS: It wasn't a good roll! 
LAURA: She would've roll higher than that if she rolled a one. You should let Fearne be leading this shit. 
ASHLEY: Well-- 
TRAVIS: Why don't you just relax and enjoy the view back there? 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: If we get into trouble-- 
TRAVIS: Paradise. 
LIAM: Little guide? 
TALIESIN: She's going to strain her neck looking down that much. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Could you roll a d6 for me, please? 
SAM: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
LIAM: Here we go. Come on. Fuck it up, Travis. 
MARISHA: Oh shit, oh shit. 
TRAVIS: My favorite kind. 
TALIESIN: Ruin us. 
LIAM: Come on, what you and I like. 
TRAVIS: Two. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Two. Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh, he smirked. 
TALIESIN: He smirked. 
SAM: He smirked. 
SAM: Because it's nothing. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: White dragon. (laughs) 
MATT: A short trek later-- 
MARISHA: What is it doing here? 
MATT: -- you begin to hear the sound of nearby rushing water, and you begin to notice that there is a winding river that is carving through the floor. Whether it be from rain, moisture, or some unseen source of water, a river is winding through the jungle. 
LIAM and LAURA: Runs through it. 
MATT: Also in a descending path as it makes its way towards the center of this valley itself. It's about 15 or so feet wide. You can hear at some points where it crests off of some of the hills. There's a small, maybe five foot waterfall, but nothing too dangerous. It's your choice to either cross it or continue to follow it along. 
TRAVIS: Ah, a source of water. Life for the plants and animals of this region. 
MARISHA: Well done. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: Is he okay? 
MARISHA: Well done. 
LAURA: I don't know what's happening with him. 
SAM: Is he becoming a novelist? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We could continue on, but it might throw us off course. We could traverse this raging water and be on our merry way. 
LAURA: Maybe cross it? 
TRAVIS: How fast does the water look like it's going? Just like-- 
MATT: It's not like a rushing river, but it's-- 
TRAVIS: If we threw a stick in it, is it like (hums) or it's like boosh! 
MATT: No, it's cruising gently. (laughter) Like I said, it's 15 feet wide. So it's a decent volume of water that's been pushing through this jungle for a while. But it's not traveling at an expedited white rapids pace. It's just, you're uncertain how strong the current is or how deep it goes from this perspective. 
MARISHA: Maybe do the stick check? 
TRAVIS: Not of concern. I'm just-- No. 
MARISHA: No? Okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: No, you test it. 
TRAVIS: Stick check is good. Yeah, stick check is good. 
LAURA: Do you want us to carry you, Chet? 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
LAURA: I'm just saying if it's, you know-- 
TRAVIS: Why yes, Imogen. 
LAURA: I can't do it, but maybe FCG can-- Oh wait. 
SAM: You want me to carry him? 
ASHLEY: Wait, can you go-- 
SAM: Sure. 
TALIESIN: How clear is this water? 
LAURA: Can you go in the water? 
SAM: Yeah, I can go in the water. 
TRAVIS: Great question. 
SAM: I'll just rust and die, but it's okay. 
MATT: The water itself seems pretty clear. 
LIAM: Do you have, like, pontoons that come out? 
MATT: Though there is enough sediment being picked up at the different breaks in the rock beneath it where you can't quite see the bottom. 
MARISHA: I'm going to do the stick check. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Take a meter plus stick and see how deep it goes. 
TRAVIS: Meter plus. 
MATT: About five feet out, it goes to about three feet and it's a slow and then sudden drop to where the stick completely submerges about a third of the way across. 
LIAM: Orym's going to hand you one end of his rope. Then he's going to run 10 feet to the edge of the water and then leap 20 feet over. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Here, I hand you the immovable rod. 
LIAM: Oh, do we have two of those now? 
MARISHA: We do. 
LIAM: Whoa! 
LAURA: We have two rods? 
MARISHA: We could full like-- 
LIAM: That's luxurious. 
SAM: How did we get two rods? 
MARISHA: I started the campaign with one. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Then we got another one from-- 
LIAM: Got another one then Ash built it into their hammer. 
TALIESIN: Into the hammer. 
LAURA: That's right. 
MARISHA: That's right, you put it in the hammer. 
TALIESIN: It's in the hammer. 
LAURA: Wow. 
LIAM: Okay. So, all right. I leap over with the immovable rod and once I get over there, (clicks rod). I tie the rope. 
SAM: Great! This is awesome. 
ASHLEY: This is a great idea. 
SAM: Good teamwork, you two. 
LAURA: Easy. No problem. 
ASHLEY: Nice, yes. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: ♪ That's fucking teamwork ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ Teamwork ♪ 
SAM: Okay, I'll hold the rope while you guys go. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you don't need to do that. I'm going to use the hammer to get to the other side of the rope and tie it off. We now have-- 
LAURA: How are you going to get that hammer-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to take it with me. 
LAURA: Oh, so you'll be the last? 
MARISHA: So you'll be last? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll be the last and you all have to drag me across in case something goes terribly, terribly wrong. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: While they're doing all this, I'm going to take out my fishing tackle that we bought forever ago. Just get a stick, tie, see if I can catch anything. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: That's great. Roll a survival check. 
TALIESIN: It's less intentional than you think. Just kind of happens sometimes. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 19! (laughs) 
MATT: 19. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
MATT: Once the rope is set up, and it takes a moment to do so, you quickly fashioned this stick, let it loose, and maybe about 60 seconds, about a full minute or so, you get a heavy tug. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: You pull, pull, and get pulled in and eventually drag it over to the bank and sure enough, flopping, it's a good 10-inch long, it looks like a rainbow trout almost. 
TRAVIS: Oh! You guys! You guys! I take the chisel out. (intense slashing) 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Gack it on the back of the head. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LIAM: Oh, you didn't filet? 
TRAVIS: No. (laughs) 
LIAM: You knocked it out? 
LAURA: Yeah, you can bludgeon it. 
ASHLEY: Well, we'll wait for later. 
MARISHA: Can you get another one of those? That'd be good dinner. 
SAM: Wow. 
TRAVIS: (sniffs) Does it smell okay? Natural, alive, nothing undead? Tell me the truth. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Go ahead. 
LIAM: Why are you talking to a tree? 
TRAVIS: Tree? 
MARISHA: Loving it, trout. 
MATT: If you would like to make an investigation check on it to see if it is anything beyond-- 
TALIESIN: Now I'm worried. 
MATT: It's investigation or nature, your choice. 
TRAVIS: Oh, investigation. 19. 
MATT: 19. It looks like a healthy fish. 
TRAVIS: Hey! 
MATT: The only difference from that sort of trout that you've seen before, is as opposed to those long catfish whiskers, it has a single one of those that dangles further than the length of its full body and flows behind it about another foot, like it has its own dangling line that it carries behind it. 
TRAVIS: Huh. 
SAM: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Okay, city boy paranoia just kicked in. Can we get Pâté to do something for me really quickly? 
MARISHA: You want something from Pâté now? 
TALIESIN: I do. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MARISHA: I thought you didn't trust him. 
TALIESIN: I don't. 
MARISHA: What do you want from him? 
TALIESIN: I want him to get into the water and splash around a bit. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: Can he swim? 
MARISHA: Use him as bait? 
TALIESIN: Yes, that's exactly what I want to do. 
ASHLEY: Well, what happens if he gets eaten? Is he gone forever? 
LIAM: It's reusable bait. 
MARISHA: He's all right. He'll be back. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I have to cast a spell. 
TALIESIN: He will? 
LIAM: He'll be killed. 
MARISHA: He'll be killed, yes. 
TALIESIN: But he'll come back? 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, yeah. I have to bring him back. 
TALIESIN: Oh, it's fine, then. 
MARISHA: But yes. 
TALIESIN: Let's put him in. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: (grunts) 
MARISHA: Hey buddy, were you napping? 
MATT: "I was just sort of, you know, contemplating the meaning of my existence as a construct that's only really given purpose when it has to bring itself to bear to your command. So, yeah I'm napping." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ooh. But you have thoughts and free thinking. 
SAM: Does he? 
MARISHA: You don't just go idle when you're not being used, right? 
MATT: "I don't know. What can I do for you?" 
MARISHA: Well, I need you to be tackle. Be fishing tack-- 
MATT: "What?" 
MARISHA: I need you to be a lure. I need you to-- 
TRAVIS: I hold up my fishing line and little sparkle. 
MARISHA: Like this, the little spark. I need you to go in the river. 
TRAVIS: (fishing reel whirs) 
MARISHA: I need you to go in the river and just splishy splashy. 
MATT: "Oh, I could do water fun times, yeah!" 
MARISHA: Yes. All right. All right, go. 
MATT: "Hey!" (splats) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (splashes) He was just splashing into the water. On the end of your line? 
TRAVIS: Just near it, yeah. Because I'm still-- 
MATT: Yep. 
TRAVIS: I'll see if I can get another. 
MARISHA: Oh yes, please do. 
TRAVIS: It's a race. 
MATT: "Eyyy!" All right, cool. Everyone who's going across, let's make a group athletics check. 
MARISHA: Is anything happening? Is anything going after Pâté? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: Nothing major, it's not like a piranha feeding frenzy or-- 
MATT: No, there's not a piranha feeding frenzy. 
TALIESIN: I was just-- 
MATT: No, but it's good. 
TALIESIN: City boy panicked. 
MATT: I know. 
TALIESIN: City boy panicked. 
MATT: That's good. That's good. 
TALIESIN: Don't like being in the woods. 
MATT: No, there's nothing currently assailing Pâté at the end of the line. 
MARISHA: Okay. All right. 
TALIESIN: Damn it. 
TRAVIS: Splash farther away. You're chasing off all my fish. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. 
TALIESIN: You're doing great. 
MARISHA: Come here, Pâté. 
TALIESIN: You're doing great. 
MATT: "Are we done already?" 
MARISHA: Well then, you can keep playing. Just go over there. 
MATT: "Okay!" (splashes) 
MARISHA: Oh my god, you're so cute. 
TALIESIN: Guidance before you go out, by the way. 
ASHLEY: Yes, Guidance, Guidance. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
SAM: I'll Guide you. 
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you. 
SAM: Because no one ever guides you. 
ASHLEY: Well, thank you so much. 
TRAVIS: I don't have a spool. (whizzes) (splashes) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's a d4, right? 
MARISHA: Like a line. 
ASHLEY: That's a d4. 
TALIESIN: Can never remember. 
LIAM: Who heals the healers? 
SAM: That's right. Athletics, you say? 
MATT: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: Because of the affixed rope at the two points, it's a far lower DC, so-- 
MARISHA: So. 
SAM: 14. 
MATT: 14, okay. 
MARISHA: We're all rolling athletics. 
MATT: Yes, athletics. 
TALIESIN: And I'm doing last. 
LAURA: I'm Misty Stepping across. 
MATT: You're fine. 
LIAM: Orym's doing pullups on the rod on the other side. 
MARISHA: Can I do acrobatics? 
TRAVIS: No! 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: Actually, it's pretty taut. If you want to try and tightrope across, you can do acrobatics. 
LAURA: Tightrope across, Laudna! You can do it. 
MATT: It's a much higher DC. 
LIAM: It's like the Haunted Mansion. 
LAURA: You can do it. 
ASHLEY: That's pretty cool. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
ASHLEY: It is like the Haunted Mansion. 
MARISHA: I have a plus two to my acrobatics, but a minus three to athletics. So it might be about even. 
SAM: Go for more. 
MATT: (laughs) Choice is yours. What do you want to do? 
LAURA: Do it. 
TALIESIN: If you're going to go out, go out in style. 
MARISHA: Okay. All right. 
SAM: Nothing bad has happened to your characters in water. 
LAURA: Can you Guide her? 
MARISHA: I'll be like those bros you see in the parks with the ratchet straps. 
TALIESIN: We know who you're talking about. 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs) All right. 
SAM: Just in case I'm preparing my grapple cannon. 
MATT: Good to know. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Very specific person in my mind. 
MATT: So you're acrobatic? 
MARISHA: Naruto run! Ooh! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Seven! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Is that with the plus two? 
LAURA: You've got this! 
MARISHA: Yes, I rolled a five. 
SAM: I'm at the ready. As soon as I see her fall, I will shoot her with my grapple cannon. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Poacher her person. 
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for an attack. 
SAM: Okay. Three. (laughter) 
SAM: I missed. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
MATT: What'd you get? 
ASHLEY: I got a 19. 
MATT: A 19. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: You're going across? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. It was 13. 
MATT: Okay. Ashton? 
TALIESIN: I'm going last. Are we dealing with this or no? I was going to go-- 
MATT: This is all considered rolls for the attempt. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: So this is-- 
TALIESIN: So, since I'm going and I have a-- That's interesting. 
TRAVIS: Sorry. It was a 12. 
TALIESIN: It's athletics? 
MATT: Athletics, yeah. 
TALIESIN: 31. 
MATT: 31, jeez. 
SAM: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: Sheesh. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Bye. (laughter) 
MATT: So as some of you clamber across, hand over hand, eventually getting to the opposite side, narratively, we'll say, Laudna's the second to last to go across, FCG has passed beyond to this point. 
MARISHA: Sure. 
MATT: You're holding up the rear, as you begin to arms out, they can't stop us all, you know? Naruto run across the rope. 
LAURA: Balance! Balance, Laudna! Don't just-- 
MATT: And just-- 
LIAM: You've got to believe! 
ASHLEY: Aah! 
MATT: You stop and catch yourself and the rope's like, (wide wobbling). 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: (intense burst) You fall and slip ass over tea kettle in the air as a bolt goes-- (whoosh) (laughter) You (splashes) into the water. It is freezing cold. But you being a non-necessarily super warm-blooded person, it's not a huge shock, just a little shock. But nevertheless, you are now treading water. I would like you to make an athletics check to try and swim to the shore. 
LAURA: Can I use my telekinetic pull and try to help her out, pull her towards me as she's trying to swim? 
MATT: Yeah. I will say, because you are, this isn't just pushing somebody in the air, you're pulling against the current of the water. Go ahead and roll a d20, add your spellcraft modifier or your spell. 
MARISHA: Ugh, my hoop skirt. Oh jeez. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Oh jeez. 
TRAVIS: It was close. 
MARISHA: A nine. 
TRAVIS: That was almost real bad. 
LAURA: A 22. 
MATT: 22. Okay. So you pull her five feet closer and she just full on, under the water. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to try and deal with this. I'm going to disengage the rod and the hammer. 
MATT: Okay, you haven't crossed yet. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go running to catch up and dive in, still holding, with the hammer still tied to the thing, but not-- 
MATT: Okay, so you're disengaging, but you just run off in that way? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to try and get, and go and jump and grab. 
MATT: Okay. You leap and with the rope still tethered, which is taut, you do an outward swing angle, which would put her beyond your reach because you are now being, from a physics standpoint, you're being pulled away from the point where she's splashed in and is dragged down. So you would have to let go of the hammer or let the rope go. Your call. 
TALIESIN: Let the rope go. 
MATT: Okay. So the rope actually, you give a tug and the rope snaps off of your-- We'll say that's five feet of rope off of whoever put that up. So it's now 45 feet of rope. As you (big splash) into the water, the cold of it washing over you, the dark, murky beneath, that (bubbling) sound as you're currently now pushing through the river, you do manage to swim up to Laudna. You're going to try and bring you both to shore? 
TALIESIN: I am. Yeah, I'm going to give it an attempt. 
MATT: Make an athletics check for me. This is a very high DC, because you're rolling for both of you. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: Does he have hands on Laudna? 
MATT: You would be able to see because you have very, very high-- You can see, he catches up to her beneath the water and they're both in a similar area. So you get the sense he probably does. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm going to flash out Seedling and whip out a vine onto Ashton's back. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: And hold onto the immovable rod on my side with my tiny arm. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Are you pulling in or just attaching it to him? 
LIAM: I'm attaching and not letting them go downstream. Because I'm holding this with one arm and this out with the other. 
MATT: Okay. I'll say, because he's a moving target beneath the surface of the water, just roll a d20 and add your dexterity modifier. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to rage. 
LIAM: It's a 21. 
MATT: 21. Yeah. You send it below like a Spider-Man whip catching the back of him. You are raging, roll your athletics with advantage. 
TALIESIN: All right. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I feel like such a problem right now. 
SAM: You are. 
LIAM: One attempt, two attempts, three attempts, four attempts. 
TALIESIN: Athletics with advantage is 18. 
MATT: 18. All right. 
TRAVIS: (water droplet) 
LAURA: That was a good one. 
MATT: At this point, it's not a very wide river, and at the point where you grabbed and where you attached, the rest of it only gets easier as you go. So it takes you a moment, but you do manage to get both of you up and out of the surface of the water and to the point where your feet begin to touch the bottom of the river itself and get some traction. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: It's about this time that you also notice that something is emerging from the water behind them. 
SAM: Oh snap! 
MATT: Like a mound begins to rise up. 
LIAM: Guys, guys! Guys, guys, guys! Something's surfacing! 
MARISHA: This is so heavy! 
TALIESIN: What? 
TRAVIS: You two. It's a fighter. 
MATT: Behind the two of them, you see this rising mound, almost like its own small island of a deep gray, brown, almost dappled textured hide. You see where the back is and shoulders are, it's smooth and rotund almost, but muscular. You see the head pull up and there're these tiny little ears that wiggle. Where the snout would be, these two massive horns that curl up like this. You see this monstrous hippopotamus that basically like. 
MARISHA: Werehippo. 
MATT: You see it sprays air out of its nostrils and it seems to be slowly stalking up behind the two of them. 
TALIESIN: Come on, dude. Not now. 
LIAM: Ash, go around there. 
SAM: Come on, dude. 
TRAVIS: Hippos are not territorial at all or aggressive. 
ASHLEY: Are you holding onto Laudna, Ash? 
TALIESIN: I am. We are moving and I've got a rage up at the moment, so. 
ASHLEY: Would it be possible to use my Stonky's Ring to try to-- 
LIAM: It's been a while. 
ASHLEY: -- lift up Ashton's hammer so that I can try to get them across? It can hold 1,000 pounds. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Yeah. I think with the ring you used right now, you activate it. 
ASHLEY: Hold onto her. 
MATT: The hammer suddenly (zooms)! 
TALIESIN: Ah! God! 
MATT: It yanks your shoulder a little bit, but not enough to do any damage, but just enough where it might be sore for a little bit, as you both rocket out of the water. As this creature goes and tries to gore up behind them and catches the air, maybe a foot beneath their feet. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
MATT: As you pluck them up and, I'll say, as gingerly as you want to lay them down on the ground. 
ASHLEY: Yes, very gingerly. 
MATT: Just set them down. 
TALIESIN: It only goes so ginger because the gravity kicked in, so (intense impact)! We fall a little hard. 
MATT: (growls) (heavy footsteps) 
TALIESIN: Ow. 
SAM: Is it charging? 
LAURA: Is it coming at us? 
MATT: You see it's emerging from the water on the side of the riverbank where you are. You can see not far behind it in the water, three other smaller ones that are emerging on the side. 
LAURA: Oh, babies, no wonder it was so mad. 
MATT: (growls) 
ASHLEY: It's okay, it's okay. 
MARISHA: Don't hippos kill more people than lions? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Yes. They do 
TALIESIN: Yes, they do. 
SAM: But yes. I'll cast Speak with Animals! 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yes! 
SAM: I will say: Please, we mean you no harm. We were just trying to cross a brook to get to our destination. 
MATT: (deeply, passionately) "Fuck off!" (oohing) 
SAM: We will gladly fuck off. Can we go? Will you let us go? 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
SAM: Ooh! 25. 
LAURA: Nice! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: "Don't come any closer! Fuck off!" 
SAM: There's no need for that kind of language. (laughter) 
LIAM: He's leaning in. 
LAURA: Just go, just go. 
MATT: "Fuck off!" 
SAM: You can just say-- 
MATT: The rest of you see it going (growls). 
SAM: You could just say like, "This is my lair, please excuse yourself from it," and we would also gladly go. 
MATT: You hear the babies behind emerging from water going like, (squeakily) "Yeah, Mom, tell him! Tell him, Mom!" "Yeah! Go get him, Mom! Go get him!" 
TALIESIN: This conversation's going on way too long. 
SAM: It doesn't need to be this impolite. 
LAURA: I'm just using telekinetic pull and pulling FCG back. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Come on. 
LAURA: As we're walking. 
SAM: Kids, don't use that language. 
ASHLEY: We're leaving. We're leaving. 
LIAM: Unclick the rod. 
MATT: As you slowly peel away from the encounter, eventually you can see its territorial stance begins to lax and the rest of you can hear the soft grunts of a family reuniting, as you can gently hear the kids going like, "Yeah, Mom, that was great!" 
SAM: That was not great. That was not great. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "You sure showed him!" 
SAM: I just left because I wanted to, not because she told me to! 
LIAM: I'm Prestidigitationing you, Laudna, and drying you off. 
MARISHA: Thank you. I'm sorry. 
LAURA: I mean, it-- 
ASHLEY: Worth it. 
LAURA: It was real funny. You looked-- 
MARISHA: Running down. 
LAURA: It's great. 
SAM: Oh, your makeup? 
LAURA: Perfect. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: I threw the trout into my bag of holding. 
LAURA: You too. 
TALIESIN: Thank you, I was about to say, I'll just stay here wet. But whatever. 
LAURA: No, I'll dry you. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: We had tissue in there. 
MATT: True. 
SAM: Maybe I could bake it. 
TALIESIN: That's true. 
SAM: I could have baked trout. 
TALIESIN: Polish. That's really nice. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Or I could butter, or just-- 
SAM: I don't have any butter. Wait, I have a little butter. 
LIAM: You have butter. 
SAM: A little butter. 
MARISHA: We have seasoning. 
TRAVIS: There's a pantry. 
SAM: You can bake it. Bake it in my body. 
LIAM: How old is the butter? 
TALIESIN: We can't get to the pantry right now because we can't put anywhere, but there is a pantry. 
TRAVIS: Don't ask about the butter. 
SAM: I got it-- 
MARISHA: Butter's surprising resilient. 
SAM: -- 30 episodes ago. 
TRAVIS: Don't ask where body butter comes from. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Butter saves. 
TALIESIN: As long as you have a cup, butter can stay for ages. How does nobody know this? 
SAM: I ran out of butter several weeks ago. I've been using motor oil. 
TALIESIN: I have-- (laughter) 
SAM: Is that all right? 
TALIESIN: That explains why it's moving so quickly through the system. 
ASHLEY: I'm pretty sure that's basically Crisco, so it's fine. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, castor oil. 
MATT: Are you still helming this journey? 
TRAVIS: Oh no, I'm going to relinquish the duties to... 
ASHLEY: Me? 
TALIESIN: You. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: But I'll assist you with my nose. 
MATT: All right, so Fearne, you understand in wild spaces that the water travels down. So if you're following a river, it will lead to the direction in which things get steeper or more to the bottom of a basin, the bottom of a forest, the bottom of a mountain. You could choose to follow the river or choose to not. You know that things seem to exist in the river or near it at times that are not immediately friendly. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. All right, I'm going to get low and put my hands in the dirt, taste it. 
TRAVIS: That was poo. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Hippo shit. 
LAURA: Yeah, Chet just pooped there. 
TRAVIS: I just dropped trou. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that was your shit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Shit. That's fine. All right. So, stealth check. I mean, what am I saying? Survival. 
MATT: Survival check, yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's what I meant-- 
LAURA: Are we following the river? 
MATT: We'll find out with the roll. 
LAURA: Oh. Oh, gosh. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Fearne kneels down, sticks her finger in shit and disappears. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! Okay. (laughter) 
LAURA: Did you Guide yourself? No. 
TALIESIN: Fucking power is that? 
ASHLEY: 26. 
MATT: 26? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: You gather you can follow the river from a distance to where at least the direction it's traveling will-- 
MARISHA and SAM: ♪ From a distance ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Just pathetic. 
TALIESIN: How do you people-- 
MATT: Nothing is free. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: A bunch of hacks. 
TRAVIS: No good deed. 
ASHLEY: No good. 
TALIESIN: Worst Spotify list ever. 
MATT: So you can follow with it as long as it continues to wind in that direction. At enough of a distance to where at least denizens that would be fearful of some of the creatures that you encountered will make it a safer journey. 
LAURA: Totally in here. 
MATT: But for the rest of the day's travel, you don't encounter any other dangerous issues. 
SAM: That's the Fearne effect. 
MATT: Until it grows darker and the mood begins to change. You will likely have to hole up for the evening or find some way to sleep comfortably in the middle of the wilds. 
TRAVIS: Where we are-- the canopy or the nearest branches are 40, 50 plus feet up? 
MATT: Between 30 and 40 up, yeah. It's these long stalks of trees before the tree begins to expand upward. 
TRAVIS: Well, we could search for a hollow, or we could rock some branches. I don't know if the floor is level enough for the hole. 
TALIESIN: It is definitely not level enough. 
LAURA: Yeah, are any of the trees hollow? 
MATT: You can look for some-- 
LAURA: They're pretty wide, right? 
MATT: -- if you'd like to. 
LIAM: They're big 'uns. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. There are different types of trees here, some that are thicker than others. Some that do have, like I say, some boughs that are probably lower, but they're not very strong, at least on the lower points. The stronger branches are the ones that push up towards the top of the canopy. Down here, they're thin or flimsy by comparison. Maybe it'll support the weight of one or two of you, but that's about the extent of it. 
TRAVIS: That'll be the one. 
ASHLEY: Fearne, what do you think? 
ASHLEY: I could also try to grow like I did the last time, a nice little A-frame. 
LAURA: Yeah, that was really nice. 
ASHLEY: How did I do that? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
LAURA: That was-- 
TALIESIN: Chaos! 
ASHLEY: Plant Growth? 
LAURA: Plant Growth is what it was, yeah. 
ASHLEY: It was Plant Growth. Shall I make us a nice little A-frame situation? 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Where's the best spot? 
LAURA: Is there a hollow-ish tree that we can tuck into with a little A-frame outside? 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Roll a survival or nature check to look for one that could possible. 
LAURA: I know, should you roll? I'll assist you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You might know this. Are there signs of other humanoid civilization anywhere? 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Good setting, Matt. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Okay, all right, all right. 
ASHLEY: 16. 
MATT: 16. 
LAURA: Not terrible. 
MATT: Okay. That's not bad at all. It takes you a little bit of a journey into the evening to where you have to source your own light. But you do eventually find one large tree where it looks like it was either struck by lightning or something split it partway down. Where it was split, it continued to grow. But it cut this darkened charcoal dark hollow that goes about eight or so feet into the tree trunk itself. 
ASHLEY: Little moss bits. Any little holes, maybe some little mushrooms. Toadstools peeking out. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. Easily enough, you tap into the fey nature of your life, your upbringing, and the magic that flows through you. In instilling the land to grow to your interests and imagination, a vibrant spectrum of colorful fungus and moss begin to grow, unnatural to this environment internally, but you can mask the exterior of it to match in with the surroundings. 
ASHLEY: Great. It's really cute, huh? 
SAM: Gorgeous. 
MARISHA: It's so cute. 
LAURA: It's wonderful. 
TALIESIN: I like it. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: How long does it take you to bake that fish? 
SAM: Oh, me? I've never baked fish. I've mostly been baking baked goods. Maybe, I'm just going to guess. Actually, I'm going to think about it. 
LAURA: Fish bakes up pretty fast. 
MARISHA: Eh, 25 minutes. 
SAM: Can I search my memory banks for the perfect recipe for baked fish? 
MATT: Yeah, roll an intelligence check for me. 
LAURA: Did you catch more than one, Chet, or was it just the one? 
TRAVIS: Did I catch a second fish or was it only the one? 
LIAM: I bake salmon in 15. 
SAM: Nine. 
MATT: Nine? You could probably fake it. 
TALIESIN: Nine minutes. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: A couple hours. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: A couple hours, yeah, for salmon. 
LAURA: Can we Guide you? 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: With the time that you were hanging back, I'd say you could probably catch a second one with that roll you got. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got two. 
MATT: You got two. I'll allow it. 
SAM: Give me one. 
LAURA: No, give you both because that way you can cook-- 
TRAVIS: I'll give him one. I mean, they need to perfect their recipe. 
SAM: I don't think a fish-- Fit two seven-pound fish in my body anyway, so. 
LAURA: That's true, you're pretty small. 
TALIESIN: Just filet them one at a time. 
SAM: Cram it in there. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Shut the door. 
MARISHA: Did you filet it? 
SAM: Oh, is that what you got to do? 
LAURA: Yeah, you got to-- 
TALIESIN: We filet it. 
TRAVIS: We definitely got the chisel out, we did a down the middle-- 
LAURA: Yeah, we prepped it. 
TRAVIS: -- then fileted the sides. The meats, we checked the blood, make sure there's nothing funny going on. 
MATT: Totally. You're cooking it for a couple hours, you said? 
SAM: I've got the spices that I would have for baking pastries and things. So a little cinnamon. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Little nutmeg. 
TRAVIS: Goddamn it. 
LIAM: Salt? 
SAM: Some sugar. 
LAURA: Why are you making it gross? 
LIAM: You need salt to bake. 
SAM: A little salt, sure. You can use salt to bake. 
LIAM: How about just the salt? 
SAM: Oh. Well, I already put all that other stuff on. I'll wipe it off. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: I'll wipe it off. Just scrape it off and just do a little salt. Fold it, stick it in there. 
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: As you all settle in, it is actually quite a delightful smell. This hollow and the proximity means that you all, for the next two hours, smell the wonderful smell-- 
LAURA: Several hours. 
MATT: -- of a bakery-spiced fish slowly cooking. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Low temp, right? Smoking it? 
TRAVIS: Cinnamon trout. 
SAM: Easy-Bake Oven. 
MARISHA: Right, right. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Is there any rosemary in this tent we have, or something just to give this a little bit of a kick. I don't know, some pepperberry. 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: Nothing. None of it. 
TALIESIN: Oh god. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Nevermind. 
MATT: But as the evening goes on, the temperature drops significantly. The mist gets thicker. For bits, you can look outside with what little faint bit of moonlight that is disseminated through the mist itself, that curves down, you can just barely see the shapes of the jungle boughs above. You feel that darkened abyss portion of the ocean where it's just no light and that little glimmer of faint blue above at the surface. It is about a couple hours into cooking this and you create-- 
SAM: (bright ding) 
MATT: -- some fine fish jerky. (laughter) 
SAM: It's a little dry. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Orym takes a lot. 
MARISHA: Honestly, it's not bad. 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: Anything weird in the fileting of this fish, meat color, blood-- 
LIAM: Protein is protein. 
TRAVIS: -- insides, anything strange? 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine. 
MATT: Not from your experience, no. 
MARISHA: Think you can walk it back at least an hour? 
SAM: It's trial and error over here. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Great. 
TALIESIN: I'll also say we're going to have to clean you out real hard before we bake anything. 
LAURA: Yeah, you smell-- 
LIAM: You stink of fish. 
LAURA: -- pretty ripe. 
TALIESIN: That's going to be some vinegar and baking soda. 
TRAVIS: Don't say it. 
SAM: My lower parts sort of smell like fish now, is that what's happening? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I know, we're literally setting him up for the worst. 
TALIESIN: Why do we do this? Goddamn it. 
SAM: My hot hole smells like fish? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I take responsibility for this one, I'm so sorry. I didn't see it coming. 
LAURA: Bye, Matt. (laughter) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I really feel bad about this one. Shit. (laughter) (laughter) 
LAURA: The show's over. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: See you guys. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: He's just going to-- He's going to do a lap. (laughter) 
LIAM: (reporter) Critical Role shockingly ended mid-Campaign Three. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: My hot hole. 
MARISHA: It's been a great eight years, everybody. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: Nope. 
TALIESIN: It came to a head right there. 
LIAM: A landslide. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. (laughter) 
SAM: Sublime! (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Amazing. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Crap. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: All right, so who's taking first watch? (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Someone with darkvision pair up with someone who doesn't have-- I don't have darkvision. 
TRAVIS: I'll take it. 
TALIESIN: You have darkvision? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
TALIESIN: All right. Two of us, then. 
MATT: Okay. Roll a perception check for me. 
TRAVIS: Perception check assisted by-- 
TALIESIN: Moi. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Moi. ♪ 
MATT: Well, you don't have darkvision so you can't assist him. 
TALIESIN: No, so I technically assisted, but it doesn't help at all. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Can I use my-- 
LAURA: Wait, wow. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, advantage on wisdom perception checks. Yeah, but here another way. 
TALIESIN: That'll do it. 
MATT: Yours are scent based, right? 
TRAVIS: Just the one then. 15, 14. 
MATT: 14, got it. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Math sucks today. 
MATT: The silence beyond the sounds of the evening insects that rule the night jungle soothe you into a state of contemplation. 
TRAVIS: (pleasantly) Ah. 
MATT: Excitement for the weird space you're in, the weird people you travel with, and you get lost momentarily in memories of dalliances and encounters of the past, encounters of the recent. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Can you not make weird gurgling noises? It's getting very distracting, man. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry. I was lost in my escapades of the past. 
TALIESIN: I'm well aware. 
TRAVIS: Of the present. 
TALIESIN: Yup. 
TRAVIS: We could have taken that fucking hippo. 
TALIESIN: Inside voice. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Sorry. 
TALIESIN: Sorry, carry on. 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
TALIESIN: Could you have taken that hippo? No, I don't think you could. 
MATT: Laudna. 
MARISHA: Wha-- What? Wait, what? What? 
TRAVIS: You're sleeping. 
MATT: Just, you're sleeping. 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: But mark nine points of necrotic damage. 
LAURA: (gasps) What, why? 
MARISHA: What, why? 
SAM: But why? 
MARISHA: Okay, so wait, wait, wait, hang on though. This gets weird. I was down-- We leveled up and I gained hit points, but then we were down hit points. 
TRAVIS: You were down 10. 
MARISHA: But now we've slept. 
SAM: But you haven't slept a whole night yet. 
MATT: You haven't done a full long rest yet. 
MARISHA: So would I still be at-- Even though with my hit points going up, I was at, hang on a minute. I was at 91. So I was at 81. 
SAM: When you level up, it levels up your hit points, too. 
MARISHA: As to where it was. 
MATT: Correct, it keeps the maximum diminished previously, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You went up-- 
MARISHA: I went up. 
TRAVIS: -- four. 
SAM: You're good. 
MARISHA: Yeah, plus-- 
LAURA: (sneezes) 
MATT: Gesundheit. 
SAM: Stop it! 
MARISHA: -- my constitution, so I went up eight. 
TALIESIN: It's a hippo of the Everlight. 
SAM: Just take nine points off. 
TRAVIS: So 17 down. 
MARISHA: So if I go nine-- 
LIAM: Then perish. 
MARISHA: I take nine points of-- 
TRAVIS: Necrotic. 
MARISHA: Is that right, then? We'll say that's right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Man, you got some fucking hit points, though. 
MARISHA: I know. It's that amulet that I have. 
TRAVIS: That's warlock shit. 
SAM: Anyone else take these hit points? 
MARISHA: So wait, necrotic? 
TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: Just mark it. 
LIAM: One guess. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
LAURA: Is it because you used the vision? 
TRAVIS: We don't know why. 
LAURA: Because you used Delilah's powers? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
TRAVIS: What does it mean? 
MARISHA: Even though I'm a Hollow One? 
SAM: Oh, he didn't remember that. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Shut up. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Fear your secrets. 
MARISHA: Sometimes necrotic shit is immune to-- 
TRAVIS: He's still rolling shit! 
MARISHA: -- other undead people don't do it. 
LIAM: Forget about it. 
SAM: It's just nine points, Marisha. 
TRAVIS: Look at those blue eyes. 
SAM: You'll be okay. 
TRAVIS: Look at those blue eyes and ask yourself if he doesn't know. 
MARISHA: It's not the amount of points. 
MATT: Orym, you take three points, sorry, six points of necrotic damage. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Orym? Wait, why? 
LIAM: Now she's in my head. 
LAURA: What is it? 
TRAVIS: Is it the mist? Is it the cold? 
LAURA: What's causing it? 
MARISHA: See, they're equally confused. 
MATT: The two of you end your watch without issue. 
TRAVIS: But we're up in the fucking tree. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Up in the tree? You climbed up? 
TALIESIN: We're just a little-- We're not in the-- We're up outside the thing. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I guess we didn't go up 40 feet to the branch. We didn't do that, we're just outside keeping track. 
MARISHA: What if the fucking ground-- 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: -- is sucking the life out of us? 
TRAVIS: So we're on the same level. 
LIAM: That could be. 
SAM: I can take the next watch. 
MATT: As you both climb down and enter the hole-- 
LIAM: The whole valley. 
MATT: -- you swear in just a moment, the shadow seemed to shift, and then it's still. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (gasp) 
TRAVIS: Wait, hold on. Hold on. Motherfuck! Chisel (flames ignite) on my thigh, a little Crimson Rite 
LIAM: Badass. 
TRAVIS: Just to light it up. 
MATT: As the light fills the space, you immediately see a dozen or so of these small, thin, elongated, almost humanoid shadow shapes that have gathered around Laudna and Orym that have been reaching out and grabbing them. As soon as the flame ignites, they (deep hisses) and they remain there, just looking at you, still. 
TRAVIS: Ashton, wake everybody up! 
LAURA: Oh, do they look scared? 
TALIESIN: Wake up, wake up, wake up. 
LAURA: Things look nice sometimes that aren't actually nice. I don't like them. 
LIAM: There's no light, right? What's going on? 
TALIESIN: There's light. 
SAM: He's got flame. 
LIAM: Oh, from the flame? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Do we see them? 
SAM: Here, I'll turn on my-- 
MATT: Oh yeah, you see them. 
MARISHA: We all see them. 
MATT: They're emerging from the nearby shadow and you see them, they're floating up a bit, these tiny little wraiths that are small and waifish. There's these tattered shadows with these elongated small bodies and their heads are misshapen and stretched a bit, almost like The Scream, but just made of shadow and just (waifish moan). 
TRAVIS: Looked like they were trying to pick your pocket or something. 
MARISHA: I feel a little like shit. Do we have any marks on us? 
MATT: No, but you feel very cold, colder than the air seems to present. 
LAURA: Can I talk to them? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to try to talk to them in their head. 
MATT: As soon as you try and connect with one, you get this yearning, this need to be warm. After this standoff lasts a few moments, they begin to return to Orym and Laudna. 
LAURA: No, no, no! 
LIAM: Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo! 
SAM: I'm going to turn on my lights and shine my light right at them. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: They recoil slightly again, and you can sense the emotion from them. Their drive to consume heat is a little bit stronger than their fear of the light that you're presenting, and you watch as they recoil and then grow bold again. 
LIAM: If I'm back to calf with Laudna, I'm going to start doing circles around her and try to keep them at bay, somewhat. Shield up, sword out. 
MARISHA: Can I say in Shadow Cant-- 
SAM: Ooh. Ooh! 
TRAVIS: What? 
LIAM: Shadow Cant. 
MARISHA: Shadow Cant. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Shadow can. 
MARISHA: Oh, I shadow can. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
MARISHA: Can you understand me? 
MATT: They don't speak at all, but what you can see now is about five or six that are affixed around you and about four or five that are around you, all of them all at once look over your direction. You've caught their attention for a moment. You also notice more are starting to creep in from the outside of the tree, from behind Chetney. 
LIAM: Spitball, it's like 15? 10, 15? 
MATT: Right now, 10, 11, 12. 
SAM: If they want heat, should we give them a bonfire somewhere else or something? 
MARISHA: That's what I was going to say. 
TALIESIN: Let's do that. 
LIAM: Fearne, can you? 
MARISHA: I use a little Prestidigitation-- 
LAURA: She's asleep. 
SAM: She's a heavy sleeper. 
MARISHA: -- to make a little flicker on my palm of heat. 
MATT: They're just looking at you. 
SAM: They want life forms. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: They want warm bodies, not warm flame. 
SAM: Well, shit, we can't sleep here then. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Or we got to figure out a way to keep them out. 
LIAM: We're outnumbered, there's like 14 of them now. 
LAURA: Are they little? 
MATT: They're smaller than Chetney. They look almost like withered shadow gnomes, if you will, but also their features are exaggerated. You're uncertain who they might've once been if they've been something before. If this is just their nature, you don't know. 
TALIESIN: Well, you should tell them to leave and if they don't leave-- 
SAM: Can I do-- Do you think they're undead? Should I Turn Undead? 
TALIESIN: Try it. 
MARISHA: I think they are undead. I can actually try this. I'll be able to tell. If I reach out to one like I'm going to let it touch me. 
MATT: (dry, raspy moan) 
MARISHA: Chill Touch. 
MATT: Chill Touch? Okay. Is that an attack roll, or a saving throw on their point? 
MARISHA: It is-- 
MATT: It's attack roll for you? 
MARISHA: -- attack roll from me. Yep, 27. 
MATT: 27, roll damage. 
MARISHA: Three-- (gasps) Wait, did my shit go-- (gasps) I went up in a level, my shit goes up. 
MATT: 11, cantrips. 
LAURA: Yeah, cantrips go higher. 
MARISHA: I've got 3d8 (excitedly frantic) My cantrips go higher! 
MATT: That means three Eldritch Blasts. 
MARISHA: 3d8! Well, Chill Touch. 
MATT: I know, but when you do Eldritch Blast, you do three. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (gasps) 
MARISHA: I get three now. So the thing with Chill Touch. 
TRAVIS: Triple Eldritch Blast. 
MARISHA: If you hit an undead target-- 
TRAVIS: Yee-haw! 
MARISHA: -- it also has, oh wait. 
TRAVIS: Disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of its next turn. 
MARISHA: Oh, I guess it is. 
SAM: You're going to kill it here anyway, doesn't matter. 
TRAVIS: 3d8, go for it. Hit it. 
MARISHA: (mumbling cantrip description) I thought it was-- Okay. 
SAM: Garbage. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Not great. Not great. 10, 11 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Disappointing. 
SAM: Not bad. 
MATT: 11 points of damage. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Leave the table. 
MATT: As your energy converts into that cold necromantic lash out to this creature, it strikes the shadow and it dissipates and the others recoil. 
MARISHA: Did I get a sense that it's undead? 
MATT: You got the sense that it's undead. They all begin to close in once more, very like the Doldrums from "The Phantom Tollbooth." They're slowly creeping. 
TALIESIN: I think I've had enough of this. 
LIAM: Are we doing this? Feels like we're doing this. 
MARISHA: Do your thing, do your thing. 
LIAM: Oh, if we're going to do this, I'm going to hold you down. 
SAM: What? 
MARISHA: Oh, yes. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MARISHA: I shield into Ashton. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I will cast Turn Undead. It's not casting; I will call on the Changebringer to get these undead things away from us! 
MATT: As you close your eyes and give yourself this prayer that you unleash on to the Changebringer in hopes that she will grant you the protection that you seek. This radial blast of magical energy seems to light up in the core of FCG's chest before it emerges like a shockwave of gentle warmth. As it cascades outward, the shadows scatter until the entirety of the chamber you're in is left sans any shadow. You hear their tiny little squeaky cries as they're scattered into immaterial. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: And then silence. 
TRAVIS: Can I take dagger out to the opening of our A-frame and just look out? 
MATT: You glance outward. Make a perception check for me. 
LIAM: Everything smells like fish now. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, that was really fishy. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: 12. 
MATT: 12. 
TRAVIS: Not great. 
MATT: You glance out with the light and you can see about seven or eight of them that are waiting on the outside that are now recoiling into the nearby brush and foliage. Properly fearful of what just occurred. You get the slightest, out of the corner of your eye, shadow everywhere moving for but a moment before it goes still once more. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: So this is all-- 
LAURA: These things are everywhere. 
SAM: Do you think they won't come in anymore? 
TALIESIN: I think-- 
LAURA: After-- How long does that last? 
SAM: That's it, it's over. 
LAURA: How long do they run away? 
SAM: Well, they're all dead. The ones that were affected. 
TRAVIS: Can I immediately go to the nearest tree, and using my woodworking abilities, can I take out some of the tools and I'll start carving off of the trunk shavings, kindling materials, slicing strips, harvesting off of the tree and looking, grabbing a bundle of stuff that could begin to start a fire. 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Let everyone else sleep. 
LIAM: Letters is probably-- 
TRAVIS: We can start a fire if we need to outside. Maybe they'll be drawn to that. 
LAURA: Distract them? 
TRAVIS: Although, it feels like it's not that kind of heat they want. 
TALIESIN: I think that's how you get a hippopotamus. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
TALIESIN: I think we just have to be-- Whoever's awake has to be dealing with it. If it gets to be too much, we wake everybody else up. 
SAM: Someone's got to be silently fighting these things off while everybody else sleeps? 
TALIESIN: I mean-- 
ASHLEY: Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
MATT: It's okay. 
SAM: Or, just to talk it out, could one of us be a sacrificial-- 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
SAM: Like we give one person to be sucked of their life force during the night while the rest of us sleep, and then when the rest of us wake up, I can heal that person right back up to full. 
TRAVIS: They were moving. I think they'd do that pretty quick, though. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Well, that was only (mumbles) hit points over two hours. 
TRAVIS: That's true. 
SAM: So we only need another four or six hours. 
TALIESIN: Only few of them though, there were more coming. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Let's try the next shift and see if they'll stay away after-- 
LAURA: See what happens? 
SAM: I can stay up. I've got another Turn Undead, so I could stay up for the next shift and see what happens. 
MATT: Okay. So you're taking next shift? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Can you see in the dark? 
SAM: Nope. 
LAURA: Okay. We should start a fire then so you can see what's going on. 
TRAVIS: Inside or outside the A-frame? How big is our A-frame? 
MATT: It's not very big. 
SAM: Eight feet? 
ASHLEY: It's very tiny. 
MATT: Yeah, it's eight-foot by six-foot. You're all pretty crammed in there. 
TALIESIN: Who else has darkvision? 
TRAVIS: Does it have open air at all? Because otherwise, I'll put it at the mouth. 
MARISHA: I do. 
MATT: Well, it's still, it's not entirely enclosed. 
TALIESIN: You okay with staying up for a round? 
MATT: There's a curtain of moss that she created and overgrowth. 
MARISHA: I can stay up for a round. 
TALIESIN: If things go south, wake me up and I will-- 
SAM: Do we have any of the bodies? 
TALIESIN: -- pin you to the ground again before that. 
TRAVIS: We got rid of all the dead bodies. We got dead fish. 
TALIESIN: Can't open the hole either. 
TRAVIS: I'll bring all that kindling that I brought and I'll bunch it on the floor and I'll put in one of my more prized (cries)-- 
TALIESIN: I'll figure it out. 
TRAVIS: -- possessions of wood and I'll force some splits into it so it'll burn easier and I'll start a little-- 
MATT: Start a little fire in there. 
TRAVIS: At the mouth of the-- 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to use Control Flames to dim the light on it without dimming the heat from it. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'll throw some incense into there to create a miasma of... 
TALIESIN: Just mixes with the fish, doesn't hide it. 
SAM: Protection. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Can't cover that. 
MARISHA: Fish and Palo Santo. 
LAURA: Yeah, every time you cast a spell now, it's going to reek of fish. 
MATT: A strange like-- 
TALIESIN: Person in the office. 
MATT: Like a Seattle fish market meets patchouli smell fills the interior of this tree hollow. (groaning) 
TALIESIN: San Francisco. 
MARISHA: What is this? 
SAM: Spiritual bookshop vibes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Vanilla and shit. (laughs) 
MATT: For your watch. 
MARISHA: Oh, so it's me and FCG now? 
SAM: Yeah, you want to stay up? Can you see in the dark? 
MARISHA: All right. Yes. 
SAM: Okay, great. 
MATT: As you both keep an eye out there for your watch, a slight crackle of the nearby flames kicking and sparking occasionally in the inside here. No shadows seem to creep in during your time. 
LAURA: Great. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Maybe you scared 'em. 
SAM: Yep, maybe I did. 
MARISHA: It's good. 
MATT: All right, and then you finish your watch without issue. 
SAM: Wake up. You two are next. 
LAURA: Oh, really? Can I see in the dark? 
ASHLEY: What's that smell? 
SAM: It's-- 
TALIESIN: Incense and fish. 
SAM: It's not Pussy. 
LAURA: No, it's not. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
SAM: It's me. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, that's fine. 
LAURA: Can you see the dark? 
TALIESIN: It's funny on three levels. 
LAURA: Okay, me neither. 
LIAM: Is the fire still going? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You got a little fire monkey, it's okay. (snorts) 
LAURA: I'm going to keep trying to keep my mind open in case I can hear any yearning sort of thoughts. 
TRAVIS: I'm yearning all right. 
LAURA: Not those kind of yearnings. 
TRAVIS: Okay. (snores) 
LAURA: Chet's dreaming about some-- 
ASHLEY: What's he doing? 
MATT: Make a perception check, if you'd like. 
SAM: Come on, come on, big roll. 
ASHLEY: Guidance? 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: You got Guidance. 
LAURA: Oh, this, that's, okay. 
TRAVIS: Double didge, let's go, double didge. 
LAURA: Ooh, natural 20. 
MATT: Nice. 
LAURA: Plus Guidance. 
LIAM: Guidance. 
LAURA: Shook. What is that? So 23, perception? 24. 
MATT: 24. You have no incursion of the shadows within the interior of this tree. Through the time that you have keeping watch, you glance out beyond the threshold of the plant growth that you've created to protect your-- 
LAURA: Beyond the plant growth. 
MATT: -- friends. You can see the shifting shadows still weaving through the nearby foliage and brush, just avoiding the proximity. 
ASHLEY: Just take out a little tuft of moss, peek through. 
LAURA: They're sad and cute. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: I know. I feel bad for them. 
ASHLEY: I do, too. 
LAURA: Just trapped here. Wanting love. 
MATT: As the light begins to creep up with the morning and brighten the forest floor as bright as it gets at this time, the shadows dissipate and with your passes and rest now coming to fruition, you see no sign of the encroaching shadows and the jungle is yours to traverse. 
MARISHA: Do we all get a long rest? 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: As we wake up, can I use my Hunter's Bane to feel out for like is there a constant state of a feeling of undead around us, or perhaps only at night? 
LAURA: It feels bright after that night. 
MATT: Yeah, it's funny how it works. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: ♪ I go walkin' ♪ 
LIAM: I have a question, too. Does that necrotic damage stay gone? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Sorry, sorry, it heals up with your morning time. 
TRAVIS: Let's go, Father Time. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: What did you get? What is yours? 
ASHLEY: It's a brownie. 
TALIESIN: I'm so curious to see what your face will be when that finally-- 
TRAVIS: Me too. 64, we're fine. 
MATT: So you're-- 
TALIESIN: Ooh, a good number. 
MATT: You're sensing for, roll a perception check to see if you can make up any sort of details or sense of necrotic undeath in the vicinity. 
TRAVIS: 16. 
MATT: 16. Nothing seems to catch your eye, your nose, the hairs on the back of your neck. You don't feel like it's a serious challenge at the moment. 
TRAVIS: Weird. 
LAURA: Where do they come from? 
TRAVIS: Don't know. They're brought on by the night... just like me. 
SAM: I really think he's working on a book. 
LAURA: Yeah, what's going on? 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
TALIESIN: Also, it's the morning right now and I really, I feel your energy so hard. I don't think the night is your vibe. 
TRAVIS: Thank you, Ashton! I'm so glad to hear that the vibe is being received so well. 
TALIESIN: It wasn't a compliment, but I'm glad it got received that way. 
LAURA: I feel like Chet's more alive here since he's never been here before. 
TRAVIS: It's my peeps. 
TRAVIS and LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It is nice here. 
LIAM: Bright eyed and bushy tailed. 
TALIESIN: I like it. I mean, I don't, but I like it. 
SAM: Is there anything I have to Identify before we get going? Anything, any objects that we needed to? 
TALIESIN: I feel like we're-- 
TRAVIS: Not the charm, not the-- 
SAM: Otherwise, I will attune to something else. 
TRAVIS: Weapons. 
LIAM: These washboard abs! Orym tucks his feet under a tree root and just starts crunching. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy, let's go. Anything from the pirate ship? No. Oh, do we need to identify the (mumbles) spyglass. 
LIAM: The schmargle flask? 
TRAVIS: But we don't know that he has. 
TALIESIN: I mean, is it fancy? 
SAM: Is there anything you need me to identify? 
TRAVIS: We're good. I got nothing. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh, we're being that player, are we, Liam? Ah, I've missed this Liam. 
LAURA: He's always that player. 
TALIESIN: I haven't seen this Liam in a while. 
TRAVIS: Atta boy, atta boy. 
MARISHA: Echoes of Caleb. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! All around. 
TALIESIN: Smug Liam! Been wondering where smug Liam has been. 
TRAVIS: It's a buffet. 
LAURA: You'll run out of room. 
LIAM: Oh, I have an identical one of these guys. 
TRAVIS: A buffet. 
LIAM: But that's kind of you. 
LAURA: Well, fuck off. 
LIAM: Well, you fuck off, too. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. With a warmer morning, though still cold in its own right-- 
SAM: Warmer morning. 
MATT: -- before you, with a decent day's travel, you'll likely reach what you hope to be the base of the three mountains by nightfall or shortly after it. Who is leading the journey this day? Is it still going to be you, Fearne? 
TALIESIN: I've been impressed by your leadership so far. 
ASHLEY: Yes, well, I mean, yeah, I'm a leader. What can I say? 
TALIESIN: You fit the environment. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: Can I hop up on your shoulders? 
ASHLEY: Yes, of course. 
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to listen-- 
ASHLEY: Come, come. 
LIAM: -- and look for threats. 
MATT: Okay. Roll a survival check for me. 
TALIESIN: (jumping noise) 
TRAVIS: Good jumping exert. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
TRAVIS: (jumping noise) 
MATT: 19, okay. 
TRAVIS: Very "Sonic the Hedgehog." (pinging) 
MATT: The first leg of your journey during this day, getting deeper into the jungle where it becomes full rainforest, the vine cover is very thick and as they drape and tumble down, occasionally, you can see these beautiful points of vibrant yellow, purple flowers that dot the sides of these trees. Uncertain what they are, necessarily, if you want to make a nature check at first glance. 
ASHLEY: Should I make the nature check? Because I'm really bad at-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: But you're so good at out here in the woods. 
SAM: You're doing great. Keep going. Guidance. 
LAURA: I have shit nature, too. 
ASHLEY: All right, let me see what these are. (chuckles) 
LIAM: Did you Guide yourself? 
TRAVIS: The little chuckle. 
TALIESIN: The giggle. 
LIAM: Did you Guide yourself, Fearnie? 
SAM: I Guided her. 
ASHLEY: I didn't. Oh, you did? 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Okay! 14. 
LAURA: That's not bad. 
MATT: 14's not bad. You're not quite certain what they represent. What you do know is that usually bright colors in nature are either drawing things to them. Bright colors in creatures is warding things off. For plants that color, you get the sense that it's trying to be invitational. 
ASHLEY: I think they're fine. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh nice. 
MARISHA: Remember the ones in the Feywild we had to sing to or they'd scream? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that makes me think of these. 
TRAVIS: Would you like me to get you one to put in your hair? 
ASHLEY: Well, I think we should be really-- 
TRAVIS: Really, it's no trouble at all! 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: What is happening? 
MARISHA: What's gotten into him? 
LAURA: What is going on? 
MARISHA: I don't know! 
LIAM: Something in the mist. 
MATT: Do you go acquire a flower? 
MARISHA: It's odd. 
TRAVIS: Yes. I'll acquire a flower. 
MATT: Purple or yellow? 
SAM: He's gone Dickensian. 
MARISHA: "He's gone Dickensian." 
TRAVIS: Purple. 
ASHLEY: Yes, good choice. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Not a good choice. 
MATT: You jaunt up to the base of one of the nearby trees where within reach you can see one of the purple flowers itself. It has-- 
LIAM: (monster growl) 
MATT: -- six large flower petals that reach out and then curl at the edges. On the inside you can-- 
LAURA: Just like teeth. 
TALIESIN: (deadpan) No, don't, stop. (laughter) 
MATT: Reach up, cut it down, and as you reach for it, you acquire it without issue and return. 
TRAVIS: Oh, romance wins, motherfuckers! Fearne, would you accept this flower on behalf of romantics everywhere? 
LAURA: Insight check. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It is lovely, thank you. 
TRAVIS: Not as lovely as ♪ you-hoo! ♪ 
ASHLEY: Oh wow! I'm going to put this up and put it with the rest of them. 
MARISHA: You know, I've heard of little parasites, that can get in your brain. 
LAURA: Coming from flowers? 
MARISHA: Like just from jungle settings. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to put this on my somewhere else. 
TRAVIS: Any pollen on my hands from the flower at all? Anything like that? 
MATT: There's a thin layer of an orangeish pollen, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: This is going to be your fault when she turns on all of us. 
ASHLEY: What? 
TRAVIS: Fair. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to keep it down here. I'm not going to put it near my brain just in case the creepy crawley comes out. Not that-- 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: What? 
ASHLEY: It couldn't make its way. 
LAURA: Oh, you can move them around. 
TRAVIS: I didn't even see it last time. That's what was happening? 
LAURA: That's cute. 
MARISHA: So fun. 
TRAVIS: The one in the middle looks like a poop. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's great. 
LIAM: Nice. 
LAURA: Ew. 
ASHLEY: The Shattered Teef. 
TRAVIS: It's like a stop motion. 
MATT: The first leg of the day's journey seems to go by without issue. Go ahead and roll again another survival check as you continue deeper into the valley. As the mists grow thicker, the sounds of birds grow louder, which leads you to believe that there are a number of a thicker-- There are more aerial denizens that exist towards and near the base of the mountains, especially the mountainous regions above. You don't know if they're hunting or if they're just being social-- 
TRAVIS: Avoiding. 
MATT: -- or avoiding, but the sound of birds above the canopy is getting louder. 
LAURA: Do they sound sweet birds or loud large birds? 
TRAVIS: (birds whistling) 
MATT: Make an nature check. 
TRAVIS: (caws) 
LAURA: Nature. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: Hawks. 
TALIESIN: Big bird. 
LAURA: No, yeah. 
TRAVIS: (like Big Bird) Hi! 
LAURA: Six. 
TALIESIN: Run! 
LAURA: They're birds. 
MATT: Could be either. Birds are fun. 
LAURA: I think those are monkeys. 
TRAVIS: Big Bird booking. 
MATT: So what's you other nature? Your-- 
ASHLEY: 24. 
MATT: 24 is great. 
ASHLEY: My goat eyes. 
LIAM: Save it for Candela, okay? 
MATT: In following the river down, and you can see it crashes as a 20-foot waterfall into a natural rock pool a little ways off from where you are and then you can see the cliff descent was rather sharp for a bit before it evens off. The slow, gradual descent begins to come to a stop where water is now gathered in a basin around what is going to be the rising base of the nearest mountain of the three. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MATT: You are currently now able to continue to follow the river where it goes, or you can see another beaten path that seems to follow the perimeter of this larger body of condensed water. 
ASHLEY: How do we feel? 
TALIESIN: I'm feeling perimeter, personally. 
ASHLEY: Perimeter? I was feeling perimeter as well. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Perimeter. 
SAM: (mockingly) Perimeter. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's hard to say with this kind of voice. Perimeter. 
TALIESIN: Perimeter. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm a little drunk. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: Okay. So you're following the exterior of the water on the beaten path? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: On the base of the mountain, is that what you said? 
MATT: I think so. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: What was the marching order for this day, by the way? I forgot to ask about. 
SAM and LAURA: Same. 
LIAM: I'm still on Fearne's shoulder. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'll be in the number two position. 
ASHLEY: Holding your little ankles. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Number two. 
TRAVIS: Crabwalk. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm holding your little ankles and pushing your little feet. 
MATT: So I guess a perception check from you. 
SAM: Stuck in there? Do I need to pull it out? 
TRAVIS: I'm trying to get a little waggle going. 
LIAM: That is a 27. 
MATT: 27. 
LAURA: You keeping an eye out for danger? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: And human hoo-ha. More humanoid. 
LAURA: Human hoo has? 
MATT: Two things. 
TRAVIS: Oh, boy. 
TALIESIN: Civilization. 
MATT: One, you stop Fearne from moving forward at one point because you can see the pathway where you're walking, the ground itself, the texture changes for about an eight- to nine-foot length of it. You can see the brush that's around it has a somewhat darker coloration. The vibrant green is a little more brown. 
LIAM: Right here, like just ahead of us? 
MATT: About 10 feet ahead of you. 
LIAM: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up. 
LAURA: What do you see? 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
TRAVIS: Brown. 
LIAM: That ground looks funny, somehow. It doesn't look like what came before it and what's after it. 
LAURA: Detect Thoughts. 
TRAVIS: And a sniff. 
TALIESIN: On the ground? 
TRAVIS: Just because we stopped the train. 
MATT: Perception check. You don't detect any unexpected thoughts within the-- 
LAURA: No creatures within the vicinity. 
TRAVIS: It's a crap roll. 
ASHLEY: No sniffs? 
LIAM: Does that look like a coverup of some kind? 
TALIESIN: Maybe a hunting trap. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: I don't really want to spring it. Should we just try and walk around? Is that possible? 
LIAM: Is there anybody watching? 
MATT: With your perception check right now, you don't see anybody in the vicinity, no. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Does it look like something? 
TRAVIS: Just brown all of a sudden. 
MATT: Do you want to go and inspect the--? 
MARISHA: Is it a perfect circle? 
MATT: Well, I mean, the pathway where you're walking is about two-and-a-half, three feet wide, where the foliage has been carved a bit and the dirt and undergrowth of it looks like the texture's a little-- It's like the nearby brush moves with the pathway. Here it seems to cross across a little bit, so the texture's odd and the surrounding brush that's pushed into that area, it's a darker color. 
TALIESIN: It's a catch pit. 
MARISHA: Does it look like how hunters will use foliage, and stuff to-- 
MATT: It's possible. You can make an investigation check. 
MARISHA: Sure, and then I'll also pull out Pâté. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: My poor little dummy boy. 
TALIESIN: Are we going to spring this thing? 
TRAVIS: Well, I think also-- Well. 
MARISHA: I'll at least do an invest-ooh-ooh, investigation. 
LIAM: They check in, but they don't check out. 
MARISHA: 17. 
MATT: Yeah, so glancing and getting a good perimeter view, it looks like the brush that's been pushed here, I mean, it's been pushed here. It looks like an area was cleared out, and then other distant brush was gathered to fill the space. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Because that was pulled, it slowly died. 
MARISHA: Died, okay. 
MATT: Which means it's been here for a little bit. It's not super fresh, but enough to where the coloration is turning. Indeed, the ground area where the texture is different, it looks like they've laid over bits of roots to try and obscure the ground. 
MARISHA: Hide a pit. 
LIAM: So days or weeks, someone set this. 
TRAVIS: Can I, because it's so different from everything we've seen through the hours, can I lick my fingers, and touch the ground, and use my Grim Psychometry to tap into the history-- 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: -- of this location? 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll your history. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Grim Psychometry. 
TRAVIS: Advantage, but I think that's only fey, fiend, and undead. Oh! 17 plus three, 20. 
MARISHA: That's grueling. 
TRAVIS: Dirty 20. 
MATT: 20. In sensing the vicinity here, you don't gather any tragedy or dark history that is tethered to this location. You can sense the occasional choking of shadow that washes over these areas when light and sun is not as present. 
TRAVIS: Fuck, what does that mean? 
MATT: But that's the extent of what you're able to sense in the space around you. 
TRAVIS: That makes sense. Ah, it didn't pick up anything necessarily terrible, but there's that feeling again that when the light goes, it gets real shitty. 
LAURA: Hmm. 
MARISHA: It could be just more of those little, little ghoulie ghouls. 
TALIESIN: I think it's a hunting trap. 
LIAM: Well, it-- 
MARISHA: I think this is a hunting trap. 
LAURA: Let's get as far away from this as we can, yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Let's just set it on fire. 
LIAM: Is it bypass-able? Because it's along a path along the water, is that right? 
MATT: It's bypassable, you just step off the path-- 
LIAM: Just step out of the-- 
MATT: -- and cycle around. 
TRAVIS: What would clear an area and then collect it if you weren't going to, I don't know, set it on fire. 
LIAM: There's no secondary shit off the side of the path that the path is a red herring for? 
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check. 
LIAM: Perception. 
LAURA: I feel like if we set it on fire, it'll alert-- 
LIAM: Natural 20, 31. 
LAURA: -- whatever's here that we're here. 
MATT: 31. You don't see anything in the vicinity of it. 
LIAM: Okay, all right. 
LAURA: You'll be fine. 
TRAVIS: No, I just want to, you know, see what happens. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Let's just keep-- 
MARISHA: I mean, if it feels like a hunting trap, we should be, I guess, on the lookout for civilization. 
TALIESIN: That's the other thing. 
SAM: Hunters, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Are there humanoid tracks by this thing at all? Do we see-- 
LIAM: I think with 31, I probably-- 
TRAVIS: It's a giant beaver. 
LAURA: You would've seen it. 
LIAM: See toe beans. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Right? 
LIAM: That's what that smell is. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TRAVIS: I mean, we've seen some crazy animals. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Doesn't have to be humanoid. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Feels good. (intermittent chuckling) 
MATT: But you're asking about if there are tracks around? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Hope my kids don't watch this show someday. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, like animal tracks? 
MATT: If you'd like to make a survival check. 
TALIESIN: Oh, oh, because I was going off of that. 
MATT: I have to separate it. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MATT: Perception is too powerful if it can do everything. 
TALIESIN: No, no, no, that's fair. 
MATT: So, being able to see details in the environment is one thing, but the actual search for tracks, which tracks would be layered over-- 
TALIESIN: My survival sucks, but I'm going to go for it. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. 
MARISHA: Is it investigation? 
MATT: The natural environment. 
TALIESIN: Survival. 
TRAVIS: Survival. 
MARISHA: Oh, survival? 
LAURA: Oh, so not investigation? 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: Survival to look for tracks and to follow tracks. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. It could be worse. 
MATT: I'll allow investigation if need be, too, that can sit in the same space. 
LIAM: Survival. 
TALIESIN: They're the same on me. Ah, that's not bad. 20. 
LIAM: Survival. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
MATT: 20's not bad. 
TRAVIS: (murmuring) Not bad. 
MATT: Looking through the texture of the undisturbed parts of the surrounding jungle, indeed, you can see there are signs of foot traffic. Maybe even just a few days in the past. Some of the mud is still sunken in. It looks like the fallen leaves and such have mostly covered them, but if you pull back the underbrush, you can see there are signs of footprints and footfalls and people that make these trails travel these trails often enough to the point where within a week, probably. 
LIAM: Okay, there are folks live here. 
SAM: That's all right. 
LIAM: We are visitors. 
TRAVIS: For the visual, it's a circular area that's been cleared, and the brush has been gathered in the middle of it, or just sporadic? 
MATT: So, the path that you're following is a footpath where a lot of travel's gone back and forth, it seems, where it has a natural shifting of this pathway. A portion of the path, the texture is odd, and the surrounding brush that normally sits at the sides of it is discolored, like someone cleared out that area, and then filled the edges to still leave the path there. 
LAURA: Let's throw something in the middle of it, see what happens. 
SAM: That's a good idea. 
TALIESIN: I think we just leave it. 
TRAVIS: I just kick Laudna. 
MARISHA: (yelps) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm perfectly content to just leave it, personally, but I'm fine with-- 
LAURA: Well, I mean, if this is a trap laid by the Raito people, then maybe it's a good thing, we can-- 
SAM: Give them their amulet. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: So the trap is in the middle of the walkway? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Probably better when-- 
MARISHA: It's like a game trail. 
TRAVIS: Ah, he said yes, it is a trap. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm-- 
LIAM: It's like we're looking at the chair again. 
LAURA: I'm going to telekinetic-- 
ASHLEY: See what I did there? 
LAURA: Take a stone from across the path, and throw it into the middle it. 
TALIESIN: That's always fun. 
MATT: Okay. You check and find a stone that-- 
TALIESIN: Backing up a bit. 
MATT: -- seems to have enough weight to it, and-- (stone launches) (thud) It hits, and the whole floor of it, collapses beneath under the weight of the stone. Parts of it stick out, and still hold it. It wasn't a massive distributed weight, but a small central one, so part of it does fall in and collapse. 
LIAM: Spikies? 
MATT: You hear the initial crash, and then an impact, and then a second crash. 
LIAM: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: Down below? 
MARISHA: In the hole? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. You step up to the edge and glance down. 
TALIESIN: Turned into what? 
MATT: It looks like there are a number of sharpened pikes-- 
LAURA: Mm. 
MATT: -- that are aimed upward, and then part of that has fallen inward, and it looks like there's a secondary layer, it's a two-part trap. 
LAURA: Sheesh. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: The interior of it is about 12-foot from end to end. 
MARISHA: Damn. 
TALIESIN: Damn! 
LIAM: How deep does it look? Are we able to tell? 
MATT: It looks like it goes down about 12 or so feet. 
ASHLEY: Dang, that's a lot of work. 
MATT: There's an eight-foot portion eight feet down-- 
ASHLEY: That's a lot of work. 
MATT: -- to the first hit, and then collapsing into a second set beneath. 
LIAM: That is a lot of work. 
LAURA: I feel bad for-- What kind of creature do they think they're catching in here? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Maybe the boar. 
TRAVIS: How much rope do we have? 
TALIESIN: 48. 
LIAM: 45 feet. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Just the one? 
LIAM: On me, I don't know what you have. 
MARISHA: I feel-- 
TRAVIS: Anybody else got a 50-footer? 
SAM: I got 20 feet. 
TALIESIN: Are we really going down there? 
TRAVIS: It might be a good idea to make a link, right? 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: Just in case one of us slips and falls. 
MARISHA: I also have rope. 
TALIESIN: We're also going to keep walking. 
LIAM: Oh, across? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a-- 
LIAM: We'll just repeat our river trick. 
TRAVIS: Plus there's the Feather Fallies. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay, never mind. 
TALIESIN: We'll be fine. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: All right, let's go around it. 
SAM: Should we leave a note? "Sorry we've messed up your trap. Call this number. Here's our insurance." 
MARISHA: We could try and reset it for them, theoretically. 
SAM: Eh, that's fine. 
LAURA: Nah. 
MARISHA: Fearne could do a little plant growth over it. 
LIAM: Come on, Fish Cut Grass, let's go. 
ASHLEY: Just cover it? 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Fish Cut. 
MARISHA: Fish Cut Grass. 
SAM: Fresh Cut Bass. 
TRAVIS: (retches) (exclaiming) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That's the one, that's the one. 
LIAM: Level up. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Come on, Bass-o-matic. 
MATT: All right. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I should've stopped it. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Ooh, I want sushi. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It's so good. Sorry. 
SAM: You can order sushi right now. 
MATT: If you're still helming this journey, make a survival check. 
ASHLEY: Shall I? 
TALIESIN: I've been enjoying it. 
MARISHA: Dude, I can-- 
LAURA: Oh, another survival check? 
MARISHA: -- smash a fish ball. 
LAURA: Are you assisted from Chet? 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Always. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TALIESIN: Don't-- 
ASHLEY: Guide myself as well. 
MARISHA: (deadpan) No, please, don't. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! Ooh! All right. 
SAM: Three. 
ASHLEY: 30. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: 30. 
TALIESIN: Monster. 
ASHLEY: I see everything. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Fucking Matt. Ah, sure. 
MATT: Yeah, you-- 
LIAM: I see London, I see France. 
MATT: -- along with the help of both your tiny compatriots keeping eyes out, begin to notice a trend of traps set through this part of the rainforest floor. You see a handful of these large nets that are bundled up and kept at the base of certain trees. There are also what look to be loops that are set upon the ground. 
TRAVIS: Snares. 
MARISHA: Like snares? 
MATT: Snares, that's what I was looking for. 
MARISHA: Like rabbit snares almost? 
MATT: But large, heavy rope, and multiple layer there. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You watch too much "Alone." 
MARISHA: "Alone." 
TRAVIS: Dinner! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's all good. 
LIAM: That's also how you catch wookiees, guys. 
MATT: That's also valid. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's all I was thinking about. (laughs) 
MARISHA: You said big-ass snares? 
MATT: Some of them are large and meant to catch larger creatures. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: But you continue keeping an eye out for these things, and manage to avoid stepping into them. 
ASHLEY: Watch out for that. 
MATT: Keeping out for certain-- 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: There's one. 
SAM: Wow. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: Now you're just showing off. 
LIAM: You see them easy, did Nana Morri have stuff like that littered about? 
ASHLEY: Of course! All over. 
LIAM: Well, there you go. 
SAM: What does she try to trap? What is she-- 
ASHLEY: Well, all kinds of things. 
MARISHA: But you were friends with little floppy bunnies and stuff. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but those-- 
MARISHA: Would you catch them and then befriend them? 
ASHLEY: No, those just appeared some days. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I was not-- No answers, but all right. (laughter) 
LIAM: Ah, that's perfect. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Eventually, the gathered pool of water in this basin that's formed this deep into the valley comes to an end. You find the edge of the crescent, and you begin to see the rocky climb-- 
LAURA: Oh god, we have to climb that. 
MATT: -- of what you can assume to be the base of the mountain, the first one, the closest one. 
LAURA: Do we see the big tree? 
MATT: You see a number of trees everywhere. 
LAURA: The big one. 
ASHLEY: How are we supposed to know which one it is? 
MATT: You don't see one that's-- 
TALIESIN: Maybe we have to break-- 
ASHLEY: Is it bigger? 
TALIESIN: -- the treeline a little bit. 
MARISHA: But this is-- 
SAM: Maybe. 
MARISHA: It's a rocky wall to get to a base of a mountain? 
MATT: So, the jungle is slowly beginning to incline, which connotates, based on the journey you've taken thus far, that the landscape is beginning to rise towards, as the mountain is beginning to form in front of you as you travel. 
LIAM: Here we go, Runyon Canyon guys. 
TRAVIS: How's the sun? 
MARISHA: I was about to ask. 
MATT: At this point, it'd be mid-afternoon. 
MARISHA: I'll send Pâté on a quick scout. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: While you do that, Matthew, is a tree an object or a creature, or neither? 
LIAM: Or either. 
MATT: Depends on what tree. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. (laughs) 
MARISHA: This tree could be a creature because it was a titan, right? 
TRAVIS: What a GM answer. 
MARISHA: It was a dead person. 
SAM: Was it? Or was it-- 
MARISHA: Or a thing? 
SAM: Was it? 
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah. 
LAURA: The tree that we're-- Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Technically, sort of-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it started out-- 
SAM: Because I have Locate Object or Locate Creature. 
TRAVIS: For sure, for sure. 
LAURA: You could try to Locate-- 
SAM: Or Find the Path. But I think technically, the spell says we have to have something from the place that we're going. 
LAURA: That's the-- It's the most annoying spell-- 
SAM: It's the worst spell. 
LAURA: -- because it assumes that you already have been there. I don't know, it's fucking dumb. I always hated using it every time. 
SAM: Do we have anything from this tree? 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: Well-- 
MARISHA: We have Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I'm not from this tree. 
SAM: (gasps) We do have Ashton. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but you're-- 
MARISHA: But you're (breathy) Ha-shari. 
TALIESIN: I've never been here before. 
SAM and ASHLEY: (breathy) Ha-shari. 
MARISHA: Ha-ha-ha. 
SAM: Yeah, but what if you or your blood has. What if-- 
ASHLEY: How do you know you haven't been here before? 
TALIESIN: I-- While I can't prove it, it would be highly unlikely, given what I know about my background at this point, that at any point my family would've made it this far. This is very far away from the village we found. 
MARISHA: Didn't you already get some tinglies? 
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah. 
MARISHA: So? 
LAURA: Yeah. What if when you were a kid, you were here. Didn't you remember getting shunted away somewhere? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was-- Well, that's different. But okay, no, I'll play this game, sure. 
LIAM: Different how? 
TALIESIN: I mean, I-- I mean, honestly, I guess it wasn't. It doesn't feel the same, but-- 
LIAM: Is it worth a shot? 
SAM: To do Find the Path and use him as the thing that we have from the object? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: I mean, it's cool. What if it worked? 
ASHLEY: It's cool. 
LIAM: What if? 
ASHLEY: How would you do it? Like a little, do we need-- 
SAM: Well, we just-- 
LAURA: A little drop of his blood. 
ASHLEY: Cut him open? 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Little pinprick? 
SAM: Sure, I could-- I mean, it doesn't say we need blood, but-- 
LAURA: His blood could be the object. 
MARISHA: I mean, you'll know really quick if it doesn't work, right? Because it'll just point at him. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Just a little pinprick ♪ 
TALIESIN: That's all I need, Winslow. 
SAM: I'm happy to burn a 6th-level spell just to try it. 
MARISHA: Whoa! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Wowsers! 
SAM: Could be super cool! 
TALIESIN: I mean-- 
SAM: Or it could be doing nothing for a 6th-level spell, which I'm cool with. 
TALIESIN: I'm not going to tell you how to live your life at this point. 
LAURA: Giant wave! (splashes) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm-- 
MARISHA: Dude. 
TALIESIN: I doubt that it's going to work, but I'm not here to tell you how to live your life. 
MARISHA: Just got the dragon real wet. 
SAM: I'll do it. (laughter) 
SAM: Why not? 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
LIAM: We carry these chairs. 
SAM: This is really bending the rules of this spell. 
MARISHA: No, it's being creative. 
SAM: Clever. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: And clever. 
SAM: Yes, I am going to cast Find the Path, and using Ashton as an object from the location I want to find, I will call to the Changebringer to light the way. 
MARISHA: Titan shit. 
MATT: What location are you attempting to find? 
SAM: The location of the Tree-- 
LIAM: Evontra'vir. 
SAM: Of Evontra'vir. 
MATT: Okay. You take a minute or so to prepare the ritual, focus, and open yourself to the guidance of the Changebringer, themself the goddess of travel and freedom and open pathways. As you concentrate and focus on Ashton, the spell dissipates. 
LAURA: Oh! No. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: You ruined my spell! (laughter) 
SAM: You wasted it! 
TALIESIN: I'm not sure, we should try it again. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We should totally try again. 
LIAM: Twice to be sure. 
TALIESIN: We'll try again tomorrow just to be sure. 
MATT: It's about then that, Orym, you hear the snapping of twigs and moving of branches not far off from the path you're currently walking. 
LIAM: Does it sound like lumbering animals or like people creeping about? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
SAM: Maybe my spell called the tree to us! 
LAURA: Oh, maybe it is, maybe spell turned around. 
LIAM: 26. 
MATT: 26. It would look to be-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: -- five figures, humanoid. 
SAM: Five figures. 
MATT: You just barely see them shifting silently, making almost no sound. 
LIAM: Can they see us? 
MATT: They are currently slowly fanning out to the back of where the rest of your troop is not paying attention. They are coming from behind while you're journeying up the side of this mountain's beginning. 
LIAM: I tug Fearne's floppy ears, and point past her shoulder. 
ASHLEY: Ah! Oh, oh. 
LAURA: Hmm? 
MATT: As you all begin to see Orym waving his hands in the air, a voice shouts out, "(command in foreign language)" 
SAM: Oh, oh no. 
MATT: Emerging from the nearby brush, you see five figures in thick, heavy, green-brown cloaks that look like woven moss, like the forest's undergrowth itself has been made into a cloak that encases the entirety of the back of their frame. Their arms just barely poking through. You can see heavy longbows, these wicked-looking, metallic, these dark gray metallic longbows that are bent backwards, that you can see are made from the same woe steel that you encountered in the bases previously. You can see a number of them, while the hoods are up, their faces are painted in similar colorations to help obscure their skin tone, and blend in better with the surroundings. From within the cloak, you can see colorful adorned armor made of numerous wooden plates that have been bound into a torso piece. You can see it, it's a very unique type of armor that you've only seen pieces of in your brief encounter in the remnants of the cavern that you fought with that creature not but a day before. As the the troop sits there, weapons drawn, arrows nocked into these dangerous-looking longbows, one of them, the one that the voice seemed to shout from, steps up. "(question in foreign language)" 
SAM: I will cast Tongues on myself. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LIAM: Who's got the necklace? You think it'll harm us or help us? To offer it? 
LAURA: Help us, help us. 
MATT: "Put down your weapons." 
SAM: Everyone drop your weapons. 
TALIESIN: I'm fine with that. 
ASHLEY: Do you want me to put you down, or you want to stay on my--? 
LIAM: I'll stay. I drop Seedling into the earth. 
TRAVIS: I lower my arms. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Swat at him. 
MATT: In that tense silence, almost the insects seem to grow quieter. As you all place your weapons down in that stillness. You can barely make out the eyes from underneath the hoods darting about, as the central figure, you see lowers her bow, and you see the feminine features. She pulls the hood back and you can see a woman in probably her early 40s or so. Short white hair that is pulled back tightly with some strands, or braids that pull into beads and colorful decor. You can see the facial markings themselves also blend with a number of scars. Her eyes are a piercing deep, dark blue coloration as she stares right towards the center of the troop, looking for someone to give any sense of leadership, but glances towards you as the one to have reacted to the phrase that she said, and told everyone to put their stuff down. "Who are you, and how did you get here?" And that's where we're going to go to break. 
ALL: (sighing) 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! 
LIAM: Ah! 
SAM: I'll use the break to learn the Aishio language. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yes. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Download it. 
MATT: We'll come back at that moment here in a few minutes. Hang tight, we'll see you shortly. 
SAM: I know Aishio.

Narrator 2: - Utterly doomed Midst - Narrator 1: Yeah, it's still pretty doomed! Narrator 2: - At pretty much the moment where we last saw it. Well, that's not quite true. Narrator 1: It's a few hours later. Narrator 2: Stationary Hill is not looking so hot at the moment.

JESTER: Oh hey, everyone. It's me, Jester. So the Traveler and I were going to tell you guys all about subscribing to Twitch, but, um, (giggles) it sort of seems like he's not really here right now, which is so stupid. Traveler? Traveler?! Artie! (grunts) You know what, it's fine. I can do it by myself, with myself. (laughs) I Invoke Duplicity.
DUPLICATE: Oh, hello, Jester. 
JESTER: Hi, Jester. Okay, so what we're going to do today is tell the people at home all about the good stuff they get when subscribing to Twitch. 
DUPLICATE: Oh, I don't know what Twitch is, but that sounds good, let's go. 
JESTER: No, that's perfect, because this works for you, too, then. Okay so, there's a professionally moderated live chat. 
DUPLICATE: Ooh! 
JESTER: And if you subscribe, you can post the links in the chat. 
DUPLICATE: (gasps) Like a link to a cool hamster video? 
JESTER: Exactly like that! So what we do here is tell, like, really cool stories, right? And sometimes, like, crazy shit happens when we're telling those stories, and people that subscribe get special emotes so you can express how you feel. 
DUPLICATE: What if you live on the side of Exandria where it's really late, and you're like, "I'm just going to close my eyes for a few seconds," and then it's two hours, and the music is playing, and you're like, "Oh no, I missed the whole show!" 
JESTER: Oh no, that's a great question. Well, if you subscribe to Twitch, then you can just watch all of our VODs as soon as the live broadcast ends. So cool, right? 
DUPLICATE: So cool. 
JESTER: I know. Another really cool thing is you can gift subscriptions to people. Like, I could buy a subscription for you, duplicate Jester, and for other p-- What are you doing? 
DUPLICATE: Look what I found. 
JESTER: Oh my gosh, paint brushes. 
DUPLICATE: I could draw a dick. 
JESTER: Oh, well, technically, technically that might break Twitch's Terms of Service, so. But there's no rule against, like, drawing chubby little snakes. 
DUPLICATE: (giggles) Yeah, or a really long balloon sword. 
JESTER: Yeah, or like a really thick rope, with like, two honking knots at the end of it. 
DUPLICATE: Cucumber, with two tomatoes. 
JESTER: Yeah! A banana, you know, sitting next to an onion and an avocado. 
DUPLICATE: Like a mushroom, with like a little cap on it. 
JESTER: A wiener dog, with just two feet. 
DUPLICATE: Yeah. 
JESTER: Artie, where are you? 
DUPLICATE: Should we go look for him? 
JESTER: Yeah, sure, why not. Oh, don't forget to subscribe to Critical Role. Okay, let's go! 
DUPLICATE: Okay! [whimsical music] 

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. (snickering) Goddamn it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Stay down there and pray to the old ones. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. 
MARISHA: Oh, we were talking to people. 
MATT: So. 
SAM: Oh shit, that's right we were. 
MARISHA: Sorry everyone. Fuck the game! 
SAM: Fuck the game. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: As this crew-- 
LAURA: Well, guys. 
MATT: -- of five cloaked figures have partially surrounded you as you acknowledge their arrival, they have you at weapons nocked. The tension is palpable and a central leadership figure, a female hunter figure of this troop has stepped forward, pulled her hood back and spoke to you in Common, asking who you are-- 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: -- and why are you here. 
SAM: I thought she was asking in her language. 
MATT: She switched over to Common. 
LAURA: Oh, amazing. 
SAM: She's multilingual. 
LAURA: Iffodola. 
TALIESIN: Went right to it, did we? 
MATT: A few of them look confused. "And what of them?" 
LIAM: We maybe found traces of them. If I-- 
SAM: Something they owned? 
LIAM: I have an offering. I want to reach into my pack and get it. It's not a weapon. May I? 
MATT: The arrows that are currently nocked, two of them go directly towards you and tighten. 
LIAM: Super slow. 
MATT: "I will inspect it." 
LIAM: Okay. I might have to hop off my friend's shoulder. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: She waits for you to hop off. 
LIAM: (leap and thump) 
ASHLEY: Oh, you jumped. 
LAURA: (laughs) Wiggle, wiggle. 
ASHLEY: (fumbling) Whoa! 
TALIESIN: I'd say just leave it on the-- 
MATT: Puts the hand out, and you can see there's a very well made leather, fingerless gauntlet that goes down to about mid forearm. It is beautifully and intricately made with this back lacing that goes across the entirety of the forearm. You can see these metal rivets right around where the knuckles are. 
LIAM: Can I reach for it? My sword's over there on the ground. Okay. Real slow. Slow, slow, slow. I'll pull out that necklace. We found this. In a cave closer to the coast. 
SAM: Fireball. 
MATT: "This... This belonged to Temu's father. 
SAM: Temu's father? 
TRAVIS: Temu? 
LIAM: Is Temu here? 
MATT: "No." 
LIAM: Oh. Oh. 
MATT: "He'll be grateful to have it returned to his family and his memory preserved in strength." She steps back a bit and puts it into a pouch. 
LIAM: We are visitors here. We're really sorry to be-- I don't know if this is your land. But we're here looking for Evontra'vir. 
MATT: "For what purpose?" 
TALIESIN: For me. Blood of titan. I'm looking to know myself. I'm Ashton Greymoore of the Hishari. If that means anything. 
MATT: "It does not mean anything to me. But you're looking for answers." 
TALIESIN: There's a lot going on in the outside world right now. I don't know how it's affecting you here, but things are changing. 
MATT: "Indeed." 
TALIESIN: Maybe looking to some older answers. 
MATT: "(sighs) Well. Do you know where you go and what lies before you?" 
TALIESIN: (laughs) Never. 
LIAM: Boy, that'd be great. 
MATT: "You just came on a whim and got this far?" 
LAURA: We were sent by Keyleth of the Air Ashari. 
MATT: "I do not know this person. But either you're extremely lucky or extremely foolish, or both." 
TRAVIS: Both. 
TALIESIN: Both. 
TRAVIS: With respect. 
SAM: More recently, a woman named Jirana sent us or gave us more specific directions. Do you know her? 
MATT: There's some turns of heads of acknowledgement. "We know of the Shore Shrew, yes." 
SAM: Yeah, she's a very wise, amazing person. 
LIAM: She gave us a ride. 
TALIESIN: And this isn't whim. This is... Necessity. Sorrow. Friendship. This is... People are going to die and we need to know things. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage. 
SAM: Come on. 
TALIESIN: Oh, me. Oh, boy. 
SAM: Come on. 
TALIESIN: Always fun. 
LIAM: Do it. 
TRAVIS: Come on, baby. Here we go! 
SAM: Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter. 
TALIESIN: Really good for me. Nine. (oohing) 
MATT: Nine. 
TALIESIN: I have a negative two. 
MATT: I know. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
LAURA: Stop talking! 
TALIESIN: I can't help it. That's why I have a negative two. 
TRAVIS: Double ramped. 
MATT: "You have done a service in bringing this back to us and to the family of the fallen. For that we will not stand in your way. But we offer no guidance other than... Find your destination and be gone." 
LAURA: In your head, you hear, didn't we find some armor of theirs as well? 
SAM: Yeah, some old steel. 
LIAM: We gathered it all up, right? 
LAURA and SAM: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yeah. That's Liam asking the table. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: We did find a few more of their personal effects. 
MATT: "Are you grave robbers?" 
LAURA: No. 
LIAM: No, we were attacked by a creature of some kind and there was a nest? 
LAURA: It seems like quite a few people had lost their lives there. We meant only to return it to you. 
LIAM: We were trying to learn. 
MATT: "Then return it." 
LIAM: Okay, okay, hold on. I've got some of it. I don't think I have the swords, but-- 
TRAVIS: I got them. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: We also messed up one of your traps half a mile back. That was an accident. 
LIAM: Sorry. 
MATT: "That is how we were made aware of your presence." 
LAURA: Can I ask a question? The spirits at night... How do you keep them at bay? 
MATT: "Evontra'vir is rooted between realms. They are a window between life and death. Sometimes... Things are drawn beyond that boundary. This forest has become home to many. You keep your convictions close to you." You see as they tighten their grip on the amulet type trinket that you returned to them. 
LIAM: We wouldn't expect hospitality, but we thank you for your patience. I promise on my own that we mean no harm here. We'll be quick about our business. 
LAURA: With a little guidance, we'd be quicker. 
MATT: "You've gotten this far. Good luck." 
SAM: So we'll just be headed this way. 
MATT: "O Kyo Tsukete." 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MATT: They step back. 
LAURA: You still had Tongues up. 
SAM: What did they say? 
MATT: Roughly says, "Stay safe." The five of them arrows still nocked, though not as tense, but they slowly back into the brush. Until they become more and more challenging to see before the rustling gets quieter and they're gone. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what was your name? 
MATT: They're gone. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
TRAVIS: "Keep your convictions close." 
MARISHA: "Keep your convictions close." 
TRAVIS: The amulet had a list of things that mattered to Iffo-- 
TALIESIN: My faith in the cycle of destruction and creation, endless. 
MARISHA: All their loved ones. 
TRAVIS: My children, my promise to Shotus. But maybe a significant other? 
MARISHA: It's almost like, like a prayer or a cadence that you recite to yourself to not slip. 
TRAVIS: Or forget? 
MARISHA: Or forget. 
SAM: Maybe it protects you from those spirits at night. If you sort of have a deeply held belief. Maybe that's why they didn't mess with me. 
TALIESIN: Or maybe you're made of metal. 
SAM: Or maybe it's because you all could use a little bit more faith is all I'm saying. 
TALIESIN: Or maybe it's because I'm made of stone that they didn't attack me. 
LIAM: It's not a bad way of life. 
TRAVIS: He said, Temu's father, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Temu's. 
TRAVIS: Temu? But in the amulet, it said "My children, Ro and Saka--" 
LAURA: Hikagi. 
ASHLEY: Shikagi. 
LAURA: Sykagi, Sykagi. 
TRAVIS: Sakagi. 
LAURA: I missed an S in there. 
TRAVIS: There was another? 
MARISHA: Promise to Shotas, my love of my children. 
MATT: You didn't ask about it, so... 
TRAVIS: God! (shouts) Come back here! (laughter) 
SAM: We could call him back. 
LIAM: I don't think we should press our luck. 
SAM: All right. 
LIAM: Just going to try to go-- 
ASHLEY: Shotas? We didn't-- There's-- My promise to Shotas? Do we know what that is? 
LAURA: No, we didn't ask anything. 
ASHLEY: Cool. We're doing great. 
MARISHA: I mean, they seemed very done with us. Thanks to Ashton. 
TRAVIS: Don't worry, we'll trigger another one of the-- 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Someone's not getting fished out of the river next time. 
TRAVIS: I'll share my fish. We know how to summon them. All we have to do is trigger it on one of their shitty traps. (laughter) 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: I guess we'll just keep going-- 
LAURA: Keep going the same-- 
SAM: -- the way we were going. 
LAURA: -- direction. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to pay for that. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Should I fly up and see if I can find the tree? 
SAM: You could. I can also ask for divine help. But it might be easier if you just looked and saw it. 
LAURA: Yeah? All right. I'll cast Fly on myself. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Fly. 
ASHLEY: Fly. 
MATT: (whooshes) You race up past the canopy. 
LAURA: Yeah. Up and over so I can see a large tree. 
MATT: Okay. You rise up over the rainforest canopy itself and you see as it rises up before it thins out towards the base of the mountain. The trees still climb for a bit but eventually the heavy almost graphite colored basalt rock that forms the closest mountain seems to take most of the color and shape as it rises up and it's like the entire ground is pushing and it's less of a gradual mountain. It comes to almost a curved spire that peaks upward before it comes to an end. You can see the shape of two others, like there are three of them, facing each other slightly. You don't see, at this current glance, any particular tree that stands out. You can roll a perception check, if you'd like to gauge the scenery beneath you. 
LAURA: I don't know why I chose myself to do this. 
TALIESIN: Feel that. 
LAURA: Four. 
MATT: Four. The jungle the rainforest beneath you is immense and you're taken aback and have a sense of pride that you've traversed what you have so far safely. The best you can do is to try and follow the shape of the mountain or head back down. Because other than that it's just this constant canopy. 
LAURA: Can I go down and pick up Orym and bring him up? 
MATT: Yeah. (whoosh) Dart down. 
TALIESIN: Hey, Orym, what-- 
SAM: Oh no. 
LIAM: Hey, whoa! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I need your help. 
LIAM: What're we-- Okay. 
LAURA: I don't see shit. I mean, I see trees. 
LIAM: Oh, look at the mountains. 
LAURA: Yeah. They're weird, right? I've never seen mountains like that. 
LIAM: Me either. 
LAURA: Do you see a tree? 
LIAM: I'll strain to look to see if there's any irregularity in any of the geography I see. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: 25. 
MATT: 25. What you do notice is, around the mountainside, the canopy seems to drop off. Like where if you're staring at the base of the mountain, this massive column and the jungle all around are on the edges of it. Where the shadows of the two mountains are, the trees almost sink out of view before you reach the outside of the mountain itself. 
LIAM: Okay, you run out of tree before you reach the mountain? 
MATT: Possibly. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Like a doughnut shaped-- 
ASHLEY: Maybe the tree is-- 
SAM: -- chasm around it. 
ASHLEY: -- on the mountain. 
MATT: It would probably need a better point of perspective to see any more. 
LAURA: I wonder if the tree's in the chasm. 
LIAM: Want to get closer? 
LAURA: Yeah. I only got 10 minutes of this. So we got to get close and in a hurry. Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right. Are you returning or are you flying in that direction? 
SAM: They left us! 
LAURA: Trying to get him a little bit, a better perspective. I'm following his direction of where to go so we can see a little better. 
LIAM: This is so cool. 
TALIESIN: I wonder what they're doing right now. 
MARISHA: Probably scouting. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Coasting above the mists and below the cloud line, you begin to cruise to the right hand side of the mountain, as it begins to shift and turn. Indeed, you can see, while the jungle floors tend to be rising up to meet the mountain, between these mountains, the landscape continues to descend. As you begin to push past, to look into the center area where the three mountains act as a trio, it is just darkness. A crevasse, a chasm of that-- 
LIAM: The mountains coming out of darkness? 
MATT: The mountains are the perimeter to-- 
LAURA: This giant-- 
MATT: -- a massive sinkhole. 
LIAM: Sinkhole. So not any kind of volcano. There's gaps between the mountains. 
MATT: There's gaps between the mountains. But the jungle just vanishes and there's just darkness with a mist resting. 
LIAM: So I can't make anything out. 
LAURA: It might be inside that hole. 
LIAM: Well, and they said that-- 
ASHLEY: Inside the mountain. 
LIAM: It exists between worlds. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: All right, so here. I guess we try here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Or we could just fuck off to another island. You want to go? 
LAURA: Oh, eh. 
LIAM: Let's find the others. 
LAURA: Let's go. 
MATT: (whooshes) You return to the rest of the troop. 
LAURA: (fast whooshes) 
LIAM: Ah, sail! 
LAURA: (fast whooshes) 
TRAVIS: (cheeks flapping) 
MATT: (laughs) Just (cheeks flapping). Yep. 
LIAM: Kind of like Koneko. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) You'll catch me, right? 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Landing exert. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA, LAURA, and SAM: (grunt) 
TRAVIS: (heavy grunt) 
LAURA: (grunts) 
TRAVIS: Medium size? 
TALIESIN: (grunts) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. Too real. (grunts) 
LIAM: (grunts) 
LAURA: Sorry I let you down a little hard there. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Blew out a kneecap with that one. 
LIAM: Third meniscus. 
LAURA: (grunts) 
TALIESIN: (grunts) 
LIAM: Dang it. 
LAURA: There's a big hole. 
SAM: Let's go to it. 
TALIESIN: What? Okay. 
MATT: All right. Fearne, are you leading this final trek? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Ready? 
MATT: One more survival check. 
TRAVIS: So ready. 
SAM: Is it a hot hole? 
ASHLEY: It better be. 
LAURA: I don't know, kind of looked like a cold hole. 
LIAM: Like a dark hole. 
LAURA: A misty, moist hole. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: I hate all of this. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: The whole thing? 
MATT: Everything about it. I quit. 
LIAM: You have to go through a gap. 
MARISHA: Oh, it was almost something great. 
ASHLEY: I know, it was. Okay. 
SAM: You got this. 
LAURA: Did you do it with advantage? Because Chet's helping you. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, okay. It's a dirty 20, but. Oh, that's way better. 
SAM: 28. 
ASHLEY: 28, thank you. 
TRAVIS: Oh wow! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: 28. 
MATT: All right. It takes you a few more hours. As the air gets colder, the sky grows darker, your knees grow painfuller. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I hurt that. It's really bad. 
MATT: You are racing the sunset and the knowledge of what lurks into darkness. But with that roll, you manage to find a pretty clear path around the base of the central mountain that you've been racing towards, and begin to follow where the landscape continues to descend. You can see other rivers that have now gathered and begin to pour in this direction. As you walk alongside them, eventually, you can see where the forest grows thinner and where the graphite-like rock begins to take over, and then vanishes. It is a black expanse that is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of feet across. What little bit of light comes through, you can see from the mists that rest and fall into it. It looks like this-- 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
MATT: -- throat in Exandria-- 
SAM: Cute! 
MATT: -- that just vanishes into shadow. You can just faintly see, you can hear the waterfalls cascading off the edges and can see a little bit at certain bases of where the jungle comes to an end, and some points grows over before no portion of earth or soil exists to take root for the forest. Threads of thin waterfalls all cascading down into nothing. You can see there are some cliffside paths that do punch out in various areas, broken rock bridges that reach out into space and then end prematurely in a similar pattern to some of how the island's formation has that frenetic leap of stone pillars. But nowhere near long enough to go the more than a hundred or so feet from the edge in certain places. Even those start a ways down before the lack of light takes over. Like dozens of petrified arms that are reaching out from the edges of this pit. If you want to roll a perception check. 
LIAM: Sure do, always do. 
LAURA: How long does Feather Fall last now? 
MARISHA: I was just thinking the exact same thing. Let's find out. 
LIAM: 27. 
MARISHA: I think it's 'til you land. 
TALIESIN: 10 minutes? 
MATT: You can't see too far down into it as the light doesn't quite reach, but you do notice the pattern of this pit does seem to gradually fill past a certain point. Meaning the sinkhole isn't an endless straight drop. It looks like it does slightly begin to pinch inward the further down it goes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: So we could climb down, find a bottom, go across that way, or we could just fly back and forth. 
LAURA: Or we could just run and jump. 
SAM: A hundred feet? 
MARISHA: We would float. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Feather Fall. 
SAM: It works that way, too? 
TALIESIN: Going down. 
LAURA: You want to go across it? We're going in. 
SAM: Wait, you want to go down? 
LAURA: That's where I think Evontra'vir is. 
LIAM: We think that the tree is not in this realm. 
SAM: Down there? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: But it's scary and spooky down there. 
LAURA: I know, there's probably really big spiders. 
TRAVIS: FCG, you're not worried about scary and spooky. You've got the Changebringer. 
SAM: That's true, you're right. 
MARISHA: Can send some lights down there. 
TALIESIN: I'll also say, I don't know if anyone else has been thinking about this, but the island moves, and that's a very deep hole. So does the hole move with the island, or I guess it maybe it goes somewhere else. I don't know, I'm not really qualified to say. 
MARISHA: Does the hole move with the island? 
SAM: You're uniquely qualified. You're made of rock. This is a big rock thing. 
LAURA: That's true. Don't you open portals with your brain? 
TALIESIN: Not on purpose. 
MARISHA: Is this a portal? (gasps) What if it goes to, like, the Shadow Realm? 
LIAM: That's the implication. 
SAM: Is that a real thing? 
MARISHA: The Shadow Realm is a real thing. It's layered on top of our realm, but it's like this. 
LAURA: Like-a this. We can see how far down? 
SAM: Under our plate? 
LIAM: Like a flat disc on top of-- 
LAURA: How far down can we see? 
LIAM: -- another flat disc. 
LAURA: Like 100 feet? 
MATT: Like 200 feet. You can see some of those pillars that are reaching out, and then come to premature ends, and below that, nothing. 
LAURA: I'm going to send my dancing orbs, my light orbs down. As they get to 120 feet, I'm going to double the distance, and send them further down and see if we can see a bottom. 
MATT: For a total of how far? 
LAURA: That would take it 240 feet. 
MATT: 240 feet. The lights reach the end of it, and the darkness continues. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: I'll take out a trusty ball bearing, toss it in, and just listen. 
TRAVIS: Cast Light on it first, though. 
MARISHA: Oh, can we do that? 
SAM: Here, I'll cast Light on it. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: Okay, yeah, that's way better. 
LIAM: Pinprick of light. 
MARISHA: Remember when we dropped your coin into a hole? 
LIAM: When Orym dropped, yeah. 
SAM: Oh, but then I got a different kind of coin. 
MARISHA: You did. 
LAURA: Oh wow. 
LIAM: You're welcome. 
MARISHA: It's nice. 
LAURA: How did we never think of that? 
SAM: I don't know. We need some sort of-- 
LAURA: The Changebringer was with you this whole time and you didn't even know. 
SAM: The Changebringer was the friends we made along the way? 
MARISHA: That was so long ago. Maybe one day we'll go back to Jrusar. 
LAURA: Oh, we should be watching that bearing. 
MARISHA: All right, here it goes. Whoosh! There you go. I haven't tossed. Now it goes. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Orym jumps in without Feather Fall. 
MARISHA: And then counting. 
MATT: Make a strength check for me. 
MARISHA: Make a what? 
MATT and SAM: Strength check. 
TRAVIS: You want to make sure it doesn't go up. 
SAM: Throw it down. (laughter) 
MARISHA: What do you mean? 
LIAM: Ah! My eye. 
MARISHA: Just a straight check? 
MATT: Just a straight strength check. 
TRAVIS: You roll a one, and you hit yourself in the head with the ball bearing. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh, like straight into your eye. 
MARISHA: As I pull it back. This is not going to be good. (gasps) Natural 20. 
SAM: Hey! (laughter) 
SAM: Throws it through the boundary. 
TALIESIN: Ball bearing throwers. 
MARISHA: For a 17. 
TRAVIS: Hadron Collider. 
MATT: On a natural one it was one where it was like, throw it and like, whoa, whoa! 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: (whooshes) No. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Not again. 
MATT: The cold air that grows colder as you approach the edge of this, you can sense an odd connection to the energy of this space. There is a strong flow of you can only consider negative energy that emanates from within. There's an odd surge of strength and determination that comes within you as you pull back this ball bearing and throw it. It coasts out and you watch it goes and the winds catch it, and it shifts and moves as it falls and falls and falls. 300, 400 feet, and then it just is gone. 
LAURA: (gasps) It is a portal. 
SAM: Oh my god. What do we do? 
ASHLEY: Let's just jump. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: ♪ Might as well jump ♪ 
LAURA: But here's the thing, how long would it take to fall 400 feet? 
MARISHA: It seems like it's more than that. I mean, here's the thing. Feather Fall lasts for 60 seconds. 
LAURA: You could cast it again as we get to the-- 
MARISHA: I could theoretically cast it again or we could just jump, and we let the lights be ahead of us and cast it. 
TRAVIS: You're also presupposing that there is a bottom, which we are not sure that there is. 
SAM: We do have one. We have a couple people who could fly. 
LIAM: Do you want to send Pâté down first? 
MARISHA: I don't think Pâté will be able to see past what we already know. He can go far, but not as far as that. 
LIAM: Could we put a little lit up ball bearing, like a bell on Pâté's neck and fly? 
TALIESIN: We do have a little ribbon. 
LAURA: Let's do ourselves. 
TRAVIS: From side to side. 
LAURA: We got to take a risk. We can't keep sending Pâté ahead. 
TRAVIS: Diameter is 100 feet, more? 
LAURA: I do feel really bad that I strangled him. 
MARISHA: We're pretty mean to him. 
SAM: He's-- 
LAURA: I know. Can you bring Pâté out? 
MATT: From side to side? 
MARISHA: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Or like half a mile. 
MATT: Oh, it's probably closer to half a mile. 
TRAVIS: Wow. Big caldera, just (whoosh). 
MATT: Two miles across. Yeah, a massive sinkhole where the ground is gone, and then it slowly comes in with little bits poking out, like hairs on the inside of a throat. It's like this odd stone chasm with nothing. It just disappears into shadow. 
TRAVIS: Just because we had necrotic stuff before and it's a dark hole and it's cold, can I get a good whiff and feel if there's anything funky coming from down below? 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Had one ready to go. 
SAM: Seeing if there's a funky smell coming from down below? 
TRAVIS: Natural one. Real funky. 
MATT: Natural one. Like a-- 
LIAM: Don't be afraid of the hole. 
MATT: You get lost in the memory of a fine summer morning on the beaches at the Menagerie Coast. You have a scent recollection of piña colada type drink that was delicious on your tongue. You have no idea where that came from, and it's distracted you from the moment, but it was a nice memory. 
TRAVIS: We used the rest of that pineapple for creative reasons. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Laudna pulled out-- 
TALIESIN: Don't bring that up. 
SAM: Laudna pulled out Pâté. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, Pâté's out, and I'm snuggling him because I felt bad for shaking him the other day. 
MATT: "Okay, I don't mind. Snuggle me all you want." 
LAURA: Oh, do you mind if I shake you? 
MATT: "Well, I mean, let's find out." 
LAURA: No, I don't want to. I just didn't know if I hurt you. 
MATT: "I don't really hurt." 
LAURA: Well, all right. 
MATT: "Not really alive." 
LAURA: Well! It is very weird, Laudna. 
MARISHA: It is. Actually, Pâté, do Pâté and I get any weird sense of this having a connection to undeath in other realms? Yeah. (laughs) What do you think, Pâté? What do you think? 
TRAVIS: Starts screaming. 
LAURA: (screams) 
MATT: "It's very dark. Uh." 
MARISHA: Do you feel anything otherworldly? 
MATT: "I mean, maybe?" 
MARISHA: Maybe? 
TRAVIS: Getting deep with Pâté. 
MARISHA: Me too. 
TRAVIS: Reach inside yourself. 
MARISHA: Do I sense anything? 
MATT: I mean, you sense what you sense when you stepped to the edge, and there's definitely a-- 
MARISHA: Is it like intrusive thoughts like when you're at the top of a skyscraper, and you're like, "What if I just jump?" 
TRAVIS: It me. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: For you? Maybe. 
MARISHA: For me. Okay. 
LAURA: Hmm. 
MATT: I just mean in the sense that you're the one that's concentrating on it, but there's something, there's something familiar. At the same time, there's something alien about this. You're standing in a cliff of a massive hole in the ground. I don't know what else to tell you at this distance. 
MARISHA: I say we jump. 
LAURA: I say we jump. 
MARISHA: Let's jump. 
ASHLEY: Feel like there's something about just trusting. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Could you cast Locate Object on Evontra'vir right now? 
SAM: Maybe. 
LAURA: Does it have to be within how close? 
MARISHA: Maybe your spell dissipated because he's not on this realm. 
TALIESIN: Do we have a dumb plan? 
LAURA: That's right! 
TALIESIN: Or do I have a dumb plan? 
LIAM: Well, I don't know about the physics on that. You want to float it? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. So how many people can you make light, light? All of us at the same time? 
MARISHA: No. Up to five. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: So, and you can both do that, right? 
LAURA: No. I can fly. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you can fly, so you're fine. 
LAURA: So I could potentially carry someone. Fearne can transform. 
ASHLEY: I could transform. I could carry someone as well. 
TALIESIN: So that's five people that we're all covered there. 
LAURA: Yeah. Then we also have two things, two immovable objects. So god forbid if things go south, as long as we have a rope. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
LIAM: Not if we were hurtling down, that'd be bad. 
TALIESIN: But if-- 
LIAM: If we were floating down. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, floating down, there's an emergency stop that we have available. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Let's jump. 
SAM: Well, are we going to tether ourselves together with a rope first? 
TRAVIS: Just to float it. Just to float it, is there any reason why we think this tree is at the bottom of this endless chasm that reeks of death? 
LAURA: Yeah, because they said Evontra'vir was between-- 
MARISHA: Mountains? 
LAURA: They said it was between the mountains, but they also said it was between worlds. 
SAM: Worlds. 
TRAVIS: A window between. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: This seems like it's going to plop us out into another dimension. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I say this with supreme confidence. 
TRAVIS: We'll be ready just in case we get down near the bottom and it starts pulling at us also. 
ASHLEY: Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but you know how, I think they said he was like a vessel of the sorrows of others. So maybe this is like a big old fat vessel, and that's why it's so dark because it's just a bunch of sadness in a hole. 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, Fearne, that was fucking deep. 
LAURA: I mean, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Just a big old vessel. 
LIAM: We have no guarantees, but this is the closest thing to a-- 
LAURA: Do you guys see any trees anywhere? 
TRAVIS: Is that the convictions part? Like remembering the things you're doing it for, the positive things? Because if you get down there, then you feel the sadness and you get lost. 
SAM: Maybe it's like that part of "Last Crusade" where you just have to take a step of faith. 
ASHLEY: That's what I was thinking, too. 
TRAVIS: Should we make our own reminders? 
LAURA: We probably should in case we lose ourselves. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. Everybody write down their shit. 
SAM: I don't need to write down. 
TRAVIS: I take out a bunch of little miniature Chetneys that I've carved that are about the size of a quarter. Here, remember your love for me. 
LAURA: They're just a little bunch of little wolves, or a bunch of little yous? 
TRAVIS: They're little fucking Chetneys, okay? (laughter) 
SAM: Do you guys-- If you guys are scared to do this leap, I can ask the Changebringer if it's okay. 
LAURA: I'm not scared. 
MARISHA: No, let's go. 
TALIESIN: I won't-- I'm going to do it regardless of what the Changebringer says. 
SAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: I would actually like it. 
TALIESIN: But you're welcome to ask. 
TRAVIS: I would like you to ask. I would be interested in what she would say. 
SAM: Okay, I will ask her a yes-or-no question. If we jump, are we going to die? (laughter) 
SAM: Heads for yes. 
LIAM: Not, "Is the tree through this hole?" 
SAM: Uh-uh. 
LIAM: Okay. (laughs) 
MATT: So you're using the actual question? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: It comes up tails as a no. 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh. 
SAM: (gasps) We're good. 
LAURA: Yeah, all right, great. 
LIAM: Coin toss, though. 
TRAVIS: She's betrayed you. 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: We're not going to die. 
TRAVIS: Let's do it. 
LAURA: Great. 
MARISHA: Changebringer's like, "Let's see what happens." 
ASHLEY: We jumping? 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: We jumping. 
MARISHA: We jumping. 
TRAVIS: Well, no, wait, there's a couple things that happen first, right? Change, Fly, then we jump, right? 
SAM: Tie a rope around the five of us. 
TALIESIN: We don't even need to necessarily tie the rope, I was just saying have it available. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Because we'll know when we're getting to the end of that. 
LAURA: I'll wait 'til you cast Feather Fall to cast Fly. 
MARISHA: That makes sense. I'm not going to cast Feather Fall right away, until we feel like we need it. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: See, this is the shit that goes sideways. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) Isn't it possible to fail on a spell cast if you're falling? 
TRAVIS: What? 
MARISHA: This one just happens. 
LAURA: Mm, mm. 
TALIESIN: It's Feather Fall, it's literally designed to be cast while you're falling. 
LIAM: Falling, yeah. 
LAURA: That's true. 
LIAM: It's a reaction. 
MATT: Yep. Concentration spells in extremely dire circumstances, like being buffeted by heavy winds from a fall might require concentration checks. I don't believe Feather Fall's a concentration spell. 
MARISHA: No, it's a reaction. 
LIAM: Unless I punch you in the head repeatedly as we fall. 
ASHLEY: Mine is, but if-- If worst comes to worst. 
LAURA: Then you can transform and save me, okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, awesome. 
MARISHA: Can we have some lights to go with us? 
LAURA: Yeah, of course. That's a concentration, they'll go away as soon as I start flying. 
SAM: I can cast Light. 
LAURA: All right, great. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's go. 
SAM: All right. 
MARISHA: Three, two. 
TRAVIS: Two. 
LAURA: Get a running start, you don't want to run into the sides as they get narrow. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's true. 
TRAVIS and SAM: One. 
MARISHA: (grunts) 
MATT: (footsteps) 
ALL: Ah. 
MATT: (whooshes) 
SAM: Freeze frame, end of episode. 
LIAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: Dart as far as you can with the strength of your legs and convictions you hold to yourselves, you, as a group, leap into the abyss beneath you. 
SAM: The abyss, we're in the abyss now? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: I slipped and I'm already starting to rotate in a fucked up way. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: He was on the way out anyway. 
MATT: The wind, (blows) rushes past you, as you fall further and further in, you can glance up and see above you the circle of foggy daylight diminish and diminish. As you glance down at the lights below, picking up speed, (blows) the wind rushing past, you also watch the walls begin to get closer in from the sides. The lights that you keep out there at a fair distance-- 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: -- begin to light up a sudden glance of texture. There is a multitude of texture beneath you that is rapidly approaching. 
LAURA: Fly. 
MARISHA: Like the floor? 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Feather Fall. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. (buzzing poofs) Feather Fall on who? 
SAM: What about you? 
LIAM: Splat. 
ASHLEY: Oh, wait. 
MARISHA: Ashton, Orym, FCG, Laudna, and Chet. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, that's right. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Shoebill. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. Shoebills are flight birds, right? 
ASHLEY: Yep. 
MATT: Good. (laughter) 
MARISHA: (claps) 
LIAM: Penguin. (laughter) 
MATT: Look. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Wait, I've used the shoebill before. 
TRAVIS: Ostrich. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Wait, shit. 
SAM: Should fly? 
LAURA and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: "Can shoebills fly?" 
TRAVIS: This is goldfish all the way. 
TALIESIN: Ostrich would be great, because it'd be sad-- 
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, I'm doing giant eagle-- 
TALIESIN: -- but also fucking awesome. 
MATT: No-- 
ASHLEY: -- but I want it to look like a shoebill. 
MATT: -- they are not flightless, they have an eight-foot wingspan. 
LAURA: Oh, phew. 
MARISHA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: I just wanted to double-check. 
TALIESIN: That would've been amazing. 
MATT: Proportionately, they're odd birds, and I just wanted sure. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Man. 
MATT: That would've been amazing; we would've had a second goldfish. 
SAM: Thanksgiving turkey. 
TRAVIS: Chicken. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I just love the cadence of, "Fly," "Feather Fall," "Shoebill." (laughter) 
LIAM: Lipschitz. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Lipschitz. 
MATT: Heart. (laughs) 
MATT: The five of you begin to drift down, still at a quickened pace, but not in one that makes you anywhere near as nervous as you were but a moment ago. While you transform into your massive, odd-looking (laughs) shoebill bird. 
LAURA: Jingle, jingle, jingle. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: Imogen, you catch yourself in a flight scenario. The lit orbs-- 
LAURA: Disappeared. 
MATT: They disappear. 
SAM: Concentration spell. 
LAURA: Yep. 
MATT: Indeed. So there is no light. 
SAM: I still got light going. 
MATT: From your eyes, you have light going there. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Cool. 
MATT: So you have this headlights that are trying to show beneath you what you're approaching. As the texture, not rushing to you at the exact speed, but still coming at you quickly, they look like leaves, endless jet-black leaves. 
TRAVIS: Scales. 
LAURA: Oh, it's creepy, because it's just (whooshes) of light. 
MATT: You're just seeing (whooshes) in darkness. 
SAM: Are we going through these leaves? 
MARISHA: Full horror game shit. 
SAM: Or it's just approaching? 
MATT: They're approaching from beneath. 
SAM: Okay, well, yeah, nothing we can do. 
LIAM: Well, we can land or go through. 
MATT: (bangs) You start impacting with what is the top of a tree. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: (gasps) A tree. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: As you hit into it, you start hitting branches. (bangs) Not enough to take heavy damage necessarily, but definitely bruised up a bit, as you're now (bangs) and catching yourself onto branches, for those of you that are just Feather Falling. The two of you can maintain flight above if you'd like, but the rest of you eventually catch yourself up in the boughs of this. As you stop, and you are (laughs) currently the only one that is producing light, but as you glance around, you can see the branches of this tree have an oddly textured, almost striated bark-- 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: -- that twists in ways and has a deep maroon, red coloration to it. Where the branches extend, black leaves sprout out, these slick, long leaves that fold and overlap each other in places, then they create these clusters, and it is everywhere. 
SAM: If we look down, do we get a sense that these branches are coalescing on a stalk? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LIAM: Is it navigatable? 
TRAVIS: I'll help you with 60 feet of darkvision. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: It might be. Yeah, I mean, there's plenty of branches everywhere. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Perception you said? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: 20. 
MATT: 20. 
SAM: Natural 20. 
MATT: Natural 20? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, for a total of? 
SAM: 27. 
MATT: 27. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
LAURA: Sheesh. 
MATT: Glancing down, indeed, you can see, these are the thinnest edges of branches. Looking down, you can see them converging and other parts converging into thicker limbs. Indeed, this is just the top of a tree. The further down you go, you get the sense you'll eventually find the base. 
LAURA: I'm going to float down next to Laudna. Do you want to hold onto me and go down? 
MARISHA: Sure. 
SAM: We all can go down, right? Are we still Feather Falling or is it over? 
LIAM: As soon as you touch down, doesn't it? 
LAURA: Yeah, as soon as you touch down, it ends. 
SAM: Oh, it ends, you're right. Okay. 
LAURA: I can come up and get everyone, just give me a second. 
SAM: Sure. 
TRAVIS: I've been in trees before, I'm fine. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's a massive tree, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Not a problem. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: I pull out dual chisels, including my mini. 
TALIESIN: Aw, you're going to chisel the tree? 
LAURA: Don't chisel the tree. 
TALIESIN: Don't chisel the tree. 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Don't chisel the tree. 
TRAVIS: I wasn't going to chisel the tree, just in case I slip. 
SAM: Go fly down there. 
TRAVIS: Just hand holds. 
SAM: See what you see. 
LAURA: Keyleth talked about this tree, I pictured something green and large and natural. 
MARISHA: Same. 
TALIESIN: Atrophy. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Cute. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: There's so many things you can make. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's fun, all right. 
TALIESIN: This is atrophy. Oh fuck. 
MATT: So. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, and touching the branches, it's all dry though, there's nothing viscous, or wet, or? 
MATT: Correct, it's dry. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: The branches appear flimsy. You're catching yourself, but you're holding on to multiple branches to hold yourself where you are, and they're bending with your weight. Even as they converge, they're thin branches, so you don't feel like you have a strong hold. So climbing down will be a little precarious, but it's definitely doable. 
ASHLEY: I can help carry some down, too. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. I'll fly Laudna down. 
MATT: Okay, so the two of you are flying through the canopy? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to fly Laudna down, too, and then-- 
MATT: It is dense to fly through, and to carry another person through this thick branches, it's still pushing through a very dense tree canopy. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: So it'll take you a bit, but you can probably do it. I'd say, for the sake of that, make an acrobatics check for me. 
LAURA: 10. 
MATT: 10, okay. Darting through and helping Laudna weave through the entirety of this ever-thickening collection of trees. It's not like a standard expanding tree, this has a red coral-like expansion. It's going out in all directions and dividing and dividing and dividing into thinner and thinner branches, like a capillary system. It is just expanding and consuming all the floor area of this cavern that you can even possibly see with what little light is there. And to that point-- 
LAURA: Oh, right. 
MATT: -- you have no light 
LAURA: You have darkvision. 
MARISHA: I do. 
MATT: You do. 
MARISHA: Kind of help guide her as we go. 
MATT: Which with the 10 acrobatics you get partway down before one branch you push past that (thwap)-- 
MARISHA: D'ah! 
MATT: -- swats you both extremely hard in the face. 
LAURA: (laughs) Ow! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You both take three points. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Help. 
MATT: I'll consider this slashing damage. 
MARISHA: Slashing damage. 
MATT: As the branches catch your cheeks, and, "Ah." All right, make a concentration check for me. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh, for three points? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: I have to roll a one in order to-- 
MATT: It's still damage. Just have to get over than a 10. 
LAURA: Do I add anything to it? I do, I add-- 
MATT: It's your constitution saving throw. 
LAURA: Okay, great. I got over a 10. 
MATT: Okay, good. (laughs) 
LAURA: I got 16. 
MATT: 16. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Slowly, you push through branches, until they get easier to get through. You get to the thicker portions of where the tree branch bases are set. The two of you are the first to eventually break free of the boughs. The boughs, they end five feet off the ground. And "ground" is an interesting description. You touch down on a blanket of seemingly endless roots that spiral out from the tree and entwine and knot and continue to stretch. The roots themselves, with what light that you have visible, there's wet vegetation and moss, dark moss that grows through the roots, as well as thousands and thousands of small objects embedded in between and on parts of the roots. You see gemstones, you see little carvings, little sculptures, pieces of ceremonial attire, musical instruments, and many, many skulls. 
MARISHA: Offerings. 
LAURA: Maybe, maybe it's what's been left behind by people that perished here. 
MARISHA: Are you all right? 
LAURA: You? 
MARISHA: I'm good. 
LAURA: Ah. 
MARISHA: As long as I keep you in the forefront of my brain, I think we'll be all right. 
LAURA: Promise? 
MARISHA: Promise. 
MATT: It is extremely cold here, and you can feel yourself involuntarily starting to shake and shiver. You at least. You're a little more keen on that temperature than she is. 
MARISHA: I'll wait here. 
LAURA: I feel weird leaving you down here. 
MARISHA: I'll be all right. Go past the thing, you won't be long. 
LAURA: I look up. I can't see shit. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Mm, mm, right, right. 
LAURA: What if I just stay down here and I send some lights up to them (laughs) so they can get down better? That might help. 
MARISHA: I mean, Orym, super dextrous. Fearne, fine. 
LAURA: Flying. Chet, fine. 
MARISHA: FCG, questionable. 
LAURA: FCG's going to have some issues. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ashton-- 
LAURA: But maybe Fearne can pick FCG up. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: All right. On the-- 
LIAM: We're waiting here, right? 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: Now, as a note, to those you who are still in the upper parts-- 
TRAVIS: Like "Crouching Tiger" on-- 
MATT: -- you can look up and can see the sky above stuff still. 
TRAVIS: -- the bamboo. 
LIAM: Say that again. 
MATT: You can look up-- 
SAM: Sky? 
MATT: -- and still see the circle of lit sky above. 
LIAM: Oh, like a little circle way high above? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: I was going to start making my way down while we're (INAUDIBLE). 
LAURA: Send some dancing orbs up from the ground and send it up through the tree branches so that they can see where they're going. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's very helpful, thank you. 
MATT: You see a handful of globules that are mostly obscured by the cluster of overlapping tree branches. 
LAURA: I move them around and move them up. 
LIAM: Do they come up through the tangle or are we just seeing little flickers? 
MATT: They come up through the tangle to a certain point, but even at... what's the max distance on your? 
LAURA: 120 feet. 
MATT: 120 feet, they don't quite reach to where you are, they're still somewhere in the tree below. This tree probably at full height is, based on your flight down there, is close to 200 feet tall. 
LIAM: You're still visioning? 
SAM: Yeah, I've still got my light up. 
LIAM: Still light? Okay. 
LAURA: I could double the distance again and send them up further. 
MATT: If you want. 
LAURA: I'll do that, I'll do that for... 
MATT: Okay. So the orbs scatter throughout the canopy. Those of you that are still up there, how are you getting down? 
SAM: Are we going? 
TALIESIN: I'm climbing. 
LIAM: Nah, I think they're going to come back. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Um. (sighs) 
LIAM: Imogen said she was going to ferry us up and down. 
SAM: She definitely did-- 
LIAM: Yep. 
SAM: -- so we'll wait right here until we are told otherwise. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Are you guys still up there? (ninja jumps) 
SAM: Oh no! He's going down. 
MATT: (laughs) Athletics or acrobatics check? 
TRAVIS: Athletics. 26. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
MATT: 26. Deftly, you begin to pick up on the pattern of how the branches split and expand and split and expand, and so you can ascertain where the next stronger step will be. The slightly bendy and untrustworthy branches become a little more sturdy. Though still thin and stretched in places, they're stronger. Within a few moments, you eventually climb down to the point where the leaves seem to stop growing from the branches, and instead, it's a long, twisting striated trunk, or a central branch that eventually merges with others. There isn't a solid singular trunk, it's like all the branches eventually converge into a very short, stocky trunk that's only a few feet off the ground, and then the roots spread out in all directions. As you step down, you are greeted by both Laudna and Imogen and the odd reaching expanse of what this cavern's floor is. 
TRAVIS: Just getting down there. What's up? (sniffs) 
TALIESIN: I'm also going to head down. 
LAURA: Is Fearne-- 
MATT: Athletics or acrobatics. 
TALIESIN: Athletics. 
TRAVIS: Smell also, please. 
LAURA: Where are you? (laughs) 
SAM: Fearne, can you give me a lift down? 
ASHLEY: Just up at the top. 
SAM: Okay, I'm going to go down on Fearne. 
TALIESIN: 25. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, you follow suit as well, following in Chetney's footsteps and looking at the best paths, you eventually find your way to the bottom as well. 
SAM: Bye, Orym, I'm going to go on Fearne. 
LIAM: I instantly can't see and I'm all alone. 
LAURA: No, I have globules; I sent them up to you. 
LIAM: Oh, are they? (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah, there's little-- 
LIAM: Okay, cool. (laughs) 
MATT: -- light globules that can help. It's still at a higher DC. 
TRAVIS: Orym starts singing to himself. 
LIAM: ♪ Somewhere out there ♪ (laughter) 
LAURA: As he sways on the branch. 
ASHLEY: Aw. 
TRAVIS: Looking up at the sky, in a circle. 
TALIESIN: ♪ Our love can see us through ♪ 
ASHLEY: ♪ Someone's saying a prayer ♪ 
MATT: All right, so you fly. You're a large creature with a large wingspan. 
ASHLEY: (awkward thuds) 
SAM: Ah! 
MATT: You're just going through the tree? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check with disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (clatters) 
MATT: Using the bird's dexterity. 
ASHLEY: It's cocked. Oh, okay, well, okay. Bird's dexterity, dirty 20. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Dirty 20, okay. In spite of how thick it is, and how ungraceful your descent may be, you do tumble. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: But you manage to hit every major cluster of black leaves over a hard branch and don't sustain enough of an impact to do actual damage to your form other than the fact that you lose a number of feathers in the descent. As you eventually slam onto the ground, you watch this rain of gentle feathers eventually come to rest around you. 
SAM: Wow. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to change back. 
SAM: Oh, thanks for the lift. Orym, you coming down? 
ASHLEY: Sorry it was a little messy. 
LIAM: Yeah, I start hopping my way down. 
MATT: Acrobatics or athletics check. 
LIAM: Always acrobatics. That is a 23. 
TALIESIN: That landed with a thump, man. 
MATT: So with just the lights at your disposal and no other aid, 20 was the DC. So it takes you a little bit, but you do manage to trapeze leap from branch to branch, quickly darting between them and find the rest of your troop here awaiting at the base of the tree. 
TALIESIN: Holy shit. 
LAURA: Sorry I didn't come get you. 
LIAM: That's all right. 
LAURA: I couldn't see shit if I didn't have the lights. 
LIAM: Right. 
LAURA: I couldn't have the lights if I was flying. 
LIAM: We're at the bottom of a giant hole, it's okay. 
TALIESIN: There's a lot of skulls. 
MARISHA: There's a lot of trinkets. 
LIAM: Whoa, look at all those skulls. 
LAURA: There's a lot of-- Yeah. 
ASHLEY: There's a lot of trinkets. 
MATT: You can see they're tied up-- 
SAM: Trinkets? Oh. 
MATT: -- into the lower branches as well. 
LIAM: Tied up? 
ASHLEY: Respect. 
MATT: There are many vines that dangle and tether from the further up branches. You can see there are things tied and left dangling from the lower branches. 
LIAM: So presentationally left by-- 
MATT: In some way, yeah. 
LAURA: Left intentionally. 
LIAM: Not just piled up. 
LAURA: We should make an offering? Is that what I'm-- 
TALIESIN: I don't necessarily know if it's an offering. 
LIAM: Is everything that's here that we see, I know there are skulls, but you said there were trinkets and things. Do they all look like-- 
MATT: There are art pieces. 
LIAM: Art pieces. 
MATT: There are keepsakes, there are small statuettes, there are little porcelain knickknacks. There are wood carvings. 
MARISHA: Do they-- Do they look like they span many Exandrian cultures? 
LIAM: That was my question. Are we looking at Aishio culture down here or all kinds of stuff? 
MATT: You can make an investigation check. 
LIAM: I'm not that good at that, though, Matt. Could it be acrobatics? 19. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: 19. 
LAURA: Never mind, never mind. I'm good, I got it. 
TALIESIN: Cartwheeled right to the answer. 
MATT: There are a number of things based on the glimpses you've seen and what knowledge, you being the one who actually has some knowledge of the Aishio culture. There are a good number of these items and relics that are themselves Aishio and/or Aishio adjacent, even just Ossended Host culture related. But there are a number that are beyond that. There are remnants of attire and left ornamental weaponry and all manner of objects that span from many places in Exandria. You're unable to ascertain the age because nothing here has a dust coating. 
LIAM: If I spend-- 
TRAVIS: What? 
LIAM: -- three to five minutes scanning everywhere, do I see anything that looks like it might have been left by Keyleth of the Air Ashari? 
MATT: Glancing about you do not, but you also recall that she said she did not actually see the tree herself. 
LIAM: Oh okay. 
MATT: She had heard about it from Jirana-- 
LIAM: Got you, got you. 
LAURA: That's right. 
MATT: -- who she went to to work through her grief. 
LAURA: Right. 
LIAM: Ah, okay. 
TRAVIS: I can't help myself, but if I spot one of those little wooden sculptures, can I check it out? 
MATT: Yeah. You approach the nearest wooden sculpture and it looks like a small egg, but it has features on it like a bear, like a little gentle bear has been carved out of this chunk of polished wood. 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
MATT: It looks simple, but very well-crafted in its simplicity. Something either a child would cherish in their space or someone who was an enthusiast of nature's fuzzier creatures to just look at and enjoy.
TRAVIS: (unimpressed) That's cute. Is it attached to the tree as well? 
MATT: No, it's just resting between roots, it looks like. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Grim Psychometry as I touch the object. 
MATT: Make a history check. 
MARISHA: That is the coolest ability. 
LAURA: I know, right? 
TALIESIN: Fun, isn't it? 
ASHLEY: It's really cool. 
TRAVIS: 15. 
MATT: 15? You sense that this object once belonged to an old soldier who had accepted the demise of their innocence, and this was left as-- 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: -- their final sacrifice. That's all you can gather. Just kind of that feel. It's not detailed. 
TRAVIS: That's heavy. 
MATT: But there's heavy energy around this. That's as much as you can make out. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Okay. Why would that be here? 
MARISHA: Sorrow? 
TALIESIN: Maybe that's what it is. Maybe it is a sacrifice. 
MARISHA: Sorrow, atrophy. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly walk around, see if there's any point that seems, I don't know, if there's any point in the tree that seems like it is aware. I'm just looking to feel something. 
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check if you like. 
TALIESIN: Probably both suck so-- I'm bad at both. 11 perception? 
MATT: 11 perception. Looking around the tree, it just looks like a tree. The odd spread of the dozens and dozens of immediate thick branches that twist and rise up and then divide and divide to create this massive canopy that reach out at some points almost parallel to pierce what you imagine the walls would eventually be, if not end prematurely. You cannot see the walls of the cavern. You're just sitting in the space where what little light you've created for yourself reveals this tree and what feels like another expanse before you. 
SAM: Can I Detect Thoughts on the tree? 
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was going to say. Open Mind on it. 
MATT: As you both focus in on this tree, you sense consciousness, but it is immense and ancient as much as it resists your attempt to peer further. 
TALIESIN: Well, fortune favors the bold. 
SAM: Yeah, are you going to talk to this thing? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up and I'm going to touch. 
SAM: Before you go Ashton, let me give you a little boost, a little something. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
SAM: Just a little extra. You don't have to believe in the Changebringer, but she believes in you, and so I'll cast-- Boy, what would-- Enhance Ability, charisma? 
MARISHA: Charisma, probably. 
LAURA: Yes, jesus. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Take it. 
SAM: Charisma, Eagle's Splendor. 
LIAM: Little Guidance couldn't hurt. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
TALIESIN: Just to have it. Yeah, I'm going to walk up and touch the trunk of the tree. Are you there? This is Ashton, blood of titan. Do I need to show you? Pull out and using part of the glass, I give myself a cut and put it on the tree. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. As you rub your hand across the bark, leaving that bit of warmth that you spread across it, the rest of you, you especially, begin to hear it. The faintest rustling of millions of leaves at once, (soft rustling) creating this buzzing sensation. You begin to hear this loud creaking sound. (stiff creaking) As you watch branches begin to shift and bend. 
LAURA: Mage Armor. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: This still entity begins to all at once move and shift, like something rousing from a deep slumber. As it begins to move, the branches seem to bend and curl in odd places, and you begin to make out shapes of where these branches are where it's like elongated fingers that stretch for 20, 30 feet beginning to flex outward and pull back in. You notice where your hand is, one of the pieces of bark splits and a massive milky white eye looks back. 
TRAVIS: Oh crap. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: A little ways over on one of the thicker branches, a second eye also opens, both blinking. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (gasp) 
MATT: You see now a heavily-stretched face that is burned and carved into the bark of this tree. The nose itself, about three, four feet of it, pulled downward, and a frown that extends out about five or six feet stretched deeply, like someone had smeared someone's face across a pole as it was then bent and gnarled upward. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: You watch as some of the branches reach down, catch the ground to one side of your troop as another branch reaches to the other, flanking you to each side and preventing you from going any direction but back or being forced to address it where you stand. Some of the blackened leaves flitter down from the movement above, and you see the vines shaking and the sound of hundreds of small baubles and trinkets clinking into each other as the tree itself moves to life. (slow, ancient) "What is it you seek?" 
TALIESIN: I am the abandoned child of the Hishari. I'm the blood of titan. I seek what is owed to me. I seek my past. I seek power. I seek to know what I am. 
MATT: "(long sigh)" You hear the voice, all of you hear it, not in your mind, but vibrating through the air, like you're standing next to a war horn that has been blasting and you can feel the vibration sourcelessly. Its mouth, its stretched mouth hangs open, not forming the words, they're just present and around you. This almost nightmarish visage carries with it an intensity, a dark curiosity. The eyes, the milky eyes shift and focus onto Ashton. "Mm. As it was fated." 
SAM: What? 
MARISHA and LAURA: As it was fated. 
MATT: "You are the son of Efterin." 
SAM: Efterin? 
MATT: Those of you who were present for the journey in Issylra, you recall Efterin was the leader of the Hishari. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "A broken man of burning purpose, endured an odyssey to walk under my boughs and ask for the golden purpose that they felt they were owed by the world. He claimed visions throughout his life that promised greatness. A fated path that would leave his mark on history. He was not wrong. I let him gaze into his future and showed him the relic he was fated to own, that he would use to usher in a renewed ancient power. I showed him the way to the necropolis of Toramunda where this relic lay uncovered and waiting. His ambition met his destiny, and he recovered his artifact, this remaining shard of Ka'Mort, the Primordial Empress of Earth. A lingering remnant of her power. He thought his destiny was his to embrace. He was wrong." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: "I granted him this knowledge because he was meant to take it, meant to create and destroy the Hishari, meant to destroy himself, meant to create you. You were his destiny. But in his arrogance, he could not see beyond his own aspirations, as it was fated. And now you return, as I have foreseen, to find another piece of history's sorrow. The unity that twice brought judgment to Exandria's children." You hear the sound, this horrid sucking sound, as the tree itself seems to inhale air? Energy? Shadow? Who knows. But it's awakening still. There's an odd, can only describe as a vibrance or a subtle excitement coming to this ancient creature. Its eyes move from you and begin to take in the rest of you. You know who I am." 
SAM: Evontra'vir? 
LIAM: Evontra'vir. 
MATT: "Evontra'vir is the name I was given and the name that endures. I was of those who stewarded the protection of Toramunda, who helped mediate the division of Mount Ygora, who trusted empty promises and watched our legacy become ash." All the leaves fall free and tumble. You hear a shattering sound as one of the baubles falls free. (echoing shatter) "I saved the few that I could and still carry with me those I could not." It falls quiet. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Who were you before Evontra'vir? 
MATT: "'Tis hard to remember. I was a guardian." You recall hearing that this individual who became this tree was one of the surviving Gau Drashari-- 
LAURA: Right. 
MATT: -- of the cataclysm. 
TALIESIN: I have a very insane idea. Do you smoke? I pull out a pipe and I fill it with tobacco. This reveals the most heroic moment in your life. I haven't been stupid enough to smoke it myself yet. But do you want to see you at your best, just once? 
MARISHA: Oh, oh, oh. 
TALIESIN: It's something I can offer. 
MATT: You hear the squeaking sound of the eyes shifting behind the bark. 
MARISHA: He was from our shit. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: With the split. 
MATT: "I find myself curious." 
TALIESIN: I step closer. 
MARISHA: It's a magic pipe. 
TALIESIN: I don't believe in destiny. If it does exist, I don't know if I wouldn't crush it underneath my boot at every moment I found it. 
MATT: "It exists. I live through destiny. My roots reach into the skein of fate and the golden threads that guide us all." 
TALIESIN: Wow. I have a lot of very big people who keep talking about my fate and your fate. But I have a secret. I'm nobody. I've been nobody my whole life, and there is great power in that. Now, be a small man for a moment, you big fuck. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: He's a tree, I don't know what to tell you. 
TALIESIN: There is a mouth. 
MATT: There is a mouth, not much he can-- 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try, I'm going to attempt to fan it in and see if that happens. I'm actually going to attempt to-- 
MARISHA: Shotgun. 
TRAVIS: Shotgun the tree? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, try it. (laughter) 
MATT: You're going to-- (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Dave Matthews concert, you guys. 
TALIESIN: More or less. 
TRAVIS: Shotgun it. 
TALIESIN: Fucking going. 
MARISHA: Just a baby hit. 
LAURA: (trippy) Whoa! 
TRAVIS: ♪ Open up my head ♪ 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try it. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I subtly start using Gust behind Ashton to waft it toward the tree. 
TRAVIS: ♪ (Dave Matthews humming) ♪ 
MATT: As you blow the enchanted smoke into the somewhat agape, awful looking maw (laughs) of this tree, you hear this (hollow gusting) sound as the leaves begin to shake-- 
TRAVIS: Jeez. 
MATT: -- and you can feel the stagnant air around you is being pulled into the tree, like every leaf is breathing in at once. As it does, the smoke drifts into the opening. The mouth closes for a moment and the eyes pull shut and then the eyes open once more and you watch as smoke pours out of all of these tiny little holes across the base branches. (smoke disseminating) As it does, each little cloud of smoke is a person running and then caught. Running and caught, running and caught, until they're all brought to a tree and vanish through it. And more, and more. Hundreds, hundreds of people. The smoke drifts off. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: "(ancient sigh)" 
TALIESIN: I think I might wish to be great like that in my own way. 
MATT: "You must soon wrestle with the changes you cannot avoid. The threads show me. You have no choice but to be somebody soon." 
TALIESIN: We'll see. 
MATT: "There are no nobodies that come this far to see me." 
TALIESIN: Well then. Show me. 
MATT: "A spark of Rau'shan burns in the heart of the Chynes Maw, a volcanic mass on the island of Igthuldus within the side of Athos Peak." 
LAURA: So many locations. 
MATT: "It is my destiny to show you the way. But be warned, holding the strength of the two in one vessel might sunder it. You bear the dormant strength of the empress. Find and bestow the might of the emperor. You, I sense our time is short." 
SAM: With him specifically or all-- Oh. 
MATT: "Why have you come?" 
TRAVIS: I'm not scared. (scared noise) The red moon, Ruidus, Predathos, do you know anything of this? 
MATT: "I've seen it. The threads come together. The tangle that you have been racing towards your entire life. You are that tangle. He sought these answers, but you are all bound to this journey." 
TRAVIS: He? Ludinus? 
SAM: Him. Ashton. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: I thought Ludinus, too. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "I am the gate and the boundary. I am one of numerous passageways into the realms of death and renewal. My roots reach into the skein of destiny and I see what paths can be taken, some harder to deviate from than others. I am balance to the enemies of the natural cycle of life, and one of the many caretakers of the fate of Exandria itself. Some come to seek a meeting with ones they've lost. Some come to see their own death. Some come to seek direction, a glimpse at their fate, and hope for opportunity. Not all find what they want. Many find what they are meant to. What do you seek?" 
LAURA: How do we stop Predathos? How do we keep him from devouring everything? 
MATT: "Not all answers are clear, but you all walk a path together. Your tangle is the chaos that can undo that which has been carefully planned for so very long, should that be what you wish. Your journey puts you on a particular path to make the choice, to guide the future of the gods. What do you believe in? What is right for this world?" 
SAM: We want what's right for this world. It seems like we've been put on a path that will help us shape it. But as you said, the fate of the gods is also at stake. Can you see what might happen if this crisis is not averted, to the gods themselves?
MATT: The eyes close and you feel the wind pull in once more. (whooshing) The air goes cold. For a brief moment, you almost feel a shared vision. You see the thin line of the Bloody Bridge widen. You see the skies crack. You see beings of impossible fathomability, light and shadow alike, stepping from the heavens. You see a lattice of infinite gold apparate and shatter. You see the lights and shadows leave, chased by a glow of endless red. As those lights fade, left below, the blue waters and green of the world lay bare, and the vision pulls. 
MARISHA: What of the titans? We know they were here first and the gods have also done their, they've done quite some harm. Where is the balance? 
MATT: "I cannot say whether the gods are a blessing or bane upon the world. Some seek to harmonize with the ways of things, others wish to subjugate or destroy them. With each epoch, the pendulum swings. The titans are gone. All that remains is what was before and what was after. The divine are pilgrims made idols, refugees become conquerors. They are not makers, but crafters, shapers, and their devotees follow in their image. They take what is found and remake it into new. Sometimes beautiful, sometimes terrible. Is that their nature, or are they a reflection of us? 
LIAM: If history's told us anything, when these higher powers go to war against each other, against the titans, mortals are ground up like wheat. We can't let it happen again. How do we stop that from happening again? 
MATT: "I cannot tell you what is right. Your convictions guide your path. Your choices can change where the threads pull you. What I offer is the knowledge of what can end that path. But not all take to that knowledge well." 
MARISHA: How we die. 
SAM: Did you say: How do we die? 
MARISHA: Just how we die. 
SAM: Oh, okay. Well-- Oh, go on. 
LAURA: Ludinus. He's unnatural. He goes against the fabric of creation and destruction. What will it take to defeat him? 
MATT: "You already walk that path." Inhales once more, and as the tree does, you see blurry flashes of the earthen spark that beats in the chest of your compatriot. You see the flickering flame that is embedded within the roiling fires and molten earth of some distant cavern. You see an endless dusty expanse. You see cries of anguish. You see bloodshed and war. You see the Bloody Bridge. You see the moon. "This is the path you've chosen. Follow your convictions or change them. I cannot tell you what is right." 
SAM: If we continue down this path and intersect with the ones who would seek to destroy the world and the gods, can you tell us at least, not how to achieve our goals, but how we'll know when it's time? Will there be an ally, a weapon, something that will tell us that we're ready? 
MATT: "The spark of life, no matter where it's sourced, instinctually wishes to be free. Wherever the hand of tyranny resides, there are those that will rise up to tear down the cage, familiar or not." 
LAURA: Oh. (gasps) 
MATT: "To do what you need, look for conviction, look for strength. But above all else, look for trust, look for allies, and look to each other. Ludinus-- Ludinus should be stopped. Not all would disagree with his reasoning. It may very well be there are harder choices for you to make the further you draw close to your destiny." 
TRAVIS: This isle of Igthuldus, the Athos Peak, we only have a small piece of a map and the islands move. 
TALIESIN: You spoke that you might be a gateway, is that true? 
MATT: The eyes stop in place and both focus in your direction, but beyond you. "You are being watched." 
MARISHA: Right now? 
MATT: You follow its gaze and the boughs of the tree glow for a second, and you glance over, and in the empty space behind you, you watch this faint blue glowing orb, like an eye just appear before it shatters. 
MARISHA: Son of a bitch! 
MARISHA: Someone's fucking Scrying on us. 
LAURA: Son of a bitch. 
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. 
TRAVIS: For sure. 
MATT: "You must hurry." You watch as the tree twists and you hear the creaking heavily shifting. 
MARISHA: Wait, we're not done. 
MATT: The branches on one of the heavier bits of the trunk begin to split, and as it pulls open, it's almost like seeing bits of red flesh pulling apart until it shows an opening doorway. Beyond that, you see cold snow and wind blowing. 
LAURA: Uh! 
MARISHA: Oh, but it was so nice. 
LAURA: Go, go, go. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's go. 
TRAVIS: It's a gateway to die, friends. 
SAM: Do we have to leave a-- 
TALIESIN: We're going right now. 
SAM: Should we leave an offering or anything? An offering? 
TRAVIS: Are we going to die? 
TALIESIN: Go, go, go, go. 
MARISHA: I leave a Chetney statue. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's one of eight. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Got to collect them all. 
MATT: As you all quickly dart through out into this area, you immediately sense this brush of cold wind blowing. You feel the snow and bit of sleet slamming into the side of your face. You all stand now on the cusp of some sort of a mountain range. There is mist surrounding the base in the scenery beyond a certain distance to where you can't quite see where you are. You just know you're very high up. 
LAURA: Why did I choose a sheer dress, why, what? 
MARISHA: I mean, it looks fabulous. 
MATT: As the sound of the magical gateway closing behind you, you turn and see a secondary mountain or almost like a dual peak that splinters off taller and it looks to be an area where the ice and snow doesn't touch. 
LAURA: Oh, that's the flame that, that's the flame he was talking about. 
MARISHA: Can we see Ruidus? 
MATT: You just see mist surround you and you get the sense you're likely still somewhere in the Shattered Teeth. 
LAURA: He said there were flames within a cavern nearby. 
LIAM: Up a mountain. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Volcano? 
SAM: Or an eternal flame in a cave or something. 
MATT: (low droning) You hear a familiar, if louder rumbling sound.
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: As the guttural call-- 
LAURA: Sky whales. 
MATT: -- of one of the sky whale creatures seems to drift through the mists. You can just faintly make out the shadow of this massive beast just faintly crest past the mountaintop where you stand and vanish into the cloud and fog beyond. As you bundle yourselves up, staring at this one cavern entrance, and process what the hell you just saw and where you are and where you're going. And that's where we're going to finish tonight's episode. (groaning) 
TALIESIN: I love it here. 
TRAVIS: Who are you? 
LAURA: Yeah, what the hell? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
LIAM: Champion of the titans. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
LIAM: They want to put two big old hunks of titan in there. 
TALIESIN: I'm a fucking pebble. 
LAURA: Mommy and daddy. 
SAM: So yeah, you're the key master and there's a gatekeeper? 
LAURA: We got to find another person to put the emperor in or are you supposed to hold both? 
TRAVIS: We might get a replay of that. 
LIAM: We're putting both in, but it's risky. 
SAM: But he's both. He's the empress. 
LAURA: No, he said one might-- Both of them in one might sunder them. You're the empress and somebody else is supposed to be emperor? 
TRAVIS: The embodiment-- 
LAURA: The embodiment. 
SAM: You got to-- 
TALIESIN: I mean, to be fair, I am pre-sundered so we can see-- 
TRAVIS: Also, you brought Toramunda into this, motherfucker. 
MARISHA: Toramunda! 
MATT: Yeah! Shattered Teeth, man. 
TRAVIS: What was the relic, was the tree? 
LIAM: When the tree smoked up and so, what's that, your proudest moment? 
TALIESIN: No, your most heroic moment. 
LIAM: Heroic moment, so was this past being's-- 
LAURA: That was when you were saving everyone. 
LIAM: -- the being's past life saving hundreds or thousands of people? 
TRAVIS: Catching them. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Or at least helping them pass on? 
LAURA: Scooping them up? 
MARISHA: Helping them transition? 
LIAM: Is that their skulls? 
TALIESIN: That's for them to know and us-- 
LAURA: Yeah, I think that is. 
TALIESIN: -- to postulate, isn't it? 
LAURA: Yeah, he says he keeps them nearby. I think that's all their skulls that were embedded in the tree. 
SAM: Answer all the questions. 
MATT: Maybe in time. 
MARISHA: So wait, and it was also shard of Rau'shan in a volcano on Athos Peak? 
SAM: That's where we are. 
TRAVIS: Athos Peak. 
MARISHA: That's where we are. 
SAM: That's where we just landed. 
LIAM: Where's the best place to punch Ludinus? Is it his gooch? Say it's his gooch. 
LAURA: I know, I kept asking how do we defeat people? 
MATT: Take a pick. 
LAURA: Stupid question. 
MARISHA: So he was basically a Gau Drashari from pre-Calamity times that helped broker the deals between-- 
LAURA: Don't agree! 
LIAM: Upstairs and downstairs. 
MARISHA: -- upstairs and downstairs. 
TRAVIS: The broken trust between the flying cities. 
MARISHA: Between the flying cities and Terra Exandria. 
TRAVIS: What was the relic? Was the relic a seed? Was it the tree? Was it the tree at the center of the city? 
SAM: Was it the Luxon Beacon? 
MARISHA: Wait, the relic that he gave to Ashton's dad? 
LAURA: Efterin. 
MARISHA: He said a shard, a shard of Toramunda? 
MATT: A shard of Ka'Mort. 
MARISHA: A shard of Ka'Mort. 
MATT: Ka'Mort is the titan, The Empress. 
MARISHA: The Empress, right. What Kamordah is named after. 
LAURA: So you were made from the shard? 
TALIESIN: I suppose so. 
MATT: Kamordah is-- 
TALIESIN: We'll find out. 
MATT: -- loosely named after the elemental-- 
TALIESIN: I wasn't-- Well, I was there, but I don't remember. 
MATT: -- because of its tumultuous, earthen geothermal-- 
SAM: So many questions. 
ASHLEY: So many questions. 
TALIESIN: Or at least it's something that happened to me at some point, so-- 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Don't know. 
TRAVIS: We'll get a replay-- 
SAM: We got homework. 
TRAVIS: -- as soon as we stop rolling. 
MATT: Yeah, think on it a bit. We'll pick it up next time. 
LIAM: Do we have cloaks? Do we have the cloaks from Bassuras? 
MARISHA: Maybe in the hole. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: See now there's snow, there's places to put the hole now. 
LIAM: I'm in a bare arm with a rib window. You're in sheer. 
LAURA: I'm in short shorts, hot pants! 
SAM: We got flaming poop. We got flaming poop, we'll be fine. 
TRAVIS: This tracksuit is comfy as fuck. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We'll be fine, there's a volcano up ahead. 
MATT: We'll pick up here next time. But thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)
