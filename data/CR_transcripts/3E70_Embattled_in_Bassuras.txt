MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (various garbled nonsense) 
MATT: That one. Before we get into our episode tonight, our first sponsor is a brand new game called Immortals of Aveum. Sam, what, what are you putting on your head, Sam? 
SAM: Well, Matt, Immortals of Aveum is a groundbreaking single player first person magic shooter-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: -- from Ascendant Studios. Yes, it's a fantasy FPS. So I thought I would do this ad read as an FPS, a first person sponsorship. 
LAURA: Nice! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Let me shift into first person view. Whoa. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is that the shift? 
SAM: This is so cool. 
LAURA: Have you practiced this? Isn't your hand going to-- 
SAM: I don't know. I should hold it like-- 
LAURA: -- block the shot fully? 
MATT: Have you ever played a first person shooter? 
MATT and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Is this you trying to-- 
SAM: I'm first person now. Look, I can pick things up. 
MARISHA: -- do your hands? 
SAM: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: Like Mr. Potato Head. 
SAM: Whoa, this is so cool. Now, what should I do? Should I read the next part of the copy or give it to Marisha? 
LAURA: One of your cameras is pointing towards the ceiling. 
SAM: I know. I didn't test this. (laughter) 
SAM: Can you look through and see if it looks like it? 
MARISHA: Oh, wait, wait. Let me see. 
TRAVIS: It looks like a stupid headlight. 
MARISHA: It's a little high, but it's fine. 
LAURA: It looked like it might be high. There, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Ah. 
LAURA: There. 
LIAM: From the top. 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that looks good. 
SAM: So wait, I got, now I have a HUD, (electronic game music) which is a heads up display. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: It's asking me, do I want to read the next part of the copy or give that part to Marisha. I choose (clicks) Marisha. 
MARISHA: Why? Why me? Fish eye lenses make everyone look fucking horrible. [electronic beeping] 
SAM: Yeah, but that's what the HUD said and I can't read the copy doing this at the same time. Please? 
MARISHA: All right, fine. Set in a fantasy universe-- 
SAM: But look at the camera! It's first person! 
MARISHA: Set in a fantasy universe engulfed in magic rife with conflict-- 
LAURA: Don't look up her nose! 
MARISHA: -- and on the edge of the abyss, you play as Jak, an elite battle mage fighting legions of soldiers, deadly magic wielders, in an visceral, story driven campaign. You're so close to me, stop! 
SAM: Great job, let's move around like a real first person shooter. 
MARISHA: (whines) No! 
LAURA: I hate this. 
SAM: (grunts) 
TRAVIS: Not over here. 
LIAM: What are you simulating? 
LAURA: Where are you going? 
SAM: I don't know, is this how it goes? 
ASHLEY: (emphatically) No. 
SAM: All right, my HUD-- (laughs) 
MARISHA: You do voiceover. (laughter) 
SAM: Now I'm idle. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What is... Why are the hands so high? 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Why are you idling behind Marisha? [electronic beeping] 
TRAVIS: It's the gear head. 
SAM: Now the HUD is asking if I want to battle Travis. 
TRAVIS: I will destroy you. 
SAM: Or my other option is to have Travis read the next part of the ad copy while I film him from unflattering angles. 
TRAVIS: I will also destroy you. 
SAM: Those are the only two options! 
TRAVIS: Fine, I'll take the second one. Do I read it to you? 
SAM: Just say it! 
TRAVIS: Immortals of Aveum combines a modern synthetic story in a fantasy setting to deliver unforgettable characters, fast, fluid action, and spell-based combat that defies FPS conventions. 
SAM: Oh, that's it, okay. Now I'm going to run like a real first person shooter. 
TALIESIN: Oh, everything's breakable. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Oh my gosh. 
SAM: Laura, maybe you can do the next part. 
LAURA: Get away from me, Riegel. 
SAM: Okay, your annoyance bar is going through the roof, [urgent electronic beeping] I better wrap this up. 
SAM: Immortals of Aveum is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox series XS, PC via EA app, Steam and Epic Game store. Summon your-- 
TRAVIS: Are those melee strikes? 
SAM: Yeah, huh, huh! Uh! Uh! Summon your powers, stop the ever-war and save the realms. Huh! Huh! Uh! Matt, back to you. Huh! 
LIAM: Give us a death react, please. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: Wow. That is just... 
ASHLEY: I feel like-- 
SAM: Ugh... 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
LAURA: Nice! 
MATT: That was the most accurate part of the entire read. 
ASHLEY: He died. 
MARISHA: That's great. 
MATT: The worst Quake mod. Thank you, Sam. (laughs) Marisha, you got some announcements. 
MARISHA: I do. The sky shaking premiere of "Midst" season two-- (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Midst season two! 
MARISHA: -- dropped yesterday, you guys. You can check out the first episodes everywhere that podcasts are found. Or head over to our YouTube channel for a version that includes little animations and really awesome artwork. It's really fucking cool. Then for $2.99 a month, or $30 for the whole year, you can get access to the first three episodes of season two and then you continue to stay two weeks ahead. So you get early access to the episodes that are also all ad free. 
TRAVIS: Dope! 
MARISHA: You also get a ton of fun perks like monthly bonus episodes, with Third Person, artwork, music, the ability to-- eh. The ability to support creators. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Artists and creators. 
MARISHA: Artists and creators. 
SAM: That's important, too, yes. 
MARISHA: That's the most important part. 
SAM: Go to Midst.co for all the info! 
MARISHA: Correct. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You need a first person camera, that's what you need. 
MARISHA: I do. (laughs) 
MATT: Get him back. 
MARISHA: Ugh. Also... 
TRAVIS: Oh, there's more? 
MARISHA: There's more! Join us for the premiere of Candela Obscura: Chapter Two-- (cheering) 
MARISHA: -- next Thursday, you guys. We're returning to the Fairelands with a whole new circle of investigators seeking light in the darkness. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MARISHA: The Circle of Needle & Thread includes Travis Willingham! 
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry) 
MARISHA: Brennan Lee Mulligan! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Zehra Fazal! 
MATT: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Luis Carazo! (cheering) 
MARISHA: And Marisha Ray, that's me. 
TRAVIS: That's you! 
MARISHA: Alongside game master and, you guys, the lead designer for Candela Obscura, Spenser Starke. 
TRAVIS: Give it up for Spenser Starke! 
MATT: Spenser! 
MARISHA: He's so incredible. He smashes it. You guys got to watch it. You can still grab tickets to experience the first episode on the big screen at Cinemark.com, or as always, you can catch it on Twitch and YouTube. 
MATT: Ah, oh, right, it's my turn. I have announcements. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's you! 
MATT: Queen By Midnight from Darrington Press is out now! (cheering) 
LIAM: Yes! 
MARISHA: (air horn) 
MATT: Queen by Midnight is a battle royale deck building card game of guile, deception, and brawn. 
LIAM: So beautiful. 
MATT: Six princesses with unique tactics battle for the right to become queen of the Midnight Court, but only one will be the winner. 
TRAVIS: (whispers) The winner. 
LAURA: It's so fun! 
MATT: Though their inner circle-- 
TALIESIN: It's so good! 
MATT: -- could share in the spoils-- 
LIAM: It's so pretty. 
MATT: -- should you play your cards right. Literally. This game was created by our own Kyle Shire, and we're so amazed-- 
LIAM: Yes, Kyle! 
MATT: -- at what he and the rest of the team have created. He is also joined in design by Darrington's own Alex Uboldi with graphic design and clockwork design by Matt Paquette and Co. Cover art by Michal Ivan. Game art by Ameera Sheikh, Michal Ivan, and Michael Pappe. 
TRAVIS: Nice! 
MATT: Uh, Pape, not Pappe. Mike Pape. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Knew it would be one. 
MATT: All the way to the very end and I fucked it up. I'm so sorry, Mike. 
MARISHA: The one they didn't give you pronunciation of. 
MATT: I know, that's okay. See Darrington Press' website for more info. Find Queen-- Shut up. Find Queen By Midnight now at all Critical Role shops, and Darrington Press Guild Stores. Plus, they'll be coming to other friendly local game stores very soon. Also, at guild stores. Be on the lookout for an exclusive set of foiled versions of the princesses' ultimate cards. 
ALL: Ooh! 
MATT: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: It's so much fun. 
LIAM: Shut up, I'm trying to run a show. 
TRAVIS: If you lose the first time, you got to play it again. It's so good. 
MATT: Love you, Mike, so sorry. Laura, you're up. 
LAURA: Hi. (laughs) Our official Critical Role cookbook, "Exquisite Exandria." (cheering) (oohing) 
LAURA: This is a big episode for announcements. 
SAM: This is a big night. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: It releases next week on August 29th in both hardcover and ebook. Oh my goodness. It features 60 delicious dishes-- 
SAM: Damn! 
LAURA: -- from far flung corners of Exandria. I don't know if I'm allowed to open this up, but you got to see all these beautiful, gorgeous illustrations, photography... 
ASHLEY: Meat pies! 
LAURA: And lore. 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: It's a big night for baking. 
LAURA: "Exquisite Exandria" is written by Liz Marsham with recipes developed by Jesse Szewczyk, Susan Vu, and Amanda Yee. If you pre-order Tuesday, you're eligible to receive an exclusive recipe preview for Trinket's bear claws.

TALIESIN: I'll take the book. 
LAURA: Give me them, give me them, nom.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off: Bells Hells, upon traversing the breadth of the Grey Valley to seek a means of aiding Keyleth from her unhealing wounds at the hand of Otohan Thull, during the moment of the Apogee Solstice. You bring her back to health, managed to peruse and cause a little bit of chaos in the Ashari city of Zephrah. Get a little tipsy in an evening of winding down and then trek out to Yios, where it was discovered via Scry spell that Dancer, the one responsible for repairing and bringing FCG online not but a handful of years back, seemed to have found themselves. In looking for someone to help you repair this strange, arcane harness that you had recovered from the past of Ludinus Da'leth, you went to speak to her. After a somewhat tense encounter, here within the city of Yios, the City of Flowing Light, you convinced her to help you out. Unfortunately, she needs more of a workshop to do the work. Even then, her knowledge is a bit incomplete for what this requires. It was spoken that perhaps teaming up with Imahara Joe over in the city of Bassuras would be enough to likely get this to a place where it could be helpful, or at least get any information you would need around its history and purpose. After being attacked by the ever-seeking Shithead, the bird which has claimed you as its primary focus of spite. In its undying spirit, you finally laid it to rest. Nothing but a pile of ash and feathers left behind. 
SAM: That was the first main character death on the show in a long time. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Keyleth, coming along with you to aid you to eventual discussed prospect of heading to the Shattered Teeth where it seems a number of ancient elemental power seems to still swirl and shift the numerous islands of the fog-shrouded, broken continent to the far east, and mysteries that lie around the history and the essence of one Ashton Greymoore might be tethered. With that in mind, Keyleth brought you through and to, I guess it would be an early morning tree in the central city of Bassuras here in the Hellcatch Valley. Here under the reddish glow of the still and locked moon Ruidus, you walk through the predawn streets. The smoke stacks rising into the air. As you seek your destination, we jump in. The first thing you begin to really notice that has changed since the last time you were present, beyond the tense energy of the handful of people that you see throughout the city. The Gajakhandas, the Crawler watchers all sitting at the corner of various streets. All look in strong alertness. You also begin to notice soldiers armored not of Marquesian design. For those who had stepped briefly into the realm of Issylra, you begin to see armor that resembles those, perhaps not specifically, of the Dawnfather's temple. But you see similar shades of the Vasselheim bastions walking through. You also begin to pick up, you specifically, he who shovels his mouth full. (laughter) 
LIAM: (mouth very full) Orym likes pastries. 
MATT: I know, I get it. I get it. 
SAM: Exquisite. 
MATT: You note that beyond the clusters of forces that are moving through the city gathering supplies like they're briefly collecting what they can. You see the three skyships also of similar Othanzian make. Not unlike the one that you saw crashed before you came to the Red Center in the Hellcatch Valley to confront Ludinus, not but a couple of weeks ago. You see three floating up, moored maybe no more than 50, 60 feet off the ground. As one (explosions) flashes a blast explosion. What looks like some sort of a flash and a burst of fire seems to erupt from the side of it. It lists and collides gently into one of the other ships pushing it slightly. As that occurs, you can see all the rest of the surrounding Gajakhandas look up into the sky in its direction. Shouts and a handful of a bells begin to ring off in the city. You can see both soldiers and some of the local Gajakhandas wardens begin running off in that direction. 
SAM: Were these skyships, sorry, they were just docked, moored? 
MATT: Docked just outside of the Carmine Curtain, the outside of the city's walls. 
SAM: They weren't like, loading, unloading, active? 
LIAM: How close to us? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
SAM: Oh my god. This is exciting. 
TRAVIS: They're treating it like a FOB. A forward operating base. 
LIAM: 20. 
MATT: 20, probably a good quarter mile from where you currently are standing. As the tension passes and most of those who are caught by it begin to rush by talking to each other. The rest of the handful of people that are beginning to wake up in the predawn light here, you can see, or into the darkness, technically. Are curious but not particularly worried. The explosion didn't destroy the ship. But it certainly set it ablaze. You can see the crackling flames along the side of it, as it begins to lower back down out of sight below the edge of the Carmine Curtain. 
LIAM: Those ships are like the one we saw by the Malleus Key. 
ASHLEY: Are we able to see a name on the ship? 
MATT: Too far to make out any details. 
TRAVIS: You said people are reacting. Some are hustling, but others don't seem terribly nonplussed about it. As if like, this might be something they've seen before? 
MATT: The general civilian populous, which you've only really, at this hour, see maybe two here, four there. You can see some of them are setting up carts. Which is interesting. Most of the places of business here are internal or within specific areas of the city. Like the Salmagunda Strip and stuff like that. There are people who are just setting up shop here in the roads. A quick point of understanding, whenever there are foreign powers briefly stopping in town, you know that the populous will do what it can to try and make a quick bit of change before they shove off. 
SAM: But this explosion happening and no one reacting, is that normal behavior for Bassuras? 
MATT: It's rare to see skyships here in general, let alone to see something so visibly apparent here at this hour. I mean, it was a loud enough explosion where you can see people are looking out their windows and opening to check into it, but. 
TRAVIS: You know, when we rolled up in one. Oh, yeah! 
MARISHA: That's right. 
TALIESIN: I feel we walked into-- I don't know, halfway through somebody else's fucking issue here. 
LAURA: Yeah, does it look like somebody's-- like they're under attack? 
MATT: I mean, it looks like it could have been an accident. You don't see any other signs of warfare, or combat in the skyline. But you're also quite a ways from it. It's definitely drawn attention to the eastern side of the city. 
LIAM: Excuse me, grandmother. I'm sorry to bother you while you setup shop-- 
MATT: "Oh, you're down there. I didn't see you, sorry." 
LIAM: Uh, yeah, hi. I'm just curious if those ships from out of town, how long have they been in port? 
MATT: "Oh, we've had a couple come through. Those have been here for about a day and a half, I think." 
LIAM: So recent. 
MATT: "They probably put the fire out, it looks like. Well, that's why I don't trust things that fly." 
LIAM: Have there been any more like them in the last week or so? 
MATT: "Oh, there's been a few ships that have come through and headed north, yes." 
SAM: Have any of them exploded? 
MATT: "There's been a handful of issues, I think." 
SAM: What?! 
MATT: "Within the town as well, but--" 
SAM: Explosions around town? Has anyone been hurt? 
MATT: "Yes, but what is life in Bassuras, eh? (laughs)" 
SAM: What is life in Bas-- Life is beautiful! What do you mean? 
LAURA: Explosions happen a lot here. 
MARISHA: It's Bassuras. 
SAM: I know, but-- 
MARISHA: We did a crawler race here through the town, it was crazy. 
SAM: I know, but are there more than normal or just a normal amount of explosion? 
MATT: "You are an adorable little metal man." 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: It's true, I am. 
MATT: "Oh, goodness me." 
TRAVIS: We should try to get to Imahara Joe's. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: I think you're right. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Unless we want to go towards the action! 
SAM: I mean-- 
MARISHA: We have a mission. We have Keyleth here. We have-- (hums questioningly) 
SAM: What was her name? What does she go by? Jolene? 
MARISHA: Vanessa Carlton. What was her name? 
ASHLEY: Kimothée Chalamet? 
MARISHA: Kimothée Chalamet. 
SAM: Kimothée Chalamet. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's right. 
ASHLEY: Kimothée. That's right. 
MARISHA: Kimothée. 
MATT: She's, you know, in her relatively drab looking altered garb. (Keyleth) "I appreciate you being a little more careful." 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You see Dancer looks over. 
MARISHA: I totally-- 
MATT: Wipes her nose a bit. 
MARISHA: -- covered that. Yes, we should-- She's on the clock. We should just go. 
SAM: Yeah, all right. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: I mean-- 
TRAVIS: I can't help much with this. Maybe I should go do a little recon, see if there's anything-- 
SAM: If you want to. I mean, I'm curious too. 
TRAVIS: I'll meet you up at Joe's. 
LAURA: I can go. I can make us invisible, I think. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Dope. 
LAURA: But you can make yourself invisible. 
TRAVIS: Yup. 
MARISHA: What were you going to say, Kimothée? 
TRAVIS: Keyleth. 
MATT: She goes, "Just a moment," and she ducks in an alley and-- (fluttering) you see a bird-- 
LAURA: Oh, well. 
MATT: -- shoot up into the shadow for a moment. 
TRAVIS: Oh, show off! Was that her? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god. I thought I was yelling at a random bird. 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: (laughs) Returns and emerges out from the same shaded space and says, "These are indeed, look to be either temple sourced or temple affiliated. I wonder if I know anyone or have crossed anyone who might be part of this regiment." 
LAURA: Did you see why it exploded? 
MATT: "I just got a glance right now. I can go inquire." 
LAURA: No, no, no. 
SAM: Well, I mean, if you might know somebody there, it might be helpful. 
MATT: "Maybe." 
MARISHA: Do we want to split up? Half us go? 
SAM: Splitsies? 
TALIESIN: I can shake some trees. I've got plenty of people I can hit up while we're here. Find out what the fuck's going on. 
MATT: "Well, to that point, is there a particular place you would like to meet? I imagine back at that tree where we first emerged from would be a good meeting place?" 
SAM: That's great idea. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Are you going by wing or by foot? 
MATT: "By foot to wing. It's faster." 
ASHLEY: By foot to wing. 
MARISHA: Someone should go with you, right? A few of us. 
SAM: Well, are you two going to go also? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: "I can handle on my own." 
MARISHA: No one's saying you can't handle yourself. But also, it was 48 hours ago that you were-- 
TRAVIS: Wrecked. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Needed our help, I'd say. 
MARISHA: You are, as Orym has said several times, you are the Voice of the Tempest. You should have protectors. 
SAM: When a dead lady's worried about your health, you should probably listen. 
TRAVIS: Woof! 
ASHLEY: Very good point. 
MATT: "I'm simply going to speak to a few folks, and if I'm going to stay as careful and as stealthy as I can be, given my capabilities, I think with the short time we have, maybe it's best I do this myself." 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh you want to-- You want to be alone. You want to be alone. 
MATT: "How long are we spending here? I guess is the question." 
LAURA: Well, I don't know how long it's going to take them to work on the-- 
SAM: Yeah, Dancer, is this-- 
TRAVIS: Apparatus. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Do you think this is a one day thing or a multi-day thing? 
MATT: (Dancer) "If I'm going to be perfectly honest, this is probably a multi-day thing. I got to get a better look at it. It's not just you slap some duct tape on it and everything's good to go. But I figure--" 
TALIESIN: What time is it right now? 
TRAVIS: Sundown? We sneak back up at sundown? 
SAM: Duct tape, by the way, is tape that you use on a duck. 
TALIESIN: What time is it right now? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, just to see what's up. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's got a little duck print on it? 
SAM: You know. 
MATT: It's predawn, so you glance over to the horizon and you can see the faintest bit of a sunrise creeping up. So you imagine you probably have another hour or so of night before the light begins to take the sky. 
TALIESIN: Oh, it's very fucking early. 
MARISHA: If it's going to take a few days for this, we might as well drop it off. Maybe head to the Shattered Teeth and come back and pick it up? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I mean, she could run a recon. We could drop it off. So maybe we-- 
SAM: We'll meet back here in three hours? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Maybe at high middle of the day? 
MARISHA: High... lunch time. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Is there a noon? 
TRAVIS: What's that? 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (rapid mechanical footsteps) 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
MATT: You see a crawler, a skirmish-crawler just scoots by real fast and you see two Gajakhandas on the back and rush off in the eastern direction of that side of the city, barreling through the street. 
LAURA: Yeah, you go. Go figure out what's happening. 
MARISHA: Noon. 
MATT: (Keyleth) "Noon, it'll be done." 
MARISHA: Noon. 
TRAVIS: High midday. 
MATT: "All right, good luck. If you need anything, I guess--" 
LAURA: It should work well. We are really close. 
MATT: "Make a very bright, colorful display." 
SAM: Oh yeah, that's a good idea. 
LIAM: Here if you need, Ms. Chalamet, but as you will. 
MATT: "Thank you." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "It's been a bit since I've done this," and she darts into the alley once more and you don't even know where she went. 
SAM: Wow. 
TRAVIS: That's the last time we'll see her. 
MARISHA: I know. She makes me so nervous. 
TRAVIS: Arrogance is what that is. 
ASHLEY: She makes me nervous, too. 
LAURA: You would know nothing about that. 
TRAVIS: Overconfidence. Nope. 
LAURA: Let's head over to Imahara's. 
MARISHA: Before we roll, I'm going to look at the Treshi scry ball. 
LAURA: Oh, smart. 
LIAM: (garbled) Treshi scry ball. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (garbled) Treshi scry ball. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Still dark. 
TRAVIS: Insight check. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Are we checking him? 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll. 
TALIESIN: Just shake the ball to see if it-- "All signs point to yes." 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Yes. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Eight. 
MATT: (laughs) You're dead. 
TRAVIS: Ah! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It was about time. 
MATT: If you had rolled a natural 20, it would've been really funny. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We should probably all go to Joe's. No one's going to be fucking awake yet. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go. 
MARISHA: Aw, wasted. 
TRAVIS: It was the next one. You should've given me advantage. 
LAURA, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: To Joe's! 
TRAVIS: To Joe's! 
TALIESIN: To Joe's. 
SAM: Go, Joe! 
MATT: All right. So with that-- 
LAURA: (drawn out) Go! 
MATT: (laughs) How's that go again? 
TRAVIS: Cowboys. 
LAURA: Joe! 
MATT: All right, so-- 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
MATT: Going through the city, you eventually come to the Sonyon Row and through that, you have the snaking thin alleys between the large makeshift, cluttered buildings with cables and bits of material and tattered ruin, bits of wood that jaggedly shoot out at the sides, creating this somewhat dangerous, massive nest of a neighborhood. Familiar from the last time you were here. The Ends themselves are where the Roaches, the forgotten, the people who prefer to stay out of the business and local politics of the city and get strange work done in the shadows. Until eventually, you come upon the outside of Joe's workshop. Looking to be dark and shuttered. 
MARISHA: Oh, right. It's still so early. 
LAURA: It's important. 
SAM: We'll knock. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: (knocks) 
TRAVIS: I get my lock picks ready. 
LAURA: Wake up! 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
MATT: Nothing. 
MARISHA: What if he's dead!? 
TRAVIS: No, no, no. 
SAM: Why would he be dead? 
TRAVIS: Don't jump to conclusions. Hold on. Can I-- Can I check the door for traps? 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Yes, you may, make an investigation check for me. 
LAURA: I'm sure he has traps. 
SAM: Insight check. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (searching moan) 15. 
MATT: 15? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to let this happen. 
TRAVIS: No, sorry. 19. 
MATT: 19. Does not appear to be directly trapped from this side, no. 
TRAVIS: This motherfucker's got some advanced traps. I can't even see them from over here! I ain't worried. Lock picks. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
LIAM: Everybody, five steps back. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LAURA: I'm going to go more than five steps back. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, no. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm seeing if I can figure out where the bedroom is from the exterior. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, same. I was looking for a window. 
TRAVIS: 22. 
MATT: 22, all right. Well, the first thing you notice is there is that massive collection of rifles that are welded together that sits as part of the front of the shop that you had seen previously as a defensive deterrent. It is currently not operational. It hangs down, pointing to the ground. But you find it is a lock just on the cusp of your ability at this early hour. But eventually-- (lock tumblers clink) You hear the metal slip and unlock. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
LAURA: Can I try to use my-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: I'm going to try to use Telekinesis. Not full Tele-- Just my Mage Hand to open up the door. 
TRAVIS: I'll back up just a little bit. 
MATT: Mage Hand to open the door? 
LAURA: If it's unlocked. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: 10 feet. 
MATT: (door creaking) It opens. It's a dark interior. 
MARISHA: I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: We can call out. 
MARISHA: Right, I'm going to use Prestidigitation to-- Am I able to use that to throw my voice inside a little bit? 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
MATT: I can allow it a little bit, sure. 
TRAVIS: I thought we were trying to be nice. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Imahara! 
TRAVIS and MATT: (demonic echoes) 
MARISHA: Joe! (demonic echoes) 
MARISHA: It's your favorite people! (demonic echoes) 
LAURA: (creepy) We're here. 
MARISHA: Then I make some rattling noises. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. You make some rattling noises and immediately there's a-- (whoosh) A heavy sound of some object shooting through the air and a slam of wood on some sort of heavy object or onto wood, splintering it to the ground. (smash) 
MARISHA: It works every time. 
MATT: You hear a voice go, "Shit!" It pulls back. 
MARISHA: Wait, who, what? 
TRAVIS: You hear a voice go, "Shit" and pull back. 
MARISHA: Did it sound like Joe? That doesn't sound like Joe. 
MATT: It does not. 
SAM and LAURA: (gasp) 
LIAM: And everybody heard? Okay. 
MARISHA: Son of a bitch! 
SAM: Who's this? What's going on? 
TRAVIS: Somebody set a trap. 
MARISHA: Maybe he's gotten-- Maybe it's a trap. Maybe he's gotten captured. Maybe he's gotten captured! 
SAM: Should we spread out, surround the place? 
LAURA: I'm going to Detect Thoughts. All right. 
LIAM: Could be someone he hired, so let's not go in killing. 
LAURA: Sure. I'm going to Detect Thoughts. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: If I'm away from everyone, I can do this without a spell. 
MATT: So you're basically feeling for minds. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. You pick up-- Nine additional wills within the interior of the building-- 
ASHLEY: Uh-oh. 
MATT: -- and its surrounding space. 
LIAM: He probably just hired a guy. 
MATT: As you're concentrating, a small, glowing, glass orb about that big (rhythmic clinks) rolls out right about where your feet are. 
MARISHA: Get back, get back, get back! 
MATT: I need you and, I'll say-- 
TRAVIS: I'm there. 
MATT: -- people that were towards the front would be you and you to all make dexterity saving throws for me, please. 
TRAVIS: Can I, not leap on top of it, but just in front of Imogen? 
LAURA: Oh, Chet. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. 
MATT: Sure. It doesn't affect the context of this, but yes. It just looks cool. 
TRAVIS: Still. (yells) (laughter) 
LIAM: (wolf howl) 
TALIESIN: Well, her knees are fine. 
TRAVIS: ♪ And I ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: I'm going to instinctively shield Dancer. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Dexterity saving. 
MARISHA: Oh wait. Oh wait. Don't I have a thing? Do I have a thing? 
LAURA: 14. 
TRAVIS: Do I have a thing? 
MATT: 14, okay. 
MARISHA: 13. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: 15. 
MATT: Okay. All of you take seven points of lightning damage. As it rolls out and then flashes (static) and sends this-- (electrical explosion) This strange surrounding force field of electrical energy that bursts out for a second before it cracks and lands there and the door slams shut again. 
TRAVIS: Ow! 
LAURA: Come on. 
TRAVIS: We're friends! 
MARISHA: Is there a back entrance? 
MATT: Oh, there is a back entrance. 
TALIESIN: That we know? 
ASHLEY: I feel like-- 
MATT: You have to climb over the fence and stuff. 
ASHLEY: I feel like Ashton and I were trying to go find a bedroom or a window or something. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we heard all this happen. 
SAM: You were outside, going around? 
LAURA: Yeah, they were. 
TALIESIN: All the windows are locked up, right? There's no way to-- 
MATT: It is shuttered. 
TALIESIN: But the back entrance, can we see it since we were starting to walk around the-- 
MATT: If you want to go around. Now, the building is-- The backside of it has a backyard workshop space where a lot of the currently worked on crawlers and various other designs and materials are loaded up. It's like a junkyard meets an outdoor workshop. But it is surrounded by a high metal fence that completely encases the back of it and arcs up at the very, very top to prevent people from-- Or I'd say, arcs outward to prevent people from climbing in. Not to say it's impossible, but it's-- 
LIAM: The whole picture, the front, we have two stories, one story, windows on the front? 
MATT: It's a tall, single story. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: If I remember, yeah, it had a workshop area out back. Are there any roof entrances? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: It's unnecessary! We're paying customers! That hurt! 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
LAURA: Let's do it. 
TRAVIS: Kill them all. Wait, maybe not. 
MARISHA: On the Laudna die. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: That means extra. 
MATT: The rooftop is-- It's like a thatched roof in its shape and design, but it is bent, rusted iron. Just strips of it laid over itself. There is no visible chimney point, necessarily. But you do see there is some sort of a grate where you can see a little bit of smoke and exhaust seems to-- Whatever material is giving off any soot from the inside rises up and then comes out of this grating at the top. 
MARISHA: I'm going to Spider Climb up. 
MATT: Okay. (skittering) 
TRAVIS: ♪ I'm going to Spider Climb up ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Fearne, Orym, either of you got a rope? 
LAURA: You need some company? 
MATT: Make a stealth check for me if you're doing this quietly. 
TALIESIN: I got a fix for this. 
SAM: ♪ I'm going to Spider Climb up ♪ 
TALIESIN: Let's go over the fence. 
LIAM: Are you going to use your hammer? 
TALIESIN: Yup. 
MATT: Are you doing this quietly? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Make a stealth check for me. 
MARISHA: Imogen is joining me. 
LAURA: Yeah. But I can't Spider Climb. 
TRAVIS: You're going away from the Laudna dice after it did you well? 
MARISHA: Well, you got to mix it up. 
MATT: So you're just climbing up? 
MARISHA: You got to let them recharge. 
LAURA: I don't know if I can. 
TALIESIN: Send a rope so we can all climb up? 
LAURA: How high is it? 
MARISHA: 22. 
MATT: Oh, it's about-- 
MARISHA: 20-- 
MATT: I'd say, to the edge of the roof is about-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, 22. 
MATT: -- eight, nine feet up, to the very edge and it goes up higher from there. 
TALIESIN: How high is the fence in the back ish? 
TRAVIS: Give me the other half of that Trinket foot. 
MATT: It's about, I'd say, nine feet. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that ain't nothing. 
MATT: Nine, 10 feet. 
LIAM: Nothing for me. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take the hammer, flick it up, make a little platform. After you. 
MARISHA: That's great. 
TALIESIN: With a rope. 
MARISHA: 22, by the way. Stealth check. 
MATT: 22 stealth check? Okay. So you (chittering climb) carefully get up on the rooftop. Imogen? 
LAURA: I'm just so afraid I'm going to eat shit. I'm just going to fly up. 
MATT: Okay. Glide up and hover over the top of it. 
MARISHA: I'm looking through the grate. 
MATT: Okay. You look into the grate. You have darkvision? 
MARISHA: I do. 
MARISHA: You do. You see the inside of Joe's workshop. It's a little more in disarray. Some of the furniture's been moved around a bit. You can see there's piles of materials. You can see the faint dull glow of various power cores that are put into far corners. You can see there are a number of figures that are inside, three of which that are currently framing the front door. One on one side and two on the other, weapons at the ready. Just waiting for anybody to come in. You can see others that are behind nearby tables. One that has a heavy crossbow and two others that are crouching in wait. You can see there are two figures that are pushed off onto the far back room that are under guard. 
MARISHA: Under guard? 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Oh, like they're prisoners? 
LAURA: Can I see Joe? 
MATT: Or at least staying away from the middle of this. 
LAURA: Can we see-- Oh, they don't look prisoners. They look like they're-- 
MARISHA: Being protected. 
MATT: Well, with darkvision, you can make some details of the interior. One of them looks to be a hooded figure. Hood up over the top of the head, cloak. You see what first looks like hair, but when you look closely, you can see they look like long fuzzy ears that pour through the bottom and a somewhat rabbit-like face that's keeping down, leaning off in the corner. Then to the right of that figure is Imahara Joe. It looks like they both essentially got kicked off of cots and are pushed to the back of the chamber There's somebody keeping them there-- 
TRAVIS: We interrupted. 
MATT: -- playing guard. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: Keeping them in there-- Okay. 
LAURA: Wait, I can maybe talk to Joe, then. 
MATT: They're whispering. 
MARISHA: They're not protecting them. 
TRAVIS: No. 
MARISHA: It's like a hos-- They were interrogating-- 
TRAVIS: We interrupted something. 
MATT: Well, you can make an insight check if you want to try and-- 
MARISHA: Hostage situation. 
MATT: -- make out the details of the-- 
MARISHA: Sure, I want to see. 
TRAVIS: Don't fuck it up. Laudna dice, come on. 
MARISHA: All right, all right. Laudna dice. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MARISHA: Mm! 
TRAVIS: (snapping fingers) (blows raspberry) 
MARISHA: Insight? 
TRAVIS: (dry laugh) 
MARISHA: 16? 
MATT: 16? The tension in the room, based on the hushed whispers and the forcefulness around it, there's definitely a heightened state of alertness within the room and they're giving little cues and hand gestures to each other to move around. You do hear a little bit of movement in the backyard area as well. But you get the sense that, indeed, Imahara Joe and this other figure do not want to be in this scenario and are fearful. 
MARISHA: Ashton and Fearne are moving around back, right? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: And Orym. 
MARISHA: And Orym? 
LIAM: I went up his hammer, which he made like a step, and I'm going to roll stealth, and I want to peep over the fence and see what I see back there. 
MARISHA: I'm going to, while you do that-- 
LIAM: I have an 18 stealth. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to message Ashton and say: Seven hostiles. 
MATT: (creepily whispers) Seven hostiles. 
TALIESIN: We've got seven problems out here. 
MARISHA: Then I'll continue. Two to three headed your way. 
MATT: (deeply whispers) Headed your way. 
TALIESIN: Two to three headed-- 
TRAVIS: (grumbly nonsense) 
TALIESIN: -- towards the back. 
TRAVIS: (creepy growls) 
ASHLEY: Do we do it? Do we take them? 
TALIESIN: Take it slow. Let's see what we see. 
MATT: You glancing over and you hear the (creaks) the very faint sound of the back door opening. There's big double doors that lead to the outside area, and you can see as they open and shut two figures stand against the door and hide in the piles of clutter on the sides, weapons at the ready. You have a high enough perception that even your passive is higher than their stealth. 
MARISHA: I will also quickly send a message to Chetney up at the front, say the same thing: Seven hostiles, looks like three or four at the front door. 
MATT: Because you have a-- 
MARISHA: Imahara Joe is captive. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (ghostly whispers) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Because you have sight on this in this tense moment, your visuals, you're able to read them in the space, and you have a visual, maybe best to show you the layout. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: [Inaudible] Matthew! 
SAM: This combat-- Oh boy, guys. I have two ads, and I don't know which one is the right one for tonight. 
MARISHA: Oh no! (laughs) 
SAM: I'm going to pick this one. 
MARISHA: We've got to date these. 
SAM: This combat is brought to you by Gilmore's Fantastic Fabrications. They're customizable figures created with more experienced hobby painters in mind. (oohing) 
SAM: Adorned with epic magic effects and highly detailed armor, the Cyclops Stormcaller will command attention on the table. Find it at wizkids.io/crminis. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
SAM: Maybe that was the right one. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: That's Imahara Joe and the bunny figure that you're seeing from the topside area on there. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: I'm being told it was the other one. (laughter) 
SAM: This combat is brought to you by WizKids minis. 
MARISHA: WizKids. 
SAM: The Tomb Takers are out for blood. This dark and mysterious group is now available for pre-order. Them and other Critical Role miniatures are at wizkids.io/crminis. Forget about that other bullshit I said before. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Well-oiled machine. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: WizKids, WizKids, WizKids. 
TALIESIN: Monster trucks. 
SAM: Oh shit, this is fun. 
LAURA: There's a lot of people? 
TALIESIN: Oh man. 
LIAM: I don't see them. I don't see them. 
TALIESIN: Seven baddies. 
LAURA: Okay, wait. Where's Imahara? 
MARISHA: There in the back. 
LAURA: That's them? Okay. And the-- 
LIAM: By Frodo and Samwise there. 
LAURA: Okay. And where are we? Me and Laudna are-- 
TRAVIS: Oh. I see Laudna. 
MATT: So Laudna's up here on the roof. 
LAURA: I would be hovering above her? 
MATT: Right. So I'll say for the purposes of this, you both are up in this region. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Don't fall. 
LAURA: That looks so good. It is so good! 
MARISHA: It's really good. 
TRAVIS: It's so good. 
MATT: Meanwhile, over here on this edge-- 
ASHLEY: Toasted nuts. 
MATT: This is where you all have been glancing over the side of the yard. 
ASHLEY: Peeky-poo. 
MATT: Over the top right there. Then, FCG and Fearne. 
SAM: Fearne was with Ashton. 
ASHLEY: I'm with Ashton and Orym. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: I was near the front door, probably behind where Chetney was. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
SAM: Blocking Dancer. 
TRAVIS: Rolling deep. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. 
MATT: Then we got Dancer. 
SAM: I was going to preemptively cast a Shield of Help on her. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: Just to give her a little AC boost. 
TRAVIS: Legit! 
SAM: Are we rolling for initiative right now? 
MATT: There is nothing in combat yet. 
LAURA: We're going to attack them, right? 
MARISHA: I just-- 
TRAVIS: Talk. 
MARISHA: I just don't want them to hurt Imahara Joe. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: And whoever else it is. 
TRAVIS: That would be terrible. 
LAURA: How big is that room? 
MATT: This room? Well, each one of these squares is about five feet. So that's five, 10, 15, 20. 35, 40, 45, roughly 50 feet from side to side. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: How many are we going to have in the back? 
LIAM: You said two were coming out, right, Matty? 
MARISHA: Yeah, right? You mentioned, Matt, that two were heading around the back? 
MATT: You're not quite certain where that one is currently. 
TRAVIS: Where the fuck is Orym? 
TALIESIN: Did they close the door behind them, or is the door to the back-- Well, this is me asking you. 
MATT: They closed it behind them. 
TALIESIN: The door's closed. 
MATT: You heard the (lightly latching) 
TRAVIS: You probably already said this. Is there an entrance up here where these three cats are at? 
MATT: Nope. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: The only two entrances are the front and the back. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: These stairs that go up to where that red fabric is, does that connect to the home and go in, or--? 
MATT: No. You actually look at it. It looks like there was another structure here. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: That's what remains of an older structure. 
LIAM: Ah, okay. 
MATT: Then, this building was constructed alongside it. 
LIAM: Copy, copy, copy. 
MARISHA: Maybe we can drive them out. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Set it on fire? 
LAURA: I can try to do something that might confuse some of them. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's good. 
SAM: Like an interpretive dance or something? Yup, uh-huh. 
LAURA: Are you confused? 
SAM: (laughs) I really am. 
MARISHA: I can swarm the house with yellow jackets again. 
LAURA: I want to make sure Imahara is fine. 
MARISHA: Yes. Well, I could tell the bees to go-- 
LAURA: All right. I could drop something, and you can swarm them at the same time. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: At the same time. 
MARISHA: Maybe we can do some spooky shit or something? 
LAURA: Sure. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good. All right. 
LAURA: Will you tell everyone we're going to drop it in three, two, one? 
MARISHA: Okay. All right. 
LAURA: All right? 
MARISHA: (panicky breaths) Can I dual Message? I can't! I'm going to do to Orym. 
LAURA: I can probably see them down in the back. I'll message that group if you want to-- 
TRAVIS: DM, I'm going to go Invisible. (whoosh) 
LAURA: I'll message whichever group. 
MARISHA: The front group or this group? 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, I can see both, because I'm flying. 
TALIESIN: Can you reply when you Message or no? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll create a telepathic-- 
SAM: Are you invisible? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MARISHA: I'll message Ashton again. 
TRAVIS: I'm going "Metal Gear Solid" on this bitch. 
MARISHA: We're going to see if we can drive them out. In three seconds. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to go Predator, over here. 
TALIESIN: I don't remember if I can talk back to you. 
TRAVIS: Over here! 
MARISHA: You can! I can hear everything you just said. 
TRAVIS: I'm over here! 
TALIESIN: Give us a second more so we can take out the ones and start the ones in the back first. 
LIAM: Which one of the girls are we talking to? 
TALIESIN: Creepy, Laudna. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Pass me another bear claw. 
LAURA: I'll send a message to FCG. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Or I'm just going to talk to you in your head. 
MARISHA: Do you want the other one? 
LAURA: Hey, there's people inside. Imahara's prisoner. We're going to try to drive them out. Confuse them and-- 
SAM: Towards us? Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Dancer, hide behind that rock. Come on. 
LIAM: What's the plan? 
SAM: We're going in three-- 
TALIESIN: We're going to start-- 
MATT: Oh? 
TALIESIN: We're going to start fucking them up in the back. 
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, he's rolling. 
TALIESIN: Then we're going to go. 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: What's your armor class? 
ASHLEY: Should we get back there? 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
LAURA: Why? 
MARISHA: 14. Why? 
MATT: 14. In the moment that this tension's been happening, you've been plotting, they've been looking into all places-- 
MARISHA: Oh dear. 
MATT: -- and what you don't notice is one of them looks up and actively makes a perception check that beats your stealth. 
LAURA: God-- 
MATT: And without you noticing-- 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: 22? It was high. 
LIAM: It's the Babadook. Kill it. 
MATT: (intensifying whoosh) There's a slight release of a taut string before you feel the sharp pain of a bolt (impacts) hitting you in the abdomen through the grating. You take-- 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (gasps) 
SAM: That's a lot of dice. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's a lot. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: It was a heavy crossbow, right? 
MATT: You take 32 points of piercing damage. 
SAM: Whoa! Is she up? 
LIAM: That's no ordinary crossbow. 
MARISHA: Shit. 
MATT: That's a sneak attack crossbow. (oohing) (groaning) 
TRAVIS: Fucking bitch. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
MATT: Now initiative is kicked in. 
MARISHA: All right! (groaning) 
MARISHA: Laudna screams in pain. 
TALIESIN: We're rolling over. 
MATT: Yep. (laughs) 
LAURA: No! 
LIAM: So we hear Laudna-- 
MARISHA: So you hear me go (screams). 
TALIESIN: Yep. We're moving. 
LIAM: That makes it simple. 
LAURA: Gosh darn it. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. 
LAURA: That's why you should ask. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Gosh darn it. 
MARISHA: Oh my god, natural 20 again on initiative? What a fucking waste. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Because it's your character? 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (intensely groans) (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay. (groans) 
TRAVIS: This is going to be fun. Who's going to die? 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: No! 
SAM: WizKids minis, guys. 
LAURA: I'm already starting-- I don't know how, but I'm 20 points down already. 
MARISHA: I was down too. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, there was some shit that happened. 
MARISHA: We already did some fighting. 
SAM: I'm already down, too. 
TRAVIS: Didn't it hurt us coming-- 
TALIESIN: I'm a little down as well. 
TRAVIS: -- here teleporting? 
LAURA: Oh, it was you. 
MARISHA: Yes, that's what it was. 
MATT: Yup. 
TALIESIN: Teleport. 
LAURA: You didn't heal us when we landed. 
MATT: 25 to 20. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: 22. 
MATT: 22. Nice. 
LIAM: Real low. 
TRAVIS: Laudna. 
LAURA: Same. 
LIAM: For the O Man. 
ASHLEY: You got 22 as well? No. 
LAURA: No, I got low. 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
SAM: 16. 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: So, wait. Who got 19? 
MARISHA: Oh wait, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Me. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: 17, 16. 
LAURA: So Fearne and Chet. 
TALIESIN: Chet. 
LAURA: FGG. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: FCP. 
LAURA: FGG. 
LIAM: FGG! 
SAM: Fuh-guh-guh-guh-gee. 
TRAVIS: If you fall. 
MATT: 17 was who? 17 was you, Chetney? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: What's your dexterity? 
LAURA: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Dexterity is 14. 
LAURA: Bad guy. 
LIAM: Rollies with a bad guy. 
TRAVIS: We rolling? We Rollies? 
MATT: No, no, no. You're good. You have a higher dexterity. 
TRAVIS: I lose. 
LAURA: Bad guy goes after Chet. 
TRAVIS: That was a good one! I lose all the time. 
MARISHA: Who's after Chet? 
TRAVIS: Let's roll. 
TALIESIN: Bad guy. 
LAURA: The bad guy. 
MATT: 15 to 10. 
LIAM: 13. 
TALIESIN: 14. 
MATT: So we have Ashton and then Orym. 
TRAVIS: How do you spell Orym? 
LAURA: I got five. 
LIAM: A-R-M. 
MARISHA: Oh boy. 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) We'll say here-- 
ASHLEY: FCG, Orym? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: FCG, Ashton, Orym, Imogen. 
MATT: 10 to five? 
LAURA: Five. 
LIAM: Oh dear. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit poodle. 
LAURA: I got five. That's everybody. 
ASHLEY: Shmerry. 
MATT: FCG, what'd you get? 
SAM: 16. I was up there earlier. 
MATT: Right. Yeah, you were after Chet. Got you. 
TRAVIS: -Ney! Chetney. 
MATT: Or, technically, not after Chet. 
LAURA: After the bad guy. 
MATT: After the bad guy. All right. 
LAURA: Duh! 
MATT: Dancer rolled a natural one, but they're on the run. So, hearing the terrible pain, it immediately sends a surge of adrenaline through your body, and Laudna, you're up first. 
MARISHA: Yes, I am. Oh shit balls. 
TRAVIS: Yup. 
TALIESIN: Bringing heartburn. 
MARISHA: All right. All right. Immediately-- 
LAURA: Marisha's going to be climbing on the table. 
TRAVIS: She's going to be standing on this fucking table in five minutes. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: And immediately sends me into my Form of Dread. 
TRAVIS: She's going to be pooping on the map. 
MARISHA: (laughs) All right. That's not too bad. Form of Dread's giving me 10 extra hit points, which is good. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MARISHA: I think I would-- I'm choosing chaos. This hurt really bad, so what does a Fireball look like down here? 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: What does a Fireball look like down here? 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: It's combustible. 
MATT: That big. 
LIAM: It looks like a big old ball of fire. 
MARISHA: In this combustible place, 100%. 
TRAVIS: Yup. 
MARISHA: I'm doing it. 
LAURA: No, Imahara. You're going to kill him. 
MARISHA: No, I won't kill him. I'm going to put it right and try and get these three and keep it away from Imahara Joe. 
SAM: We do need his workshop 
TRAVIS: You want to put it on the wall close to him instead of those dudes over there? 
MATT: Like here? 
MARISHA: There's these two dudes right over there. So, okay, yeah. Can I put it-- 
TRAVIS: That's fucking-- 
MARISHA: -- getting-- 
LAURA: I know. 
MARISHA: -- right below. 
MATT: All three of them. 
TRAVIS: This is fucking ridiculous. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: What? I can't see, okay? 
TRAVIS: All I can see are your hips and your knees. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Fuck it. 
MATT: (whooshes) You fire a beam of burning red energy that hits the ground before (booms) exploding on the inside. Immediately, those who are standing outside, all the nooks and crannies across all the metal that welds together light from the inside like it was this sudden lantern for a flash. (booms) 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: As the flames subside, you can see the interior, all the wood has this charred, blackened, more charred than a lot of the interior may be. The furniture is blown back. These individuals are thrown to the side a bit. It looks like a handful of small bits of black powder and other explosive elements have also (crackles) detonated a little bit. Some of the materials and loose mechanical bits and some of the smaller arcane cores roll off to the side, slightly damaged. Go ahead and roll damage on this. 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: What's the DC on this, by the way? 
MARISHA: 16. 
MATT: 16. Okay. 
MARISHA: 10, 20, 25. 
MATT: 25 points of fire damage. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: They all have to roll for fear as well. 
MATT: Okay, so. 
LIAM: (muffled) Rolling for fear. 
MATT: Two of them made their save. One of them didn't. They roll back drop to the side. Actually, and that one takes even less. The one over here, this tall-looking half-giant gets to the ground as the flames subside. It seems to shrug it off a bit with a grin. (whooshes) The smoke emanates from its teeth as it bites down. The one back here, he takes less damage as the blast of the table being blown back actually guards it a little bit from half the damage. The one that's near the wall over there takes the full brunt (impacts) and is slammed into the wall. "(grunts)" Falls to one knee, and she glances up at the source angrily. 
MARISHA: They have to roll for fear. 
MATT: They do have to roll for fear. 
TALIESIN: I'm afraid. 
TRAVIS: Are you afraid? 
MATT: That guy succeeds. 
SAM: Did you kill him? 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: That guy. What's the DC on it? Also 17? 
MARISHA: Yes, I think that's correct. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Let me check. 
MATT: Succeeds and that same guy fails again. (laughs) 
MARISHA: 16. 
TRAVIS: Got to have one of them. 
MARISHA: 16 wisdom save. 
MATT: So this guy here is fear. After being blasted at the wall, looks up and sees the shadow crawling against the grate and goes, "(shrieks)," and she begins to hold the weapon at her side, preparing, knees shaking a little bit in the spot. 
MARISHA: I'm going to move away from the grate, too. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Away from the grate ♪ 
MARISHA: I'm going to skitter away, but stay on the roof. 
LIAM: ♪ Skitter away ♪ 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I'll move back a little bit. 
MATT: Back a little bit this way? 
MARISHA: Towards you. 
MATT: Oh. I'll rotate this little guy here. 
MARISHA: Just so I'm not shootable again. 
MATT: Yeah, you are out of the position of the grate. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: I am also out of the position of the grate. 
MATT: I assumed that was the case. 
LAURA: I look like I'm standing right on it. 
MARISHA: I just don't want to be fucking shot. 
MATT: Okay. So that finishes your go. 
TRAVIS: Oh jesus. Here we go. 
LIAM: What's next? 
TRAVIS: How much trouble are we in? 
MATT: The figure out here (thuds) kicks out the window. 
SAM and TRAVIS: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: Immediately. Both feet, lands out. 
LAURA: Who are these fuckers? 
MATT: And looks at the folks in the ceiling, and then sees you and Dancer right there. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: And goes, and is going to-- Hmm. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. I went invisible. 
MATT: Nah, immediate threat's up top from as far as it's concerned, and it's going to start leap up, vaulting off and climbing onto the ceiling. 
MARISHA: Come and get it, bitch. Come and get it! 
SAM: Who's the bird behind us? 
MATT: That is-- 
MARISHA: That's Dancer's robot bird. 
MATT: That's Pussy II. 
SAM: Oh, that's right. Pussy Two. 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: P2. 
TALIESIN: Electric Boogaloo. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: An athletics check. Natural 20, yeah. Without issue. 
TRAVIS: Two stories, one story? 
MATT: It's one story, but it's a tall one story, but they vault off and grab onto the top and immediately start (feet pounding) running up the top of it, like the incline has a little effect if they go-- 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: -- up the side. 
LAURA: Whatever. 
TRAVIS: Did we spot any-- 
LAURA: Is he a monk? 
TRAVIS: -- weapons on them as they jumped out and ran up? 
MATT: No weapons. 
LAURA: Oh, that's a monk. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MARISHA: Dope monk shit. 
TRAVIS: It's a clown. 
MATT: With a bonus action, Step of the Wind. 
MARISHA and LAURA: No! 
MATT: It will close the distance as they run up (feet skittering) to the top of the roof. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: Right towards where the two of you are. 
LAURA: I'm flying. 
MATT: Right. How far up are you flying? 
LIAM: (mocking noises) 
LAURA: I don't know. 10 feet up, I guess. 
MATT: Okay. It comes for you, then. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: As they ran, in addition to the weapons, were they wearing any red garb that we have seen previously from-- 
MATT: No red garb. Make a perception check, if you don't mind. Quick glance over towards them. 
LAURA: Oh no. Laudna's falling. Laudna's falling. 
MATT: I got it. Good looking out. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 18. 
MATT: 18, quick glance, darker colors and a glimmer of gold hanging around the neck. 
LAURA: Dawnfather? 
LIAM: Yes. 
SAM: Dawnfather? 
LAURA: Why are they trying to attack us? Oh, because you guys attacked them? 
TRAVIS: No. I mean, that's on another continent, though. 
LAURA: Yeah, but these guys are-- 
MARISHA: I mean, if they're still-- 
TRAVIS: Gold hanging around their neck's like a chain or trim on-- 
MATT: A gold chain with something hanging on it that is gold. 
TRAVIS: Gold chain. 
MATT: It looks like a small skull. 
TRAVIS: Duskmaven. 
MATT: Like a bird skull. 
TRAVIS: Duskmaven. 
MARISHA: Duskmaven shit. 
ASHLEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
MATT: It darts up movement, and bonus action, darting up to the side there. It's now going to make three unarmed attacks against you. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: That is a natural one. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Eight. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: That is going to be a 19 to hit. 
MARISHA: Shield. 
MATT: (laughs) We'll say as far as the narrative here, the first one goes wide, and they spin around with a back kick that you duck under. The third one, they're going like a full-on dim mak punch right to the front of your chest and (fist thudding) it just hits this arcane shield. (energy crackling) Deflects it off. 
TRAVIS: Sick. 
MATT: Now at a quick glance, you can see this is a figure dressed in similar garb to Paragon's Call. 
MARISHA: It's Paragon's Call. 
LAURA: Oh. Oh, right. 
MARISHA: Right, because they worship the Duskmaven. That's right. Fuck those guys. All right. 
TRAVIS: So we are fighting. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MARISHA: We are fighting. 
MATT: As they pull back, you can see this grizzled, patchy half beard on the chin. It's long, tattered hair that's knotted up into rat's nest-like clusters. As it stands there with its hands at the ready, it gives you a little bit of a glare, like, "I dare you." That's going to finish their turn. Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Hello. All right. 
SAM: Hello. 
ASHLEY: So we're doing this. We're doing this? 
TALIESIN: Well, the question is, were we already climbing up the rope? Because I know that we were trying to get up to get the view. 
SAM: I don't think we're doing this. 
MATT: If you guys were to climb up onto the fence, you can get up onto here, maybe. 
TALIESIN: I mean, were we already there? 
MATT: You were climbing up there, for this planning, I would say yeah. You guys should probably already be up here. About there. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: You were probably up there as well? 
LIAM: No, I'm hanging on the fence. I'm cool where I am. 
MATT: Okay, cool. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: All right. All right, well, we can't see inside so I am going to Mirthful Leap down to the back. 
LIAM: (bleats) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Bamf out Mister. 
MATT: Got it. 
LAURA: Just pulled my hair out. 
MATT: (squawks) (hoots) 
ASHLEY: Hi. Stay pretty close 'til I tell you somewhere to go. Good boy. So I'm going to get up against that wall. 
MATT: Over here? 
ASHLEY: Like right in the corner, so my back is up against it so I can keep looking around. 
MATT: Okay. Glancing over here, there is one figure with a massive crossbow to their chest that's looking up towards the roof where you hear the battle happening. Being like... (swooshing impacts) Some strikes that go wide. You see a flash of arcane energy above from where Laudna is standing, and this individual is crossbow loaded and glancing up, just at the ready, and they do not notice you at the moment. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Shit. I think I did all my moves. 
MARISHA: Do you have any sneak attack shit? 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, I do have a sneak attack. I have a sneak attack. I have sneak attacks that I can do. I don't know why I keep saying that. 
MATT, MARISHA, and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
TALIESIN: It's a sneak attack. 
LIAM: It's a sneak attack. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Um, um, mm, mm, mm Let me see. 
TRAVIS: Um, um, um, um. 
ASHLEY: Where did it go? Where did it go? 
LIAM: As long as I have advantage. 
MATT: Right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, Mirthful Leap. 
MATT: Which is a bonus action? Or is that-- 
ASHLEY: That is just a feature and traits. I don't know. 
MATT: (laughs) I'll look it up. 
ASHLEY: Mister is an action, bamfing him out. 
MATT: Right. 
ASHLEY: Mirthful Leap, I guess, is considered a movement? 
MATT: Well, here. So Mirthful Leap, technically how it works, is when you make a long or high jump, you can roll a d8 and add the number to the number of feet you cover. 
MARISHA: That's awful. 
MATT: So just roll a d8? 
ASHLEY: Three? 
MATT: Three, all right, so that would probably be at full-- 
ASHLEY: My full speed is 35. 
MATT: Your strength? Right, your strength isn't that big, but you make a little leap and you land down because it is a large height. Make an acrobatics check for me. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, all right. Acrobatics. Great. 
SAM: You've got this. 
ASHLEY: All right, 12. 
MATT: A 12. You land. (crashes) Your knee pops a little bit. You're like, "Oh." 
ASHLEY: Ow, oh, oh, oh. 
MATT: You do take three points of bludgeoning damage as you land. 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's fine. 
MATT: But from that point, you can continue to use your movement to get over here. Then you use your bonus action to bamf out-- 
ASHLEY: That's an action. 
MATT: That's an action, okay. So he's out now as an action. 
ASHLEY: He's out. 
MATT: You still have your bonus action. 
ASHLEY: I still have my bonus action. Okay, so-- 
MATT: Is there anything you can do? 
ASHLEY: Let me see. I don't know if there's anything. Standby. I'm going to have Mister throw some flame seeds. 
MATT: You got it. 
ASHLEY: No, wait. Oh, yeah, that's a bonus action. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Bamfs up and lands over here. This guy's looking up there for a second, not paying attention. (hoots) (ploop) (throw) 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: 22. 
MATT: 22 hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So that's... 
SAM: Oh, oh no. Come on, come on. 
ASHLEY: All right. Nine points of damage. 
MATT: Nine points of fire damage. (groans) Looks over and you can see now this figure, also in a heavier cloak around the shoulders and a half hood that's pulled over the head, turns around. You see a light gray. A gray colored dragonborn snout from underneath the hood as they look back at you with a shoulder flaming and they pat it out for a second before spinning around with the crossbow in your direction. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
ASHLEY: That finishes my turn. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: What are the two witches' true height? Are they here or does the structure go up in the middle somehow? 
MATT: They're maybe closer to here. 
LIAM: Okay, so it goes to here and then up somehow? 
MATT: Yeah, it's height, and then it has a very... What do you call it? Like a vaulted pitched roof that goes up to a point right there. 
LIAM: Oh, yeah. 
SAM: For when it snows. 
MATT: Yeah. But-- 
MARISHA: You never know. 
MATT: At this point, so yeah. 
MARISHA: I know, right? 
LIAM: Unfortunately-- 
TALIESIN: We're splitting up? 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: Fearne? She's gone. 
TRAVIS: She left. 
MATT: I was like, "Oh!" 
ASHLEY: I'm here, I'm here. 
MATT: That's okay. 
SAM: I turn invisible. 
LIAM: (as Ashley) I go invisible. 
MATT: (laughs) It's okay. What's your passive perception? 
ASHLEY: I have to pee. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MATT: 19? 
SAM: You got to go pay-pee? 
ASHLEY: I got to go pee-pee. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I got to go pay-pee. 
LIAM: I mean, she just had her monkey go poo, so the element of surprise has been sprung. 
MATT: Off to the side like this, the poo hits him, bursts into the guy's shoulder with flames, who turns around towards you with a little cocky grin. You just hear this (light whoosh) right behind you. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: As you turn, what you don't notice is a figure that had climbed across the side of the roof and landed right behind you. 
SAM: Oh, shit. 
MATT: With a quick little grin, they smile and go in and try and stab you. 
LAURA: (gasps) No. 
ASHLEY: All right. All right. 
TRAVIS: We are outnumbered. 
TALIESIN: A lot going down. 
LIAM: Sneaky snake! 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: With a rapier out that goes right towards your center. First attack is going to be a 15 to hit. 
ASHLEY: No? 
MARISHA: Seven. Imogen sensed nine minds. 
MATT: 18 to hit? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: There's got to be seven at least. 
MATT: And a 20 to hit. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: My what? 
MARISHA: You sensed nine minds, right? 
LAURA: I did. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MARISHA: Two of them are-- 
LAURA: Yeah, two of them are ours. 
ASHLEY: Why did I just jump in like this? This was dumb. 
SAM: You're fine. 
TALIESIN: These are going to all be problems. 
SAM: What are you going to do? 
TALIESIN: Every last one of these. 
LIAM: Ashton and Orym are running up the road. 
ASHLEY: Bye. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Well, we're starting our own gang. 
LAURA: Run. 
MATT: Okay, the first strike, 23 points of piercing damage. Most of it from sneak attack because you didn't see it there. It just runs you through on the upper side. You pull out of the way and the armor takes a bulk of it, but a lot of it also gashes upward off your shoulder and catches part of your ear. Almost pierces it, additionally. 
LAURA: (gasps) Ooh, you got a ear piercing. 
MATT: Other one goes wide and then one swings around for nine points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: That bitch getting flayed. 
LAURA: Spider Climb. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Weird. Yeah! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Nine points of piercing damage? Okay. 
LAURA: Ah! 
LIAM: No! I killed him. I fixed it. 
LAURA: That was so aggressive, Liam. (laughs) 
MATT: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: Can I activate-- 
TRAVIS: Operation. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Is that your Armor of Agathys? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: It's an action to do that. So your next turn you can, if you like. 
ASHLEY: It's an action. Got it, got it, got it. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: All righty, that finishes its turn. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That brings us to Chetney. 
TALIESIN: Fuck some shit up. 
TRAVIS: Can I use my 35 feet of speed with my super-stealthy invisible self to trace my way over to the window where the monkish individual kicked in, and try and climb through and up onto that table behind-- 
MATT: This figure here? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Can I use my... I'm going to hold my-- 
MATT: So normally, you'd have to move half speed to stealth up. You are invisible, which, to do that, it would be an advantage. You can make a straight stealth roll to try and sneak in here. Or it might still be waiting for something to go in there. 
TRAVIS: I'll do a straight stealth roll. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: I normally have advantage on, but not in this case. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 22. 
MATT: 22. They do not seem to notice your arrival as they're sitting there with a massive axe facing towards the door, this way. This brawny looking member of the Paragon's Call is sitting there, beads of sweat down the side of their head. 
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I'm going to use a Blood Curse of Bloated Agony on the guy that's already frightened across the doorway. 
MATT: Okay. Popping out of invisibility. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit, that's right. I didn't think about that one. I suck at this. I will take two strikes now, because I'm not invisible anymore, against the back of the gentleman that's right in front of me with Graz'tchar, the Luminary Blade. 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh fuck. Is this your first time using it? The cursed sword? 
TRAVIS: In combat? Yeah! 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: "This is our chance to become heroes!" 
MATT: As you pull the blade from its sheath after popping out of stealth. At this point, the person looks over their shoulder just as you begin to unleash. In the back of your head, you hear, "Now this day, we prove ourselves in the field of battle. The first step of many." 
TRAVIS: Oh, shut up! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: 11-- 22 to hit on the first one? 
MATT: 22 will hit. 
TRAVIS: The second one. (dice clattering) Ah, that's so loud. Sorry about that. That is a natural one. The first one. 
MATT: We'll say the first one's the natural one, as you're distracted by the speaking in your mind and just go wide. The second time, you strike back and hit it against the wall. 
TRAVIS: That's 20 points of damage. 
LIAM: Where's Chet? 
MARISHA: He's inside. 
TRAVIS: 11 of which are radiant, if that makes any difference. 
MATT: Actually, how much was it, 20? 
TRAVIS: 20 total. 
MATT: 20 total points, all righty. 
TALIESIN: I'll either go down or up, depending on my build. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: If you're okay. 
LIAM: I got plans. 
MATT: You slam the blade into them. They go, "(grimaces) I've got you." They back up with their axe, like they're protecting you. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, because they got to roll a charisma save, DC 17, which you failed? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: (shouts) Yes! 
SAM: Wait, so now they're on your side? 
MARISHA: He's on your side? 
TRAVIS: (excited noise) 
MARISHA: What?! 
LAURA: That's tight. 
TRAVIS: Our numbers grow. 
MATT: They're charmed by you. 
TRAVIS: Charmed. 
MATT: Not dominated. 
TRAVIS: No, I own them. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
LIAM: Charmed. 
TRAVIS: You're amazing. 
TALIESIN: Come on. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
TRAVIS: (giggles) Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) All righty. 
ASHLEY: What did he do? 
LAURA: He attacked one of them and charmed them-- 
MATT: As you've arrived there-- 
LAURA: -- so they're fighting for us now. 
MATT: -- from the far end, the brawny-looking half giant goes, "Wait, I've seen you before." 
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been waiting for this moment. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: Is this the guy? 
MARISHA: Paragon's Call. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: Massive battleaxe that's held at the middle, just kind of-- 
MARISHA: What was this guy's name? 
TRAVIS: My memory ain't what it used to be. 
MATT: Lets it drop in his grasp and catches it in the middle. 
LIAM: Is this the one that eyeballed Ash? 
MATT: You see General Ratanish on the other side of the chamber. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
LAURA: Oh no. What is he doing here? 
TRAVIS: Is he right here? 
MATT: Over here. 
TRAVIS: Oh fudge. Fudge. 
SAM: Oh schnap. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: 35. 
TALIESIN: This is bad. 
MARISHA: This is bad. 
MATT: Goes rushing towards you-- 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: -- (footsteps) dual-handed. As he approaches, it's like the air seems to just grow hotter and hotter as he begins to burst towards you. 
MARISHA: Because he's got flame resistance. 
MATT: He's going to rage-- 
TRAVIS: I should've turned into a werewolf first. 
MATT: -- as he does so, and he's going to-- 
TALIESIN: You didn't turn into a fuck-- two strikes against you with his battleaxe. That is going to be a 25 to hit. 
TRAVIS: That definitely hits. 
MATT: And a 23 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, hits both times. 
SAM: On the nose. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Fuck this guy. 
MATT: Double-handed with this. 
MARISHA: Fuck this. 
SAM: You okay? 
MATT: So the first one is going to be (laughs) not great. This will be 15 points of slashing damage. 
TRAVIS: Oof, yeah. 
MATT: And, much better, 18 points of slashing damage. 
TRAVIS: This costly mistake on my part. Okay. 
MATT: After the first hit, he knocks you down on the table, and the guy you just hit goes like, "Wait, Ratanish, they're our friend." 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: Ratanish goes, "Do not worry. I can tell who's friend and foe," and takes the axe in one big heavy hit and slams it down, right as you try and dodge it, but it's with an immediate speed, faster than you expect. As you try and dodge, it catches you in the shoulders. You try and parry it off-- 
LAURA: Are we all going to die? 
MATT: -- with your chisel, and instead it buries itself into your clavicle and you hear like a snap. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
TALIESIN: We are going to get Joe and run. 
MATT: That's going to finish his go. FCG, you're up. 
SAM: I can't see half you guys right now. 
MATT: Your turn. 
SAM: Okay. I didn't see Chetney do any of that-- 
MATT: Nope. 
SAM: -- because he was invisible. So I'm going to do what I would've done, which is I'm going to tell Dancer: Dancer, hide, protect yourself. Use your Pussy for protection if you have to. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Never leave home without it. 
SAM: It's a power. It's powerful. Then I was-- 
MARISHA: Hashtag feminism. 
SAM: Ally. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. (laughter) 
MATT: Yes, FCG? 
SAM: I was going to go to the window, and I don't know that he did, so I'm going to go. I was going to go to the window and I was going to look in and see if I can see Imahara Joe. What can I see? 
MATT: All right, you coast over, looking inside, what you see is Chetney on a table with a battle axe wedged into his shoulder. 
SAM: Oh fuck. 
MATT: And immediately see General Ratanish with both hands on it glance before noticing you in the window. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: What are you doing? 
MARISHA: Okay, so, yes, if this goes bad, maybe we get Joe and run. But until then-- 
SAM: I'm going to cast Banishment on General Ratanish. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah! 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: It's a 15 charisma. 
MATT: That is going to be... (laughs) Charisma? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: With his modifier, he rolled a one. 
LAURA: (gasps) (laughter) 
SAM: (shouts) Get off of him! 
MATT: Pulls the axe out with a giant arc, with a grin, and then (poofs) disappears from sight. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Great. Great. 
SAM: (shouts) You got one minute! 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, he's gone for a minute? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You've got one minute. Go fuck everybody else up. 
TRAVIS: Thank god. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure you saved my life. 
TALIESIN: Might've just entirely changed the game there. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Wow. 
SAM: That's a spell. 
LIAM: Don't worry. I've got this. (poof) 
SAM: Bonus action, I can't really do anything. 
TRAVIS: Holy crap. 
SAM: Because that was a spell. All my bonus actions are also spells. So that's about it. 
MATT: All right, finishing FCG's go. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: This figure over here that was hurt earlier steps up, comes over to the table, actually scoots the table forward, keeping them at half cover as they do. Okay. 
LAURA: It's both sides of the table we're really addressing. (chuckles) 
LIAM: Hire us, please. 
MATT: Hmm. 
LAURA: Does it sound like, ♪ She's a maniac, maniac ♪ 
TALIESIN: ♪ Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum ♪ 
MATT: Okay. So they are going to-- 
TRAVIS: Oh man, Matt's thinking. You noticed that-- 
TALIESIN: Shit got weird. 
TRAVIS: Noticed a moment. 
SAM: Oh, and if I had any other movement, I was going to start going inside, but I don't know how far I could get. 
MATT: 30 will get you inside. 
SAM: Oh, okay, great. I'm in. 
MATT: Just barely. So you're just inside right there. What kind of armor are you wearing? 
TRAVIS: I just have my chisel and mallet. What kind of armor is this? 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
TRAVIS: A breastplate is the equivalent, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: The figure across the way, looking at you after Ratanish vanishes, looks surprised, kicks the table forward, scoots forward about five or so feet as they move in. You see them now. They have this cloak billows up a bit. They begin to muttering in Marquesian under their breath. Do you speak Marquesian? 
TRAVIS: I don't. 
MATT: You hear "(speaking in Marquesian)." They put their hand out. As you're here still reeling from the attack, nothing. Magic just passed you. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Who does this? Which individual? 
MATT: Over here. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. They don't close on me. They do it from across the room? 
MATT: Yeah. Then your armor begins to heat up rapidly until it's immediately scalding and burning the flesh from the inside. (hissing) It's glowing orange on your torso. 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
SAM: I can't tell if that's just you being you, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Nah! 
SAM: Okay! 
MATT: You take 11 points of fire damage. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. Fuck. 
MARISHA: A Heat Metal situation. 
LIAM: If only you had Fjord's Ring of Fire Protection. (laughter) 
MATT: They're going to crouch low behind the table. That brings us to Ashton's go, with Orym on deck. 
TALIESIN: All right. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to-- 
MATT: Initiative was like tap, tap, tap. 
TALIESIN: This is a lot. I see both of these fucking things happening. 
MATT: You see down here and you see up here. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: This isn't closed off. 
TALIESIN: Going to rage and see what the fuck the happens. Here we go. Ooh, okay. Interesting. That'll be fun. 
LAURA: You're on the back, Fearne? Is that what's going on? You're over there? 
ASHLEY: Yes, we're in the back. The back yard area. 
SAM: She's in a strategic place. 
TALIESIN: Okay, how far away would you say approximately, since it's hard to judge right now-- 
MATT: How far away this is from? 
TALIESIN: From the monk that's being a dick. 
MATT: Up here? 
SAM: The dick monk? 
MATT: It's a pitched ceiling upward. It's a high angle, but it's about, at a quick glance, 35, 40 feet. 
TALIESIN: 35 feet. 40 feet. Okay, I'm going to tap. I'm like: Down? You good? 
LIAM: I'm set! 
TALIESIN: Going up! I'm going to run full fucking speed at that goddamn monk. 
MATT: Up top? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: All right, I need you to make an athletics check to make sure that you can push yourself up with enough strength to not end up sliding down the actual metal roof. 
TALIESIN: That's not a great roll for me. 13. 
MATT: You have advantage if you're raging, which you are. 
TALIESIN: I am raging. That's 16. 
MATT: 16. You needed a 15. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: So you dart up, and technically, she is floating a little bit higher there, but you rush up and you are now in combat with this monk who is currently locked in with you and Laudna, and you're floating in the air. 
TALIESIN: I am going to, if I can take a swing at this motherfucker-- 
MATT: Yeah, you can take a swing. 
TALIESIN: I am taking a swing at this motherfucker, and I'm going to use the belt. So, yeah. Let's see what we're going to do. I'm going to swing recklessly, because that's where we're at right now. 
MATT: Because I forgot, roll a dexterity saving throw. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MARISHA: Why? What? 
MATT: Just do it for me. 
MARISHA: What? 
TRAVIS: Just do it. 
SAM: You're covered with goo. 
MARISHA: Did something happen that I missed? 
LAURA: What happened? 
LIAM: She's making a dex save, your lady love. 
MARISHA: Six. 
TRAVIS: Don't roll those Beau dice. 
MATT: No, it missed, missed, and you shielded, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So it didn't even hit you. Never mind, you're fine. I was trying to think back. Nothing happened to you. Sorry. Go ahead and roll. Sorry. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that worked. A lot. 26. 
MATT: 26 hits. 
TALIESIN: Thankfully bounced. Fuck. All right, I'm hitting with the belt, which means I get an extra d6, so that's 3d6. That's, thank god, (counting) that's 20 points of damage. 
SAM: Damn. 
MATT: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Then they have to have a 17 strength saving throw. 
MATT: Strength save on their point? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: All righty. Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Well, I'm going to take my... Can I add my Crusher to that, too, or no? Is it too late to use the crusher effect and have that five feet of push no matter what? It might be too late. I may not be able to add that to, well-- 
MATT: What's it say for Crusher? 
TALIESIN: "Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can move it five feet to an unoccupied space, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you." 
MATT: Okay, yeah, you can push it back five feet, if you want to. 
TALIESIN: I'll get that five feet out of the fucking fray. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I know I can't move any further. I got that one good push. Now I'm going to spend a chaos burst, since at this point, the monk has probably noticed that there seems to be a weird hole in my head, and the hammer, it's not quite invisible, but boy, it's got a weird vibe and it doesn't quite look right. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a wormhole strike. So that's reckless. 
MATT: Against him? 
TALIESIN: Against the monk? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: So you knock him back and then teleport it to him as you swing it. 
TALIESIN: It's going to teleport behind them. 
MATT: Oh, even better. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: If he can stay tangled with Ashton-- 
TALIESIN: That's 21 to hit. 
MATT: 21 hits. 
TALIESIN: 21 hits, and then I get an extra d6 for that attack. Mm-hmm. That's better. 
MATT: This is not technically a ranged attack. A melee attack-- 
TALIESIN: No, it's a melee attack. 
MATT: Yeah, so he cannot use his deflect missiles. 
TALIESIN: (counting) 23 points of damage right on the back of the head as the thing, and then comes right-- 
MATT: So it gets hit, skids back and catches right before they begin to slide down the back of the other side of the roof, and then right as they prepare themselves, get hit from behind, their hair flung up in the air, and they fall back onto their knees for a second before getting back up, forward, looking a bit dazed from the sudden cluster. 
TALIESIN: You like surprises? 
MATT and TALIESIN: Bring it. (oohing) 
MATT: A little bit off left of you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's where I'm at. 
MATT: All right, finishing Ashton's go. Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: Okay, so Orym, from his perch on the fence, watched Fearne jump down, then immediately get attacked by two assailants, sizes it up, and then leaps to the crawler directly out in front of him there, and I'm going to rev that shit up as loud as I can. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: (engine sputters) 
LIAM: Died? 
TRAVIS: No! No! 
LIAM: Repair? 
MATT: This is a repair yard. 
TRAVIS: (shouts) Oh my god! (groaning) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: Smoke is pouring out of it. Little sparks going around. 
LIAM: Smoke goes in his face. 
LAURA: Well, they know we're back here. 
LIAM: Fucking of course. Action surge, and I will leap off the seat. 
MARISHA: This is a repair yard. Sir. 
TRAVIS: Next one. 
LIAM: I knew it was probable, but I thought it was worth a try. 
MATT: Now, mind you. 
LIAM: Yeah? 
MATT: It's still sparking and glowing. 
LIAM: Great. 
MATT: It's been activated. It's just not moving, and it looks unstable and damaged. 
SAM: Oh no! 
LAURA: Great. 
LIAM: I will run up behind Fearne and scoop her out of the way with my shield and press my blade up towards the person who stabbed her. 
MATT: Okay, so you're going to move across this way. Bait and Switch. 
LIAM: Bait and Switch. 
MATT: Move Fearne out of the way. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Where is she? I can't see. 
MATT: She's right over here. 
LIAM: She's there-- 
MATT: So you moved her out of her space. 
LIAM: So she's out of range, right? 
MATT: If you want to push her out of range, put her there. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah, that'll work. 
LIAM: I'll give her the AC, so you have an extra five AC. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Until my next turn. Then I'm going to go to town here. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Go to town ♪ 
LIAM: Okay, that is a-- (trills) 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
LIAM: That is a 15 to hit. That was low. 
MATT: 15 does not hit. 
LIAM: Does not hit. Second one's even worse. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. Guidance? 
MATT: Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
LIAM: All right, that's it. 
ASHLEY: I always try. 
LIAM: That's it, done. 
MATT: All right, so as you try and strike at this figure, it's fast, it's ducking, and it has that smile on its face where, unaware of some of the other chaos going on, it feels confident in the moment and squares off with you as you push Fearne backwards. Behind it, the sparking energy. Glances over his shoulder. 
LIAM: I look over at her. I'm your Huckleberry. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: All right, finishing Orym's go, Joe and the other figure are going to scoot around this way, and as they begin to scoot around, the caster figure that is currently here goes, "(speaking in Marquesian)" They both back up and stay back over this way, holding their position. From there, this frightened figure that can't get closer to you is going to move through the chamber over to where Chetney is and... And, "(pants) (grunts) Where's Ratanish?!" Swings out in your direction angrily. Make two attacks. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to be a 15. 
TRAVIS: Misses. 
MATT: And a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Oof. 
LAURA: Oof. 
MARISHA: Oof. 
MATT: That will come to-- 
LAURA: Shit! 
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: I'll talk half of that. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: That's to Chetney, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I'll take half of that. 
TRAVIS: Cool. Eight? 
MARISHA: Nice. Oh shit. 
MATT: Eight points to you. You take half that. We'll say you take nine. 
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of here. 
SAM: Nine! 
MATT: All righty-- 
TRAVIS: Not being a werewolf is real bad. 
MATT: -- that's going to finish their go. The one that is currently charmed by you goes, "Hold up, hold up! Hold on, they are friend. Don't go for them. There's other people above that are scary." And... does not make a great persuasion roll. The other person is like, "What do you mean? You're confusing! But--" and is in this moment of trying to figure out what to do as their friend's trying to defend you, and there's this confusion in the moment, but they do not attack you and their turn is trying to keep their friend at bay. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: So that's both of their turns? 
MATT: Yeah, both of them on that side. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: This one back here, however, now aware of Fearne's presence, is going to... Is going to drop the crossbow on the ground where it was ready and pull out a longsword with two hands and is going to jump up onto the edge and come in a downward arc over towards you. 
LAURA: This is the dragonborn? 
MATT: Dragonborn, towards you. The first strike is going to be a 22 to hit. 
ASHLEY: Just hits. 
MATT: What's your armor? 
ASHLEY: It's 17, but I have the plus five from Orym. 
MATT: Got you. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: The second one is going to be a 19. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: That misses. This one is going to be-- 
LAURA: Armor class of 22 right now, that's awesome. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's pretty great. 
MATT: That is six points of slashing damage from downward strike. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: That's take-able. 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay. 
SAM: That's a take. 
LIAM: Which one is a take? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Dragonborn has now entered your fray. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to finish their go. Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: I pushed them back five feet. 
LAURA: I'm going to push them back another five feet, if I can. I'm hoping, because it's a little bit of an incline, it might make their feet a little unstable. 
MATT: They have to make an athletics check to keep try and keep themself on there. What's your spell DC? 
LAURA: 18. 
MATT: 18? You shove them back "(screams)" and they go sliding down. 
MARISHA: Hey! 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Then fall out of sight. You're not quite sure. You just hear a heavy impact. 
SAM: That was the monk who dashed up there? 
MATT: The monk, yeah. The monk... 
SAM: That was easy. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: Takes a little bit of damage there. 
LAURA: Do you want me to try to help get you down, Laudna? Or are you Spider Climbing? 
SAM: Girlfriend's getting-- 
MARISHA: I'm all right. I'm Spider Climbing. 
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to fly. 
TALIESIN: You don't look all right. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm okay. I'm all right. 
SAM: You never look all right. 
MARISHA: Exactly, it's my base. 
LAURA: I'm going to fly down. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Can I get to the window? 
MATT: Fly movement is 60? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, you can get to the window and inside, if you want. 
LAURA: What do I see through the window? What do I have access to? 
MATT: Immediately as you glance through the window, you see FCG right there. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: You see Chetney on the inside, his chest glowing a bright orange and steam rising up from the inside. Steam or smoke. 
LAURA: Oh gosh, can I get in? 
MATT: Yeah, you can get in, if you want. 
LAURA: I'm going to get in and try to get right here. 
MATT: You can get right in front of-- 
LAURA: FCG? 
MATT: -- if you want to. Right there. 
SAM: I can't see anything now! 
LAURA: Sorry. 
SAM: Oh wait, but your dress is a little bit see through. 
LAURA: Yeah, perfect. 
SAM: So I can see a little bit. 
LAURA: I'm going to line it up and try to Lightning Bolt through both of these people in front of me. 
MATT: Okay, the guy farther in there has three quarters cover behind that thing, so he gets a plus five to his dexterity saving throw. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But the person in front of you who, by the way, has to save against frightened from you, right? 
MARISHA: Right. 
LAURA: I'm doing it at 4th-level. 
MATT: 4th-level? 
LAURA: 4th-level Lightning Bolt. 
MATT: All righty, so the one in front of you-- 
SAM: Imogen, no, that's Chetney's friend! 
MATT: That is going to be a natural 19 on that person's end there. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: With a plus one, so that's 20 for the one in front of you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: The one in the back with plus five on top of that, that's going to put it at a 21. 
LAURA: Okay, great. 
MATT: They both succeed. 
LAURA: So they take half? 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: Okay, and then it would light anything flammable, so it would light that table on fire that the person is hiding behind. 
MATT: It would, yes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It would also, if you're doing it from here, it wouldn't quite hit that table, but it would hit the back end there. 
LAURA: That's a four. 
MATT: The table takes the brunt of it, but it still hits him on the side. "(groans)" 
LAURA: Seven, eight. 
SAM: Here we go. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
SAM: Here we go. 
TRAVIS: If I'm charming somebody-- 
SAM: No, this is good. 
TRAVIS: -- can I instruct them to attack? 
TALIESIN: You need an extra? 
SAM: Whoa, those are some good ones. 
MATT: You could ask him to like a friend, but he's not going to attack his friends. 
SAM: There's a couple good ones. 
LAURA: There's a couple good ones. No, it's actually really shit. 21. 
MATT: 21, okay, so both of them take 10 points of damage. 
LAURA: 21 on a 4th-level spell. (blows raspberry) 
SAM: Well, you know. 
MATT: It happens sometimes. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, maintain concentration over here. Yeah, easy enough. All right. You also see the flames crawl across the ground as the table itself is splintered and burning a little bit. Some of the wood in the chamber is burned. The back wall is burning a little bit, and you can see the glowing power cores piling up in corners as well. 
LAURA: Do I have any movement left? 60 feet? 
MATT: Let's see here. 60 feet would put you from here roughly to about 50, there. No, that's it right there. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: That finish your turn? 
LAURA: Yep. Can I duck behind the table? (laughs) Is that anything I can do? 
MATT: You have half cover. 
LAURA: Cover right now? 
MATT: Kind of, because there's a table right there from where you're standing. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But that's about as much as you can get. All right, so finishing your turn, it is now Dancer's go. 
MARISHA and SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Dancer comes forward-- 
TALIESIN: Run! 
MATT: -- hearing all of this. 
SAM: No! I told you to... Stay! Get-- 
MATT: "I'm not going to miss out on this!" Kicks the door open. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: Pushes through there. 
LAURA: It's all good. My bad. 
ASHLEY: Oof. That's the worst. 
LIAM: You all right? 
LAURA: It's okay. It was my chair. 
MATT: Dancer rushes in and looks over at you. How are you looking? 
TRAVIS: I'm fucked up. This is a bloody little gnome. 
MATT: Okay. Pussy II-- 
SAM: (raunchy laughs) 
MATT: -- darts in next to you on the table, the little metallic, headless, owl-looking creature, and lands on your shoulder right as Dancer gives a whistle sound, puts out her hand, and is going to Cure Wounds you through Pussy II. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Whoa. 
LIAM: Pussy's game strong. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh wow. 
MATT: Not a great roll. 
TALIESIN: There is so much that could be happening right now. 
TRAVIS: I knew it. 
MATT: You heal 14 hit points. 
TRAVIS: 14! 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I'll take it. 
SAM: That's a healthy Pussy. 
TRAVIS: Thank you, PS2 or whatever! (laughter) 
SAM: The graphics aren't very good. 
MATT: As Dancer kicks the door open, heals you, and then looks at the room, sees the flames and the Lightning Bolt subside and goes, "I'm going to wait outside." 
SAM: Yes! 
MATT: Going to use the last of her movement to step out over here. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's good. 
TRAVIS: Matt, because the frightened individual took two strikes against me, there was 1d8 from the Bloated Agony. 
MATT: That's right. 
TRAVIS: He takes eight points of agonizing damage. 
MATT: That's good to know. They're not looking great. All right, that brings us to the top of the round. Laudna, you're up first. 
LAURA: Each take one more point of damage, because I didn't count one of my dice. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: How do you want to do this? 
TRAVIS: Everybody else sure feels like a problem. 
MARISHA: Where did the monk go? 
MATT: You don't know. 
MARISHA: You saw them go that way? 
MATT: They got pushed back and then slid off the roof and fell out of sight. 
TRAVIS: Which means they're probably doing sneaky-ass monk shit. 
MARISHA: 100%. 
SAM: Or ran away. 
LAURA: Or they have a concussion and they're just laying there. 
MARISHA: Man, monks are so cool! I'm going to look through the grate, and I'm going to start firing some Eldritch Blasts. I think that's where I'm best used right now. Can I look through the grate and see this person that's harassing Chet? 
MATT: You can. Because you're through the grate, I'd say they have half cover, technically. 
MARISHA: I've got Spell Sniper. 
MATT: Then you're fine. You can see both of them over there. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to do one towards each. One is charmed, right? 
MATT: You don't know that. 
MARISHA: I don't know that. 
LAURA: That's why I attacked him. 
SAM: It's Spell Snipper, by the way. 
TRAVIS: That is the shittiest fucking joke! Wow! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MARISHA: Goddamn it. 
TRAVIS: That is 24 hours old. 
LIAM: Just jokes from the other day. 
TRAVIS: 24 hours old. 
MARISHA: Wow. What a callback. 
SAM: She didn't know the word "sniped," people. 
MARISHA: Did you have to say the inside part out loud? 
SAM: Otherwise, they're going to be-- 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ! 
TRAVIS: Southerners snip each other. Don't be snippy! 
MARISHA: Well, I'm going to snip at the two guys by Chet. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It was a different usage. 
MARISHA: Ew, one's a natural one, the other's 20. 
MATT: 20 hits. 
SAM: Oh! That's better. 
MARISHA: Yeah, pretty good. 
MATT: Which one was the 20 one? 
MARISHA: Which one looks more fucked up? 
MATT: Roll a d6 for me. One, two, three, four, five, six. We can choose that in advance. 
MARISHA: Six. 
MATT: Six, so it's that one, the one that is more fucked up. 
MARISHA: Jesus fucking Christ. Six damage. Weak. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Then I'm going to Quicken a spell to do it again. 
MATT: All righty, go for it. 
MARISHA: Same targets. That's better, a 19 and a 20. 
MATT: 19 and 20 both hit. 
SAM: Take these guys out! 
MARISHA: Let me make sure I'm actually adding the right damage here. That was actually seven damage. I added the wrong damage on that first one. 
MATT: Got it. That's okay. 
MARISHA: Then one to each of these, again. Where's my fucking d10? I'll use this. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Where's my fucking d10? ♪ 
MARISHA: Goddamn it. 
SAM: ♪ Where's my fuckin' ♪ 
MARISHA: Okay, so that's 12 for the far one, and then nine for the other. 
SAM: Ooh, that's great. 
MATT: Okay, that one's looking really rough. The one that you hit on the far end gets hit and shakes its head. "You! (grunts)" 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: And its charm's broken. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, and then I'm going to skitter this way with my movement. 
TALIESIN: Good call. I got to watch all this happen. 
MATT: 30 feet'll get you off the edge of the roof that way. 
MARISHA: But still up, right? 
MATT: Still up on the roof, yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm going to be-- I don't want to be visible from any lips. 
MATT: Right, understood. We'll say you're a little bit further from there, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go. 
TALIESIN: I got to watch you fuck somebody up; I'm very pleased. 
MARISHA: Oh, thanks. 
MATT: Half speed to get up. 
TRAVIS: (quiet footsteps) 
MATT: Going to-- 
LAURA: Slide down and (impact). Such a good visual. 
TALIESIN: I am leaning on the hammer, waiting. 
TRAVIS: You're doing the-- 
TALIESIN: Nah, I'm this. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MATT: Step of the Wind. 
LAURA: Ah, he's abandoning you. 
MATT: He's going to come through this way here. 
TALIESIN: That's okay. I got options. 
MATT: Through the door. Runs around after getting hit. Looks through the window, abandoning that roof area. Sees you immediately. 
SAM: Me?! 
MATT: "(growls)" Pulls back and is going to unleash a Flurry of Blows on you. 
TRAVIS: Through the window? 
MATT: Yep. 
TRAVIS: Drive-thru?! 
MATT: Now, you do have half cover. 
SAM: Nice breeze. Ah! 
MATT: You do have half. Well, the first hit. The first hit. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: Here we go. Strike against you. You have plus two to your AC because you have half cover through the window. 
SAM: Great. 
LAURA: How many rounds will General Ratanish-- 
MATT: That will be a 19 to hit. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: 10. 
LAURA: 10 rounds? 
SAM: That doesn't hit. 
TALIESIN: 10 rounds total. 
MATT: Doesn't hit? 
SAM: No. 
MATT: The first one goes and actually-- 
SAM: Because I have a plus two to my armor class or something? Yeah. 
MATT: First one goes (clanging)! "(pained grunt)" 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: "Shit." Goes and grabs the window and tries to do another double kick like it did to open the window originally, is going to try and double kick into you. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: That is going to be a 24. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: They rolled really well on that one. 
LAURA: Zoinks. 
MATT: That hits you for 10 points of bludgeoning damage. 
TRAVIS: Right in the muffin maker. 
MATT: I need you to make a strength saving throw for me. 
SAM: I am making muffins. 
TRAVIS: Come on, FCG. 
SAM: Strength saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Muffins, protein shakes, here we go. 
SAM: I get advantage. 
TRAVIS: Let's go, here we go. (clapping) 
SAM: Because she rolled a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Changebringer 'roid out. 
MATT: That's true. 
MARISHA: I did. 
SAM: 10 plus strength is 11. (laughter) 
MATT: You get pushed 10 feet away from the window, which puts them now inside the chamber as they finish kicking you both feet out and then on the inside of the building. Also, I need you to make a constitution saving throw to maintain your Banishment. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MARISHA: Roll high. Do you have War Caster? 
SAM: Constitution save. 14 plus four is 18. 
MATT: You maintain your Banishment. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: Woo! Woo hoo hoo hoo! 
MATT: With its last bit of movement, it closes in for its third and final strike against you. 
LAURA: Final strike. 
SAM: Oh, going to do more. Oh jesus. 
MATT: That is going to be a 16. No, it misses. 
SAM: No, it misses. 
MATT: Yeah. The last one misses. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, finishing its go. Fearne, you're up. 
TALIESIN: You both have-- 
MATT: You've been pushed out of the way. 
TALIESIN: -- your own problems. 
MATT: Orym's got your back here, but right as you get slash from overhead, there's the one stealthy one that's currently facing off with Orym, still keeping one eye on you, and the one that's above you with this longsword, double-handed, hacking down from on top of a platform. 
ASHLEY: All right, so Scorching Ray to the one with the longsword. 
MATT: Okay. Now, you are in melee with it, which means ranged attacks are at disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay! 
MATT: Which you can do, just to let you know, unless you want to try and move away and take an opportunity attack, but then you get the full brunt of your attack rolls. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I am going to cast Charm Person on him. 
MATT: Charm Person on him? 
ASHLEY: Yes. It's wisdom save of 18. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Boy, that's high. 
MATT: Okay, it has advantage on it because you're in combat with it, but it can try. What is the DC? 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MATT: 18. 
LIAM: Let's go, Fearne. 
MATT: Nope, that's a failure. 
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry) 
SAM: What happened? What'd you do? 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Charm Person. 
SAM: Oh, nice. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: You're very charming. 
TRAVIS: Remember, I don't think they can attack other friends. 
ASHLEY: They cannot. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Well, they consider you a friend. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But you cannot tell it to attack its allies. It just considers you a friend now. Immediately, as you finish the spell, it goes like, "I'm sorry," spits on the ground. "I did not realize." 
ASHLEY: It's really okay. Give me your crossbow. 
MATT: "Under attack-- It's on the ground." Then points over to it behind where it was. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go get the crossbow. 
MATT: Okay, so you move around to where? 
ASHLEY: And start making my way to the front door. 
SAM: ♪ Makin' my way ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Startin' my way ♪ 
MATT: The back door? 
ASHLEY: The back door, sorry. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: ♪ Downtown ♪ 
MATT: 25, 30. 
ASHLEY: Is there anything to load up the crossbow? Just get it ready? 
MATT: It's already loaded. It was loaded to go and he dropped it on the ground before it pulled its sword out to come after you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So now-- okay. 
ASHLEY: How close am I to the back door? Can I make it there? 
MATT: You're about 15 feet from it. 
ASHLEY: With a 35 feet walking speed? 
MATT: Oh, 35 feet, so you're five feet closer, so you're 10 feet from the door. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
SAM: I wish Kimothée Chalamet were here. 
MARISHA: I know, I was just thinking that. 
TALIESIN: We can keep fucking with these people for a minute. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TRAVIS: We didn't bring the fucking Voice of the Tempest with us? 
LAURA: I guess it's good that we didn't split the party, though, because this might have-- 
TALIESIN: This would've gone real poorly. 
LAURA: Thanks, Keyleth. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Boy, oh boy, oh boy. 
TRAVIS: Thanks, Keyleth. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TRAVIS: Echoes of a decade ago. 
MARISHA: Never gets old. 
TRAVIS: Never does. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to have Mister-- 
MARISHA: Always relevant. 
TRAVIS: Better times. 
ASHLEY: -- shoot some flame seeds at-- 
MATT: Mister can move as well, too, if you want. 
ASHLEY: Mister can move as well, okay. Gosh, I wonder where I should-- 
MATT: Mister is in melee action. Mister will take an opportunity attack if it wants to from the dagger. 
ASHLEY: I will have Mister shoot a flame seed at the one attacking Orym. 
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll. It is a ranged attack in melee range, so it's with a disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Eugh. Okay. 
MATT: That's the problem with being up close with ranged attacks. 
ASHLEY: I don't want to do that. Shoot! 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Um-m-m-m-m-m-m. Oh man, I wonder if I should just go in there. 
TRAVIS: ♪ M-m-m my Sharona ♪ 
ASHLEY: ♪ M-m-m-m my Sharona ♪ Okay, all right, I'll just do it, I'll just do it, I'll just do it. 
MATT: Do it. So roll twice, take the lower. 
TRAVIS: ♪ My, my, my, my ♪ 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: ♪ Woo! ♪ 
TALIESIN: ♪ ("My Sharona" bass line) ♪ 
ASHLEY: 13. 
MATT: 13 misses, unfortunately. The roguish one ducks out of the way and looks at the strange flaming monkey and is like, "What the hell?" 
ASHLEY: All right, Mister, I'll: (smooches) Come here. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Have him start coming around this way. 
MATT: Will take an attack of opportunity on Mister. 
ASHLEY: That's okay. 
MATT: That's going to be a 19. 
ASHLEY: Yar. 
TALIESIN: Yar. 
MATT: All righty. Mister takes seven points of piercing damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That finish your turn? 
ASHLEY: Yes, it does. 
MATT: Okay, it is now that figure's turn. 
TRAVIS: Do you have to see me to heal? 
MATT: It's going to-- 
SAM: ♪ See me ♪ 
MATT: -- shift around this way to fill the space behind you-- 
SAM: ♪ Heal me ♪ 
MATT: -- in between where the other guy is. 
MARISHA: So unhelpful in the moment. 
SAM: I do. 
MATT: And is going to-- 
LIAM: Came around Orym? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah, came around to the other side of you, moving around carefully, feints to one side and as you go to defend with the shield, all of a sudden, it's on the other side of you quickly. 
LIAM: Pretty good, pretty good. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, you going to be okay? 
LIAM: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Make an athletics check for me. Actually, let me double check this, this way. This would be, hold on. Before you roll. 
TALIESIN: You know you can scream. 
MATT: It's a little bit with these things. 
TRAVIS: Choices that cascade. It's the worst. 
TALIESIN: I have a dumb plan that may or may not work. 
TRAVIS: I love those. 
TALIESIN: I really want it to. I actually should probably look at the battlefield to make sure it can work so I'm not-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's negligible. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, so it's athletics. 
TRAVIS: Exciting either way. 
MATT: Or acrobatics, your choice. 
LIAM: I'll take the acrobatics for 18. 
MATT: 18. Natural fucking 20. 
LAURA: (groans) 
LAURA: So many natural 20s tonight, Matthew. 
LIAM: I believe it. 
TRAVIS: Ew. 
LAURA: Ew, Matthew. 
TALIESIN: Where's FCG? FCG's there. 
TRAVIS: Da-vid! 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
SAM: Well, okay. 
MATT: Kick you back. Just full on (kicking blow) right to the chest, sliding you backward. Second strike, they're going to pull up a dagger. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: And-- (dagger swishing through air) 
TRAVIS: Good sound, shit. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: (diminished swishing) 
MATT: It goes over your head. (whooshes) 
MARISHA: Wait, try one more. 
MATT: Tink. 
MARISHA: Oh god. Aw jeez. 
LAURA: What? What? 
MATT: Into the machine behind you. 
LIAM: She's trying to blow up the machine. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: As it hits-- 
LIAM: She's doing exactly what I was going to do to her. 
MATT: (vrooming) Let's see how much damage it deals. 
TRAVIS: No! 
MARISHA: Did she get him good, good, good? 
LIAM: Trying to blow me up. 
MATT: That's going to-- 
TRAVIS: Blowing up the crawler. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: It's nine points damage. It's now, the core is, (vibrating) it's unstable. She's going to make one more attack with another dagger. 
TRAVIS: Bait and Switch her! 
MATT: (grunts, whooshes) Is going to throw another one. 
TRAVIS: Miss. 
MATT: Natural one. (cheering) 
MATT: Fuck. Fuck! 
LAURA: (cackles) 
TRAVIS: (tongue waggling) 
MATT: Hit the spectrum on that, natural 20 to one. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MATT: Fuck. 
TALIESIN: Threw the dagger, did the thump, hits with the handle. 
TRAVIS: They both turned back, and they're like-- 
MATT: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
SAM: It blows up anyway! 
MATT: Seeing that circumstance, goes "(sighs)" and is going to run. 
LIAM: Dang it. 
MATT: And bonus action dash. 
LIAM: Son of a fuck! 
SAM: As in escape or back in the front? 
MATT: As in right up against the back of-- Fearne, as you're running up with the crossbow, you hear-- 
LIAM: Damn it. 
MATT: (footsteps) Looking over your shoulder and you see the figure, rapier out, rushing towards you again. Chetney, you're up. 
TRAVIS: They're fucking smart. 
LAURA: These guys are smart. 
TRAVIS: Chet is going to look at being surrounded by three enemies now and is going to break into his best Magic Mike strip routine and he's going to start grinding on the table. 
LAURA: Take it off, Chet! 
TRAVIS: (growling) Just slowly turning into a werewolf as he does his best Channing Tatum on the table. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Chetney Tatum. 
LAURA, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: Chetney Tatum! 
TRAVIS: Chetney Tatum. 
MATT: As you do this, as you start growling and roaring, the three surrounding figures are like (yelling). 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Tip big. I'll swing with the Graz'tchar, the Luminary Blade. First one at the frightened individual. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: All right. 
SAM: (Graz'tchar) Yes, my furry friend, we will be heroes! 
TRAVIS: 20, 20. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: 28 to hit. 
MARISHA: God, I hate him. 
MATT: Yes, that definitely hits. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: Never thought I'd miss Craven Edge so much. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
TRAVIS: 18 plus eight is 26 points, 18 of which is radiant damage. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Yeah. How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
TRAVIS: (growls) (sword swooshing) His head just (clunks). Just comes off. 
MARISHA: Oh fuck! 
MATT: (slumps) 
MATT: Just crumples to the ground. 
MARISHA: Brutal. 
MATT: The two others are like, "(yelling)" 
TRAVIS: I look-- 
SAM: It's a wolf with a sword! 
TRAVIS: I swipe, I look over my left shoulder and I'm like: (deeply) There's room for two. (whooshes) I'll take the second shot at the monk behind me. 
MATT: The monk is actually 10 feet from you. You can try and move. 
TRAVIS: I will. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: All right, so you move down to where the space is by. 
TRAVIS: I know, I'll take a-- 
MATT: You do get an opportunity attack as the one that's like (panicking). Sees you moving away. (grunts) Does a side strike over to try and get to you. That is going to be 20 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that hits. 
MATT: All righty. That is going to be eight points of slashing damage reduced to four because of your form. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. I rolled a 23 on the second strike. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: All right, and that is. Yes, 11, 17. 19 plus eight, 27. It's 27 points of damage, 19 of which is radiant damage and he has to make a charisma saving throw. 
MATT: Indeed. That is going to be 17. 
TRAVIS: That is it. 17. 
MATT: That's the target. 
TRAVIS: Cool. Damn it! Cool, and with that, I'm going to-- I was hoping he would be chopped. I'll stay in his melee and move back into the corner. 
MATT: Back into the corner, okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, and flank up on him with basically everybody else. 
MATT: All right, so the corner is this massive pile of cores and discarded cables and materials and you curl up into it. 
TRAVIS: Hunch down. 
MATT: You can feel the slight vibration into your feet. 
TRAVIS: (growls) Oh, because it's coils and machinery and shit? 
MATT: There's arcane cores and-- 
TRAVIS: And just I post up over there, does that suit of armor on that thing look like it has a very obvious 'on' button? Anything on the side over there? Or does it look like it's not even fully built and complete? Is it patchwork? 
MATT: Quick glance, it looks like it's partially open and in the process of being repaired. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
MATT: A long way from completion. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
MATT: You can always fuck with it, if you want to, but. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Chetney? 
TRAVIS: Yes, it does, thanks. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Sorry, we're watching YouTube over here. 
LIAM: It's our show now. We're just looking at memes on our phones. 
ASHLEY: It's a cute dog with a sword. 
SAM: It's a dog with a sword in his mouth. 
ASHLEY: I love him. 
MARISHA: It's this border collie that's obsessed with a sword. That's great. 
TALIESIN: Stop it. 
ASHLEY: He's so proud of his sword. 
LIAM: This'll be really good for the podcast, specifically. 
TRAVIS: Jeez, that's it? Oh, he is cute. 
MATT: FCG, you're up. 
SAM: Oh no, me? Oh no. 
TALIESIN: Did I-- (confused mumbling) 
LAURA: You're after FCG. 
TALIESIN: I'm after FCG. Okay, yeah, that's what I thought, okay. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: So there's a monk next to me. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: There's another guy next to Chet. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Boy oh boy. 
LAURA: Do you get all new hit points when you're a werewolf? 
TRAVIS: No. But my-- some damage is halved, which is what I should've done in the beginning, but I forgot, using a bonus action. 
SAM: I could, hmm. Hmm. I want to heal Chet, but-- (laughter) 
LAURA: I get it. 
TRAVIS: Just talk it through. 
LAURA: I'm not even going to give you shit about it. 
TRAVIS: Talk out your process. 
SAM: I am going to heal Chet, just not a lot. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Just waste that moment. 
MARISHA: Little bonus action Healing Word. 
SAM: I'm going to do a bonus action Healing Word, but I'm going to do it at-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ Sail away ♪ 
SAM: -- 3rd-level. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: 3d4 plus your wisdom. 
SAM: So that's three. Seven. 10 plus-- 
LAURA: Nice! 
SAM: -- three is 13. 
TRAVIS: 13, that's massive! 
MATT: There you go. 
TRAVIS: Thank you, FCG! (deeply) Thank you. 
LAURA: You're almost as good as that little headless bird. (laughter) 
SAM: I was replaced so easily. Then, with my action, I will use my saw blade and I'm going to try to hit the monk. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh wait, he probably has a super high AC. I'm going to go for the-- 
TRAVIS: You get advantage because we're flanking. 
SAM: Then I will hit the monk. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: I think. I didn't mean to-- 
MATT: Yeah, you would technically be-- Well. Yeah, I'll allow it. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Go for it. 
SAM: I can move into posish. 
MATT: She's where you would need to be. 
SAM: Well then, I'll hit the guard who's right in front of me. 
MATT: The guard over here? 
SAM: You know what? I'll hit the monk and I'm going to give myself advantage because I can do that once a day with my Changebringer coin. 
MATT: That's true. 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Ooh! 
SAM: So I'll flip the coin, figure out who I'm going to attack. Oh, it's monk. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so roll with advantage to hit. 
SAM: 12 plus. Oh, it's not going to be enough, he's a monk. 17. 
MATT: That hits. (cheering) (clapping) 
SAM: It's not very much damage, but okay, it's a one plus one is two, but I think I get Divine S-- divine something. What's it called? 
MATT: Yep, it's an additional 1d8, I think it is. 
SAM: That's another three, making it five, but I also get to pump in all my temporary hit points. 
MATT: That's true. 
SAM: Which is another nine, so that's 14 total points. 
MATT: 14. 
TRAVIS: That's right! 
SAM: I don't get hit by nine points of damage. 
MATT: Oh, that monk is looking rough. 
ASHLEY: Howdy Doody. 
TRAVIS: (excited hooting) 
MATT: (whirring) "(pained yell)" Pulls the saw away and this big old bloody gash in the middle of its chest. Falls on one knee. "(panting)" You see it cracking its knuckles. It's looking back towards the window. 
SAM: You're not going nowhere. 
TRAVIS: Slobber coming out of my mouth. 
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn? 
SAM: I think so. If I move any, well, if I move, will I do, am I within melee of things? 
MATT: Of the monk, that's it, though. 
SAM: Okay then, I won't move. 
MATT: Okay, stay put, all righty. 
LAURA: It's probably better that we're all clumped up right here. When the caster's going to go. No, it's actually bad. 
MATT: Behind the table. Darts up over the side. As a bonus action, you take another. 
ASHLEY: That's really good. 
MATT: Ooh! 11 points of fire damage. 
SAM: Ouch. 
TRAVIS: Oh, but when I could-- 
MARISHA: You still. 
TRAVIS: Usually my shit falls off when I transform, though. What do you think? 
MATT: No, no, the armor stays there when you transform, you just get larger in it. 
TRAVIS: 11 points of fire. 
LAURA: I've always pictured you naked, Chet. 
MATT: 11 points of fire damage as the armor is still (sizzling) burning into you. 
TRAVIS: Take it off, lower my AC. 
LIAM: Anyone smell burning dog hair? 
MARISHA: This caster? 
TRAVIS: The caster down here. 
SAM: It's Chetney! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: So it's a bonus action. As an action-- 
LIAM: What is that big spider? 
MATT: -- they're going to-- 
LAURA: Where's the big spider? 
LIAM: Is it modern art? 
LAURA: What thing? 
LIAM: To the left of the man behind the table. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: 4th-level Erupting Earth. 
LIAM: Is it like corporate art? 
LAURA: Oh. I don't know. 
TRAVIS: Erupting Earth. 
SAM: Can't do that though, we're not on Earth. We're on Exandria. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Which is round! 
MATT: 20-foot cube. You see them looking over at the monk and the rest of you and goes-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: (whooshes) And raises a fist. The monk goes, "What? No!" The entirety of the rock ground beneath here (rock exploding) punches up through the wood floor. 
SAM: Earth punch. 
MATT: As pillars of jagged rock starts blasting upward. It's going to hit FCG, Imogen, and you, as well as the monk. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Say my name. 
LAURA: (tune of "Orinoco Flow") ♪ Say my name ♪ 
MATT: Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
LAURA: ♪ Say my name ♪ (laughter) 
SAM: Kimothée Chalamet. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Chetney Chalamet. 
LAURA: Do we roll a dex? 
MATT: This will be a dexterity saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm ready. 
LAURA: If I'm texnically. 
LIAM and SAM: Texnically. 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Texnically. 
LAURA: Technically, I'm still hovering because I never dropped my Fly. 
MATT: It's 20-foot cube. It hits everything in that space. 
LAURA: All right, I'm just saying. 
LIAM: Texasly. 
LAURA: I'm hovering while I'm also dodging. 
MATT: I understand. 
TRAVIS: It's about as good as it can go. 
SAM: I rolled a natural 20. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: Nice! 
SAM: For a total of 20. 
MATT: Great, so you take half damage on that, let's see. So you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
LIAM: Nope. 
SAM: I think I have to roll. 
MATT: You do. 
SAM: Okay, to maintain my thing. 
TALIESIN: Do you have-- 
SAM: 12? 
MARISHA: Plus, plus. 
LAURA: (shouts) Plus plus, plus? Plus anything? 
SAM: No, that's it. 
LAURA: You don't have a con save? 
SAM: I mean, that was eight plus four. 
TALIESIN: Then do you have advantage or no? 
SAM: I don't. 
MARISHA: Well, but it's half. The damage is halved. So, wait, how much damage? 
MATT: No, I gave you half. It was 28 originally. 
MARISHA: But for War Caster, he has to-- 
SAM: I don't have War Caster. 
MARISHA: I mean, sorry, for-- 
MATT: You're right. It's half the damage of what it was. 
MARISHA: Half the damage of what you take? 
SAM: I have to beat seven. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
MATT: So yes. Or, 10 is the minimum, so yeah. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: So I do! I do save. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
SAM: Thank you, Rules Lawyer. 
ASHLEY: Sheesh. 
MATT: That's a valid point there. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
MARISHA: It's fine. 
LAURA: That heart rate just counted towards exercise fully. I just reached my goals because of that. (laughter) 
MATT: Imogen? 
LAURA: What? Oh. 16. 
TRAVIS: Don't yell. 
MATT: 16. 
LIAM: Imógen. 
MATT: All right, you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Natural 20, or natural 19 for 25. 
MATT: Dang! 
MARISHA: Whoa! 
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to seven. 
MARISHA: (groans) 
TRAVIS: Seven, wow. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Wow, wow, wow. 
MATT: They're going to, seeing the scenario, back up. 
LAURA: Fuck! 
MATT: Then kick this table over here. They're now pushing into where these two other figures-- the other figure and Joe are in the corner, and holding them back. All right. 
TRAVIS: Boy. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: That brings us to Ashton, with Orym on deck. 
TALIESIN: That monk ain't coming. Actually, I've been up here long enough. I heard all that. 
MATT: That monk, by the way, is splattered. (groaning) 
LAURA: Hey! 
TALIESIN: Monk's dead? Is there-- 
MATT: Well, you don't know. (laughs) You just hear (impacts). You do see part of the roof bend up slightly as bits and shards of rock-- 
TRAVIS: Leaves in imprint of the monk in the roof. 
MATT: (laughs) Yeah. Ping! 
TALIESIN: So I'm looking through the grate. Do I see anybody fucking around in there? Nothing at all? 
MATT: Glancing through the grate, yeah, you see that there's a bunch of, and that's all difficult terrain, by the way, in this whole area now. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: You see shards of rock and earth jammed in the air. You see your friends dodge most of it, and are in the process of pulling out of the rubble. 
TALIESIN: But they got no problems in that immediate vicinity? 
MATT: Other than this one guy here. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) "Problems." 
TALIESIN: How bad does he look? 
MATT: He looks like he's taken a hit or two. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: (deeply) ♪ Now we got problems ♪ 
TRAVIS: (deeply) ♪ And now we can't solve 'em ♪ 
TALIESIN: What can I see of what's going on over here? (laughter) 
MATT: Over here, you see off the edge here, there's one guy here-- 
MARISHA: Chetney's version. 
MATT: -- down here in the backyard, you see Fearne, who's currently being approached from behind by that stealthy figure that's holding a rapier and he's darting towards her. 
TALIESIN: (groans) How far away are they? 
MATT: They're down off the roof. Probably a good, I mean, if you want to try and slide off the roof, you can make a little more movement, but you have to-- 
TRAVIS: Come on! 
MATT: -- make an acrobatics check to land properly. 
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah. 
LAURA: Oh my god, that would be so cool. 
MATT: Make an acrobatics check for me. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Peer pressure. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: That's 21. 
LAURA: Be cool, be cool! 
MATT: So you leap off the side and catch the edge, slide off the pitched roof and can land, with that high enough roll, hitting the ground. The ground cracks under your earthkin weight as you smack into the ground and you stand upright. 
TRAVIS: Got your slide, your video game stride. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going to say, how close to that fucker can I get? 
MATT: Oh, right next to them. 
TALIESIN: Can I get it to a point of flanking or no? 
MATT: No, unfortunately, because Mister is there. 
TALIESIN: You went to 40 feet speed? Oh. 
LAURA: Mister. 
MATT: Sorry. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it, Mister. All right, that's fine. I take a look up, and go: Don't blame me, the other guy bailed. I'm going to come right fucking down with and use a, yeah, I'm rolling a damage, fuck it. 
LAURA: (laughs) And use a, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that thing. Hey! Oh, natural 20. 
ALL: Hey! (cheering) 
TALIESIN: Let's have some fun. Okay. 
TRAVIS: That was the calmest natural 20. 
MATT: That's going to be nasty. Oh! 
SAM, TRAVIS and MATT: Oh, natural 20. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't think I've hit one of these in a while. So that's-- 
LAURA: Funnily  enough, I rolled a natural 20. 
TALIESIN: That's 2d6 with a Crusher, so that's going to be that. Pass Without a Tra-- No. Let's see, where's the other ones? Critical hit. "All attack rolls against the creature are made with advantage." Oh, that's right. Also, all attacks against him now until the end of my next turn are-- 
MARISHA: Taliesin reads rules. The show. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. Also, he's dead. 
TALIESIN: Double advantage. I have advantage. 
MATT: Great, okay. 
TALIESIN: Sorry, I'm trying to catch up, I swear to god. 
MATT: That's okay. 
TRAVIS: It's your character. 
MATT: So roll damage with your Brutal Critical. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so that's three dice. I'm just making sure I'm doing this right. 
TRAVIS: Three extra damage dice? 
TALIESIN: No, I'm trying to find, where is it? Sorry, I'm catching up. This is actually, I think, my first critical, so. 
MATT: You've done it before. 
TALIESIN: It's been very few. 
MATT: It's been a bit. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, sorry. Where's my--? I can go to mine. 
MATT: So yeah, so you have one extra d6 you get to add to that. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I get three 3d6. 
SAM: Come on, Taliesin! 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: Bash his head in! 
TALIESIN: That, okay. Come on. That's cocked. That's even worse. That's okay. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. 10 is 20, 32 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Yo! (cheering) 
LAURA: Ow! 
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take another swing at this fucker. 
MATT: Go for it. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
TRAVIS: There you go! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: There you go, Fearnie. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) I don't do that. 
MATT: You don't get it. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
SAM: But it's fun. 
ASHLEY: I was just-- 
MATT: It's just fun to throw in there. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to throw it out every time. 
TALIESIN: Another natural 20. (cheering) 
MATT: Jesus Christ. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: What? 
LIAM: Hey, Crusher! 
MATT: My god. 
TRAVIS: There we go. 
SAM: Good Guidance. 
TALIESIN: That worked. Yeah, thank you for that. 
ASHLEY: It was because of me. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Two d20s. 
ASHLEY: Guided him to 20. 
TALIESIN: That's a terrible roll, so that's good. 
TRAVIS: Come on, Taliesin! 
LAURA: God! 
SAM: Jesus! 
LAURA: Play better! 
TRAVIS: Pull your weight. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to do math. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: We're all working hard over here. 
TALIESIN: 28, and then I also push them five feet away from Fearne. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (thuds) 
MATT: (impacts) You push them backwards a little bit. Still in melee with Fearne, pushing five feet away from where you are. It still keeps you at an angle. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: But it's definitely going to push back a bit. Both hits are (heavy impact) "(groans)" they pull back their rapier up and try and get a counter attack and your second one hits him in the rib cage, sending them back against the wall and they land crumpled down onto both knees for a second. For a minute, they're just not home before they-- 
TALIESIN: Put that stupid stick down. 
TRAVIS: Woo hoo hoo! 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: They're not looking good. 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: They went from no damage to not looking good. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: That's great. 
TALIESIN: Just a hollow where my eyes should be. It goes straight through to the other side. 
TRAVIS: Great turn. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
TALIESIN: That's everything I got. 
MATT: Hell yeah. Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: Okay, so the slippery enemy ran. I'm looking up at the muscle bound one standing on that rock. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: So I just look at them for a second, spin my blade and then do a Six-Fingered Man and turn around and run the opposite direction. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yay! 
LIAM: I run for the other crawler and leap into the-- 
MATT: Over here? 
LIAM: -- cockpit, yep. Come on, Imahara. I believe in you. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: (revving) 
MATT: Okay, now knowing that these are partially damaged, I would like you to make an investigation check. 
LIAM: Sure. 
MATT: To try and discern how to get it running in its partially repaired state. 
LAURA: Oh. (laughs) 
LIAM: It's three. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: It's three. 
MATT: Three? 
LIAM: A total of three. 
MATT: You get inside the cockpit, land in and the handle panel is just missing. 
TRAVIS: The handle panel. 
MATT: The handle panel. 
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Handle panel. 
MATT: The grip, the wires are there. 
LAURA: The paypea panel is just missing. 
MATT: You're like, "Ugh." You can-- 
MARISHA: Pah-hah paypea. 
LIAM: Cool. So is that investigation check my action? 
MATT: No. This is just you glancing into it. 
LIAM: So bonus action, I thrust out the blade, Grasping Vine, and yank this motherfucker to me. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
LAURA: Nice! 
MARISHA: We're the worst. 
MATT: That is going to be a 12 on the dexterity save. 
LIAM: Fails. Oops. 
MATT: He's up there watching Fearne run by and goes, "Oh, you're still a bad guy?" 
SAM: Forever. 
MATT: "I got you." Gets yanked. 
LIAM: Then I'm going to run around all those spikes coming out of the front of it and loop around this way, Matt, watch my finger, to lasso him to it and back away. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MARISHA: Such a good man. 
LIAM: I should have another 15 feet, so he's tight and I'm back. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Awesome. 
TALIESIN: You're going to do it? 
LIAM: I want to go my full distance back, if I can, to the corner of the house, as close as you'll let me get to it. 
MATT: Right, understood. 
MARISHA: Testimonial from Jameson. 
LIAM: If that's as close as it'll be, that's fine. 
MATT: 25, 30. That's your movement there, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. That gets you right there. 
LIAM: Cool. Then I just spin the blade, slash it, and then do air strike, air strike, against the other bike. 
MATT: Woo, okay. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
MATT: He's going to attempt to make an attack of opportunity against you as you move past, even though he is bound to it. He does have disadvantage, because you technically with that have him-- 
LIAM: Yar. 
MATT: -- grappled there. No, that's going to be a 12. 
LIAM: I roll backward out of the way, pop up. 
MATT: Do it, two strikes. 
LIAM: Natural one. I will reroll. I'm attacking a bike. Second's a natural 20. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "I'm attacking a bike!" 
MARISHA: Next one's a natural 20. 
MATT: Natural 20. Crit, crit, crit. 
LIAM: From a one to a 20. 
MATT: You get a crit! And you get a crit. 
TALIESIN: Yes! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Fuck yes. 
LIAM: Great. So-- 
TALIESIN: Oh man. 
LIAM: Let's for maximum damage, sorry, I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: (sighs) I am going to do, it's so dumb, a tripping attack on the bike. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
MATT: You're aiming for the cables that hold the legs in there in place? 
LIAM: Yeah, so that it falls down and then just blows up in the air. 
TRAVIS: We are living! 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: But it's also more damage. That's why I really-- 
MATT: I mean, yeah. Yeah, go for it. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Can you also steal the bike's lunch money? (laughter) 
LIAM: If Matt will let me, I will. (laughter) 
SAM: Fuck you, bike. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: 11, 18 for the first, and for the second, four, eight, eight and six, 14 for the second. 18 and 14 total. 
MATT: (slashing) These large wind blades carve out from the weapon. As it strikes the first one, it hits where the legs attach, where the metallic ligaments and cables hold them in place. The leg crumples and the whole thing tips over to the side. As it does, the arcane core dislodges and rolls over towards the base of the other one. (slashes) The second strike slams into the side as the guy's bound. He's like, "(grunts)." Looks down at it as it rolls. The blade hits. (impact) (crackling) (high-pitched whine) (explosion) 
LAURA: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
MATT: Detonates in a 10-foot radius explosion that is centered in that area. You are just outside of the 10-foot radius of where it detonates. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage for me. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Do-- 
TRAVIS: Crawler already explode, too? 
MATT: Wait, what is the damage? 
TALIESIN: No, that's the only one. 
MARISHA: I don't think so. 
SAM: It wasn't even turned on. 
MATT: 12d6 for me. 
TRAVIS: The second one? 
SAM: It wasn't turned on. 
LIAM: 12d6? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: I had a Plan A and a Plan B. Okay. 
SAM: They both involved destroying vehicles. 
LIAM: 12d6, you say? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. Six, nine, 11. 12, 13, 18. 
TRAVIS: Does that cause the other one to detonate? 
LIAM: Three, 29, 34. 
LAURA: Sheesh! 
LIAM: 35, 36, 37, 38. 
SAM: Oh, by the way, those were cores for a nuclear reactor. 
MATT: 38 points of damage to that one. 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
TRAVIS: It's been an honor playing with you. 
TALIESIN: Too real. 
MATT: As it detonates, the metal shredded outward and exploded from the inside the rest of the shell of that crawler, which is now wrecked in this pile of twisted iron. Go ahead and roll a-- 
MARISHA: Can you still fix our thing? 
MATT: Roll a d20 for me. Let me know if you get above 11 or higher. 
LIAM: It's 13. 
MATT: 13. As the smoke and the arcane blast of energy subsides, the guy who's held to it, is still standing there like, "Ugh." He looks over at you and snaps his way out of the tether of the vine that you left there. Right as you hear a second (high-pitched whine). He looks back at the arcane core in the skirmisher left behind. He goes-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yes. 
MATT: "No--!" (explosion) (laughter) 
MATT: Roll another 12d6 for me. (cheering) (laughter) 
MATT: This one he does get a save against. 
LIAM: Okay, nine, 13. 
MATT: With an eight, is not going to succeed. 
LIAM: 16, 17, 18. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
SAM: Wow, this is big. 
LIAM: 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. Almost the same. 
MATT: 31? You put your shield up just in time to keep most of the dragonborn spatter from getting on you. 
SAM: Ugh! 
LAURA: Oh gosh. 
LIAM: Just this high, so (splatter). 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: We can never come back to Bassuras after this. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It's Bassuras. We're fine. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "We're fine." 
TALIESIN: I feel like this happens all the time. 
MATT: There's just these two smoldering, small craters in the back here. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: Great. Does that finish your turn? 
LIAM: I think I'm out of gasoline, yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That was a lot of gas. 
ASHLEY: That was a good turn. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: You don't have any movement yet left. 
MATT: Finishing that. 
LIAM: Oh, I definitely did going, "Woo woo!" 
SAM: Somewhere, an old lady's like, "Welp, yeah, another. Another explosion." 
MATT: Jump up onto the table there. 
SAM: "Every hour, on the hour." 
MATT: Still spooked by you, but sees you as an easy target that's also blasted lightning through here. It's going to attempt to strike you twice. 
SAM: No. 
MATT: That's going to be a 21 to hit. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: That's going to be a 16. 
LAURA: Pshew. Did you just burp-- 
LIAM: Burped. 
LAURA: -- right as he attacked me? 
LIAM: Yeah, that's the feel of Bassuras. 
MATT: 16. 
TALIESIN: Burp-o-Vision. 
LIAM: Its burn. The diesel from the vehicle. 
LAURA: Yeah, my armor class is 13 and I did not put Mage Armor up. 
MATT: You didn't, yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, did I put it up at the beginning of the--? It's fine. 
MATT: I think you might've put it on when you arrived in Bassuras. 
LAURA: I might have. 
TALIESIN: I feel like it. That's okay. 
LAURA: It wouldn't have put me-- I think it would only put me to 16. 
MATT: Okay, got it. So no worries. The two strikes against you do 10 points of slashing damage. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: Then five points of slashing damage. 
LIAM: (nervous hum) 
LAURA: (nervous noises) 
LIAM: (nervous hum) 
ASHLEY: Oof! 
MATT: Then it's going to jump back. 
ASHLEY: Oof! 
MARISHA: That's a lot of noises-- 
MATT: You can do an opportunity attack, if you want to. 
MARISHA: -- from that side of the table. 
LAURA: I mean, what can I just-- 
ASHLEY: There's a lot going on. 
LAURA: Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap. (laughs) 
MATT: It's going to back up and pull the door to give it half cover against the side of the wall there. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: Where did it go? 
SAM: Behind the door. 
MATT: It slashed you and then leaped backward and pulled itself behind the door to give it half cover. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right, that finishes its go. Imogen, you're up. 
SAM: Boy. This is an intense one. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: At least we don't have Ratanish back. 
LIAM: Yeah, Ratanish is still in the negative zone. 
LAURA: In the banished-- 
SAM: Yeah, for another seven or eight rounds. 
LAURA: Help, help! 
SAM: Unless I get-- 
LAURA: Help me! 
SAM: -- hit. 
LAURA: Help! Help me. Okay, I'm going to-- 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: I believe she wants some help. 
SAM: I don't speak Marquesian. (laughter) 
LAURA: How high are the ceilings? 
MATT: Up in here? 
LAURA: Up in here. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Up in here ♪ 
MATT: ♪ Up in here ♪ 
TRAVIS: Stupid. 
MATT: About-- (laughter) 
SAM: I actually do speak Marquesian. 
MATT: About 20 or so feet, but there are many racks that go through and across. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: That have chains hanging from them, and, you know, sliding hooks and things that can be used for, you know, holding chassis and other pieces of materials being worked on. There's a little five-foot rafter period above those. So I guess 25 total, but it's 20 until you hit those bits. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay, I'm going to cast Telekinesis. Kyle. 
SAM: Kyle. 
MARISHA: Beat me to it. 
LAURA: I'm going to lift up the table that's on fire, the big, rectangular table. 
MATT: Right here? 
LAURA: As fast as I can, slam it into the wall and smash this guy into the wall 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MATT: (laughs) Nice! Awesome. 
SAM: "My store!" 
TRAVIS: He opens the door. "Ha ha, get through that. (screams)" 
MATT: (laughs) All righty. All right, I'm going to give him a dexterity saving throw. He gets, with half cover, plus two bonus to try and pull the door in front of the way of him. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: That is going to be a 15, which I think fails your spell DC. Go ahead and roll 3d8 bludgeoning damage. 
SAM: Nice! 
MATT: As the table shatters-- 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: Against him and the wall. 
LAURA: Would it've done any fire damage, too, since it was on fire? 
MATT: You know what? Yeah. I'll add an additional d6 fire damage. 
LAURA: Sweet. That's 12 plus five is 17 of bludgeoning. 
MATT: Great. 
LIAM: ♪ How high's the fire, Mama? ♪ 
MATT: And an additional five for fire. 
MATT: Gotcha. So 22 damage total. 
LIAM: ♪ Four feet high and rising ♪ 
MATT: The table splinters into shards of ash and flame and bits of broken wood as it explodes. The figure, "(groans)" pulls back. It's looking pretty hurt and looking around. It's a bit panicked. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: Caster bitch in the corner, though. 
MARISHA: I know. 
LAURA: I know. 
TRAVIS: You bitch. 
MARISHA: I'm going to try to go for him. 
LAURA: I'm going to move. Oh, I want to stay by FCG. You have to touch me in order to heal. You're not going to heal me, are you? Are you going to heal me? 
SAM: You don't know. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: You don't know. 
LAURA: I just don't want General Ratanish to come back and me be standing right here. I'm going to flip. I'm not floating anymore. I'm walking because I cast Telekinesis. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I'm going to hop over the little bar on the other side. 
MATT: Over here? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Ooh, right, but people may be coming in then. 
TALIESIN: Oh shoot. 
LAURA: No, yeah, I'm going to stay right there. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And duckies. Can I duckies? 
MATT: Duck down? Yeah, sure. 
LIAM: (duck noise) 
MATT: We'll just say that you're ducked down. 
SAM: That's going to make it super hard for me to touch you. 
TALIESIN: Damn. 
MATT: That duck sound. 
LAURA: I'm going to keep my arm over it. 
MATT: That's exactly in my head as the old school Windows prompt sound for warning. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
MATT: It my fucked with head when you did that. I had a childhood flashback to my first computers. Wow. All right, so finishing Imogen's go, it's Dancer's go. Dancer is going to come behind this window here and peek through a bit. Glancing through, is going to whistle again, (whistles) and with that, Pussy II-- 
LIAM: ♪ Can I work it ♪ 
MATT: Is going to fly up there. 
LIAM: ♪ Let me work it ♪ 
MATT: Over here. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Put my thing down ♪ 
MATT: Is going to cast Shocking Grasp through. 
SAM: Wow! 
MATT: Now they do have metal armor, which I believe gives their saving throw a penalty. Indeed. Well, it's advantage on the attack roll. 
LIAM: Wow-wow-wow-wow. 
MATT: That will do-- Ah, misses, 15. Shit. 
SAM: Fly, robotic sister, fly. 
MATT: (laughs) Is going to stay put over there. Finishing their go. Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: Okay. Is there a crack in the ceiling that I can see through and see the caster? 
MATT: Not from where you're standing, unfortunately. The Fireball blasted down in this space. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Which affected this area over here. But from where you are here, there's not much to see through. 
MARISHA: I'll crawl back up, then. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: (feet scampering) 
SAM: (feet scampering) 
MARISHA: And get to a place where I can. Now can I see the caster? 
MATT: The caster? From where you are, you can, but they would have three-quarters cover. 
MARISHA: Spell Snipper. 
MATT: Right, right. Yep. 
SAM: Yep, yep. 
ASHLEY: Snip, snip, snip. 
TALIESIN: The scissors go. 
MARISHA: Then do I do something big? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: (sighs) I was going to do a big spell, but we also still have Ratanish. 
TALIESIN: And there's hostages. 
MARISHA: Okay. Eldritch Blast. 
SAM: Woo-hoo! 
MARISHA: A natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. (cheering) 
MARISHA: And an 11 for 21. 
MATT: Both hit. 
MARISHA: All right. For the one for double damage. Come on, big money. Oh! (excited noises) 10 on the damage die. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: So that gives us 24 damage on the first hit. 
TRAVIS: Yo. 
MATT: Woo-woo. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MARISHA: Then a one on the second one. 
MATT: Natural 20 on their concentration check. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, to end the-- To end the-- 
MATT: The Heat Metal. 
MARISHA: Okay. That's okay. The next one is, unfortunately-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you. 
MARISHA: -- only five damage. 
TRAVIS: I know that was to end the damage on the-- 
MATT: That's going to be a 13, so they maintain concentration. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: What was that? 
MATT: They maintain concentration. 
MARISHA: They maintain concentration? 
LAURA: Thank you for nothing. 
MARISHA: Fuck it. I'm going to Quicken Spell and do it again. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Might as well. Fuck this caster up. Okay, 21 and 23. 
MATT: Both hit. 
SAM: ♪ (background music) ♪ 
MARISHA: Weak-ass rolls is what that is. Seven damage. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: On the first, and six on the second. 
MATT: Okay. Maintain concentration. 12. 
SAM: ♪ (background music) ♪ 
MATT: And 12 again. Yeah, maintain concentration. 
MARISHA: Okay. Can I once again shift to where I don't have my head in the grate? 
MATT: Yep. Off to the side. All right. Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Okay! 
SAM: (like Ashley) Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's right. The monk is dead. Okay. I am going to activate my Armor of Agathys. 
MATT: All right. So it's an action to do that. Gives you 15 temporary hit points. 
ASHLEY: I am going to do it at 4th-level to give myself 20. 
MATT: Well, the spell comes from your item. 
ASHLEY: Say again? 
MATT: The spell comes from your chest armor, and you technically can't up-cast a spell that comes from an item. 
LIAM: The item's locked in at-- 
MATT: So what level is the-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry. It just said-- 
MATT: What level is the spell from your chest armor? 
ASHLEY: "When you cast a spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increases by five for each slot." 
MATT: Correct, but look at your Gloom Chestplate. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay, so-- 
MATT: It should say what level it's cast at. 
TRAVIS: If you look at the armor item. 
MATT: Yeah, the item in your-- 
ASHLEY: (groaning) 
MATT: It's okay. In your inventory. 
ASHLEY: Is that this? 
MATT: Equipment. 
SAM: Rules shit. 
ASHLEY: Okay, second. Okay, okay. Yeah, so 15. 
MATT: Well, at 2nd-level, it would be 10 temporary hit points. 
ASHLEY: 10 temporary hit points, and then also, will do fire damage if somebody hits me with melee. 
MATT: Oh, no, fire for you. That's right. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. So, I'll activate that. That is an action. I will move, and I am going to kick open one of the doors with my hoof. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM and LIAM: (horse neighing) 
TRAVIS: Back kick. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: It is not blocked. It was just open as they were preparing. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
MATT: So it kicks right open. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: As you move away, it does slash at you with an opportunity attack. That is going to be a 16. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: No. 
ASHLEY: That doesn't hit. 
MATT: It goes wide. 
ASHLEY: Great. All right. 
TRAVIS: Ace in the corner. 
LIAM: It's a blade trap? 
TRAVIS: Right behind them. 
ASHLEY: Here's a question. 
MATT: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Would I know, with Laudna being up at the top and communicating to us about what's going on inside, where Joe is in the building? 
MATT: Unfortunately, no, because she hasn't been communicating that to folks. She's been focusing on firing things. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So. You step inside, and you see Imogen immediately to the right behind the bar. You see FCG, wolf Chetney. 
ASHLEY: Hi. Hey. 
MATT: You see one figure off to the side who's currently in the middle of battling Pussy II. 
ASHLEY: Great. You're alive. I'm going to peek around the corner with my movement of 35. So I'm going to try to go where I can see, get eyes on everybody. 
MATT: 25, 30. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Mister. (smooching) So if he's with me. 
MATT: Yeah. He can move into here as well. 
ASHLEY: Yes. So I would love to have him go over to Joe. 
MATT: What's the movement on Mister? 
ASHLEY: I believe it's 15 feet. 
MATT: 15-foot movement. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Then he would be able to get up to here, unfortunately. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. Then I'm going to have him shoot some flame shit at the guy who was on his knees in front of Ashton. 
MATT: You got it. 
ASHLEY: My titan. Okay. 
MATT: So roll for an attack. 
TALIESIN: With advantage. 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: With advantage. All right. Sorry I'm taking 25 minutes to do this. 
SAM: No, this is your moment. 
MATT: No, not at all. You're good. You're good. 
TALIESIN: I'm looking up a bunch of stuff, thank you. You're saving me. 
LIAM: That's what we all do. 
ASHLEY: All right, advantage. Okay, first one is 25. No, wait. That's not right. Oh my god. 26. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: So we're going to do-- 12 points of damage. 
MATT: 12 points of damage. How do you want to do this? 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: All right. So as I-- 
SAM: The caster? 
MATT: Down to the last couple of hit points. 
ASHLEY: I'll kick open the door, and as I go in: Thanks, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I don't care. (laughter) 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: "I don't care." 
MATT: This is Mister against the assassin one behind you. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: How does Mister finish off the assassin? 
ASHLEY: Mister, go get him. 
MATT: (monkey chittering) (screaming) Flames erupt around it. What does Mister do? 
ASHLEY: As the guy is screaming and yelling, he shoots the flaming shit in his mouth. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: Oh. Oh, demeaning. 
MATT: (splatting) He turns and he goes "(coughing)." 
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Looks over at Mister, looks at you. (explosion blasting) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: Smoke and flame erupts from their mouth as they-- 
LIAM: Heartburn. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
ASHLEY: That's my turn. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Matt. 
MATT: They're gone now. Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Was that a "Matt"? 
MARISHA: Yeah. Matt, can we do a little retconny and say I'm still peeking in the grate so I have a view of the room just in casies? 
MATT: Sure. Chetney, you're up. 
MARISHA: Nothing's happening. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and run this way towards the now open door that does not have a red-headed axe-wielding guy next to it. 
MATT: This one over here? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, this dude's gone, right? 
MATT: No, he's still there. 
TRAVIS: Oh, oh. Which one got blasted into smithereens? 
TALIESIN: Way outside. 
MATT: Outside here. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
TALIESIN: That was the end of the outdoors fuck-off. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. Let's fuck with this guy. I'm going to try and get all the way to him. I'll throw open the door. 
MATT: You can definitely get there. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Hi. 
MATT: "(shrieks)" 
TRAVIS: I'll take two swings. 
MATT: He's trying to run out the door now to flee. 
TRAVIS: Nice. First one is a 18. 
MATT: 18 hits. 
TRAVIS: Very cool. (laughs) 16, 17, 21. 29 points of damage, 21 of that is radiant, and he has to make a charisma saving throw. 
MATT: No, he doesn't. 
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Whoosh. 
MATT: You scatter him in the strike (splattering) against the wall. "(groaning)" 
TRAVIS: Awesome. Would you say I have any movement left? 
MATT: It was 30 to get there. 
TRAVIS: Could I grab the door and pull it closed behind me on the other side of the door, just trying to break line-of-sight. 
MATT: Your movement speed of-- 
TRAVIS: 35. 
MATT: 35. 
SAM: You died. 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: Unfortunately, no. You can get to the door threshold. 
SAM: But then we resurrected you. 
LAURA: Okay. (groans) 
SAM: Then you died again. 
MARISHA: You mean pull it in the crack? 
TRAVIS: I want to get out of line-of-sight with the caster in the corner, if I can. 
MATT: Unfortunately, no, five more feet. It took you 30 to get there. 
TRAVIS: That's totally fine. For my bonus action, could I send a Blood Curse of Bloated Agony towards that caster in the corner? 
MATT: Sure. What's the range on it? 
TRAVIS: 30 feet. 
MATT: 30 feet. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I don't know if I'm close enough. ♪ 
MATT: You are out of range, unfortunately. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: But good looking out. 
TRAVIS: Fair enough. 
MARISHA: Ouchies. 
MATT: All right. Does that finish your go? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: All right. Finishing Chetney's go. FCG, you're up. 
SAM: Okay. I will not head to Imogen. 
LAURA: (sarcastic laugh) 
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action, sorry, to Crimson Rite on my palm? 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: If we die, we die. 
TRAVIS: One point. 
LAURA: We can't come back. 
SAM: Oh, that's true. I'm going to head sort of to the middle of the room. 
MATT: (wheel squeaking) 
SAM: As I get there, I'm going to cast Mass Healing Word. 
LAURA: Hey. 
SAM: At 5th-level. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
SAM: I think that's what it is. I don't know. Is it? Mass Healing Word, yeah. Okay. Let's see if we get anything good. Where's my d4? It's gone. It's lit'rally gone. 
TRAVIS: Lit'rally. 
SAM: Where? 
LAURA: What'd you do with it? 
SAM: I don't know. It's gone. 
LAURA: Oh, it's right here. It's right here. 
SAM: It's tucked in the corner. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's hiding. 
SAM: Okay. Three. One. Three. That's seven, plus three. That's 10 points. 
TRAVIS: Woo-hoo! 
SAM: Everybody gets 10 points. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll take it. 
MATT: There you go. 
SAM: But everybody, including you, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: I get 10? I'm outside. 
SAM: You're within 60 feet, and I can see you. 
TALIESIN: Can you? 
SAM: Can I? 
LAURA: Yeah, you should be able to. 
TRAVIS: Through the door. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I get 10 points. All right. I'll take it. 
MARISHA: That's great. 
SAM: I get 10 points, too. 
MATT: Is the range 60 feet, right? 
SAM: It's 60 feet. 
MATT: Yeah, and you can see pretty much everybody, including Laudna up top. 
SAM: Except Orym. 
MATT: Right. Orym you can't see, and technically, Dancer you can't see. 
SAM: Laudna is in a grate above me. 
MATT: Correct. So you can see Laudna. 
SAM: Yeah, so she takes it, too. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Takes it too ♪ 
SAM: I will arm my bolt thrower, and I will throw a bolt at the caster. 
MATT: The caster? All righty. 
SAM: In the corner. 
MATT: Make an attack. 
SAM: I get advantage because many people rolled natural 20s. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Come on. 
SAM: What is that? That's a one and a one. 
MARISHA: No fucking way! That thing has never worked! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow. 
MATT: You go to fire the bolt thrower and it like, pink! 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: That's the pendulum-- 
MATT: It misfires. Yup. 
TRAVIS: -- for all those 20s. 
MATT: It's true. 
SAM: Dancer, I might need a repair. 
MATT: (laughs) Does that finish your turn? 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
SAM: That does. 
LAURA: Did Dancer come-- Oh, no. They're still at the window. 
MATT: The caster, you feel your armor that's been burning into your chest cool off. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
MATT: As the caster goes-- 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: They leap into the air and their body (whooshing) folds into a giant eagle. 
LIAM: Inside this-- 
MARISHA: Druid. 
LIAM: -- living room. 
SAM: Golden raven? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: In the space here. 
SAM: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
SAM: That doesn't seem like it's suitable for this room. 
MATT: They grab both Imahara Joe and the other figure. 
SAM: No! 
MATT: And push past. 
SAM: It can't fly out of here. 
MARISHA: That's a natural ability. Was that a Polymorph? Could I Counterspell that? 
MATT: Hmm? 
MARISHA: Is that a Counterspell? Can I Counterspell? 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
MARISHA: Or is that a natural ability? 
MATT: What do you think? 
MARISHA: Might as well. Counterspell, I guess. Let's try it. 
MATT: Has no effect. 
MARISHA: Has no effect. (groaning) 
MARISHA: That's fucking druid. All right. 
MATT: Have them both. 
ASHLEY: Do we get an attack of opportunity? 
TRAVIS: Ah ma num a num. 
MATT: Let's see here. No, you know what? 
LIAM: Eaglematic immunity. 
MATT: The best-- 
ASHLEY: Diplomatic. 
MATT: (sighs) Yeah, they're in a tight spot. 
LIAM: That ceiling is low. 
TRAVIS: They've been laying out people from that corner. 
SAM: If you would've let us do it, you can do it. 
MATT: Nah, it's a 20-foot ceiling. Well, they could probably do it in a 20-foot ceiling. It's not that terribly tight. So yeah, they transform, grab both of them, and (wings flapping) do a giant leaping flight bit to the center of the room. You do get an opportunity attack, if you want to take it. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Pulling both of them. 
TRAVIS: Do you have War Caster? 
ASHLEY: No. Wait. What am I hitting it with? 
TALIESIN: There's other stuff. There lots of stuff. 
SAM: Your hoof. 
LAURA: Your sharp hands? 
ASHLEY: My sharp hands? 
SAM: Oh yeah. She has blades for hands. 
LIAM: Is it difficult terrain for our birdie? 
MATT: Hmm? 
LIAM: Is it difficult terrain for our birdie? 
MATT: It's a 20-foot height, and it's a large creature, which is a 10-foot by 10-foot cube. So it grabs them both, leaps, flaps to the center. So the difficult terrain is not catching it. Chains are pulling by it, but they're not affixed to anything. They're just wrapping and falling off the side of the wings. 
LIAM: It's like when a crow runs dorkily along the ground. 
MATT: Yeah, it's not moving that way. It's leaping and flying across. If it wasn't as tall, 20 feet, it would've had to have done that. 
LIAM: Okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: Can I try to make a crossbow shot? 
MATT: It has to be a melee attack as an opportunity attack. 
ASHLEY: Okay. How would I do an opportunity attack, just swiping at it? 
LIAM: Hit it with a stick. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Hit it with my moon sickle, I guess? 
MATT: Yeah, hit it with your moon sickle. 
TRAVIS: Bitch slap. 
ASHLEY: 14? 
MATT: How much? 
ASHLEY: 14? Okay. 
MATT: 14 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
TALIESIN: Big bird. 
ASHLEY: Ooh, this is going to be big. 
LAURA: (laughs) Guidance. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Is this a minus one? 
LAURA: No. Yes. No. Hey, no. What? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: 1d-- 
LIAM: Moon sickle, 1d4 plus one, and it's-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but that's not a plus. It's a minus. 
LIAM: Oh, that is a minus. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: No, no. No, no, no, no, no. Then all of your things are minuses. 
LIAM: Her strength is minus two. So it gets a negative. 
LIAM: Oh, it is all negative. 
SAM: You just healed him one point. 
LAURA: No. 
LIAM: No. 
ASHLEY: So it's-- 
LAURA: No, no. Oh my gosh, it is. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: Feathers get cut off. 
ASHLEY: One point. 
MATT: One point of damage. Got it. Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: (soft whoosh) As it lands-- 
ASHLEY: Big money. Big money. 
MATT: Both of them getting slammed into the ground as it lands. You hear Joe and the other figure go "(groaning)" as they're held in the claws as it-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, don't be dramatic. 
MATT: As a monkey walks towards the edge. (screeching) 
LAURA: How are they even fitting out the doors? 
MATT: It's squeezing. 
TRAVIS: Squeezing. 
MATT: Which ends its movement. It would have 80 feet of flight, but it was 30 to get there, and that brings it to the end of its movement there. 
LAURA: Stuck in the doorway? 
MATT: It pushes through both of them. So that is bonus action to transform, movement to get there, action dash. 
TALIESIN: What about-- 
LAURA: No! 
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no. What about picking the two of them up? Does that not use something for grabbing two people in the claws, or is that a free action? 
SAM: That's half movement. 
MATT: That's why half movement pulls them along. 
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. 
MATT: For this terrain here. 
TALIESIN: I do get an attack of opportunity, though, or not? 
LAURA: It dodges you. 
MATT: It's large, and it shoots up this way to get around the ceiling, and you will get an opportunity attack. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: How far away is he getting? 
MARISHA: Drop it. Drop it. 
MATT: It is 80-foot flight speed. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah. 
SAM: Hit Joe. Hit Imahara Joe. He's all we need. 
TALIESIN: I'm taking my opportunity attack. 
MARISHA: That's kind of true. 
TALIESIN: I can't take advantage on that. I just have a straight roll. 
MATT: You just have to make a straight roll. 
TALIESIN: That's fine. 
MARISHA: Come on. Natural 20. 
TALIESIN: Not a natural 20, but it is a 16 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on, come on. 
SAM: Liam, blow up another car! 
LAURA: Whoa. 
TALIESIN: That's-- 
SAM: Throw a car. 
TALIESIN: I can't think, motherfuckers. 23 points of damage. 
MATT: 23 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: No, you fuck! 
MARISHA: Does it drop the form, drop the form? 
MATT: (screeches) (wings fluttering) 
SAM: Aw. 
MARISHA: Fuck. 
MATT: It continues to kick up into the air. 
LAURA: 80 feet? 
MATT: 80 feet, which is putting it way up over here. 
SAM: You've got sight on it. 
MATT: Carrying both of them. 
MARISHA: I do. I do. 
LAURA: Because you're on the ceiling. 
MARISHA: I've got Spell Snipper. So I can. (laughter) 
MATT: With that, it finishes its turn. Ashton, you're up. 
MARISHA: Fuck. 
TALIESIN: How high above it is me right now? 
SAM: ♪ High ♪ 
MATT: I'd say, it would be at the angle it's flying, about 60 feet. 
ASHLEY: ♪ High above me ♪ 
TALIESIN: About 60 feet? 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: ♪ She's so lovely ♪ 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: It doesn't make any sense. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to do Reckless. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: It doesn't even rhyme. 
TALIESIN: You fucker. I'm going to hop up and take a swing at it and use a Wormhole Strike. 
MATT: What's the range on that again? 
TALIESIN: 60 feet. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Are you teleporting? 
TALIESIN: Just the hammer. 
MATT: He's teleporting and swinging with the hammer through a portal. 
TALIESIN: So a little portal goes (portal booming) (hammer smacking) right across the fucking head. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
TALIESIN: That's 29 to hit. 
SAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on. 
TALIESIN: Big money. That's pretty good. 22 points of damage. 
MATT: (bursts) A burst of feathers strike in the sky as-- 
LAURA: Oh no, Imahara. 
MATT: -- its form reverts. 
TRAVIS: Wrought iron fence below. 
MATT: And all three of them begin plummeting right over-- Ashton, you can catch them. 
MATT: -- the spiked wrought iron fence, and that's where we're going to go to break. 
ALL: No! 
LIAM: You bad man! You bad man! 
TRAVIS: You can't do that! You can't do that. What are we going to do?! 
ASHLEY: How dare you! 
TALIESIN: Oh! Oh! I-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Awesome. 
LIAM: No, bad. 
MATT: So we'll come back and figure out what happens to these people here shortly. We'll see you in a few minutes.

Break[]
(action music) Jak. We're out of time. Everyone that can fight already is. And we're still losing. The last Immortal. Sigil up. 
(mysterious music) (gentle music) 
The Midnight Queen is dead. As the bell tolls for Her Majesty, her succession looms in uncertainty, for with her dying breath, the queen invoked an ancient and deadly contest, compelling the Princesses of Twelvefold to meet in secret and battle one another, until the stroke of midnight reveals the victor, the new Midnight Queen. (fire roars) Erdene, the Gilded Champion; Dr. Lux, the Scholar Supreme; Rosaline, the Oneiromancer; Freya, Blood of the Tower; Hephesta, the Light Breaker; and then there's me, Boss No, the fairest of them all. Who will survive? (horse whinnies) Who will you choose? (dice rattling) Who will be Queen by Midnight? (gentle music) 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. Roll an investigation if you want. It's basically perfect. They're so mini. Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself. I mean the Traveler always says impulse purchases are a good decision. Can you put donuts in this? Only one way to find out. Look at this. Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now.
(adventurous music) (dramatic music) 
TALIESIN: The trials of war have cracked the foundations of those willing to charge forth. 1898. The Fairelands suffered in the tight grip of the armada of Otherwhere, with scores of Halens joining the fray to protect their homes. Few who bore witness to the horrors of the war survived. The metropolis of Newfaire rebuilds, furthering the gap between the elite and the impoverished. Those who've returned from the front lines are left with nothing but fragments of a forgotten past, while others relish in the spoils of victory. Faceless monstrosities now roam the Fairelands. (creature shrieking) 
TALIESIN: Immersing themselves among the everyday Halens, feeding upon the downtrodden. (dramatic music) 
TALIESIN: It's here that this war-torn circle of investigators was forged. Hardened by the siege, they are deployed when only the brave and unwavering can survive. (dramatic music) 
TALIESIN: Chapter Two: The Circle of Needle & Thread. 
(melodic string music) (ominous music) 
Narrator 1: Hello. Narrator 2: It's us, we're back. Real quick spoiler warning. Narrator 1: If you have not listened to season one of "Midst", you're gonna wanna stop here. Narrator 3: Seriously, we'll give you three seconds. (suspenseful music) (countdown timer ticks) All right, you've been warned. So you may be asking yourself, what the hell?! Narrator 1: Why the fuck did the moon explode? Narrator 3: What's gonna happen to utterly doomed Midst and everybody trapped on it by an incoming wave of reality-devouring fog? Narrator 1: Are Lark and Tzila gonna be okay? Are they gonna figure out that Sherman's not dead? Narrator 3: What's Phineas gonna do now that he's been abandoned by the Trust, the very institution that raised him and gave him purpose and his sense of self-worth? And like, what is he gonna do? Narrator 2: Will Jonas Spahr do the right thing? What even is the right thing? Narrator 1: What is Imelda's deal? Narrator 3: Why did the Trust even bother rescuing Moc Weepe even though he's this weird sleazeball piece of shit who stabbed his closest friends in the back? Narrator 1: And what is a mirror hawk? Narrator 3: What is a bocular horse? What is going on with Weepe's voice? Is Landlord gonna die? 
ALL: No. Narrator 1: Okay, we will tell you this one. Landlord is not going to die. We're unreliable narrators, not monsters. Narrator 3: Why did Lark kill fuse? Narrator 1: What is she trying to hide? Is the nutcracker okay? Narrator 3: Will the rapidly depreciating value of valor ever restabilize, or is the market doomed to implode? Narrator 1: Is the Trust bad? Narrator 3: Did Saskia's dogs really eat the melted corpse of enterprising businessman Atticus Concord? Do the narrators even know what happens next? (tense silence) No, we have no idea. Narrator 1: Just kidding, we know. Narrator 3: And when season two of "Midst" unfolds August 23rd you will know as well. Narrator 2: In the meantime for bonus episodes, merch, media and more, visit midst.co. Narrator 1: And don't forget to stock up on light bulbs. You might need them where we're going.

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, as we left off, 60 feet in the air here. 
LAURA and SAM: (scream) 
MATT: We have both this desert warden druid reverted back to its humanoid form 60 feet in the sky, plummeting along with Imahara Joe and the other figure from the air. So that was at the end of its turn. 
LIAM: It was Ashton-- 
TALIESIN: It was my turn because I had made my attack. 
MARISHA: It was Ashton's turn. 
MATT: Indeed. Ashton, it would be your turn at this moment. 
TALIESIN: Yes, and I'm one attack in. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: So I have an attack left. 
SAM: Are you going to attack Imahara Joe? 
TALIESIN: And movement. 
LIAM: Kill Imahara Joe. 
TRAVIS: You did your-- 
MATT: Yeah, because you did the thing. Yeah. So yeah, you have one more attack. You do. 
TALIESIN: I have just an attack and a movement. 
MATT: That's true, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: And a bonus action. 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: But it's not an action for me to use Violent Gateway right now. 
TRAVIS: What is that? 
ASHLEY: Violent Gateway? 
TALIESIN: In fact, I'm forced to use Violent Gateway. I don't actually have a choice. 
SAM: What does that mean? 
TRAVIS: Because of what you already did? 
TALIESIN: Because I just brought a creature down to zero hit points. 
MATT: The Wild S-- Hmm. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Let me double check. 
TALIESIN: Since it's technically a creature, it's drop a creature to zero hit points. 
MATT: Drop a creature to zero hit points. 
LIAM: Take a creature, leave a creature. 
MATT: Wild Shape. 
TRAVIS: Does it have-- 
SAM: Oh, that doesn't mean the underlying creature. It could be any creature form. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It says drop a creature to zero. 
TALIESIN: It doesn't even say kill a creature. 
MATT: If you revert as a result of dropping to zero hit points... Okay, yeah. So-- So as long as (mumbling spell text). Technically. 
LAURA: Technically. 
MATT: You automatically revert if you fall unconscious-- 
LIAM: Text-nically. 
MARISHA: Text-nically. 
LAURA: Text-- (laughs) Can't do it. 
MARISHA: Based on the text-nicallys. 
MATT: Rules as written. Yeah. All right. 
LIAM: As snea snake always says. 
MATT: It's interesting, it's weird. I'll go with it. All right. 
TRAVIS: You were thinking about this on the break. 
MATT: So what are you doing? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a leap forward with my arms open. 
LIAM: Sail! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to sail. 
MARISHA, MATT, and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Portal's going to open right up in front of me, and I'm going to show up directly in front of Imahara Joe and grapple. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, soak it. Soak it! 
TRAVIS: (gasps) Oh! 
SAM: Just him, though? 
TALIESIN: It's what I can do. 
TRAVIS: Well, we don't know what the other people are-- 
TALIESIN: If I try and do anything more-- 
SAM: -- another guy! 
TRAVIS: We don't know. 
MARISHA: There might be a person. 
LAURA: Yeah, there might-- Yeah. 
MATT: You throw the hammer through a portal, it explodes the bird. 
ASHLEY: That's great logic. 
MATT: Then you jump into the portal that you created, and then appear in the same space-- 
TRAVIS: Come on. 
MATT: -- and then grab Imahara Joe. 
LAURA: Jeez Louise! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TALIESIN: I'm going back first into the ground. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Ashton! 
LIAM: I have a follow up, if you'll allow me. 
MATT: Falling. You would probably-- 
LIAM: I'm next in-- 
MATT: You and Imogen will be the only characters that have any opportunity to do anything at this moment. 
LAURA: Oh, great. 
MATT: Because they are falling 60 feet right now. It is (air whooshing rapidly). 
LIAM: Yeah. So Orym, with his Boots of Striding and Springing and able to jump three times normal, runs straight at the fence, punts up to the post, and leaps off of it. Seeing Ashton grab Joe, I will leap into the air and try to catch whoever this mystery individual is. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: And grab and use Bait and Switch to maneuver in the air and face my back at the ground if I pull it off. 
MATT: Okay. I need you to make-- 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
LAURA: Can I help? 
SAM: An animal handling check-- 
LIAM: Can you 'kinesis me? 
SAM: -- because this is a bunny person. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh yeah, I have-- 
LAURA: That's what I'm thinking. If I saw him running out the door, can I follow and use my Telekinesis, which is already up? 
MATT: Well, you haven't seen him leave the door. 
LAURA: Oh, well, I saw the bird leaving before. 
MATT: You saw a bird leave, yeah. So you can-- 
LIAM: I wasn't in the building. I was-- 
MATT: Possibly. We'll get there in just a minute. 
MARISHA: Donnie Darko? 
MATT: So you, I need you to make an athletics check. 
LIAM: Athletics. 
MATT: Because this is running, hitting the side of the fence, and trying to jump with enough strength to try and grab them. 
LIAM: Okay, I want to check my rules for something. Hold on before I do that. 
SAM: Do you have more videos of dogs with swords? 
MARISHA: (laughs) I could find them. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was-- 
LIAM: Where is it? ♪ Dibbie, dibbie, dibbie, dibbie ♪ 
MATT: (wind blowing) (laughter) 
SAM: This is a long fall! 
MATT: I know. 
TALIESIN: I cannot believe I'm about to soak this shit. 
LAURA: It's all happening at the same time! 
TRAVIS: (heart thumping) 
LIAM: That is 15. 
TRAVIS: (sonic boom) 
MATT: 15? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. You leap off the top of the fence, reach out and catch part of their arm as they're-- Let's see, the height on this. This is close. This is close. 
TRAVIS: 60 feet up? 
MATT: 60 feet up. By the time you catch them, leap off and catch them, they're only going to be about maybe 15 feet. 
LIAM: If I just have a hand on a limb, can I use Bait and Switch? 
MATT: Yeah, but it'll put you possibly in the way of the fence. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
LIAM: That's fine. 
MATT: You okay with that? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: But-- 
ASHLEY: But no! 
MATT: You grab them by the arm and do-si-do spin you. 
TRAVIS: That's hero shit. As you catch them, you both corkscrew downward back in their path, which will put them out of the way of the fence. They'll still take fall damage. 
LIAM: So they're landing like-- The person's trajectory was fence? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: They were all-- Their 60 feet out was right here-- 
LAURA: They were all landing. 
MATT: -- when he got knocked out, and they're all landing towards the fence itself. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So you managed to pull them out of the way of the fence to get you in that path. 
LIAM: That's fine. 
MARISHA: Fall damage is better than impale damage. 
MATT: (laughs) At that speed? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. You're okay with that? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. You spin out of the way. 
TRAVIS: I don't like the way he laughed at that. 
MATT: You have one action. What do you want to do on your turn? 
LAURA: I want to try to catch with Telekinesis. I can catch up to a thousand pounds, right? 
MATT: Of an object, yeah. Object or person. 
LAURA: Can I try to catch them? 
MATT: Yeah, if you want to. 
LAURA: Just stop them from falling into the fucking fence? 
MATT: The range on it is-- 
LAURA: 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet? You would have to-- 
LAURA: Could I get-- 
MATT: That will do it. 
LIAM: One person or object? 
MATT: Telekinesis, I think, is one person or object. 
LAURA: But if you're holding them-- 
LIAM: I'm under them. 
LAURA: Exactly. If you're holding them, then if I stop you, then it stops the other person, too. 
TRAVIS: Conglomerate. One conglomerate. One human centipede in the air. 
LAURA: One human clump. 
TALIESIN: I wonder how much damage 60 feet is. 
LAURA: If I stop Orym and he's holding the other person... 
TALIESIN: Into a fence. 
MATT: Then we'll make a roll. 
ASHLEY: (anxiously) Oh. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, he's going to have to (grunts). 
MATT: Here's the thing. Already allowing you to do this is right the last minute. 
LAURA: I know, I know, I know. 
MATT: So we're already pushing. So if you grab the next person-- Or are you grabbing Orym to stop Orym and Orym has a hold? Is that what you're trying to do? 
LAURA: Yeah. Right? 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Break the fall? 
LIAM: I'm not-- I did my thing. You're doing your thing. 
MATT: All right. So, Ashton is clutching-- 
LAURA: Or, okay. 
TRAVIS: What? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: Ashton's clutching Imahara Joe. 
LAURA: The only other thing. 
MATT: You leapt up-- 
LAURA: He's protecting-- 
MATT: -- grabbed the arm and you spun him out of the way. 
TRAVIS: Ashton's a shield. 
LIAM: You are now protecting them to fall towards the fence. 
LAURA: Then in that case, I'm going to use my Telekinesis to shove the shield down. A thousand pounds, right? Can I bend-- 
MATT: Oh, the fence? 
LAURA: Yeah, force the fence away so they don't fall on the fence. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Interesting. 
TRAVIS: Flatten the fence. 
LIAM: That's cool. 
MATT: Go ahead and make a d20 roll and add your charisma modifier. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Come on. Come on. 
TRAVIS: (metal bending) 
ASHLEY: Guidance. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Me too. 
LAURA: 14. 
MATT: 14. (metal screeches) It bends down and it doesn't slam onto the ground, but it bends at an angle. The iron itself full on you Magneto push it all across the way as it curves in an odd arc. All of you go slamming down into it, gliding off the edge, reducing the damage it would've taken because you're now hitting it at an angle. 
LAURA: That's good. 
MATT: Which means that you-- 
ASHLEY: Making a slide. 
MARISHA: Not snappy! 
MATT: -- are going to take 3d6 bludgeoning damage. That's going to be 15 points of bludgeoning damage. 
TALIESIN: Divided in half? 
MATT: Because you're raging, technically yeah. 
TALIESIN: So it's 15, it's not halved. 
MATT: No sorry. So that would bring it to seven. 
TALIESIN: Seven. Okay, thank you. 
ASHLEY: Ragé! 
MATT: For you. 
TRAVIS: Ragé! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You, same scenario. You take-- 
MARISHA: Fabergé egg. 
MATT: 13 points of bludgeoning damage. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
LAURA: How much did Orym take? 
SAM: That's a new character. 
LIAM: 13. 
SAM: The Fabergé egg guy? 
MATT: 13. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's fun! 
LAURA: What happened? 
LIAM: I turned off internet so it would charge faster. 
MATT: The figure that you saved-- 
ASHLEY: When FCG leaves, is that who you're going to make? 
MATT: -- only takes four points of bludgeoning damage. 
TRAVIS: Whew. 
LAURA: That's good. 
MATT: With you helping Imahara Joe-- 
SAM: I have all the eggs. 
MATT: -- he takes nine points of bludgeoning damage. 
TRAVIS: Hang in there, Joe! 
TALIESIN: Are we still in a combat? 
LAURA: If General Ratanish comes back, yeah. 
TRAVIS: There's an eagle that's falling too, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: It's not an eagle, it's a person. 
TRAVIS: It's person now. Yeah, sorry. 
SAM: Maybe both. 
MATT: They take the full damage. 
SAM: Oh, maybe he lays a new one every day. 
MATT: Well, they're still hitting the angle, actually. So it'll get through that. 
SAM: He's a goose guy. 
MATT: However, that is still enough. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What? To what? 
MATT: To fall unconscious. 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
MATT: They (slam) hit the fence and they snap an arm, it's broken at the shoulder. They go, (groan), and the pain knocks them unconscious. 
TRAVIS: Do we want to leave him unconscious, and then we can all gang up on Ratanish and then question this person? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Or we just fucking run. 
SAM: Run? We need to fix shit here. This is Imahara Joe's place! 
TALIESIN: He'll leave eventually. 
LAURA: We blew it up. 
SAM: There's a couple tools that aren't singed. 
LIAM: We're staying in-- 
LAURA: But it would be good to take out-- 
LIAM: -- turn-by-turn here? 
LAURA: If we took out Ratanish, we would take out one of their top-- 
SAM: We can surround Ratanish-- 
TRAVIS: Ratanish, yes. 
SAM: -- and whale on him when he comes back. 
LAURA: Yeah. I think that's a good idea. 
ASHLEY: There's just one of him. 
SAM: We've got like-- Are we out of combat? Are there other dudes? 
MATT: You have a handful of-- The person who's unconscious, you all have about 40 or so seconds until Ratanish reemerges from being banished. 
LAURA: All right, gather up! 
TRAVIS: Somebody bind up the unconscious. 
SAM: I'll Healing Word the unconscious guy. 
TALIESIN: No! 
LAURA: Why? 
TALIESIN: No! 
TRAVIS: We need him out. 
SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: That's the baddie. 
SAM: Wait, the unconscious guy I thought was Imahara Joe's friend. 
TALIESIN, LAURA, and TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: That's the bad guy. 
MATT: Imahara Joe's friend actually managed to make it through okay because of your maneuver and keeping him (grunts). 
ASHLEY: Oh right. That's the bunny. 
LAURA: No, the druid. 
MATT: The hood falls back and you can see the floppy-- 
MARISHA: A caster! It's a caster. 
MATT: -- brown furry ears on this female bunny figure. 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: A lagomore. You see as they sit up-- 
MARISHA: Lagomore? 
TRAVIS: I thought it was the Easter Bunny. 
TALIESIN: Are we doing this? Is this the thing we're really fucking doing? 
MATT: Imahara Joe looks really, really hurt. 
LAURA: Oh, Imahara Joe's super duper hurt. 
MATT: But conscious. He's like, "(sharp groan)." 
SAM: Okay, I'll Healing Word him then. 
TALIESIN: We got to go if we're going to deal with this. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: We go right the fuck now. 
LAURA: All of us go around Ratanish. 
TRAVIS: I'll bind up the druid's-- like cattle tie. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
TRAVIS: Hog tie. 
MATT: Hog tie. 
MARISHA: Same thing. 
MATT: You rush over there. That'll take you about two rounds to get there. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Actually, a round to get there with a dash. A few rounds to tie him up. 
TRAVIS: (rapid hog tie) 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: We ready? 
MATT: So what's everyone's placement on this? 
SAM: I call everyone over to where I remember Ratanish to be. 
TRAVIS: He's right on the corner of the table. We got the semicircle. 
MATT: Ratanish is right here. 
MARISHA: I'll go inside. 
MATT: This area. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'll get around there. 
TRAVIS: Anybody who can't take a hit, back up and those who can get right in there. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to stay where I am. 
MATT: Going to stay where you are, okay. 
SAM: By the way, I just healed Imahara Joe six health points. 
MATT: Great. He is doing much better. 
SAM: Hit points. 
MATT: His possibly broken ankle fits right back into place. He's like, "(winces) Thank you. I appreciate that." 
SAM: Be right with you. 
MATT: "No worries." 
LIAM: We think Ratanish is coming here? 
MATT: You don't know. Somewhere in that area. 
TRAVIS: Well, I was right there when he vanished. So it'd be corner of the table, and I'm sitting there with a sword. 
TALIESIN: I'm on the other end of it so that we can-- 
LAURA: So you're flanking him when he comes in? 
LIAM: Yeah, I'll get on the flank. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go right back here. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Dancer, you want to come in here and help? 
TALIESIN: Travis, put me wherever is flanking. 
MATT: You got it. 
SAM: I'm going to call Dancer in, too. Dancer, you want to come smash this guy with your Pussy? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Such a walk to that. 
MATT: "I guess there's a first time for everything." 
TALIESIN: Come on. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
ASHLEY: I'll come around in the circle as well to get at the ready. 
LAURA: I'm prepping a Psychic Lance to hit him. 
TRAVIS: Can we put Ashton right here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: So that would put me in the middle. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. Over here? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, so we're flanking. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: Can I be on the inside, but still stuck to the ceiling? 
LIAM: Smash or pass? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: From the top? Yeah, you can definitely do that. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MATT: That's your bailiwick. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We'll say when we're at the count of 10. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Are you good here or? 
ASHLEY: I'll get up close to where the-- 
SAM: Are you going to hold an attack spell? 
ASHLEY: -- around in the circle. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You want to get up close? 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
SAM: Is Counterspell a reaction? 
MATT: Okay. Remember, ranged attacks have disadvantage if you're right next to somebody. 
SAM: What if he comes out and casts something. 
MATT: Depending on what you're planning to do, ranged or melee. 
MARISHA: Is he a caster? 
SAM: No, I think we'll still get an attack of opportunity. 
ASHLEY: I was planning on maybe doing a melee. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: He did that brawl. 
MATT: Hell yeah, let's do it. All right. 
LIAM: That brawl with Ashton. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, get right up there. 
MARISHA: He's a fighter. 
TALIESIN: He's a barbarian. 
LIAM: Barbarian. 
ASHLEY: He's a barbarian? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Magic, good. Anything else, bad. 
SAM: Did he beat you up once? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, he almost killed me. 
SAM: You should get the final shot. 
TALIESIN: We'll see how this goes. I'm going to rage when we get to the count of four. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: I also send Pâté to be in the general vicinity. 
SAM: (as Pâté) "Oh!" 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: (Pâté) "Don't worry. I'm excited to be present in something I've missed entirely." (laughter) 
MATT: Where's he going? 
MARISHA: He can hover near Fearne. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Actually I'm going to, instead of holding an action, I'm going to hold Inflict Wounds. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Like (claws extract). 
ASHLEY: You know what? I want to back up. 
MATT: You're going to back up? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Out of range. Because that's not very smart. 
TALIESIN: I won't know what I'm holding until-- 
LAURA: I'm prepping Psychic Lance for the minute he appears. 
TALIESIN: -- count five. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: All right, we're close enough. 
LIAM: I'm going to stick him with the pointy end. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: All right! 
ASHLEY: Popping Scorching Ray. 
TALIESIN: I got the red one. 
MARISHA: ♪ I pop a spell ♪ 
TALIESIN: Kicking in. 
MATT: Now, FCG, your Banishment spell is about to unravel. 
SAM: Yep. 
MATT: The little faint line of red light on the distant horizon you can see just beyond the open door outside. All of you are sweating. You do hear in the distance what sounds like some voices. People who have been called by the attention of two massively detonating skirmish crawlers nearby. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: But as you're all set up and ready to go, what are you doing, FCG? 
LAURA: Drop it. 
SAM: Are we ready to do this? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (wolfish snarl) Yes. 
MARISHA: I'll summon my hound just as one added bonus. 
TRAVIS: On the ceiling as well? 
LIAM: Does it fall out of your belly from the ceiling? 
MARISHA: He does. 
MATT: Yeah. This weird-- 
MARISHA: As I'm upside down like this. 
MATT: It's black, almost like a sludge drop. (thick slurp) 
LIAM: It's crowning. 
MARISHA: It's like bomb bay doors, but just my ribs just go (creaks). (laughter) 
MATT: (sludge splashes) 
LAURA: Gross. 
TRAVIS: My god. 
MATT: This black shadow (swirling vapor). 
LIAM: They grow up so fast. 
MATT: It crawls out. 
LAURA: Do it before it ends-- 
MARISHA: That will be-- Yeah. Next to Chet. That's great. 
LAURA: -- and it skids away. 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: Now we're good. 
SAM: I will, one round before it's done, I will mutter a quick prayer to the Changebringer. Let this go okay. CB, come on. I will drop it. 
TRAVIS: CB. 
MATT: All right. Ratanish appears, perturbed and angry. Let's go around the table here. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 24 plus one, 25. 25 points of necrotic damage. 
MATT: 25. Well, did you roll to hit? 
TRAVIS: Oh, I did not. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That is a 21 to hit. 
MATT: 21 to hit, definitely hits. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
ASHLEY: So are we taking him out? We're taking him out. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Kind of have to. Okay. 
MATT: So what was the damage on that? It was 25? 
TRAVIS: It was 24. 
MATT: 24, all right. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, 25, plus one. 
MATT: 25, yeah. It's all right. 
MATT: What you got? 
MARISHA: Blight. 
MATT: Blight. Constitution save. 
MARISHA: He has disadvantage because my hound is next to him. 
MATT: That's true. 
MATT: Natural 18, one. 
TRAVIS: Woo. 
LAURA: Ha ha ha. 
MARISHA: Okay, so that is-- 
SAM: What was his name? 
MARISHA: Four? 
SAM: Does your hound have a name? 
TALIESIN: Is he raging or no? 
MARISHA: He doesn't. 
SAM: He needs a cute name. 
TALIESIN: Is he raging or no? 
MATT: He hasn't had a chance to rage yet. He didn't know when spell was going to come back. 
SAM: Tartare. 
TALIESIN: Just checking. 
MATT: He literally was just-- 
ASHLEY: Carpaccio? 
MATT: -- sitting there in this weird, ethereal exterior space confused, looking around and suddenly is back. Right as he appears, you all go in on him. 
TALIESIN: Thump, thump. 
SAM: Sounds like Ralph Macchio. 
MARISHA: 38. 
MATT: Ooh woo! All righty. 
SAM: Well, I used my action to drop this. I don't know. 
MATT: Dropping is instant. 
SAM: Okay, then I will use Scramble the Dead! 
TRAVIS: Scramble? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Like eggs? 
SAM: It's like Toll the Dead, but it's Scramble the Dead because I'm sending modem noises at him. 
MATT: Is it a wisdom saving throw? 
SAM: It is a 15 wisdom saving throw. 
LAURA: (modem noises) 
MATT: That is a failure. 
SAM: Huh? 
MATT: Failure. 
SAM: Yay! And he's taken hits, so that's 2d12. 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: Three. 10. 
MATT: So 13 damage. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: All righty, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: All right. I am going to do Scorching Ray. I'm checking something real quickly. 
SAM: Oh, and-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. Scorching Ray. Okay. First hit is 14. 
MATT: 14 to hit? That's a miss. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Second is 16. 
MATT: Miss. 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Mm. 
TALIESIN: Do you have a-- 
LAURA: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: Natural 19. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
MATT: That hits. 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: That would've been smart. Okay, so one hit. Plus a d8 because of Mister. 
MATT: Indeed. 
ASHLEY: All right. Okay, that's not bad. 16. 
SAM: I don't know if we're going to kill this guy. 
MATT: 16 points of fire damage. All righty. 
SAM: Yikes. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, and Mister's going to throw some shit. 
MATT: You got it. Literally. 
ASHLEY: Literally. Oh, that's a little cocked. 
SAM: Semi-cocked. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 27, that hits? 
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for him. 
ASHLEY: Eight. Wait, does he add-- Sorry, give me a second. 
SAM: At least eight. Maybe more. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Eight points. 
SAM: Eight. 
ASHLEY: An extra eight points of fire damage. 
MATT: Okay. Got it. Getting bombarded from all sides. Imogen? 
LAURA: Intelligence saving throw. 
MATT: Intelligence saving throw on his point. That is going to be an eight. 
LAURA: All right. Then he takes 7d6. 
SAM: What are you casting? 
LAURA: I'm casting a Psychic Lance on him. 
SAM: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Hell yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. 12, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24. 
SAM: Damn. 
LAURA: 24 psychic damage, and he is incapacitated until the start of his next turn. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: (laughing) Oh! 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's fucking rough. 
ASHLEY: That's rough. 
TRAVIS: Rough! 
LAURA: I'm also going to flare my eyes up red. I'm going to take-- Oh, wait, what do I got? What's my hit points? I'm going to take five points of damage and I'm going to drop a couple more. Six more points of damage into him. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: Woo! 
SAM: You're taking more damage? But you're already hurt! 
LAURA: Yeah, I know. 
MATT: All righty. Orym. 
LIAM: I'm going to stick out Seedling and slash it along his weapon arm and try to cut the weapon out of his hand. I think I'm flanking because of Laudna's death doge? 
MATT: You are. 
LIAM: That's an 18 to hit for the first. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: That hits? Okay. Then it is-- Six and six is 12, and he has to make strength save. 
MATT: Strength save. 
LIAM: 12 points of damage. Strength save. 
MARISHA: Oh my fucking god. 
LIAM: Oh wow. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: You've got to be fucking kidding. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) He put a-- 
MATT: 14. 
TRAVIS: -- coffee order?! 
LIAM: 14 fails. 
LAURA: Does he make saves when he's incapacitated? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Does he make saves when he's incapacitated or is it at a disadvantage? How's that work? 
LIAM: 14 fails, so his weapon's out of his hand. 
MATT: Actually, yeah. His battleaxe falls to the ground. 
MARISHA: He's been trolling me all day. I'm so mad, I have tears in my eyes. 
LIAM: Okay. Second attack will be a tripping attack. So actually I will-- 
MATT: What was the damage on that one? 
LIAM: Oh, it was 12. 
MATT: 12. 
ASHLEY: You know they turned off the order-- 
LIAM: Oh, and plus, sorry, I didn't do the superiority die. 16. Excuse me. 
LAURA: Did you accidentally tweet it? 
MARISHA: No. 
LIAM: Then I will spin the blade and jam it down into his thigh and yank and try to knock him down. That is a 23 to hit. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
ASHLEY: Why? (laughs) 
LIAM: So that is six, 12, another 16 points of damage and he has to make another strength save. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (excited cheering) 
TRAVIS: There we go! There it is! Oh shit! 
TALIESIN: I know. 
MARISHA: Fuck this guy. 
LIAM: Okay. So then, all right. I slice the weapon out of his hand, jump down, stick the blade into, with both hands, into his leg and I spin him around and yank his leg up and out from under me with amazing halfling strength-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: -- and drop him so that his head falls right in front of Ashton on the ground. All yours. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MARISHA: (gasps) Yes! 
TALIESIN: You really should have killed me that time. I take the hammer, I take the blunt end and go straight into the chest. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: Use Hyper Rage, I'm going to pull it all the way through on the other side with the time thing. 
SAM: Hyper Rage? 
MARISHA: What time thing? 
SAM: Have we heard that before? 
TALIESIN: So in and all the way the fuck out through the chest. 
MATT: You full on-- 
MARISHA: What? 
MATT: You pull the soft bread out of the sub. (disgusted groans) 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh boy! Matt! 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You've been in Subway too late. That's terrible. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's a weird, semi-translucent, red and blue version of me just out of time that are all helping with this one big fucking move. 
LAURA: That's cool. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Uh. What? 
SAM: If we wear 3D glasses, do you look like you're in 3D? 
TALIESIN: I do, actually. You're not wrong. 
LIAM: I was really happy to gift my "How do you want to do this," but now I'm not. (laughter) 
SAM: Holy jabobly. 
TRAVIS: But also keep eyes on the downed druid just in case they come back to consciousness and would sprint out with a clawed finger. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Just in case we need to (flick) head back out. 
MATT: All right. There's a momentary bit of breath and exhale at the passing of General Ratanish, the second in command of the Paragon's Call beneath Otohan Thull. 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Wow. 
SAM: Oh, shoot. 
TRAVIS: Thullé. 
SAM: Should we have gotten information from him first? 
ASHLEY: Probably. 
TRAVIS: That's why we got the druid outside. 
SAM: Oh, okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: He wouldn't have said shit. 
MATT: The druid is not moving. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Oh. 
SAM: Oh. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Huh? 
SAM: As in dead? 
LAURA: Did they fail all the-- 
LIAM: Might be. 
LAURA: No, they're unconscious. 
MATT: Correct. I've been rolling death saves for him while you guys were preparing and getting surrounded for all the rounds. They expired in the interim. 
ASHLEY: He's dead? 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: The druid is deadies. 
MATT: Nobody healed him. 
LIAM: We got the druid. 
SAM: I tried! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Well, what do we-- Do we need-- Oh. Well. 
TRAVIS: It's not a big-- 
TRAVIS: I mean, we'll never know. 
SAM: Wait, I'm going to use Speak with the Dead. 
LAURA: Speak with the Dead? 
ASHLEY: You have Speak with the Dead? 
SAM: Well, I mean, I don't have it prepared, but maybe we just-- 
ASHLEY: But he doesn't have to tell the truth! 
TRAVIS: We're going to be here for several days. Remember, it's going to take a while to analyze the thing, but we'll be fine. 
SAM: I'll sleep next to his dead body and wake up and do it tomorrow morning. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Just throw him in the hole! 
LAURA: Yeah, throw him in the hole. 
MARISHA: Throw him in the hole and do it tomorrow. 
ASHLEY: Throw him in the hole. 
SAM: Sure. 
LIAM: Joe, you okay? 
MATT: (laughs) Joe is still out back like, "(panting) I decided best to not know what was going on in there. Sounded like it was a little messy." 
LAURA: Search the bodies! 
TRAVIS: Can we also shutter the windows and run to the front door and take a look left and right, see if there's commotion or other people coming to the sound of, I don't know, fireballs and shit detonating, and then shut the doors, if so? 
MATT: There are definitely people. I mean, at this point in the morning, most people in the city were sleeping. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: But now there are people looking out their windows, some people are putting on robes and going to inspect. Here, especially in The Ends, it's a community that's pretty tight knit. A lot of people know Joe to be a beloved person and look up to this individual and the work he does. So any sort of loud chaos and possibly dangerous circumstances happening, people are looking out to check in. 
TRAVIS: Joe, maybe come say a word for the good folks. 
MATT: "Oh, no, that's a good point." 
SAM: It's just Bassuras stuff, right? I mean, people are used to this. 
TRAVIS: It's a shop! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's ships blowing up in the air. 
LIAM: Just a repair went bad. That's all, repair went bad. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: "Yeah, you're right." Steps out. 
SAM: I'll give him another healing on the way out. 
MATT: "Oh, thank you." He reaches down to the charred part of the wood from the fireball that you unleashed and takes some of the soot and goes-- 
TRAVIS: Nice. (deeply) Yeah, you're good. Sell it. 
MATT: Runs out into the street. "All good, folks. Just put the wrong, touched the wrong connector to the other--" 
ASHLEY: Thing. 
MATT: "-- focal point." 
TRAVIS: You're overdoing it. 
MATT: He's like, "My terminology sucks right now. I'm so scattered by the--" (laughter) 
MATT: "It's all good. I'm fine. Go back to sleep." Closes the door, spins around. "(breaths heavily) Oh my god. I'm so happy to see you." 
LIAM: What did we interrupt, Joe? 
SAM: We're happy to see you! What-- How-- 
MARISHA: What happened? Yes. 
MATT: On the other side, the woman walks in, the mousy brown fur across her face and the pointed front teeth, one's chipped to one side, these amber colored eyes and the long floppy ears that are jagged at the edges. You see her wrapped in a green upper cloth wrapping with a long robe beneath it. Steps in. (established, worn) "Well, we have suddenly been put to task outside of our preferences. (composing breath) Also, thank you for the alley-oop. (laughs)" 
LIAM: I'm a jumping bean. 
MATT: "These friends of yours, Joe?" (Joe) "Yes. Everyone, this is Verna. Verna the Viper. You may have heard, I don't know." 
TRAVIS: Verna the Viper. What were they known as again? 
LAURA: Does that sound familiar? 
MARISHA: A lagomore? 
SAM: A lagomore. 
MATT: Lagomore. They're a rare folk in Exandria. Fearne, you know all about the lagomore. 
ASHLEY: Yes. This is-- Hi. 
MATT: They're Fey-based in originality. So they don't cross too often into Exandria, let alone make a home here. But they are a hare, bunny folk. 
LAURA: (squeakily) Aw! They're cute! 
MATT: You see her, the hood still up, half caught in the rest of her fur, glances around. Joe goes-- Well, actually you two would know, at least probably a reputation. Specifically you would know. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 
MATT: She's one of the masterminds of what's called the Overmind sect of tinkerers. It's a small circle of peop-- 
SAM: Overmind? 
MATT: The Overmind sect. 
TALIESIN: They specialize in the (mumbles referencing head), or no? 
MATT: She specializes in explosives. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
MATT: Strange, esoteric explosives. 
TALIESIN: Fun. 
MATT: Joe leans forward for a bit. "Well, what can I do to thank you? That was some timing." 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Wait, wait, wait. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: What happened here? 
LIAM: Slow down. What did this crew want with you, Joe? 
MATT: "We should probably not stay for long because there's a lot more of them." 
LAURA: We should get out of here. Maybe we can-- 
ASHLEY: Wait, yeah. 
LAURA: -- go to your parents. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. 
TALIESIN: That's too far out of town. 
MARISHA: Joe, we need you to repair something for us. So, just as long as-- 
SAM: Can we take some tools? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: "What do you need?" 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. 
LIAM: Show him the thing. 
LAURA: Can we search to loot the bodies while you're doing this? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I want to loot the bodies. 
MATT: Sure. 
ASHLEY: I will help. 
TRAVIS: Barricade the front door a little bit. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. Start setting up things. 
TALIESIN: Pull the body out of the back. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: I'll cast Guidance on-- 
LAURA: This is a game. 
LIAM: Somebody's got to do it. 
LAURA: We got to loot the bodies. 
MATT: Hey. 
LIAM: Somebody's got to make that push. 
MATT: Make an investigation check. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. 
SAM: I'm Guiding you. 
TRAVIS: I'll assist you. 
LAURA: I'm looting the bodies. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
TALIESIN: I'll help, too. 
SAM: I'm not keen on it. 
LAURA: Is this an investigation? 
MATT: Yeah. So both of you can roll a d20. 
MARISHA: Loot his corpse, take his vest! 
TALIESIN: (laughs) Fucker. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
SAM: They all have vests. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
LAURA: That's a 24. 
TRAVIS: 23. 
MATT: Nice. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: All right. So, there are shields, hide armor, all manners of regular natural armor. Ratanish has a rather nice looking battleaxe. 
LIAM: That's what I cut out of his hands? 
SAM: Perfect for Laudna. 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (mock battle cry) 
LAURA: Anybody got rings or money? 
MATT: There's also a fairly nice pair of boots on Ratanish as well that look to have resisted much of the dust that usually settles on the soles and surrounding makeup of the boots that walk this land. 
SAM: They're just clean boots. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: We'll take a look at those later. 
SAM: Ooh, maybe if Chetney-- 
MARISHA: He's a sneaker head. 
TRAVIS: Those are some Strongjaw boots. 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: If Chetney wore the clean boots with the bloody vest, maybe they would keep each other in check. 
LIAM: Yeah, maybe the blood would float one foot off the ground around you. 
LAURA: That would be sick. 
MATT: As well as mostly on Ratanish, about a little over 2,000 gold. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: 2,035 gold pieces. 
TRAVIS: Can't take it with you. 
LIAM: Did the-- 
TRAVIS: Boots, axe, 2,000 gold. 
LAURA: Meant more. 
LIAM: -- sneaky lithe one have any weapons? 
MATT: Yeah, had a rapier. 
LIAM: Rapier. 
MATT: A decent rapier. 
LIAM: A decent rapier. 
MARISHA: What about the caster? 
LAURA: Yeah, the caster. 
TRAVIS: The druid. 
MARISHA: The druid. 
MATT: The caster has hide armor and all manner of strange-- 
MARISHA: Components? 
MATT: -- components like bones and little relics and things that he just kept as a decor. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: This one's got bones, Laudna. 
MATT: Paragon's Call attire, necklaces of the Duskmaven. 
LAURA: Yeah, we should take all of them. 
TALIESIN: We're going to put all of this-- 
LIAM: Get all the bones. 
TALIESIN: -- in the hole and dump it somewhere else. 
LAURA: There were seven of them? 
MATT: There were seven of them. 
LAURA: So there's seven necklaces? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: That's great! We each get one. 
TRAVIS: Killer. 
MARISHA: Any higher ranking identification on Ratanish? 
LAURA: A driver's license. 
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, yeah. His passport's on him, thankfully. 
MARISHA: Key fob, passport. 
MATT: It's super helpful. 
ASHLEY: Key fob. 
SAM: He's TSA PreChecked. (laughter) 
MARISHA: He's got Clear? Fuck! 
MATT: With the high enough investigation check, there's no identification. They don't have cards they show, but there is the symbol of the Duskmaven, the same skull, but it's burned like a brand into the top, inside of the left shoulder. You're uncertain what that signifies, but he's the only one that carries it. 
MARISHA: A brand on his left shoulder. 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: But Dancer steps forward. (Dancer) "Joe, nice to see you. Been a weird morning, I'm sure." (Joe) "Oh, Dancer. Hi. Good to see you again." Looks to you and he's like, "What?" 
SAM: We're working together on this one project. We're not back together, just on this one project. She was hoping that you could maybe help us with it. 
MATT: (Dancer) "Yeah, there's something real interesting you should take a look at. There's recent--" 
TRAVIS: Funnel vest. 
MATT: Joe steps forward and as he goes to grasp it, there's this like, boof! As the massive bunny feet of Verna land next to him and she goes, "What is this thing they brought forward here?" He's like, "Ah, it's interesting. I'm looking at it myself." They both begin looking over and whispering notes to each other, and messing around. While they're looking at it, Joe goes, "Oh, what-- They-- After the whole thing and the moon stuff went down, Ratanish and his small crew grabbed us and they've been essentially pressing us to make materials for them." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "Enchanted objects and the explosives. Things-- I don't know what they've been using them for, but from what we've been seeing and hearing from the outside, there seems to be some sort of detonations or attacks within the city on stuff. We weren't allowed to leave, so they had us currently working on another project," and looks to Verna and Verna goes, "Ah, yes, quite. Thankfully, I think you made good fine work of what was partially designed," and points over to this scrap of metal that was in the center of the floor that was destroyed by the Fireball, the initial event. 
SAM: Oh no. 
LAURA: Well. 
MATT: "It was to be a brumestone nullifier, a magical device that temporarily disables brumestone within a few hundred feet for about a minute. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
LAURA: Glad we stopped that, then. 
MATT: "But anyway," and looks back at this thing. They start-- 
SAM: So they've been doing terrorist stuff to any invading forces. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I mean, Paragon's Call is a for hire group, but they're associated with Otohan Thull who's part of the bad guys? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: The God Squad has been showing up in the airships. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: By the way, Orym is listening, but is at the window looking for trouble. 
LAURA: Yeah, we got to get moving. 
TRAVIS: Was there bloomstone in the corridor leading down to the Key? Could we use that? 
SAM: There were in the skyships. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, but not in the interior corridor that pulsed with power. 
LAURA: I don't think so. Not with brumestone. 
MATT: No, not brumestone. 
LAURA: It makes things fly. It wouldn't. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Glancing over it, Imahara Joe goes, "This is definitely a strange contraption. Looks elven make, inscribed with older runes. Some that are pure unique mix of magics that should, don't know if I'm right on this, it should make it unstable." Verna looks close. "Yes, but somehow it's balanced within its construction. Whoever designed this is extremely gifted." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "And while damaged, not in a way that was entirely ruin its ability to function, I don't think with a bit of-- 
SAM: (sneezes) 
LAURA: Bless you. 
MATT: "Gesundheit." 
LIAM: Stop it. 
ASHLEY: Shh. 
MARISHA: Cute! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Can I insight check Verna? Just watching the way they look at this and if they are and what they appear to be. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Cut. 
TRAVIS: Oh! A natural 19. Is it perception? 
MATT: Insight, you said. 
SAM: Insight. 
MATT: The thing you just told me you were doing. (laughter) 
MATT: That one? 
TRAVIS: I don't normally roll insight checks. 
TALIESIN: Mad respect. 
TRAVIS: 24. 
MATT: 24. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! (cheering) 
SAM: Ooh! We got a whisper! Guys, discover Mighty Owlbear Beard Oil from Beard Sorcery. 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: Infused with the strength of the legendary Owlbear. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
SAM: This natural-- 
MARISHA: What? 
ASHLEY: Owlbear. 
SAM: Taliesin's-- This natural elixir adds magic to your beard. With exotic spices and citrusy woody notes you'll feel ready to face the forest's fiercest beasts. Beard Sorcery will be coming out with a Displacer Beast and Mindflayer themed products. Check them out at beardsorcery.com/criticalrole and get 15% off with code criticalrole at checkout. 
LIAM: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Nice! 
MARISHA: Beard Sorcery? 
SAM and TALIESIN: Beard Sorcery! 
SAM: We have a whisper sponsor. 
LAURA: What?! 
LIAM: Here for it. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
SAM: You can sponsor anything I do on this show. 
LAURA: Specifically whispers? 
MATT: That is not true. No. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I look at Verna and I've raise my claws-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: -- and scratch my neck. 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: Is there like stubble cantrips or anything lesser? 
MATT: Imahara Joe goes, "Oh, well, uh, I think we need more time with this, but I--" 
TRAVIS: Sure. 
MATT: "-- I have a grasp of what we, I probably. It seems like it's repairable, it'll--" 
LIAM: Do you have a bug out bag? Do we need to get out here? 
MATT: "Oh, yeah, yes, yes. Uh, um." He runs behind over to the far corner and pulls out a large leather case, that's one of those that snaps together at the top, and hands it to Verna. "All right, so grab this, this, this, there, that." Looks over at the harness again. "I got some supplies here." Starts throwing shit into this bag. Throws it into another side satchel, like a backpack, and puts it over her shoulder, and is grabbing things. While you're looking out the window, you can see that some Gajakhandas soldiers are starting to-- 
LAURA: Uh oh. 
MATT: -- head down there. Three of them. A trio. 
TALIESIN: We should start walking. 
LIAM: Some unwanted attention coming. 
LAURA: We got to go. 
LIAM: Want to go out the back? 
SAM: Just a little point of negativity over here. We blew up all the cars. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Didn't none of them work? 
SAM: I mean, maybe there's some that do, but like, I think it's a long way to get to the FernGully, right? 
ASHLEY: I think it is a long way. 
TALIESIN: We can't-- 
LAURA: Yeah, plus we have to meet Keyleth in a couple hours. We're meeting her at high noon. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: But there was a secret place that-- Hondir? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Like there was a little stowaway place. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: The Hondir Hide? Is that like a safe house? Is that right? Isn't it Hondir? 
LIAM: Hondir, yes. It was way earlier. That was back when we were first getting a look in telescopes, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: That was the small-- 
LIAM: He was a goblin? 
MATT: He was a goblin member of the Grim Verity. 
LIAM: Grim Verity, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Isn't there also that place-- 
MARISHA: Like an in-between point, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We could also hide the All-Minds-Burn and probably not get in too much trouble. 
LIAM: Why don't we-- 
MATT: As soon as you say "All-Minds-Burn," you watch Joe be like-- Look at you like, "What the fuck?" You see Verna go, "What about them?" 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: Oh, is she with them? 
TALIESIN: I'm an old friend of Justi. 
LIAM: Why don't we talk about it-- 
MATT: "Justi--?" 
LIAM: -- as we walk over the flattened fence in the back? 
LAURA: Yeah, we got to go! 
SAM: Where do you think we should go? 
LAURA: Let's go. 
SAM: Okay, let's go. 
MATT: Joe grabs whatever he can. "Look, we'll, we'll, we'll, make it all we can get right now." 
TRAVIS: Extra barricade the front door just to slow them down if they come in. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Pile of bodies or anything? 
ASHLEY: Do you need me to help you carry anything? 
LAURA: Oh yeah, we hid the bodies in the hole. 
MARISHA: We're going to put them all in the hole. 
MATT and LIAM: ♪ Put the bodies in the hole ♪ 
TALIESIN: I already did all that. 
TRAVIS: ♪ (metal scream-singing) ♪ 
TALIESIN: While everyone was talking, I shoved everything in there. 
LAURA: While everybody's talking, I will have Prestidigitationed the blood and stuff like that, anything that's obvious blood. 
TALIESIN: Something clearly blew up. 
MARISHA: As we're on our way-- 
ASHLEY: I'm helping them carry and taking things and putting them in my pocket as we're going. 
SAM: Are you stealing? 
LIAM: Stealing. 
ASHLEY: I'm helping! I'm helping. 
MARISHA: I share some of the trinkets from the druid-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: -- with Fearne. 
MATT: Fair enough. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
MARISHA: I know, do you want this bone? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I do. 
MARISHA: It's a wishbone. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Use it wisely! 
ASHLEY: Thank you! 
MATT: As you heavily begin to finish barricading best you can before the door (heavy knocks). 
MARISHA: I'm going to do a Silent Image that is just a young girl's screaming face that looks like it's a part of the wood and it reaches through and screams and then reaches a hand towards them. 
TALIESIN: We should go out the back. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we go now. 
LIAM: That's the plan, we're walking over the flattened fence. 
MATT: You hear them outside the door, "What the fuck? (panicked breathes)" 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
TRAVIS: We're going, we're going. 
MATT: All right, so, Verna and Joe grab whatever they need or whatever they have around them and you all head out the back door. The fence is bent backwards which means you're not going to have a hard time climbing over, though it's a little cumbersome until you begin to dart into the alleys behind. Joe and Verna and, you know this city pretty well, eventually find yourselves scattered a bit through the various buildings and alleys and small shaded gaps between until you get the sense that you're probably safe for the moment. There's a little breath you can take in. "All right, so, where are we off to?" 
TRAVIS: Hondir? 
ASHLEY: Okay. Hondir or we go-- 
LAURA: Or are we going back to the tree to meet Keyleth. How long has it been? 
MATT: Actually, by this time, I guess, the sun's starting to rise. You have a number of hours until you're supposed to meet up again. 
ASHLEY: Obann's or Hondir's? 
SAM: We just need a place to talk, right? 
LAURA: Okay, yeah. Hondir's. 
SAM: Hondir's place. It was kind of small, but it's close-ish I think. 
TRAVIS: (whispers) A Taste of Tal'Dorei. 
SAM: Taste of Tal'Dorei is close. 
LAURA: It is close by. Taste is really close. 
SAM: Get a booth. 
MATT: Joe goes like, "I, uh, I don't think it's open." Verna is like, "That doesn't mean it has to stop us, yes?" 
LAURA: Let's go. 
SAM: Oh, I like her. 
MARISHA: She's fun. Let's go eat at Taste of Tal'Dorei. 
SAM: Wait, we're going to break into A Taste of Tal'Dorei? 
TRAVIS: It's not open. Yeah, I don't think we need that extra heat. 
LAURA: Okay, fine. 
TRAVIS: We could go hide at Hondir's. 
MATT: (laughs) "We'll just keep stacking it, why not?" 
TALIESIN: We keep walking off. We look weird. This is a town of people who look weird. 
MATT: Okay, I'd like a group stealth check. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace! 
SAM: Doesn't Dancer have a place here? 
MATT: Dancer-- 
TRAVIS: Did? 
LIAM: We just dragged Dancer into a shitstorm. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Sure, sure. I guess we don't want that heat on her. All right, cool. 
MATT: No, no, if he asked and Dancer's like, "Well, look, I left this place for a bit and the place I was staying wasn't mine and I don't know if she'd be willing to help us at the moment." 
LAURA: Right. 
SAM: It's what's-her-name! 
MARISHA: What was her name? 
SAM: Shit. 
MARISHA: I'm sure I've got it. We can find it. 
MATT: I wrote it down. 
TRAVIS: It's probably in my notes, but I don't want to look. 
SAM: Not Eunice. Nura? No. 
LAURA: No, no. 
MATT: Esmer. 
TRAVIS and SAM: Esmer. 
SAM: Esmer? 
TRAVIS: I found it, Esmer. 
MARISHA: Ah! 
SAM: At the Finder's Takers? 
TRAVIS: You guys got to organize your shit better. 
MARISHA: You said Pass Without a Trace? 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
MATT: "She wouldn't be happy with me showing up, let alone me bringing all this in." 
SAM: Sure, sure, sure. Although, last time I talked to her she was sort of, you know, open about fixing things. Just saying. 
MATT: "Maybe another time without all this baggage." 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: "Literally," and points over to Joe. Imahara's like, "(pants) All right, where we going?" 
SAM: Hondir's! 
MATT: All right, so following down to the space where Hondir was keeping his hidden alcove. I do need a general group stealth check. 
TRAVIS: Did we do Pass Without a Trace? 
ASHLEY: Pass Without a Trace. 
SAM: Nice. 
TRAVIS: 34. 
MATT: 34. 
MARISHA: 29. 
MATT: 29. 
SAM: Natural 20. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MARISHA: Hot table. 
LAURA: (mumbles) 22. 
MATT: 22. 
LIAM: 30. 
TALIESIN: 21. 
MATT: Okay. Yeah. At this early hour, with the light slowly creeping into the city, what bit of energies moving around and the sound of growling skirmish-crawlers going through the streets likely looking for you or someone else who's up to some early day business, do not seem to catch your trail, and eventually, you come upon the exterior which you recall to have been Hondir's hidden locale. It is abandoned. It looks like it may have been lived in since and trashed a bit. But it is-- 
SAM: It's empty, though, right? No one's going to come looking here. 
LIAM: (knocks) (knocks) 
MATT: Nothing, no response. 
TRAVIS: Has it been an hour since we left Imahara Joe's? 
MATT: Not quite yet. 
TRAVIS: I'll do a (sniffs) smell check of the interior and take a couple steps in. 
MATT: Perception check with advantage. 
ASHLEY: Why this music? 
LIAM: Why this music, right? 
LAURA: Remember it was super duper trapped the last time. 
TRAVIS: Oh, 19. 
MATT: 19? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: You catch simple smells of a urine puddle in the corner. 
LAURA: Gross. 
SAM: Maybe squatters. 
MATT: Liquor has been long dried and spilled. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Still good. 
MATT: You get the sense that since Hondir left, maybe some squatters came through and then either haven't returned or are going to return. But it's definitely a-- 
MARISHA: Is this where we shot the porn? 
SAM: No. 
TRAVIS: No wafts of anything presently in here? 
MATT: Not presently. The best you can catch, it looks like maybe a person had been here the past day or two. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) We should be clear, but we'll keep it short. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) We're clear. 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: What? 
ASHLEY: We're going in? 
MARISHA and SAM: We were just trying to remember where we shot the porn. (laugh) 
MATT: Oh, that was in Yios. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It was in Yios, all right. 
LIAM: That's where we shot that porn. 
TRAVIS: I'll post up at the door until my (blubbers) form changes, and keep a nose and an eye out. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: You rolled the place, right? You looked in all the corners? 
TRAVIS: I did a smell and there was no other, it didn't smell like anything else was in here besides something that was maybe here a day ago but gone. 
LAURA: Right. 
LIAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: No smells. 
LIAM: I'm going to check every room. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Not a lot of rooms. 
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check. 
LIAM: It's a one. I get to reroll it because I'm not Sam. That is a 27. 
MATT: 27. You feel pretty confident. There aren't a lot of rooms in this chamber, it's maybe two small side closets, this repurposed, basement-like hidden interior. Pretty empty of anything that Hondir had to himself and it's been thrashed ever since. 
LIAM: Cool, cool, cool. 
MATT: So you settle in. Verna and Joe pull out and begin looking over the harness again and spending some time with it. As they're glancing through it, Joe looks over, "Um, if I-- I mean, you don't have to tell me if it's best not to know scenario, but like, where, what is this? Where?" 
ASHLEY: Why? 
MATT: "Maybe help figure out what it's for?" 
SAM: It'll help fix it? 
TRAVIS: (deeply) It's very old. 
LAURA: Super duper. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Hundreds of years old. 
MATT: "Right, I figured that." 
LAURA: It was used to siphon power from fey beings, potentially. 
MATT: "See, that's what interesting. Looking at this, correct me if I'm wrong to what you're assuming, Verna." Verna's like, "Uh, speak out and say your piece." (Joe) "It definitely seems the device, to what you're saying, can attach to a powerful magic source, be it object, location, creature, and channel or siphon much of the source energy to the base of the neck of whoever is wearing this harness. Mind you, raw energies of most types being infused into an incompatible host will likely destroy the host unless they are inscribed with appropriate adaptation runes or share a similar essence. This one--" 
LAURA: He doesn't ever take-- 
LIAM: Oh, he doesn't? 
MATT: Verna and Dancer lean in and Dancer goes, "This one seems specific in its runic tuning, but I imagine it could be adjusted by a powerful enough enchanter once repaired?" Joe nods, "That's certainly possible. The details of such an inscription, however, are beyond me. I'm just an engineer, but the signs of enchantments of that power, I have no grasp on. But this can be repaired. Take me a couple, two to three weeks, probably get some materials I have. But if you're all helping, that'll make that shorter." Dancer goes, "I imagine it would. I mean, you and me together, we can definitely knock this down to a better part of two weeks. Verna?" Verna's like, "Well, I mean, I'm on the run now, aren't I? (laughs) What else am I going to do? Where are we going? What are we doing? Whatever it means, if it means we get to toy with this, and I don't know, do something interesting and strange, I'm in." 
LAURA: I think she'd get along with the Nightmare King, Ira. 
SAM: Ira? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
SAM: Will you need some resources to buy materials and tools and stuff, equipment? 
MATT: "Yes, I don't have anything on me." Joe's like, "Ah, yeah, we're, you know, left everything behind, but you know, I think if we can get out of here and get to a place that has supplies or at the very least access to some raw components. I probably have most of what would be needed to do the repairs within what I grabbed, just a few things I need to supplement that with." 
TALIESIN: Anything you absolutely can only get here? If we were to really get far, far away. 
MATT: "If I'm going to be perfectly honest, it's been challenging to even make what Ratanish was asking us to do because so many supplies were being pulled away by the war effort and all the various ships and soldiers coming through. I might have better luck elsewhere. I don't know where the rest of that supply chain is funneling through Marquet right now." 
SAM: We can give you money. 
MATT: "Money helps, just got to find a place that supplies materials." 
TALIESIN: Money is somewhere else, though. 
MARISHA: So you should get out of Bassuras. 
MATT: "Oh, we have to go. (laughs) My shop is partially destroyed we just-- I was-- The general who held both of us captive is dead and missing." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Allegedly. 
MATT: "So--" 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Where would you go? 
LAURA: Missing really, no one knows if he's dead or not. 
MATT: "I get the sense they'll figure it out quick." 
MARISHA: Maybe they can come with us, Keyleth can drop us off, and then they can go with-- 
LAURA: To Zadash. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: That's brilliant. 
LIAM: That's the plan. 
SAM: To Zadash? 
MARISHA: With Kimothée. 
MATT: You mean Zephrah? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Z! 
MARISHA: We don't know her life. 
LAURA: Yeah, I don't know where she's going. 
MARISHA: She could be going to Zadash. 
ASHLEY: Maybe she is moving to Zadash, yeah. 
SAM: Yios has some stuff, right? They have a college that has stuff, tinkery stuff, but yeah, I think you're right, though. Kimothée could take them wherever they need to go. 
MARISHA: Right. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "I don't think I know this Kimothée." 
LAURA: Oh, you'll meet her soon. 
MATT: "Okay." 
MARISHA: She's new. 
SAM: She's a beautiful waif-like little boy. She plays-- She's in a lot of-- She's in "Dune." (laughter) 
LIAM: She's in a sand dune? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Woof. 
MATT: Joe nods, "Okay, well, I look forward to meeting whoever they are as long as they can get us away from here." 
SAM: Did you see "Call Me By Your Name"? 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Excellent movie. Excellent film. 
LIAM: It's a pretty good flick. 
ASHLEY: It is great. 
MATT: Indeed. 
ASHLEY: Beautiful performances. 
MATT: "Okay, well, I think our minds together we can definitely get this done quicker in the right space, so hopefully this Kimothée person can be helpful." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Where and when do we--" 
LAURA: In a couple hours, we'll be meeting them at a tree. 
MATT: "All right." 
LIAM: A specific one. 
MATT: "I'm sure. Y'all are very, very unique people. It's funny. You bring some interesting chaos into my life and I'm not going to lie, it mixes it up a little bit." 
LAURA: (sneezes) 
MATT: "Gesundheit." 
SAM: Cute! 
LIAM: Stop it. (laughter) 
MATT: "It's Zemnian. I learned that a while back." 
ASHLEY: Verna, where are you from? 
MATT: "Where am I from? I'm from here. (laughs)" 
ASHLEY: Oh, from Bassuras? 
MATT: "Well, most of my life." 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. Born and raised? 
MATT: "No, not really born there. I just kind of stumbled my way here." 
ASHLEY: Hmm. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I get the sense that you have a similar story, hm?" 
ASHLEY: Yes, just made my way here. Just float around, you know? As we do. 
MATT: "Calloway, right?" 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: (stammering) How-- 
SAM: Your parents knew Joe, so-- 
TALIESIN: I'm going to put some money on your parents. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, they knew Joe. How do you-- Did you-- How do you know them? 
MATT: "I know Birdie. I've met your--" 
ASHLEY: You know Birdie. Okay. 
MATT: "-- what I assume is your mother." She looks to you looking for a give or a tell, and is like, "Mm, mm." 
ASHLEY: It is. Have you seen them? 
MATT: "The eyes." "Not recently. But--" 
LAURA: They're probably held up. 
ASHLEY: They're probably-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're probably fine. 
LAURA: Do you want to check on them after everything? 
ASHLEY: Well-- It's all right. It's all right. 
TALIESIN: We're going to have to come back this way eventually, anyway. 
ASHLEY: We have lots to do. Yeah, maybe at some point. 
TALIESIN: Going to check on them is, unless we find a vehicle, is days. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We have a little bit of time. 
MARISHA: Just a little, it seems. 
LAURA: Everybody gets... Everybody gets-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: ♪ (fanfare) ♪ 
LAURA: -- 339 gold. 
SAM: "Everybody gets--" 
LAURA: Except for you, because you don't take money, and I'm not going to keep giving it to you. 
SAM: ♪ Everybody gets ♪ 
LIAM: ♪ Everybody gets now ♪ 
SAM: Everybody gets, everybody gets. 
MATT: So you're going to take a short rest? 
LAURA: Oh, yeah. 
TALIESIN: How long is a short rest? 
LAURA: That's smart. 
MATT: About an hour. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so there's time for some other shit, too. 
MARISHA: 300 what now? 
LAURA: 339.1. So 339. 
SAM: Plus a copper? 
LAURA: Yeah, that's true. You could do that. 
LAURA: Well, how much do you think you would need money-wise? 
MARISHA: Oh, that's true. Maybe we just-- 
SAM: Yeah, for supplies. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- toss this towards them. 
MATT: "I mean, this is some old stuff. But I think the real challenge here, the real pricey bit, is going to be the-- A lot of it's going to be replacement materials. You know? There's a lot of different sources of specific metals and magical focuses and amplification. It's-- Residuum's going to be the tough one to find." 
LAURA and MARISHA: Residuum? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh wait. 
SAM: We had some. 
MARISHA: We had some. 
SAM: We used it? 
MARISHA: We did. I think we still have a tiny baggie. 
SAM: I'm going to look in my inventory, just in case. 
MARISHA: Did we keep a little? 
LAURA: ♪ A teeny tiny baggie of residuum ♪ 
SAM: I wrote box with residuum, but I don't know if we used that. 
MARISHA: Well, we gave some of it back to Kimothée, I think. 
TALIESIN: But not all of it. 
MARISHA: But not all of it. 
SAM: Well, we can give them whatever we have left. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Fucking roll one more. 
LAURA: Then maybe Kimothée would know where to get some more. 
MARISHA: Are you teething up? 
SAM: My inventory has some weird stuff in it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm out of it. 
LAURA: Yeah, do either of you need a "Whitestone is for Lovers" tee, or--? 
SAM: Wooden feet? Drugs. 
MARISHA: Yeah, keep those drugs. 
MATT: "I'm fine. Do you? Verna's like, "I really have no interest, but thank you." 
SAM: I was going to bake them-- 
MATT: Dancer goes-- 
SAM: -- into some brownies. 
MARISHA: I think that's a good idea. 
MATT: (Dancer) "Yeah, I can crop top that." 
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, well, I wasn't really serious, Dancer. I want to keep it for myself. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. FCG. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
MATT: "Fucking rude." 
TALIESIN: I wanted to ask you if you had the gumption to figure out about the boots. 
TRAVIS: Can I shake my wolf form-- 
LAURA: I'm sorry. 
TRAVIS: -- and I'll come over and zip up my tracksuit? 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: So, look. If all the Vasselheim airships have been a-floating around and General Ratanish has probably been having to keep a low profile, right? 
MATT: (Imahara) "I imagine so." 
TRAVIS: Is there a new ruling authority that's calling the shots or digging in the dark crevices of Bassuras now that we need to be wary of? 
MATT: "To be honest, I don't really know. It wasn't long before the solstice went down and my shop's been taken. I mean, we're pushing on almost two weeks since I've really looked outdoors. So--" 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: "But I--" Glances over towards the doorway, though still closed since you're keeping a watch out there, is like, "From what I saw, those ships are out and about, it wouldn't surprise me if a bunch of political favors are being called in, or at least enforced." 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "Bassuras isn't known for its strong local government, so if there's money to be made in stepping out of the way, I'm certain that the Gajakhandas aren't standing up to anything, nor do they have a reason." 
TRAVIS: So they're either shoring up here, staging area, or maybe accompanying somebody of influence? 
MATT: "Your guess is as good as mine. It's kind of outside of my realm of preference and understanding. So..." 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Fair enough. 
LIAM: Is it maybe a staging ground before they head in? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Makes sense. 
MATT: "Could be. We'll keep poring over this harness and make sure we have enough and all the materials required when we do finally get to a place to work on this." 
LIAM: Two weeks. 
MATT: "Well, with all three of us together, maybe even less. Once again, this is all very new, and we're just taking a crack shot at estimating this. So it could take more, could take less. Three of us working together with decent supplies and even a makeshift workshop, I think we could do okay. Maybe if this, you know, Kimothée knows of a good--" 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: "-- a good place to get tinkering work done, that might help out." 
SAM: Wait. Isn't she friends with the Whitestone guy? 
TALIESIN: We could send them to Whitestone. 
SAM: He's a tinkerer. 
TALIESIN: That's apparently where we had to-- 
TRAVIS: A metal tinkerer. 
TALIESIN: -- drop all the residuum off. 
SAM: Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah, but still, he's a tinkerer. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, kind of. 
TALIESIN: You don't tinker wood, man. 
ASHLEY: Brilliant inventor. 
TALIESIN: I don't know where you'd even-- Not to snip at you about it. 
SAM: He had all kinds of great stuff. 
TRAVIS: You don't tinker with wood. 
SAM: And he's got money. 
TRAVIS: You make love to wood. 
SAM: He's got resources. 
TRAVIS: It's reciprocal. 
SAM: They said that their production, the line of their production-- 
MATT: "Who the hell are you talking about?" 
SAM: Oh, his name was Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III. 
ASHLEY: He made my son a gun. 
TALIESIN: Do you work at Starbucks? Sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) You see Joe's eyes go a bit wide. 
SAM: I always get a flat white with vanilla. 
MATT: "The Terrible Tinkerer of Tal'Dorei?" 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: He has an alliterative nickname? 
MATT: "I mean, I've heard tales--" 
TRAVIS: Terrible Tinkerer? 
MATT: "-- and jokes and all sorts of weird--" 
TALIESIN: That asshole's got a nickname? 
TRAVIS: Like what? 
MATT: "Things." 
SAM: Yeah, we met him. He was not a nice guy, but his wife-- 
LAURA: No, he's grumpy. 
SAM: His wife was great. 
LAURA: And hot. 
SAM: Kimothée's a friend of his, and he's got another friend who's a good baker and also heals people. 
TALIESIN: Some weird kids. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: This is Pâté de Rolo III. 
SAM: Oh, that's right! 
MATT: (Pâté) "Hi, how's it going?" He's like, "Oh, jeez!" 
MARISHA: Terrible Tinkerer of My Heart. 
MATT: "Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: "Hi. Hi, Pâté." 
SAM: The Rotten Rodent of de Rolo? 
MATT: "Nice to meet you." It looks like Pâté merges into your shoulder. (squelches) 
MARISHA: Into my hair. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Okay. Great. Well." 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "I am very curious to see what sort of facilities this tinkerer might have." 
SAM: We caught a glimpse of his house, and it was awesome. 
MATT: "Well, I guess we'll check in." 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: I have a question-- 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: -- though. If we go to the Slival Islands, we're going to find this Jirana, and we're going to look for this tree. 
TRAVIS: Okay, what's happening? 
TALIESIN: Evontra'vir, yes. Yes. 
MARISHA: Yes. We're not going to need this funnel for that, right? 
TRAVIS: We don't know. 
LAURA: I don't know. 
MARISHA: Right. 
SAM: But we can't do anything with it anyway. I mean, it's not fixed. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TALIESIN: It's best to let them work on it, and we move forward with our next-- 
LAURA: While we go. 
MARISHA: But I say-- 
LAURA: What if we go and we need it there? 
MARISHA: What if we go and we need it and I just don't want it to be a waste of time. 
LAURA: What if we can fix the funnel? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Then we can find some way to reverse it so that we can siphon the power out of Ludinus. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I mean, it was made for him, right? 
TRAVIS: Maybe we can mention that to them. 
SAM: Once it works, then we can try to figure out how to use it. 
MATT: "The process of using it is more of a-- How do I describe it? It looks like it's essentially a minor ritual. The source has to be present or bound, and the funnel is then attached to the focal point in the back, and it draws the energy out of them within a few minutes. Though it will likely destroy whatever the source of power is unless it's a massive source. I mean, if it's an individual, if it's a person, it will likely wither whatever life force they have unless they are of celestial or more powerful essence out there." 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: "If you say a fey was using this, then unless they are of archfey level, I doubt they would survive the experience. But if it's a larger power source, if it's a location, if it's a place, I imagine it could also be done. But it's-- Hopefully I'll figure out more as we look at it, but I don't think it's an instantaneous thing, if that makes sense." 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: It just sucks it in? 
MATT: "But, I mean, once we figure out how to repair it, that doesn't--" and Verna finishes the sentence, (Verna) "-- mean that we can't make alterations." 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Are you part of the hive mind people, the burning-- 
TALIESIN: All-Minds-Burn. 
MARISHA: The All-Minds-Burn people? 
MATT: "(laughs) I've dabbled and partied a bit with some of their folks. Why do you ask?" You can see the eyes have that little bit of the darker, almost ashen shadow at the edges. 
MARISHA: Yes, you just strike me as a dabbler. That's all. 
MATT: "I've been known to dabble." 
MARISHA: Mm. Fun. So. 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah, I think we've got a good plan. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: They're going to go to Whitestone, hook up with Percy. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Fix this thing. I'm sure he'll be like, yeah, come into my house and fix this. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm sure Percy will be welcoming and-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- say oh, whatever you need. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: If Keyleth is with him. 
SAM: If Kimothée is with them, then they'll be okay. So maybe we should go meet her now? 
LAURA: It's probably been long enough at this point, right? 
MATT: I mean, we can. We can wait-- 
TALIESIN: I would love to shake a couple trees, if possible, because I know we're coming back here. 
MARISHA: Literally? 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Shake a couple trees-- 
TALIESIN: Shake a couple trees. 
TRAVIS: -- here before we leave? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I want to put some word out to see if we're going to-- Since we're going to be back here, I want to try and wrangle up some friends. I should probably not go alone, so. 
SAM: Have we taken a short rest? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. We just did. 
LAURA: We took a short rest. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Roll as many dice as you want. 
TALIESIN: I'd say anybody who can do long-distance communication would be really nice. 
LAURA: Okay. I'll come. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TALIESIN: Boy, that vest makes me think, makes me wonder if Ludinus is actually elven or if he was even wearing it for himself at all. Was he powering something or somebody else up? 
ASHLEY: Or putting it on people and killing them? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Taking in-- 
LAURA: I think he was pulling it into himself. 
ASHLEY: I think so, too. 
TRAVIS: Maybe. We still don't know what Predathos is-- 
TALIESIN: Who knows for how long either. 
LAURA: But when this was made, I don't even think-- I mean, Ludinus wasn't thinking about Predathos when he was making this. It was like he was-- 
TRAVIS: Do we know that for sure? 
LAURA: No, but it really wasn't part of his notes too much, you know? He had a ton at the time, and it was all about extending life and-- Right? 
MATT: Primarily a lot of the notes dealt with extending lifespan. There seemed to be an underlying obsession with, in a very Ray Kurzweil way, stay alive long enough to figure out how to finish your still-in-process plan.
LIAM: We've gotten a number of threads indicating that he's been around longer than makes sense. 
MATT: Correct, even by his own admission, perhaps even as long as the Calamity or somewhere during that time, which would put him over 800 years, you know, almost nine centuries old at the minimum. 
LIAM: Elves normally live 'til 40, so that's a long-- 
TRAVIS: Kind of makes me want to put FCG in it and-- Where was that place you were from, the ancient city? 
SAM: Yios? Aeor. Aeor. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Put you in Aeor and get you all like (energy whirring) 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh, if we went to Aeor and you sucked up the power from Aeor back into yourself. 
SAM: What do you mean go to Aeor? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. You got a power source and FRIDA had a power source. I mean, if you can (slurping). 
SAM: I could just be a big battery? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: You made a straw sound. I don't know if that's a battery. 
MARISHA: Joe did say that we could, if we find power sources that match our vibes-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, share an essence. 
MARISHA: Share an essence. So we can go to Aeor for you. For me-- 
TRAVIS: Graveyard. 
MARISHA: -- we can go to a graveyard, exactly. It'll be great. 
TRAVIS: A mortuary. 
SAM: Do we have a plan of what to do with all this power? 
LAURA: Be strong. 
SAM: Oh, okay. Okay. 
LAURA: Destroy Ludinus to save the world. 
TRAVIS: Step one, absorb essence. Step two. Step three, profit. 
SAM: Profit. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Plans being written in real time. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: We've got the beginning and we've got the end. Now we just have to figure out the middle part. 
MARISHA: What if Imogen and I go to the moon and suck in moon power? 
LAURA: And suck up Predathos. 
TALIESIN: That's what I'm thinking. 
MARISHA: Suck up the Predathos! 
SAM: You're going to suck up the moon? 
MARISHA: And, Fearne, we can go back to the Fey Realm and you can suck up Nana Morri. 
ASHLEY: Suck up all the fey? 
TRAVIS: We can find the Wolf-King. 
LAURA: Oh, the Wolf-King. 
ASHLEY: The Wolf-King. Wolf-King, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Well? 
TRAVIS: These are all good ideas. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Great ideas. 
SAM: There's no bad ideas. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Except these. 
TALIESIN: Just bad people. 
SAM: We're just-- 
LIAM: Maybe actually learn what the thing is. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. They should work on it for a while. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to quietly back out of the room, and we're going to not say goodbye. 
SAM: So you two are going to go off and-- 
TALIESIN: We'll be back in a little bit. 
LAURA: I'm going to put my hood up. 
MATT: Okay. All right. Where are you off to? 
TALIESIN: I want to head towards the Deathwish, and I'm going to start asking around about Pocket and see if we can find anybody who knows where that fuck is. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
SAM: Good old Pocket. 
LAURA: ♪ Go Pocket ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Pocket's a great name. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: So is it the two of you? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I needed somebody who putting everybody who can-- 
SAM: Is awesome. 
LIAM: Can phone home. 
TALIESIN: -- kick ass is one thing, quietly kick ass, but no one expects anything you're going to do. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You can yell for help if shit goes sideways, which it might. 
MATT: So you ask around for Pocket. 
TALIESIN: I do. Old friend. Great one. 
MATT: Some old connections. Make a persuasion check for me. 
TALIESIN: All right. Persuasion checks. Those go really well. Can I add 20 gold to that persuasion check? 
MATT: Yeah, you can. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Yeah, you can. 
TALIESIN: Thank god. 
MATT: Lowers the DC. 
TALIESIN: Nine with my negative two to seven. 
MATT: (sighs) Unfortunately, it looks like with recent events here in the city, Pocket has gone underground, like a number of other figures who work in some dubious spaces, they've either found work outside of the city or at the very least, they're not wanting to work in the presence of a lot of powerful temple soldiers and figures who might loom a little larger with outside law ideals. 
TALIESIN: That's the one nice thing about going home. Plan B is really easy, so. You're about to see some weird shit, and I really apologize-- Actually, oh boy. 
LAURA: I'm excited to see some weird shit. 
TALIESIN: Keep your mind sharp and try not to read anybody's-- Yeah, don't read anybody's mind. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to go find fucking Justi. Shit. 
MATT: Okay, so you are-- 
TALIESIN: All-Minds-Burn. 
MATT: -- heading to the palace of the All-Minds-Burn. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to do a loop, and then if all else fails, Greymoore is my last shot if this doesn't work. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. So in following Ashton around the early morning hours, the lights of the sky becoming pinks and oranges to eventually the brighter, welcoming lights of the moonlit sky, you can see the glittering rainbow-scape of the still existing solstice magical weave up in the stratosphere, and there still, the looming red moon silently lording over the entirety of the valley. You come upon a somewhat impressive structure of pale stone and simple arches with a large green glass dome that sits in the central portion of the structure's chamber. As you approach the simple archway entrance, it's very dark, and you can already see on the windows that face outside that there's a sepia stain to the glass that is thicker along the edges, almost like a burned out building, the smoke would change the coloration around the stone and the glass. You follow Ashton up the steps, and stepping into the shaded interior. Your eyes have to adjust from the brighter light to the very, very dark inside. In here, you see this massive chamber is scattered bits of furniture, tables and chairs and cushions and pillows. Strips of cloth hang and dangle from the ceiling, partially covering the slightly dirtied green glass dome that the light filters through above, giving everything inside this almost aquarium feel. 
LAURA: Does it feel like anything's very different from the last time we were here? Has it changed a lot, or is it the same sort of vibes? 
MATT: Not really. It's a similar-- 
TALIESIN: That's right. 
MATT: So you had been here previously with him? 
TALIESIN: Yes, that's right. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You've been all around. 
MATT: So this would be familiar to you. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Mostly unchanged. As you enter, there are a number of sleeping figures scattered around and a few that are awake. Two you see that are playing a card game. There are three that are off to the side, holding these elongated pipes that curl up into their mouth. They're gently having a morning smoke. But as you step within, everyone in the chamber that's awake shifts over and looks towards you, and that little bit of light hits their eyes like a flashlight catching a cat in the distance. 
LAURA: (sarcastically) This place is so much fun. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) Had some good times here. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm looking for Justi. It's kind of important. 
MATT: You hear a voice from up the way say, "You're looking for Justi, you say? Who the fuck do you think you are?" You see a woman in her late 20s, pale-ish gray skin with tattered black hair that goes over one eye, a shock of white in it, with black studded leather that's torn at the elbows, pale skin showing through with fingerless gloves. You can see a shoulder pauldron on this side, of dented-ass fucking metal. She pulls a dagger out and flips it in her hand and looks to you. You know this person. Shady Sally stands before you. 
TALIESIN: Fuck me, okay. 
LAURA: Who's Shady Sally? 
SAM: Shady Sally. 
LAURA: In your head, you hear: Who the fuck is she? 
MATT: "As I fucking live and breathe." 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
SAM: Shady Sally. 
MATT: "Well, pleasant surprise to see you're still alive." 
TALIESIN: It's nice to hear it's pleasant. 
MATT: "(laughs)" 
TALIESIN: You're just the one I was looking for. 
MATT: "You're looking for Justi." 
TALIESIN: No, I'm looking for you. 
MATT: "Looking for me? What do you want from me?" 
TALIESIN: We've got some debts to settle, and I feel like we're running out of time to settle them, times being what they are. 
MARISHA: Yeah, she was with Ashton's group. 
MATT: "Uh-huh." 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: We've heard of her. 
TALIESIN: This is Imogen, by the way. My new crew. 
MATT: "Hi." 
LAURA: In your head, you hear: Howdy. 
TALIESIN: This-- 
MATT: In your head back, you hear, "Howdy to you." There's this faintest little buzz in the back of her mind, and you sense in that moment as you open your mind a little bit to hers, you feel there is a presence of a mind throughout everyone in this chamber as they all look on. 
TALIESIN: Are you staying here these days? 
MATT: "In and out, yeah." 
TALIESIN: Is everybody else still around? 
MATT: "I don't know. We've all-- We've all gone our own ways. I stumbled back into town following the, following where the business is going down, you know? The red glow. It's hard to ignore. There's money to be made or stupid decisions to die to, so." 
TALIESIN: Well, I'm leaning into stupid decisions right now, so. This is one of the Nobodies, that group of people who left me bleeding on the street after everything went fucking bad. 
LAURA: Oh. I've heard so much about you. 
MATT: "Let's be fair. Tables turned, you would've left me, done the same." 
TALIESIN: You know-- 
MATT: "You were pretty fucking broken." 
TALIESIN: (sighs) I promise, just one. I take a punch. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: Oh wow! 
MATT: Roll for an attack. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
TRAVIS: I love it. Everybody in the joint eyeballing you. 
ASHLEY: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, not reckless, I'm just going to go for it. I'm not really doing it with anything other than unarmed. That's kind of shitty. 12. 
MATT: 12. She's not defending herself. But as you go to give the punch-- 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: -- she lifts her hand and catches it. 
SAM: Ooh. Cool. 
MATT: Looks to the side of the fist. "You can do better than that." 
TALIESIN: Take one. It's your turn. 
MATT: She drops the fist. "Justi, you awake? You're not going to want to miss this!" And darts in with an elbow towards you. Natural one. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yes! 
MATT: How do you fuck up her day? 
TALIESIN: Honestly, I'm going to take it and Erratic Defense. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Just to fucking scare her. 
MATT: Roll to see what happens. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fun. It's time. She goes very, very slow. 
MATT: (descending time) 
TALIESIN: I just tip her over. 
MATT: Time suddenly picks up. (time increases) (thumping) Stumbles a bit. You watch as she hits. All the other heads look over, and are all watching in unison as she moves, and you hear, crawling out of the cloth, the shifting. (Justi) "Oh, Ashton, you're here." 
TALIESIN: It's good to see you. 
MATT: "It's been some time, some time indeed. Good to see you. Oh, she fell. She stumbled, poor thing." 
TALIESIN: I put my hand down to help Sally up. 
MATT: Sally knocks the hand away and gets up. (Sally) "It's early. I haven't had my breakfast." 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MATT: Reaches into her pouch and (sniffs). 
TALIESIN: I spent all this time indentured to that fucking bitch, paying off your debts, and now, we're going to get even. We're going to be dealing with the fucking big red fucking ball in the sky. The gang needs to get back together, and they need to get here. We're not getting the gang officially back together, but you're really fucking good at what you do, and we're going to need everybody who's good at what they fucking do. If you can find everybody, if you can be ready when shit goes down, I will never darken your door again. 
MATT: "I can't make any promises." 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MATT: "People are hard to find these days, Ashton." Justi lands on one of the upper platforms, on the edge of a table. (Justi) "Need people, friends? What for?" 
TALIESIN: We're going to save the world. 
MATT: "(laughs)" Everybody else in the room starts chuckling together. 
TALIESIN: Want to read my mind? 
MATT: There's an odd stillness as all the laughter stops at once. 
TALIESIN: You haven't been in here yet, have you? This is a fucking fun house. I'd be very careful. 
MATT: (rapid shifting) Justi all of a sudden is right up in your face, their pointed, curved, end of the beak right up against your nose. "Okay. There's someone I'd like you to meet." 
TALIESIN: Yeah, lead on. 
MATT: "I would-- Please, follow me. I would ask– I would ask you to wear a mask. Just in case." 
TALIESIN: Sally, genuine pleasure. Not a lie. Look forward to seeing you work again, give it your best shot. 
LAURA: You should get something to eat. Give yourself a little strength. 
MATT: She grabs a stool and pulls it up real fast, sits down. 
TALIESIN: You guys are such an upgrade. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LAURA: In your head: Have you ever done this before? 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: What's the mask for? 
TALIESIN: Don't know, I've never been this far in. 
LAURA: Great. 
TALIESIN: It's going to be fine. 
LAURA: There's something big. I mean, I'm sure you know that. But there's something big in all their heads. 
TALIESIN: It's not bigger than what's in yours, and that's what we're here for. Ride or fucking die. You don't fucking leave people. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I head in. 
MATT: All right. You follow Justi towards the back of the chamber, towards one of the haphazard, curved bars that sits on the edge. There is a doorway that leads to a split hallway and a chamber, a simple chamber door across from where the hallways splits. Justi turns back and looks at you both, pushes the doorway open. 
LAURA: Should we have a mask on? Was she serious about the-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. 
LAURA: I'm putting something over my face. I don't know what the hell-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Absolutely. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Grabs a lantern off the nearby hook, and sparks it to light, lighting up the interior of the walls here. You can see the stone walls in here all have this black, spotted crawl, a creep to them, like a black mold infestation or some sort of a discoloration from some sort of influence. The scent is mustier still further down this pathway. "Yes, yes. Right this way, come. It asked for you." 
LAURA: If I lower the defenses a little bit, can I hear anything? I think I sensed it before, the last time I was here. 
MATT: You lower your defenses ever so slightly. Roll a wisdom saving throw for me. 
LIAM: Let's go, Shade Mother. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
LAURA: 12. 
MATT: 12. There is an oppressive mind present, and the minute you show but a simple opening, like a hungry investigator pushing into a crime scene, it forces its way into your will, whatever this presence is, and it pushes against you mentally. Not quite invasive, but definitely anxiety-inducing. This presence is alien. It is not like anything you've experienced. It is fractured, but unified. It is odd. 
LIAM: "Fractured but Whole." 
MATT: But not dangerous. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Yet. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: The smell of this mustiness-- 
LAURA: Okay, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: -- it becomes almost citrusy at times, in a not pleasant way. 
LAURA: Like moldy? 
MATT: Like old rotting fruit that blends in with drying moss. 
MARISHA: Fermenting lemons. 
MATT: As you-- 
LAURA: Laudna would really like this perfume. 
MATT: It's odd, because-- 
TALIESIN: Remember it, you can share. 
MATT: The progressively thickening of this blackened creep would normally come with increased moisture for a subterranean space, but it is bone dry here. As you progress down the staircase, the creep becomes textured, like slightly reflective veins of dull, pus-colored green and yellow. 
SAM: (retching) 
LAURA: (grossed out laugh) 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (grossed out noises) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: (retching noise) 
MARISHA: Pus-colored, just that phrase. 
SAM: Like a flat white with vanilla. 
MARISHA: (grossed out noise) 
MATT: The stairs almost seem soft under your feet as you're no longer touching stone as you walk. 
TALIESIN: No. I have a theory. Carry on. 
MATT: As you step into the bottom of this staircase following Justi, who eagerly scrambles forward, the light of their torch meeting the dull glow of the interior of this subterranean cellar, this massive palace cellar, you see what looks like a mass of organic matter, of that same twisting yellows and greens with striations of black that stretch and pull. You see what looks like skeletal remains bound and attached and held within, skulls pushing through or occasional hands that are all tied up into it. There's this faint glow just beneath the skin-like surface of this whole mass that rises up 15, 20 feet to a ceiling that you can't quite make out. 
TALIESIN: Jesus fuck, Justi. What the fuck have you been getting into? 
MATT: "This is-- This is us, or what brings us together." 
LAURA: How old is this? 
MATT: You watch as the entire structure pulses, almost like a muscle tensing, and all the bits of skeletal matter seem to move and shift and look in your direction as you feel that presence again in your mind. It doesn't speak with words, but thought, replicated emotion, like it's learned from watching others, but the facsimile of these thoughts are not quite natural to itself. Justi speaks up. "This is the All-Minds-Burn." 
TALIESIN: Who were those people? 
MATT: "They were those who eventually, at the end of their days, rejoined. Those of us eventually rejoin when it's time." 
LAURA: Wow. It's very special for you. 
MATT: It's almost hard to speak, the air is so dry here. The moisture is almost pulled out of your throat as you speak. 
TALIESIN: They-- It, they, you want to talk. 
LAURA: I'm going to reach out mentally to it. 
SAM: Nice. 
TALIESIN: Ooh boy. 
LAURA: How old are you? 
MATT: The splash of images and memories of the individuals who are part of this mass, not fully gone, while their body is left, it still holds a fraction of life connected to this. You see many lifetimes go by. Hundreds of years, maybe. Not as ancient as other parts of Exandria. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: But you get the sense that it's been-- It's a slow expansion. 
LAURA: Where do you come from? 
MATT: It isn't quite sure, but it, it wants to meet more. It's just, this is its home and it's hard for it to go further. But it lives a little bit through the eyes of those that take of it. You realize now the smell of the interior of this chamber is the very similar smell as to what people were smoking in the chamber above. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: I was curious about that. 
TALIESIN: So this is it. 
ASHLEY: That's gross. 
MARISHA: Dime bag of drugs we have just-- 
TALIESIN: This is what your dad was up to. Jesus. 
LAURA: Ashton, are you planning on recruiting? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. I think-- I think I might be dangerous. I might hurt it. 
MATT: "Don't hurt it. Don't hurt us." 
TALIESIN: I wouldn't. It wouldn't be intentional. I'm broken. This is not-- I don't know what this would do to you. 
MATT: Justi looks back at the mass as it (gelatinous schlorping) undulates slightly, and you feel in your mind it's-- You do sense with your words that it is reticent to try and connect with Ashton. It's putting its energy towards you because of that and because of the, the gravity that your mind is to entities apparently like this. You sense that it is probing your memories a bit. It's cross-referencing and cross-checking your experiences with-- 
LAURA: I'm letting it. 
MATT: You're not resisting? 
LAURA: I'm not resisting that. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: It pulls, you see flashes of your childhood riding horses as a kid, scraping your knee, destroying a part of Bassuras, drinking water from a river with your father, remembering your first cry as you were born under the red light of the moon. Pulling back to watching Laudna die, to being a young girl collecting fire bugs, to stepping through the dark shadow of this chamber, to being above the moon and seeing Exandria in the sky before you. Then it withdraws slightly. You get the sense that it wants to help. 
LAURA: It'll put an end to all of us, to you. 
MATT: It acknowledges it. 
TALIESIN: Does it understand? 
LAURA: I think so. I don't know how it can help, though. 
TALIESIN: I-- 
LAURA: If we took part of you with us, if we had people inhale, would you be able to see through them or use them? 
MATT: You get the sense that it might be able to temporarily do so, but its strongest connection takes time. However, it recalls, again, parts of your memory. The dust storms, the red, the dry, arid landscapes. And there is a longing, a curiosity. 
LAURA: You want to see the moon? 
MATT: A little portion of its central stalk-like form, I could call, seems to split slightly and a hard shell, about the size of an orange, (sloughing) (soft, bouncing thuds) rolls out and lands about a foot from your feet. Justi goes, "Huh. The Brood Pit." 
SAM: (softly) The Brood Pit. 
MATT: "Of course, yes. Take it with you. Yes, yes." 
MARISHA: What? 
TRAVIS: Dude, what the fuck? So fucking cool. 
TALIESIN: I'll pick it up. 
TRAVIS: So different. 
LAURA: I'm not touching it. 
TALIESIN: I'll pick it up. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Did it spit out a baby? What just happened? 
TALIESIN: What do I need to do? 
LAURA: An egg? 
TALIESIN: What do we do with this? 
LAURA: Do we bury it? 
MATT: It thinks to a second and you recall being in the storm, being in the red. 
LAURA: Incubator. 
MATT: "It wants to be seeded." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Franchises. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LAURA: Okay, yeah. 
MATT: "Maybe you have our aid. There are many of us who are part of it. When you would need us, we could be at your aid. All that we ask, all that they ask, all that it asks is if you go, take it with you and leave it there. (laughs)" 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's not the first dumb thing I've done because you asked. I-- We'll be back. 
LAURA: This is a very strange day. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Thank you for trusting me, us." 
TALIESIN: Yes. Almost never steered me wrong. Almost never. Try and find the others. Try and get Shady to get her shit together. We're going to need everybody. 
MATT: The mind pushes into you once more. It's not pushy, it's just adamant. You sense it will. When it offers to help, you get a glimpse of the many, many minds throughout the city, the valley, and a handful beyond that it can call upon when the time is right. 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: Justi walks up to the central stalk, this horrible, mutated mass of fungus and decay. Vibrant in its odd, shiny, but dry and flexible, but in some places hardened exterior. It's a horrifying sight. If you weren't somewhat certain it wasn't a threat to you right now, as Justi steps up and runs its fingers across and says, "It means no harm. It's just lonely." 
LIAM: (retches) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Thanks, Justi. I appreciate this. It's very special. 
MATT: "Yes, yes it is." 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MATT: "Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Hmm." 
MARISHA: I like her. 
SAM: I like her. 
MATT: "Come, come." You watch as two figures come in with small pails, it looks like, and some scraping tools, and pass you as you exit and Justi leads you back up inside. Now, everyone who was staring bows their heads to you in unison as you emerge into the central chamber. 
TALIESIN: We'll be back. 
MATT: "Ah, I know." 
LAURA: (laughs nervously) 
MATT: "I know." 
TALIESIN: And everybody get ready. 
MATT: "We will." 
LAURA: We'll be calling. 
MATT: Sally's gone. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Find the others. Thanks. 
LAURA: Well. That is not what I expected it to be. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (sighs) Thinking back on her dad, everything makes a lot more sense now. He was weird. 
LAURA: That was like a big ball of mucus that-- Okay. 
TALIESIN: Don't judge. 
LAURA: No, I mean it seemed just pleasant, super pleasant. We're going to put it on Ruidus. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It liked you. 
LAURA: I liked it. I liked it. 
TALIESIN: You have yet another collection of truly bizarre, broken things following you around now. 
LAURA: Well, following us around, Ashton. 
TALIESIN: No, I appreciate it, believe me. I feel-- I've run with crews before, but I've never, never felt important, and yeah. Every hit feels like a hit someone else doesn't have to take. That feels good. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You, especially you and Laudna, are-- Everybody. 
TALIESIN: It's not destiny. We, we matter. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's been a long time feeling like, feeling like we were just, I mean, I don't know about you, taking up space that was meant for someone else, right? 
TALIESIN: Man. 
LAURA: It's nice, in a weird way. 
TALIESIN: I've spent my entire life taking up space and being ignored. I'm starting to learn that it's the things you ignore that really get you in the end. And, it's one by one. 
LAURA: Ashton, you're so special. 
TALIESIN: I know. That's why I am fighting for you. It's because you are fucking special, too, and we all know it. And we will get you up there. 
LAURA: We'll get up there. We're going to do this. 
MARISHA: You're special. 
SAM: I know. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) Let's go take these fuckwads to the moon. 
LAURA: (laughs) Let's go plant an egg on a moon. 
TALIESIN: A big, slimy, skeletal, gross, smokable-- 
LAURA: Smokable. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: What the fuck. 
TALIESIN: Brain tree. Drugs she used to-- Okay, yeah, we'll get into that conversation later. 
TRAVIS: Got a little cyst fragment seed. 
LAURA: Oh, sweet. 
MARISHA: It's some dank shit. 
MATT: Any other business you want to attend to? 
TALIESIN: No, no, I've got the kid. The call has gone out to the assholes. I am perfectly fine. 
MATT: All righty. As the day continues on and you have a short time before the mid-noon sun reaches the height of the sky at its zenith, the both of you return to the rest of your troop there in the hiding spot. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (drawn out) It's mid-noon. 
MATT: Avoid at all costs. 
TALIESIN: It's mid-day. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You should definitely share some of that sense memory, you know, with the right people. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
TALIESIN: You know, it's more a-- 
MARISHA: Laudna looks around to everyone. 
TRAVIS: What are you doing? It's not necessary right now, relax. 
MARISHA: Ashton and Imogen are gone. 
TALIESIN: Well, yeah. 
SAM: You think? 
MARISHA: It's finally happened. 
TRAVIS: What do you mean? 
MARISHA: Ashton's abducted Imogen! 
SAM: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: Whoa, where's all the-- 
MARISHA: He snapped! 
TRAVIS: Where'd this paranoia come from? 
MARISHA: I just knew it would happen! 
LIAM: You've been waiting for this? 
MARISHA: He's clearly the most likely. 
TRAVIS: Where's Pâté? Pâté! 
SAM: He is? 
MATT: "Hey, what's going on? Goodness." 
TRAVIS: Hey, look, Pâté. We don't usually call on you very much. Talk some sense into this bitch, will ya? (laughter) 
MATT: "I regret to inform you, tiny fuzzy man, I only take orders from her." 
TRAVIS: Ah, sheesh. 
MARISHA: You know, you don't-- 
MATT: "What?" 
MARISHA: You don't trust them either. Ashton, the big rock person. 
MATT: "I don't know, I think he's actually pretty nice." 
MARISHA: Shut up! 
MATT: "(startled noise)" 
TRAVIS: I tried to tell you! 
LAURA: Hello, hello! 
SAM: (gasps) 
MARISHA: (gasps) You were gone for so long. 
TALIESIN: We've seen things. 
LAURA: What? 
TALIESIN and LAURA: (laugh) 
LAURA: We've seen things. 
TALIESIN: So many things. 
ASHLEY: I've seen things. 
LIAM: It was like an hour and 20 minutes. 
LAURA: What? What's going on here? 
SAM: Laudna was freaking out a little bit, thought that maybe you guys had-- 
ASHLEY: Ashton kidnapped you and-- 
SAM: Ashton had kidnapped you. 
TALIESIN: No, that's very reasonable, that absolutely could've happened. 
LAURA: Were you worried? 
MARISHA: I didn't know you left. I'm sorry. I was very distracted by talking about vibes and how we can siphon energy and I didn't know what was going on. 
LAURA: I go hug her. 
MARISHA: (sobs) 
SAM: Ashton, I forgive you for kidnapping Imogen. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LAURA: I saw a giant mucus brain. 
TALIESIN: It's true. 
LAURA: He had skeletons stuck in him, Laudna. You would've loved it. 
LIAM: What does that mean? 
TALIESIN: Exactly what it sounds like. 
MARISHA: What? 
LAURA: It smelled like rotten fruit and pus. 
TALIESIN: Grapefruit-y. Yeah. 
MARISHA: It sounds nice. 
TALIESIN: Yet dry. 
LAURA: So dry, it sounds like it would be wet-- 
SAM: Dry puss. 
LAURA: -- but it was dry. 
TRAVIS: (retches) 
LAURA: But it was slimy. 
SAM: That is a combination. 
LIAM: Where did you have the pleasure? 
TALIESIN and MATT: (laugh) 
LAURA: All-- 
SAM: Tell us on the way. 
LAURA: All-Minds. 
SAM: We got to go meet Kimothée. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Kimothée. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Keylethmée. 
MATT: Joe's like-- 
LAURA: Pay-pea. 
MATT: "That sounds like a fascinating morning." (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Always never dull at the All-Minds-Burn. 
MATT: Gathers supplies. Dancer, Joe, and Verna grab their things. You exit from the squatted hidden space and trudge through the city once more, now in the daylight. I would like the whole group to make a stealth check. 
TALIESIN: I will be using Pass Without A Trace. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: (French accent) Without a Trace! 
TALIESIN: ♪ Pass Without a Trace ♪ 
MARISHA: Diddle dum. 
LIAM: Biddle, biddle (tongue waggling). 
LAURA: Nice. 
TRAVIS: That's c-c-cocked. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
LAURA: C-c-c-c-c. 
MARISHA: That was a journey that ended poorly. 
TALIESIN: Made me sad, but that's better. Where's my stealth? There's my stealth. 26. What? No, wait. 36. 
MATT: 36. Dang. Orym. 
LIAM: 32. 
MATT: 32. 
LIAM: I'm small. 
LAURA: 28. 
MATT: 28. 
TALIESIN: It's my town. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, 16. 
TALIESIN: Plus 10? 
LIAM: Sorry. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
SAM: 12. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Natural one. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
LAURA: We started so strong. 
TRAVIS: 53. 
MARISHA: Wait, what? Is that true? 
TRAVIS: I rolled a couple d20s. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: 33. 
MATT: 33. Okay. It's getting a little tight there, but-- 
TALIESIN: I was starting to do the math. 
LIAM: Can't do that. 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: You confidently head towards the place of the original tree that you had emerged from. Kind of in the southwestern part of the city. You can see that the damaged skyship from the night before is still under repairs, but two of the skyships have now unmoored and are now heading in a northeastern north direction. The day's cloud cover is a little more present and you can see it looks like a darkened storm blowing in from the western horizon. As you approach the tree, for the first moment there, isn't a sign of Keyleth, until you see a squirrel that (skitters) skitters down the tree with a bright, reddish brown hue and a small little set of antlers that seem to protrude from its head. 
LAURA: Aww, cute. 
MATT: Before it (whoosh) "Hi. Are we all good?" 
MARISHA: How was your field trip? Fruitful? 
MATT: "It was quite fruitful. I managed to ask around. I did know somebody present, Dawn Marshall Quethir Droh, an honorable warrior of the Dawn Fist under the Stormlord of Vasselheim." 
TRAVIS: No, no, no. 
MARISHA: Somebody will write that down. 
MATT: "Did some good things with them. They were leading a battalion aboard the skyship that was attacked when we got here, actually. They, thankfully, suffered few casualties, given the limitations of restoring life under the red moon. But it seems they've been-- Well, there has been a gathering of forces across Exandria to this valley encircling and setting up battlements surrounding what they're referring to as the Bloody Bridge." 
LAURA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Catchy. 
MATT: "But there is a sizable army currently present around the site of the bridge. No one's quite certain, or at least from their perspective, what this army's capable of. Their abilities in the skirmishes they've had are mysterious and unpredictable. I let them know a bit of the intel that you've shared with me, though not the source of it, about these Reilorans. But universally, right now, the orders have been to hold unless they act in aggression until we have more information. Thus, they've been left in a deadlock. While many see this as a boon, given that worldwide forces are spread thin between focusing on this battleground and ever-growing dangers at home due to the prolonged solstice and unraveled arcana, others are worried that also grants them more time as well. So I think there will come a time soon in which either they make a move or we need to. But for now, things seem still. But nevertheless, I think it's time for me to take off. See some old friends, maybe pull some out of retirement. See some individuals that I think I can draw their interest to our cause. Hopefully, soon enough, we can pour our power us together and make a larger impact than we did last time." 
LAURA: Are you going to Whitestone? 
MATT: "Eventually." 
LAURA: Our compatriots here need access to number one, a tinkerer of high caliber and potentially a lot of residuum to repair the harness. 
MATT: "I think those can be provided. Just need to have a conversation. But I think that can be done." 
TALIESIN: See, it's not just me. That's nice. 
MATT: "When he opens up, he's an absolute sweetie." 
TALIESIN: I've heard it before; it's okay. 
MATT: "But yeah, you-- Hello, I am--" 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: "Keyleth." 
TRAVIS: Introductions. 
MATT: Joe goes, "Is this--" 
LAURA: Yeah, this is-- 
SAM, LAURA, and LIAM: Kimothée. 
MATT: "Kimothée? Kimothée, pleasure to meet you." 
SAM: Imahara Joe, Dancer. 
TRAVIS: Verne? 
LAURA: Verna. 
SAM: Verne the Viper? 
LAURA: Verna the Viper. 
TALIESIN: Verna the Viper. 
MATT: Verna is right up and grabbing her hand and like, "It is so nice to meet you. You are just beautiful. We'll have conversations." Keyleth's like, "Okay, okay. That's a lot right now up front." 
SAM: We might need you to get them somewhere for us, but-- We're going to the Shattered Teeth? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. I already talked to them about Whitestone. 
SAM: Oh, you did? 
LAURA: Did you hear that whole conversation? 
ASHLEY: Where did you go? (laughter) 
SAM: I was-- But we're still going to the Shattered Teeth, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. (laughter) 
LIAM: Were you communing with the Changebringer? 
LAURA: I was, uh, sleeping. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I was right here. 
TALIESIN: Powered down. 
MATT: "Well, that's good to know. We haven't much time, probably shouldn't dilly dally out here in the open too long. I'll take them with me, but if you're off to the island of Slival to meet with Jirana, the Shore Shrew." 
LAURA, MARISHA, and SAM: (garbles with lots of Sh) 
MATT: "The Shore Shrew. It's a term she's embraced." 
LIAM: Shore Shrew? 
ASHLEY: You're not after Shore Shrew? 
TALIESIN: Shore Shrew in the seashore. 
SAM: She's a sorcerer. 
LIAM: They didn't say that one out loud. 
MATT: I will murder you all. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I actually really like it. I'm just being a dick. 
SAM: Sorcerer. 
LAURA: I really do like it. 
TALIESIN: I like the Shore Shrew. It's fun to say. It feels good. 
SAM: I don't like it. 
ASHLEY: Shore Shoe? 
LAURA: Shore Shrew. 
ASHLEY: Shrew. 
LIAM: She sells shore shrews. 
MATT: "Let me know if you need anything." She turns around towards the tree, takes a breath. Kind of looks back off towards the direction that the ships are going. Gives a sigh. Back in the tree and then (whooshes) tears it open as the doorway opens up within and on the opposite end, you can see this vibrant, yellowish hue to a somewhat foggy sky and what looks like a series of pools with waterfalls over a lush, jungle-like hill or mountainside before you. "Good luck, everyone." 
LAURA: Oh, yes, we go. 
MATT: "Got to go." 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh no, sorry. 
MATT: "Oh! She's a sweet, older Galapa, turtle, caretaker of the island. She's great and knows quite a bit about the surrounding landscape. Probably knows the best way to get to Evontra'vir. If you hear a loud rumble, sometimes the island burps. It's the tide pushing through the rock tunnels along the coast. Could be, most of the time." 
TALIESIN: Shit! Ah! 
MARISHA: Ah! 
MATT: "Oh, say hi to Toriz for me! Oh, did I mention Toriz?" And it closes shut. 
LIAM: Bye, Kimothée! 
LAURA: What? I didn't hear. 
MATT: And that's where we'll pick up next time. (groaning) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Too much information! 
TRAVIS: We didn't ask her shit! 
TALIESIN: Thank you for coming with me. That was so good. 
LAURA: Oh my god, that was so much fun! 
TALIESIN: (yells) 
ASHLEY: Shore Shrew! 
SAM: The Shore Shrew. 
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for Justi to-- 
SAM: Jirana the Shore Shrew? 
MATT: Jirana the Shore Shrew. 
LAURA: Jirana. 
SAM: Evontra'vir's the tree? 
LIAM: Yes. 
TALIESIN: -Tra'mir. 
LAURA: Jirana, the Shore Shrew. 
TALIESIN: Evontra'mir, Evontra'mir. 
MARISHA and SAM: Evan-- 
MATT: Evontra'vir, the Great Tree of Atrophy. 
LIAM: You want shmear on your bagel? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Evontra'vir. 
MARISHA: Damn it! 
SAM: The last ride of Evontra'vir. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Evontra'vir's the tree? 
SAM: And then Toris? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Toriz. 
SAM: Toriz. 
LIAM: Toriz. 
TALIESIN: I finished all my notes in a few days, anyway, so I'm going to go back, and say-- This is silly to try and write it down now. 
LAURA: Something, something. 
MARISHA: "Say hi for me from--" 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MARISHA: Shore Shrew. 
LAURA: Shore Shoo Shoo. 
SAM: Shark Show. 
MATT: Yes, that one. 
TALIESIN: Yay, Shady Sally. I'm so pleased. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Shady Sally Shore Shrew. 
TALIESIN: Shady Sally. (laughter) 
SAM: Shay shay. 
ASHLEY: Shea Shally goes to meet sha (the) Shore Shrew of the Shattered Teeth. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We're professionals. 
MATT: Yep, yep. 
LAURA: That was fun. 
MATT: That was fun. That was weird. That got interesting. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm! 
MARISHA: We killed Ratanish. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MATT: You did. Fuck that guy! 
SAM: Ratanish and the Shore Shrew. 
MARISHA: The Shore Shrew? (laughter) 
SAM: Pay-pee. Payopée. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Pay-pee. 
LIAM: And got a psychic pus poop. 
TALIESIN: Still two more Greymoores. Ah! 
SAM: That we have to plant on the moon. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, I wasn't sure if you guys were ever going to get to the All-Minds-Burn. That was interesting. 
TALIESIN: I was really looking forward to it, so. I had a funny feeling one of the Greymoores was going to be there, so I'm very pleased. I was hoping. 
MATT: Well, we get to see your first glimpse of the Shattered Teeth next time. I'm excited for that. 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MATT: Well, thank you all so much. I'm excited for the next game. Thank you so much for joining us as always. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)
