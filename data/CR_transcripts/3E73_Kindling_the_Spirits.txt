MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
TRAVIS and SAM: We play Dungeons & Dragons!  
MARISHA, ASHLEY, LAURA, TALIESIN: (noises) 
MATT: Before we jump into our session for this evening, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with our first sponsor, which is "Dragonheir: Silent Gods." Sam? 
SAM: "Dragonheir: Silent Gods" is a new game that incorporates elements from tabletop classics like D&D featuring dice rolls, character creations, thank you, and thrilling dungeon duels. It's available now on PC, Mac, Epic, and mobile platforms with future plans to launch on Steam so everyone can start rolling in the "Dragonheir" world. Do I have something on me? 
TRAVIS: No, you're good. 
MARISHA: No, you're good now. It was like styrofoam. It was weird. 
SAM: Oh, that tracks. (laughter) 
SAM: Now, last time they sponsored the show, Matt and I had to audition to see who had the better voice to play the role of Sagomir, a character in the game. It was close. Matt barely squeaked out a victory. And to reward him, the folks from "Dragonheir" sent him this fantastic, custom-made Sagomir helmet. Matt, don thy helmet! 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MARISHA: It's so tall! 
ASHLEY: It's so tall. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Is it going to-- 
LIAM: I think I'm a horse girl now. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Is it? There's elastic? 
ASHLEY: (neighs) 
SAM: Now, Matt, give us-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You look so cute! 
TALIESIN: It's amazing! (laughter) 
SAM: Give us a little taste of Sagomir. 
LIAM: The holiday decorations come out earlier and earlier! (laughter) 
MATT: (like Sagomir) "Dragonheir: Silent Gods" is a vast high-fantasy world beckoning you to explore. Embark on a quest to uncover the secrets of Adenthia with companions by your side. 
SAM: Okay, good, that was fine. 
LAURA: Was that your Sagomir voice? 
SAM: That's was fine. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: That was fine. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: But let me add, the devs were so taken by my audition that they also custom-made me an even bigger helmet. 
LIAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Careful, careful, careful! 
TALIESIN: The right, the right-- Oh! 
MARISHA: Here, I'll grab it. (screaming) 
TALIESIN: You hit it! 
SAM: Did I-- 
TRAVIS: You're okay. 
SAM: Am I okay? 
MARISHA: Well, we'll fix it, it's okay. 
MATT: No, wait, wait, wait, wait, though, then. They custom-made you... that? 
SAM: Yeah, I believe so. 
MATT: That large, ill-fitting helmet. Did they even ask for your head measurements? 
SAM: I mean, they can approximate from photographs, I think. 
MATT: You made that helmet yourself, didn't you, Sam? 
SAM: No! What? No! 
MATT: Did you? 
SAM: Why would I do-- 
MATT: Tell the truth, damn it! 
SAM: Fine, all right? I made it. I made the helmet. I should explore a sandbox open-world game filled with love, revenge, mystery, and bloodshed. I should be Sagomir! 
MATT: But you're not Sagomir. What are you really? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: I'm Sagomir! 
MATT: You need to let this go. What are you? 
SAM: I'm Sagomir! 
MATT: What are you? 
SAM: Sagomir! 
MATT: What are you, Riegel? 
SAM: I'm nobody! (laughter) 
SAM: I'm nobody! (cries) I'm nobody, Matt! (crying) 
TRAVIS: It looks like a duck's bill. 
MATT: You're not nobody, Sam. All right? 
TRAVIS: No, we're not going here, are we? 
MATT: You're a damn fine voice actor. One of the best. 
SAM: Top 10? 
MATT: Top 80 at least, but look. You didn't get this job. And it's not because I'm better than you, probably. Maybe it's because-- 
MARISHA: Probably. (laughs) 
MATT: You're too good for this role. 
SAM: You really think so? 
MATT: I'd bet this helmet on it. (laughter) 
SAM: You're right. I am good. ("Sagomir") "Dragonheir: Silent Gods"! To start rolling in the "Dragonheir" world, head over to bit,ly/dragonheir_criticalrole. (laughter) 
MARISHA: He had no idea how to end the bit. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Just end it! 
SAM: And use promo code "criticalrole" to redeem limited edition gift packs in the game. It is I, Sagomir, saying-- 
MATT: Ah, no, I'm Sagomir. 
SAM: Right, Matt, back to you. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh wow. 
ASHLEY: They look like little arms. 
LAURA: They're so cute! 
ASHLEY: It's like-- 
MARISHA: Aw, I love a bit that doesn't overstay its welcome. (laughter) 
LIAM: The bit never ends. 
MATT: I'm your little horse boy. (laughter) 
MARISHA: The bit never ends! 
LAURA: You're going to hurt somebody with that one. 
TALIESIN: This is the bit. 
MATT: All right. Marisha. 
LAURA: Your hair is stuck to the boom mic! 
LAURA: Oh god, Sam. 
MATT: Next bit's you! Oh, this is dangerous. 
TRAVIS: They're just going to hear (thumping) 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT: I know! 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
LAURA: You've got to get the hair off of it. It's going to gross me out the whole game. 
LIAM and LAURA: (imitates gagging) 
LIAM: It's like seven of them. 
MARISHA: We're going to have to stop down and readjust. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: But it's fine. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Guys! 
TRAVIS: Yes? 
MARISHA: Join us for Episode Two of Candela Obscura. 
TRAVIS: Candela Obscura! (cheering) 
MARISHA: The Circle of Needle & Thread next Thursday. The fates of these investigators are only becoming more entwined and the stakes are rising to otherworldly heights. It all starts at 7:00pm Pacific on Twitch and YouTube. Shit's getting real, you guys. 
TRAVIS: Shit's getting real.

MARISHA: Yeah, it's good shit. We got a live show in London coming up! (cheering)

TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: That's slick! 
SAM: That's actually cool. 
LAURA: Have you ever wanted to show how big of a fan you are for CR, but not really show? 
LIAM: Yes. (laughter) 
LAURA: This is the article of clothing to wear. You can pair it with-- (shouting) 
LAURA: These amazing retro joggers! 
MATT: Okay, that's really, really cool. 
LAURA: They are. So if you guys have our other joggers that are so cozy coze, these are the same materials as our cozy coze. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it is? 
LAURA: Yeah, so they're comfy as-- 
TALIESIN: Oh my god! 
LIAM: I'm going to wear nothing else in the winter. 
ASHLEY: I got stripes! 
LAURA: Yeah! You can hug your whole body in CR. 
LIAM: And I do. 
TRAVIS: Yuck. 
LAURA: I love you. Look in the store. (laughter) 
LIAM: Did you say you love them-- 
TRAVIS: Look in the store? 
LIAM: -- licking the store? 
TRAVIS: Or I love you licking the store? 
LAURA: I love you licking the store. 
LIAM: That's what I heard! 
MATT: That sounds about right. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I love you licking the store ♪ 
LAURA: You're pretty much just licking your own mouth, but. 
TRAVIS: Sam, write that song. 
MATT: (sputters) 
LAURA: I'm stopping! 
MATT: So Liam! Liam, you got something to talk about!

LIAM: Graphic novels next year. Ah, okay, let's see. Matt and Marisha joined writer Mae Catt to unveil Beau's backstory with art by Guilherme Balbi, colors by Diana Sousa, and letters by Ariana Maher. 
SAM: Letters! 
LIAM: With Balbi and Sousa illustrating the cover. 
MARISHA: Nice.

TALIESIN: Yep. 
LIAM: And! That guy Matt and Taliesin join Kendra Wells in writing the origin story of Caduceus with art by Selina Espiritu, colors by Eren Angiolini, letters by Ariana Maher, and with cover art by Gus Allen and Angiolini. Plus! 
TRAVIS: Nice job! 
LIAM: Plus, plus, plus. Starting in January 2024, get ready for "The Tales of Exandria" two, Artagan! (cheering) 
LIAM: The four-issue arc is going to unveil a new story focused on Archfey Artagan, that fucker, AKA The Traveler. 
LAURA: (as Jester) The coolest guy in the entire Exandrian universe! 
MATT: (as Artagan) "Thank you, you know I love you."

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. (laughter) So, last we left off: Bells Hells had been on a bender of gathering information about what they could possibly bring to bear against Ludinus Da'leth, the Ruby Vanguard, and the dangers that may be besetting the red moon Ruidus above. You uncovered a strange, damaged contraption that seems to be tied to the history and the longevity and innate power of Ludinus, and upon acquiring a few friendly tinkerers, some you saved as well, set that device on the path to being repaired and possibly bent to your use. Along this journey also, Ashton discovered a little bit about his essence, his past, the Hishari people of which he was once with, and is one of the sole survivors of, and what seems to be the essence of one of the ancient, long-destroyed Primordial Titans that is buried and entwined with his physical essence, a possible dormant power that lies within. Upon seeking any sort of interesting information on this, you gathered that one entity, Evontra'vir, the Great Tree of Atrophy that exists in the Shattered Teeth, was responsible for passing the shard of power that created this incident of the Hishari onto the leader of that cult. With that lead, you made your way to the Shattered Teeth, made friends with an older tortoise woman who had helped Keyleth through her grief many years ago, who led you on the path to the island of Kalutha. You decided the best route to take to get there involved summoning a ghost ship and parleying with its captain. After a seemingly unbeatable continuation of undead ghost skeletons assaulting you, however, you sent them fleeing and made a deal with the Captain Novos that included giving over to him the intelligent legendary weapon that you had been keeping at your side. This deal was accepted, and as such bought you passage across the seas to the island of your destination, where you currently now sit upon the oddly creaking ghost ship that floats billowing out mist and fog across the waves, heading in a southeastern direction for the next two to three days. It is on this journey that you can make your fortune. Is there anything you wish to do while you are riding along on this journey? 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Mm. 
SAM: Is there anyone we need-- 
MARISHA: (unhappy scoff) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Wow. 
MARISHA: Why? (laughter) 
LIAM: How did Critical Role end? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Do you see this? Do you see this? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I missed the unveiling. 
MARISHA: Jesus Christ. 
SAM: Is there-- 
MARISHA: It's such a basic Starbucks order. 
SAM: I know, it's a very normal order. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's so basic. (laughter) 
MATT: I'm just glad I'm not in the crosshairs today. (laughter) 
SAM: Is there anyone we need to communicate with? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You're deranged. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Unhinged. 
LIAM: For the podcast audience, Sam is wearing a shirt that has a screen capture from our company's Slack from Marisha that says, "Flat white with vanilla please." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You put it on a fucking (laughs) teal shirt. 
MARISHA: It won't stop. I don't know why it won't stop. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: His shirt matches your nails. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh! They're really pretty nails. 
MARISHA: Oh, it does! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! (laughter) 
MATT: (pointedly clears throat) 
TRAVIS: Sorry. 
SAM: Is there anyone we need to try to cast Sending to? Does Sending work? 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: It just doesn't work. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: It just doesn't work. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Jeez. How long have we been dealing with this now? 
TRAVIS: Same as before. 
LAURA: Every time I try it, we get brain damage. 
SAM: All right. 
ASHLEY: Scry, do we need to scry on anything? 
SAM: Oh yeah, that's the one I meant. 
LAURA: Yeah, you can do that. 
ASHLEY: I feel like that's what you meant. 
SAM: That is what I meant. Is there anyone we need to Scry on? 
MARISHA: It is odd that we can Scry on people from far away, but we can't do Sending. Why is that? 
LAURA: I don't know what these-- 
SAM: I don't know. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: It's weird. 
MARISHA: What's with that? 
SAM: Are you going to do standup routine? You know what's weird? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: What the fuck is up with that? 
LIAM: What is the deal with Sending? 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LAURA: Oh god. Okay. 
SAM: We could do Scrying, we could do some Scrying. I could Scry on bad guys. I could Scry on-- You can Scry, too. I could Scry on D again. 
LAURA: I can't Scry. She can Scry. 
ASHLEY: Wait, you can't Scry? 
LAURA: I can't Scry. 
ASHLEY: Why did I think you could Scry? 
LAURA: I don't know. You can Scry, though. 
ASHLEY: I can Scry. 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: I thought she could as well. 
TRAVIS: We've never played this game before. 
SAM: ♪ I can scry ♪ (laughter) 
MARISHA: ♪ I believe I can Scry ♪ 
ASHLEY: ♪ I can Scry, I can Scry ♪ 
SAM: Yep. 
LIAM: What about those two from Wildemount? 
SAM: The who? The what? 
LIAM: The two-- 
LAURA: The two that got captured. 
LIAM: The wizard and the-- 
ASHLEY: The hot one and the redhead. 
SAM: Oh! We-- 
TALIESIN: Wasn't the other one-- 
ASHLEY: I didn't seen them, I don't think I could-- (laughter) 
SAM: I saw them. I saw them. 
TALIESIN: Yeah? 
SAM: Right? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. Did you see them? 
LAURA: You saw them. We all saw them. 
ASHLEY: I don't know if I did. 
LAURA: No, you saw them. 
MARISHA: Well, they were being made mockery of. 
ASHLEY: I saw-- Oh, that's right, that's right. I did see them from afar. 
SAM: Why don't we simul-Scry? You can do the hot one and I'll do the-- 
LIAM: You're going to simulcast? 
SAM: The dirt wizard. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah? 
SAM: I don't know. 
ASHLEY: I don't know, what do we think? 
LIAM: He seemed really clean to me. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: No, no. My optics are in tuned to the-- 
LIAM: My passive perception is 31, Letters. 
SAM: But I got a really good look at them. 
LIAM: Okay. (laughter) 
SAM: I can't smell, and I smelled him. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: This is your legacy, Laura. 
ASHLEY: We've got D, we've got Otohan. 
SAM: We can simul-Scry on those two Wildemount folks. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: Want to do that first? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. What do I-- If it's somebody I don't know. 
SAM: Wait, you never saw them? 
LAURA: You saw them. 
ASHLEY: No, I saw her, but that's all it takes? I forget. I've only done this a couple times. 
SAM: I think so. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, she looked like this. I'll use Minor Illusion to make her face. 
LAURA: Yeah, remember? 
TRAVIS: But she's like this. 
MARISHA: She had more abs. 
ASHLEY: Jeepers creepers, okay. 
LAURA: She had-- Yeah. 
LIAM: 24 pack. 
LAURA: Yeah, it was a lot. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, there was a lot. 
TRAVIS: (whirring) Now she's got 24 abs. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: She's shredded. 
TRAVIS: It just looks like a terrible hernia. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Probably-- That's probably fair. 
TRAVIS: She doesn't have long, we have to reach out. (laughter) 
SAM: Oh no, my d20's gone. 
LAURA: Your d20 is gone? 
SAM: Yep. 
MARISHA: Do you only have one? 
LAURA: I have some. 
SAM: I have two-- 
TRAVIS: You mean the one. Oh my god. 
SAM: -- but the one that I use is gone, so I'll just use this one, I don't care. Nope. 
MARISHA: What's it look like? 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: It's a special one. 
TRAVIS: No, it's not. 
TALIESIN: Like a d20. 
LIAM: Is that the good old Gil die in your hand? 
SAM: What is this? 
LAURA: Don't show it! Don't show it! There's a-- 
TRAVIS: Sneak peek? 
LAURA: It's a sneak peek. 
SAM: This is unreleased? 
LAURA: It's not for sale yet! Put it-- Jesus, I should not have given that to you. 
LIAM: Enhance. 
TRAVIS: I am wondering what you were thinking. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I know, I saw a glimpse of it and I was like, "Ooh!" (laughter) 
LIAM: We'll just put a black bar over it. 
LAURA: Yeah. Boop! 
MARISHA: Censor every time he rolls. 
LAURA: Stop it, Sam! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Max is like, "Oh god!" 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: We will never start-- 
MARISHA: Sorry, Max. 
SAM: -- tonight's session. 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
MATT: Nope. Nope. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
SAM: Okay, okay. What are we rolling for? 
TRAVIS: Come on! Simul-Scry. 
ASHLEY: Simul-Scry? 
SAM: I'm going, I'm just rolling something. Natural 20. (cheering) 
TALIESIN: Hey! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: They're going to freeze that bitch. 
ASHLEY: Wait, we're doing it at the same time? 
SAM: Yeah, simul-Scry. 
ASHLEY: Like the same circle? 
LIAM: You got to get a 20. Don't fuck it up. 
ASHLEY: Well, okay. 
LAURA: Get a 20. You can do it. 
TRAVIS: Don't pick one of those little things. Get a real one. 
LIAM: Yeah, no teeth. 
SAM: Whoa, that was crazy roll. 
LAURA: It counts. 
ASHLEY: I feel like it doesn't count, but it's going to count. 
SAM: Guidance. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what am I-- (laughter) 
LAURA: I'm sorry, Matthew. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
MATT: No, that's okay. It's okay. 
TRAVIS: Matt's like, "It doesn't work." 
ASHLEY: Hang on one second. 
MARISHA: It doesn't, yeah. 
SAM: What is she adding? 
MATT: Nothing, you don't roll for Scry. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I was saying! I don't think we roll. (laughter) 
MARISHA: They do. 
TRAVIS: Eight! Years! Eight years! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Eight years! 
TALIESIN: I enjoyed the walk. 
MARISHA: Matt was just letting it happen. 
TALIESIN: I thought the walk was-- 
MATT: I just let it happen. 
ASHLEY: Just sitting there the whole time. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
LIAM: You just let us hang ourselves. 
MATT: Yeah! (laughter) 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Eight years. 
ASHLEY: All right, okay. 
MATT: That was for me. 
ASHLEY: We're just doing it. We just do it. 
TALIESIN: Left home and walked right home. All right. 
MATT: All right, so you both take a little bit of time to prepare your Scry spells. 
TRAVIS: Dani's crying somewhere. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: You are focusing on the wizard fellow. 
SAM: The wizard man. 
MATT: And you are focusing on the badass fighter. 
ASHLEY: The hot one. 
MATT: Great. Both of your Scry spells are immediately canceled and sent back to you and it seems like there's some sort of magical barrier that makes them impenetrable to distant seeing. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: That makes them. We've done Scrying on other things and it's just them that they're blocked. 
LAURA: Maybe it's because he's such a powerful wizard. 
MARISHA: They have him blocked off. 
TALIESIN: Wizard shit. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: Is that how that works? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
ASHLEY: Well, did they block-- 
LAURA: Ludinus, we can't Scry on him. We've tried it before and it didn't work so maybe he's got his same spells on them still. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, all right. 
TALIESIN: This whole thing is baffling. 
ASHLEY: What about D? 
SAM: I can do D. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You want to try for D? 
SAM: Sure, let's do it. I can do the D. (chuckling) 
LIAM: It's true. 
MATT: What's the spell DC? 
SAM: 15. 
MATT: 15, okay. Using the same circle that you drew to represent the initial Scry ritual, you reuse most of the setup, scribing in the few elements of the circle that were destroyed and burned in the initial ritual. As you connect these arcane lines, if you will, you close your eyes and focus, and your vision (whooshes) pulls out through the mist, and you feel like you're being plucked and pulled through an endless series of clouds, this fog that continues to billow in front of you, until eventually it separates. As it does, you see the outskirts of some sort of a coastal city. You see beautiful, polished, cobblestone streets. You see all manner of people walking around, enjoying the warm sunlight that comes from a bright blue sky with a handful of dappled clouds, and you see the cart that's creaking over one large hillside on the upper portion of the city. You see the cloaked figure that you believe to be D walking alongside it as some sort of a three-legged automaton pulls the cart forward slowly step by step. (automaton clunking) 
TRAVIS: Three-legged? 
SAM: Do I get a sense of where in the world this man, this person, this robot is? 
MATT: Still somewhere along the coast that you previously saw, so Menagerie Coast is likely. You have not necessarily traveled, I believe, to-- 
SAM: Any distinguishing features, cliffs that are very specific, or towers or-- 
MATT: It's tough because the scry Spell itself only really focuses within a short radius of the target. Go ahead and roll a perception check for me. 
LAURA: You can do this. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LIAM: Put your back into it. 
SAM: I don't know, can you Guide me? 
MATT: No. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
SAM: Yeah, can I use the natural 20 from before? 
TRAVIS: Two. 
SAM: How about a one from this die? 
TRAVIS: Oh! (laughter) 
MATT: Somewhere nice. Somewhere very, very nice, you're sure. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Shit. 
LAURA: Don't look at me like you blame me for that because I gave you that dice. 
SAM: This is you. 
LAURA: You don't care about that kind of stuff. 
SAM: I-- 
TRAVIS: What kind of stuff? 
SAM: Don't buy this. 
LAURA: No! (laughter) 
LAURA: Samuel! (laughter) 
LAURA: I mean-- (laughter) 
LAURA: Give it back. You're not worthy. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Lost privileges. 
TRAVIS: The queen. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm dying. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I have to go home with Laura tonight. 
ASHLEY: That didn't work. 
SAM: I'm sorry. But you know, we know generally where they are. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: Anyone else y'all want me to Scry on before we call it a day? I guess we got some sailing to do, so. 
MARISHA: Hey, Letters. 
SAM: Letters? 
MARISHA: Weird question. That woman who's in my head that you saw, Delilah. 
SAM: D? 
TALIESIN: The other D. 
MARISHA: Another D. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: What happens if you Scry on her? 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MARISHA: Have you tried? 
TALIESIN: I'm suddenly very invested. 
LAURA: Scrying across planes? 
TRAVIS: Poo poo butter, let's do it. 
MARISHA: I don't know, I don't think so. 
TRAVIS: Your head's going to explode. That would be awesome. 
LAURA: It might be the same. 
LIAM and TRAVIS: (head exploding) 
SAM: I can try, or you can try. 
TALIESIN: Guidance. 
ASHLEY: I don't think I can Scry again. 
TALIESIN: She didn't want it. 
ASHLEY: Because I only have-- 
TRAVIS: If you had Guidance, that would be amazing. 
ASHLEY: I already used my 5th-level to check on the hot one. 
SAM: Got it. 
LIAM: Do it tomorrow. 
SAM: I used two 5th-levels just now, too. 
ASHLEY: I can do it tomorrow. 
MATT: You did. 
SAM: I can just rest and do it tomorrow. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. You can do it tomorrow. 
MATT: You can try it again then. 
TALIESIN: I would love to-- There was a tattoo artist downstairs. There was a ghost tattoo artist. 
SAM: You want me to Scry on them too? Jesus. 
TALIESIN: Where are they? What are they doing right now? 
MARISHA: Just walk down the stairs. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to Scry, which I'm going to go downstairs. 
TRAVIS: Are you going to get some ink? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. It's ghost ink. 
LAURA: Some ghost ink? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Fucking ghost ink. 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
TALIESIN: I'm also made of-- I just have a lot of questions. 
LAURA: Maybe they can-- Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I mean, is a tattoo for you just like chisel? 
TALIESIN: I mean, technically. 
MARISHA: I have my rock hammer still. 
ASHLEY: Wait, like a chisel? Do you have skin? 
TALIESIN: I mean, I-- 
LAURA: It's hard. 
TALIESIN: It is. 
ASHLEY: (chuckles) 
TALIESIN: But there's-- 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: That's the fine side. 
LIAM: I don't want to hurt you, though. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead, it's fine. 
LIAM: I mean, it gives a little bit. 
TALIESIN: It does give. 
LIAM: But it is a little more taut than normal. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Sorry. 
TALIESIN: No, it's okay. 
TRAVIS: Let's go get you some ghost ink. 
TALIESIN: I'm kind of tempted. I want to see what that would involve. 
LAURA: Let's try. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: Fun. Wait, should we all get something? 
TALIESIN: So I see it's Vendalla? 
MATT: Vendallo, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah. I'm going to head downstairs and find Vendalla. 
MATT: Okay, Vendallo. 
TALIESIN: Vendallo. 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Vendallo. 
TALIESIN: Handwriting. 
MATT: As you-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, I have an A. Vendallo. 
MATT: Continue back into the underneath, the ship's deck below, still even within the ship, the temperature is quite chilly, and as you step back down below, your breath even becomes more apparent in the low lantern light that hangs and sways from the interior. The ghostly skeletal crew remains playing about their endless revelry in their afterlife curse, and as you step back into the chambers, they all stop for a second and glance over in your direction, just making sure that you understand the outsider presence that you bring to this before they go back about their business. You can see Vendallo is currently over on the side, looks like a piece of driftwood that they're currently in the process of carving in a very rudimentary way. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Hunter, Whitts, Whitts, hi. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Ah. 
MATT: "Hi." 
TALIESIN: Hey, so I've been looking. How much of the work on everybody is yours? 
MATT: Glancing around, and you can see the work that's done on them is carved into bone. It isn't an exterior skin tattoo. There's no skin on this ghostly crew, so it is a carved series of shapes and designs. As Vendallo looks at you through the skeletal orcish features, the little flickering blue lights on the inside of the sunken sockets, if you could see and hear teeth and bone creaking into a grin. Leans forward. "I did all of it. It is what I do to pass the time." 
TALIESIN: It's beautiful. 
MATT: "Thank you." 
TALIESIN: That's actually kind of why I wanted to put a proposal in front of you. 
MATT: "(grunts)" 
TALIESIN: Did you do anything like this before you were a ghost pirate, I guess? 
MATT: "It's funny you mention that. I always meant to dabble, but never had the time. Now, plenty of time." 
TALIESIN: Well, that's a shame because honestly, this work, it should be seen. 
MATT: "Oh, you are too kind." 
TALIESIN: No, it's a damn shame, honestly. 
LIAM: Do you also do ink? 
MATT: "I've not tried it, really." 
LIAM: Do you have ink? 
MATT: "No." 
TRAVIS: I do. 
TALIESIN: There's ink. 
LAURA: You have paint. 
TRAVIS: What's the fucking difference? 
TALIESIN: A tenth of our audience just gasped in pain. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Sorry. (exhales) Well, I was thinking-- 
ASHLEY: It could work. 
TALIESIN: Your stuff honestly should exist off this ship. It's just not fair, really. I was wondering if you'd be up to doing a little work on, well, not a ghost. 
MATT: "How extensive are you thinking?" 
TALIESIN: I don't know, I've got some room on the back. I have no idea how much it's going to hurt, probably a fuck ton. 
MATT: "I don't know, either. I forgot what it is like to be squishy." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Pokes your shoulder a bit. 
TALIESIN: (groans) Well, I just think it's only reasonable. I mean, you, basically immortal at this point, I suppose. 
MATT: "What do you give me?" 
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to give you real immortality. 
MATT: "Huh?" 
TALIESIN: So-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) "Huh?" 
TALIESIN: You basically, at this point, don't exist out there. Everybody who has ever known you, anybody you ever knew, they're long gone. 
MATT: "They still fear us. They know about us." 
TALIESIN: They fear anybody. 
MATT: "They tell stories. There are songs! We are scary!" (pounds table) 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: But you're an artist. 
MATT: "These are not mutually exclusive! You can be scary and be an artist." 
TALIESIN: But no one knows you're an artist. No one's ever seen your work. No one ever will other than the people on this boat. 
MATT: "That would make me a sellout." 
TALIESIN: That would make you immortal. Any of your art that manages to get off this boat is just that much more real life. Suddenly you have a name. Suddenly you have something on the outside world that makes you you. 
LIAM: People come and go. Art lasts forever. 
TALIESIN: (clicks tongue) 
MATT: "We do kill the people we come across usually, and those that we don't kill, it's because they ran away screaming." Make a persuasion check for me. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: I'll give you advantage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Because he's been helping him. 
TALIESIN: Come on. 
TRAVIS: While he's doing that, can I get eyes on the driftwood that he was rudimentally carving. 
MATT: Sure, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Is it a shape of anything? Does it look like he was trying to form it into something? 
MATT: Make a perception check. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MATT: 17? Right now it looks like an oblong bowl. 
TALIESIN: Hm! Hm! 
MATT: But it could almost be a ship shape. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: Mid? 
TALIESIN: I'm middling. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 12. 
MATT: 12? 
TALIESIN: You think I'm not going to get drunk and tell everyone I ever meet who did this piece of work on me on a ghost pirate ship? 
MATT: "On one condition." 
TALIESIN: Vendallo? yeah. 
MATT: "If it hurts, make noise." 
TALIESIN: Hm. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
TALIESIN: Honestly, if I don't make noise, that's really your fault, isn't it? 
MATT and TALIESIN: (slapping impact) 
MATT: As you grasp the bone, it almost freezes your fingers to the touch-- 
TALIESIN: (grunts) 
MATT: -- and you can feel the heat immediately escape your fingers to the point where the hand almost immediately goes numb before you release, and when you pull away, there's this cracking sensation like your fingers had frozen to the bone before you managed to pull away and sever that slight little layer of ice that had begun to form. "(laughs) We've got a day so tell me what you want, I put it on you." 
TALIESIN: I am so excited. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Did Fearne come down for this? 
MATT: Fearne, did you come down for this? 
LIAM: Aren't we all here? 
ASHLEY: Mm, uh-- 
SAM: I wasn't. 
MATT: It's up to you guys. 
ASHLEY: I feel like I was down-- 
MATT: You can decide who came down and who did not. 
ASHLEY: -- down in the belly of the ship. 
TRAVIS: Don't take anything. 
ASHLEY: What? 
TRAVIS: Please don't steal from the ghost pirates. 
ASHLEY: Why? Why would, what, what? 
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, I can see you and I know you're clocking the space, but let's just, please, make it one day before we start jacking stuff. 
ASHLEY: I won't, but just, what are they going to do with it? 
LIAM: Hey, you guys. 
ASHLEY: I mean-- 
LIAM: I'm sorry, they do have a working tattoo artist. We're on a ship full of ghosts, and we have an end game of who knows what. I really think that we should get a tattoo. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MARISHA: Okay! 
LIAM: I don't know what. What should we get? 
LAURA: Do they have ink? 
MARISHA: Oh, like a group tattoo? 
LIAM: Sort of. Yeah! 
MARISHA: All matching ones? 
LIAM: I mean, Ash is doing something extra, but-- 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: I just feel like-- 
TRAVIS: Do I have ink? 
LIAM: When the hell is this ever going to happen again? 
LAURA: That's true. 
TRAVIS: I have a bottle of ink. 
LAURA: Oh, just like ink ink ink? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: I'm down. 
TRAVIS: I mean, it's probably as poisonous as the paint is. 
LAURA: We'll probably be dead before it turns into a blob on us, anyway so. 
LIAM: Seriously. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: It's doing something with it. 
ASHLEY: What could we get? 
TRAVIS: I also have a vial of skirath poison if we want to go harsh. 
ASHLEY: A little bell. 
LAURA: Yeah, just like-- 
MARISHA: (gasps) A little bell. 
LAURA: A little bell on fire. 
ASHLEY: I mean, yeah. 
MARISHA: That's cute. (gasps) A flaming bell. 
SAM: That's not bad. 
ASHLEY: I don't hate it. I actually don't hate it for myself. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I wonder how well it goes with faces. 
SAM: Let's do it! 
MARISHA: We just get Bertrand's face-- 
SAM: Oh god! 
MARISHA: -- in a massive back tattoo-- 
ASHLEY and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: -- of Bertrand's face. 
TRAVIS: With a dove in the background. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Like the Steve-O tattoo? 
LAURA: That's exactly what I was thinking. 
LIAM: You just beat me to it! 
LAURA: No, I spelled out Bertand. We could each get one letter-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ See you at the crossroad, crossroad. ♪ 
LAURA: -- of Bertrand. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: Maybe they can etch it. 
TRAVIS: ♪ So you won't be lonely ♪ 
MATT: Is that a Bone Thugs reference? 
TRAVIS: Yes, it is. 
SAM: Sure. 
LIAM: Into the metal because usually they cut into the bone here. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
LAURA: Are we getting bone tattoos? 
LIAM: No, no, no, no, no! I mean, you could if you wanted to, but-- 
ASHLEY: Wait, on our bones or tattoos of bones? 
LIAM: No, I mean the crew here. They have tattoos, but there's no-- 
LAURA: It's bones. 
LIAM: -- flesh so. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, yes. I understand. 
TRAVIS: They want to bone? 
LAURA: I mean-- 
SAM: Yeah, we could-- 
LAURA: I'm sure they haven't boned in a long time. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: They might-- 
SAM: If they can etch it on me. 
LAURA: Although, I don't know. Maybe they bone every night. 
SAM: I'm down. 
MARISHA: I mean, it feels like their very nature-- 
TALIESIN: A lot seems like it happens here. 
MARISHA: -- is boning. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I mean, none of us have said this out loud yet, but we're kind of family now, yeah? 
MATT: "You're either brazen or stupid." You all look over the shoulder and you see about five feet behind you is Cyrillia, the navigator, the one-eyed fire genasi skeleton that has a cloak over one shoulder that's smoldering beneath a little faint bit of smoke that drifts out from under looking at the rest of you with her one burning good eye. 
TRAVIS: She was in the sniper's nest, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yes. 
LIAM: Crow's nest. 
TALIESIN: Never met brazen that was smart. 
SAM: Why are we brazen or stupid? 
MATT: "You're not scared." 
LAURA: Of what? 
SAM: Of a tattoo? 
MATT: "Of us." 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Oh... 
TRAVIS: What is-- 
LAURA: Have you seen our... 
LIAM: I mean, to be honest, I'm a little on edge, but yep, I mean-- 
ASHLEY: Well, we made a deal. 
LIAM: -- kind of used to it. 
TALIESIN: Why? 
MATT: "It's just not normal." 
LAURA: Hey, we've been around enough to know that things aren't always what they seem. I don't judge based on appearances. 
SAM: Do you want us to be scared of you? 
TALIESIN: Are you scared of us? 
MATT: "(scoffs) No." 
TALIESIN: Well, there you are. 
MATT: "Just watching carefully." She backs away. (footsteps tap) The cloak spins as she steps back up to the upper deck. 
TRAVIS: She's so cool. 
ASHLEY: She's very cool. I was actually thinking the same thing. 
TRAVIS: So cool. 
TALIESIN: My favorite. 
ASHLEY: Are we going to try to cause a mutiny still? 
SAM: That's a little bit sad. They just expect us to be scared of them, and I don't know, it just seems like it's a cry for help. Don't you get any cry for help from that, you know? 
TRAVIS: I think maybe they wanted it. It might be an expectation, a desire. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Like it's easier to have people be scared of you so you don't have to get close to them and form relationships. 
SAM: That's what I'm saying! Ooh, that's really good analysis. 
ASHLEY: You know? 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Perhaps we're awakening something in them that they did not know was there. Just saying. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
LIAM: And I don't know that they're content. They're being held in this world. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Instead of passing on. 
LAURA: They seem to like their captain, though. 
TALIESIN: Do they? 
ASHLEY: Wait, were we going to try to cause mutiny between them all? Is that something we should talk about? 
TRAVIS: What? Fearne, what? 
ASHLEY: Wait, no, I thought we-- This is not a thing, right? Were we doing it? 
MARISHA: I think it's been run into Ashton's head. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: I feel like we're-- Talk to Ashton. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I mean. Not start one, necessarily, but I don't think they've really had a conversation about their lot in life in a very long time. 
TRAVIS: Well, the life part is lacking. 
TALIESIN: Heh. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All I'm saying is, I mean, this seems a little dull, doesn't it? 
LAURA: Yeah, but I mean, I imagine they're cursed until he isn't-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: -- right? So they're all on board with helping him find all of his items and then they get released. They can finally get to be free. 
TRAVIS: He made a deal, right? This is part of a bargain he made, so it's not like a-- Well, I guess it's a curse, but kind of down to clown. 
SAM: Is it a curse? Because if it is, you know, I have this magical spell that could maybe remove a curse, but it probably isn't powerful enough to remove this. 
LAURA: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Seems like some serious shit. 
MARISHA: Also, the boat is bound by him, right? 
TALIESIN: Maybe? 
MARISHA: So if we remove the curse-- 
TRAVIS: We just drop in the ocean? 
MARISHA: Boat go-- Right! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah! (laughs) 
SAM: Wait until we're done. 
LAURA: Let's wait, yes. 
LIAM: We got to game out a mutiny real carefully. 
TRAVIS and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: I remove your curse. (intense splash) 
LAURA: Well, shit. 
TRAVIS: Fuck! 
TALIESIN: I'm not even suggesting necessarily that anything happen while we're on board. I just, you know, just putting something out there. Putting something into the ship. There's a lot of means of production out there. I just, you know, it'd be a shame if someone seized it. Just saying. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I mean, his deal seems pretty intense, right? Beyond just a regular curse. 
LAURA: You saw it, right? 
MATT: You can make an arcana check if you want to-- 
SAM: Sure, I'll roll my new die. 
MATT: -- just be curious. 
LAURA: Oh, that is new? 
MARISHA: Can I assist him? 
MATT: Sure, you can either roll yourself or you can help him roll twice. 
MARISHA: How's your arcana? 
SAM: Terrible. 
MARISHA: Then I'll roll myself. 
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh, I rolled 22. 
MARISHA: You rolled? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh, for your-- 
TRAVIS: Hunter's Bane stuff. 
MARISHA: Ooh, also 22. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MARISHA: You imprinted on me. 
MATT: Yeah, you both know this information, but you also have an extensive knowledge of curses. You fought them, you used them, and you exist in that space peripherally fairly strongly in ways that you understand and some that you're still grasping. But what you do know, especially you and your proximity to dark magics as well that there are many curses in this world, some that are simple, some are complex. There are ways to break curses that go by the rules and laws in which they were bound, and there are magical ways to undo them outside of their contract. Even the most powerful curses are vulnerable in the right ways, but it's extremely difficult. Not impossible, but very difficult. 
MARISHA: Yeah, this seems like some next level shit. 
SAM: Yeah, I assumed so. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Still-- 
MARISHA: Besides, I kind of want to talk to them, and they seem, you know, I would love to take a little bit of time to get their perspectives because they all seem very comfortable in their situations. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Just across the way behind you there's one of them holding the cards looks over and goes. "(growls)" (laughter) 
MARISHA: They look so happy! 
SAM: They know who they are. 
MARISHA: Yes! They embrace it. (laughter) 
SAM: They've self-actualized. It's actually really refreshing to see. 
MARISHA: You know, yes, and if I-- I might be somewhat cursed. Chetney might be. I mean, honestly, Chetney, you're also quite the inspiration because you are very comfortable and have accepted your situation. 
TRAVIS: Oh-- 
LAURA: Not just accepted, embraced, right? 
TRAVIS: Thriving! I mean, I'm next level. 
MARISHA: Right, yes. 
TRAVIS: It is a problem that it's a curse, though. 
MARISHA: You see, I don't know-- I've told Imogen this. I think Delilah's still in my head. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So... maybe-- 
SAM: So you're cursed. 
MARISHA: Maybe. 
ASHLEY: What? 
MARISHA: I don't know if I can classify-- I mean, I guess in a way, but, you know, maybe I just need to embrace it. 
SAM: Ah. 
TRAVIS: I'll fix it. 
LAURA: Yeah, I thought she was-- 
TRAVIS: I take one werewolf claw. (splats) 
LAURA: I thought we killed her killed her. I thought she was gone. 
MARISHA: I thought so, too, but here recently she's been like-- (exhales raspily) "You can't get rid of me." 
LIAM: Does she seem as present or strong as she used to? 
MARISHA: No, very dormant. Very dormant. But you see, I kind of, when I lost control with Bor'Dor and I sort of resorted to a thing that I was trying to keep at bay when I sucked his life force out, and I think that-- 
SAM: Hm. 
MARISHA: I think she was there. I don't think she was gone. I think she was just kind of, you know, like a seed frozen in the tundra and I gave her a little bit of warmth. 
SAM: Almost like she sort of lurks in the darkest parts of your subconscious or something, and when those parts show themselves, she gets a little bit further freed? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. That, and when I eat the souls of people. 
TRAVIS: When you what? 
LAURA: Oh, it feeds her. 
ASHLEY: The children, the souls. 
SAM: Eating children? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Back up. This is when we separated, right? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you want to-- 
LAURA: By eating children? 
TRAVIS: Then the eating the souls of children part. What did you mean by that? Hyperbole, I'm sure. 
MARISHA: Oh, I didn't say children. I think that she said children. 
ASHLEY: No, I was just adding because she was eating the souls. 
LAURA: Okay, phew. 
ASHLEY: I was like, "and the children," I was just trying to make a joke-- 
TRAVIS: People, souls-- 
SAM: Oh, okay. But she didn't actually eat a child? 
MARISHA: The souls of people. 
ASHLEY: No, no. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
TALIESIN: Not that we saw. 
MARISHA: I don't know if I'm actually eating their souls, but it's like this ravaging hunger comes over me and it's like I-- It's this necromantic draw and I can feel their heartbeat, their life force pulsing through me, and it's honestly exhilarating, but I think it's problematic. 
TRAVIS: Wait, this has been something that's been going on the entire time? 
MARISHA: Well, so... Yes. So... (laughter) 
MARISHA: So, okay, when Imogen and I were fighting because I touched her rock, and the rock, I think, had a little bit of-- 
LIAM: Youth. 
MARISHA: -- a life force. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Then it shattered. Then I suddenly-- Then I felt Delilah and she was like, "More!" Then I realized I had this new ability to reach in and grasp and excise people's beings from them, and every time I do it, when I lose control, she shows her pretty little face in my head. But I've tried not to do it. I haven't done it for a really long time. 
SAM: But maybe you should. Maybe you should just embrace your, embrace the shadow, embrace the dark side and confront it and own it like these pirates do. 
SIRI: I found this on the web. 
SAM: Oh, good. 
LIAM: Oh, that's good advice. 
LAURA: "Embracing the shadow" is literally what came up. 
SAM: Thank you, Siri. 
TRAVIS: Stay in your lane, Siri. 
ASHLEY: I didn't realize that you were-- 
MATT: "Excuse me." 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: You all turn, and away from all the rest of them, away from the card games and the social corners of the deck, there's one-- 
LIAM: Is anyone playing Rollies right now? 
MATT: Yeah, there are mad Rollies right now. They've forgotten the rest of the card games. 
TRAVIS: Pog championship. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: One of the smaller skeletons goes, "Sorry, I couldn't help but overhearing what you're talking about, and I--" 
MARISHA: Who's talking to us? Which one? 
MATT: You recognize the one who was referred to as "Keith?" 
LIAM: The little miniature from the battle? 
LAURA: Keith? 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, I wrote down Kyle. 
SAM: I did, too. 
ASHLEY: I wrote down Kyle as well-- 
MARISHA: I think it was Kyle. 
MATT: No, no. It was Keith, and he goes "Oh--" His name's Kyle, but the captain referred to him as Keith. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
SAM: Oh, poor-- 
MARISHA: Kyle, not Keith. 
MATT: Yeah. For a skeleton, he looks demure for as much as a fleshless bone husk on a ghost ship can be. Puts a hand up and places it on your shoulder. 
MARISHA: Hi, Kevin. 
MATT: "That's okay. You're new here. Um. Look, before I was a ghost skeleton thing." 
MARISHA: Hi. 
MATT: "I struggled with some challenges of my own." 
MARISHA: Really? 
MATT: "In my own life. I gave in very intensely to the drink." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: "It had a hold on a lot of my life, and at times I tried to hold it back, and times I gave into it. I came to realize, you can't get rid of it. It's always there, and it's more about learning to live with it and just let it not rule you. Once you're an addict, you're always an addict." 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: "It's learning how to better deal with those impulses and relying on those around you who have your best interests at heart and listening to them when they're very loud and aggressively telling you to put it down." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MARISHA: That's very insightful, yes. 
ASHLEY: That's very insightful. All right. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MARISHA: I'm seeing one-for-one allegory. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I mean, that feels a bit like what the werewolves told you. 
TRAVIS: I am a werewolf. 
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. I might have exposed some personal-- 
TRAVIS: I, too, feel the desire for blood and meat and sometimes sinewy fatty bits, but I feel you. Once an addict, always an addict. 
MARISHA: Hm. I mean, I didn't really make the choice to have her in my brain, but I see what you mean. 
MATT: "Yeah. Anyway, I'm going to go keep cleaning up." He walks off. 
TRAVIS: Hey wait, Keith! Keith, have you ever-- 
MATT: "It's Kyle." 
LIAM: Oh. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh. See, well-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, I feel like I crossed it out-- 
LIAM: I feel like we slid into "Our Flag Means Death." 
ASHLEY: -- and then I wrote it back. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: We really did. 
TRAVIS: I was just curious, and you fought so well earlier, have you ever known the captain to not keep his word? 
MATT: "No, the Captain's a good man. He keeps his word. He's, you know, he's a big, strong sort of forthright man." 
ASHLEY: Insight check. 
MATT: Make an insight check. (laughter) (laughter) 
LAURA: (laughs) Aggressive. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: What number is that? Ooh! 
ASHLEY: All right. (laughs) Sorry. 19 plus 13. It's a lot. 
SAM: That's a million. 
SAM and TRAVIS: 32. 
ASHLEY: 32. 
SAM: Oh! Whispers! 
MARISHA: Whispers! 
SAM: I got nothing to say. This is not for whispers. 
LAURA: 13? You have a 13 insight? 
MARISHA: Whispers. 
SAM: Guys. We've got a live show coming up. Might be in theaters. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Might not. 
SAM: Also other stuff. Graphic novels, Dark Horse, sweatpants. 
LAURA: Sweatpants, hoodies. 
TALIESIN: The book is right here. 
SAM: Sagomir. 
LIAM: Marisha, do you need a coffee of some kind? 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: (laughs) That seemed like an aggressive question. 
LAURA: Why? 
MARISHA: Do I-- (stammers) 
SAM: Marisha, do you-- 
MARISHA: Are you talking to me? I should drop Laudna. 
LIAM: I said, Marisha. I didn't say Laudna. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
LAURA: Does she seem tired? I don't think you seem tired. 
LIAM: No, I just thought she might like a flat white with vanilla. 
LAURA: Oh. (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: I can't believe I didn't see that coming. 
MARISHA: Yes. I am tired. 
TRAVIS: Yes, you would. 
MARISHA: I am so tired, Liam. 
TRAVIS: You were treading around in that space for while. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Why are you asking her that? 
MATT: "So, Captain Novos is a very strong leader. He's helped us carve our way into history and everyone in the islands fears us, both Host and the Wandermen and everyone in between. We are endlessly instilling fear across the seas of the Shattered Teeth until the day that we finally acquire all of his missing gains and we can rest." 
ASHLEY: But, doesn't it frustrate you a little bit that, you know, people around here can't even remember your name? What's your name? Kevin? Keith? 
SAM: Cameron. 
ASHLEY: Cameron? 
LAURA: Kyle. 
MATT: "It's Kyle." 
ASHLEY: It is Kyle. It's just Kyle. None of the other names. I'm so sorry. 
MATT: "I forgot what the other names were. It's just Kyle." 
ASHLEY: It's just Kyle. 
MATT: "I've been trying to get them just to learn one for so long, I forgot the rest. But anyway. No, it's fine." He looks over his shoulder towards the other crew members and you see his eye line goes straight to the very, very back room where the stairs lead up to the deck. 
MATT: Sitting on the stool right next to the captain's quarters, you can see Cyrillia-- 
TRAVIS: Fuck yes. 
MATT: -- sitting right there, watching all of you having this conversation on the other side of the deck. 
SAM: Hawk's nest. 
MATT: "Anyway, I got to get back to cleaning. It's just something to do. It doesn't really get dirty here and it doesn't really get clean. We're just going through the motions." 
ASHLEY: I get it, I get it. 
MARISHA: Thanks, Ken. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "It's Kyle." 
TRAVIS: "It's Kyle!" 
SAM: That was very insightful, by the way. 
LAURA: It was! 
MARISHA: It was. 
SAM: Why is fucking Konnor a better therapist than me? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: (sighs) 
TALIESIN: I mean-- 
ASHLEY: I didn't know you were actually taking souls. I thought you were doing a bit and so I was adding onto it about the children part. But this is-- 
MARISHA: Well, I can't confirm nor deny that they're souls. I'm collecting them, you know, like a phylactery, or at least I think-- You know, I don't know. I don't really know what happens. 
LAURA: I think Kyle made a good point that it's never a good thing to give into it. Although, that does contradict your advice, FCG. 
SAM: Well, I wasn't saying maybe give into it. I was just saying acknowledge it. 
LAURA: No, you said give into it. 
SAM: Well, I did, I did. 
LAURA: Give yourself over to it, is what you said. 
SAM: I did. 
LAURA: But I think every time you do, I mean based on the fact that you've heard her again, she gets stronger. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: You provide her with that power when you pull it into yourself, right? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: It feeds her. 
MARISHA: Yes. But then she feeds me, right? 
LAURA: I mean, yeah, you do get stronger. It's just, do we want her to get stronger? 
SAM: We want you to. 
LAURA: What if-- If she gets strong enough, she'll fully take over. What if it's like... 
MARISHA: I've had that thought. But also we're going into such extreme and uncertain circumstances. It feels like we're going to need all the firepower we can get. So maybe it's a necessary evil? 
TALIESIN: I think it's important to realize what we're fighting for, and that's us. So it's not worth it if we're going to lose somebody. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I feel like we all have to accept, or at least be aware that that is a possibility, though. Right? 
TALIESIN: Sacrif-- 
MARISHA: You all have had this thought, right? 
TALIESIN: I believe in sacrifices and not casualties. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no, no. We're all going to get out of this. We're all going to be alive. We're going to be so happy and everything is going to be aces. 
LIAM: I think about it a lot. 
SAM: You do? 
LIAM: What Ashton said. I don't want to die, but I'm willing to sacrifice. We're kidding ourselves if we don't think that we're not marching into the lion's den. I wouldn't stand by and let you be taken if that happens. I hope it doesn't. 
LAURA: I want you at our side, not her. 
MARISHA: All right. No, this is good. It's good to hear everyone's thoughts. Maybe tomorrow you can still Scry. 
SAM: Sure. Yeah. 
MARISHA: It might be telling. 
SAM: Maybe she's gone. 
MARISHA: Maybe she's gone. 
ASHLEY: I wonder if you could make a deal with her or something. But I guess that's what-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: What's happening right now. 
ASHLEY: -- what's happening, actually, now that I think about it. 
SAM: Can we rewind one second? Did you sense anything from young Konnor? 
TRAVIS: (rewinding tape) 
ASHLEY: I did. I just-- He was very sweet. It's Kyle. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: He just, you know. He thinks the captain is fine, but he's just a lonely little guy, you know? 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: No one's really taking him seriously or even remembering his name. 
MARISHA: That's sad. 
LAURA: Buddy. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MARISHA: So sad. 
TALIESIN: A lot of malaise on this ship. 
ASHLEY: Should we make him a little name tag? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: That's a great idea! 
TALIESIN: Will it stay on a ghost? 
LAURA: You can pin it to his skeleton. 
ASHLEY: Maybe a necklace situation? 
TALIESIN: I'm not here to crush a dream. 
MARISHA: His ribcage. 
TALIESIN: I am not here to crush a dream. 
ASHLEY: Etch it into the ribs? 
MARISHA: Chetney can chisel one or paint one. 
SAM: A wooden name tag to pin to his bone chest? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: A little necklace situation. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, like a little wooden dog tag. 
LAURA: My name is Kyle, you fucks. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I like that. 
SAM: I like it. 
ASHLEY: I like that. 
SAM: Let's do it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. He's a sweet boy. 
SAM: Then to rewind just a bit further, are we now getting tattoos? 
MARISHA: Oh, right! 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Good jesus, god. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Flaming bells? 
LAURA: I like it. 
SAM: Flaming bells is great. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It is kind of cute. 
LIAM: Specific spot? 
TRAVIS: I got mine picked out. 
LAURA: On your butt cheek, Orym. 
LIAM: Sorry. Filled up. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: The butt cheek? 
LIAM: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: Oh man, I'm just a blank canvas. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You'll see. 
LIAM: I'll hold it taut for the artist. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's firmer than you think. 
LIAM, MATT, and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: That paints a picture. 
SAM: Very scrotal. 
LIAM: Well-- (snickering) 
LIAM: I would put a flaming bell on my butt for all of you. 
TRAVIS: Little angled now. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Let's do it. 
SAM: Well, let's go do it. 
MATT: All right. So. 
LAURA: It's going to take so long with this many people. 
SAM: Ah, no. He's got-- 
TRAVIS: Eh, they're small ones. 
MARISHA: We've got days. 
TRAVIS: Small ones. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. 
ASHLEY: We've got a few days. 
MATT: It depends on how elaborate your piece needs to be over the next two to three days. 
TRAVIS: Whoever's going first is going to suffer, though. 
LAURA: Line art. 
MATT: All right. So I guess to that point-- 
LIAM: Mine will be very small. 
MATT: All right. What are you plotting then? Those who know what your tattoos will be. 
TALIESIN: It's all the same, other than me. 
LAURA: It's a bell with fire around it. 
TALIESIN: I'm the only one who's getting something more complicated. 
MATT: A bell with fire around it? 
ASHLEY: It's real cool. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: On one cheek? 
LAURA: I'm not getting it on my butt. 
TALIESIN: Not getting it on my ass. 
SAM: Just all over. 
MATT: Were you getting it, Ashley? 
SAM: Wherever we want it. Wherever we want it. On our butt. 
TALIESIN: I'm getting-- 
LAURA: That looks like a Taco Bell bell. 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: I'm getting the Taco Bell. 
SAM: Its fine. We've committed to it. (laughter) 
SAM: Taco Bell doesn't exist in this world. 
MATT: We'll figure it out. 
SAM: We invented it. It's canon. 
MARISHA: You guys, live más. (laughter) 
MATT: (laughing) No! 
TRAVIS: Live más. 
ASHLEY: Live más and check your Gmail. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: We really know branding. 
MARISHA: Wait, that is the Taco-- Is it a flaming bell? 
TRAVIS: No, it's just a bell in an arch thing. 
LAURA: It's just a bell. 
ASHLEY: I think it's just a bell. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, just an arch. 
LAURA: We got to rethink the bell. 
SAM: We'll figure it out. 
LAURA: It just can't be the Taco Bell bell. 
TRAVIS: It was a fiery bell. 
TALIESIN: We'll make it work. 
LIAM: We'll go with Del Taco instead. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ El Pollo Loco ♪ 
MATT: Anyway. (laughter) 
MATT: What are you planning, Ashton? 
TALIESIN: I just want the shoulder back wing piece. Not too big, very much in his style. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: In Primordial, I just want a piece that says: From the earth, of the earth, to the earth. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's nice. 
MATT: All right. You'll sketch it out for him since he does not speak Primordial. 
TALIESIN: Sure. Sketch the letters and give me the vibe. 
MATT: And it is. For everyone else it will be ink. But for you, it's a scarring. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: It's a heavy series of hits across your back which creates a heavy pockmarked scarring in the shape and the design of the Primordial you requested. It's really, really cool how it sits. It looks like a neat, multi-tiered design that flares out across the back of the shoulders. But those who can read Primordial or look close enough you can see the continuation of each piece to the next that creates the phrase upon the phrase upon the phrase. It thins down with the lats, the middle of the small back. It takes a good full day. As per the request of your artist and based on your own experience, it is a very painful, very loud experience. For the rest of you in the midst of this, over the next day or so in which this takes place, is there anything you're doing to either stay present and watch or escape to get away from the yelling? 
SAM: Just hanging out. In the next couple days I might Scry on Delilah, but other than that, just hanging out. 
MATT: Sure. You want to try and Scry on Delilah? 
SAM: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MATT: All righty. All right. Your first attempt. You feel as the Scrying ritual begins to reach out for something, it almost seems to unravel the moment that it reaches beyond the circle you create and the runes (snuffing) filter out. 
SAM: Okay. That didn't work. How about, I could ask Changebringer about her or I could go into your dreams. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
SAM: Do you dream about her? 
MARISHA: We could certainly try. I mean, she's like a daydream all the time. 
SAM: Then maybe I could just do it anytime. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Oh daydreamer ("Dream Weaver") ♪ 
MARISHA: I could maybe-- Hey, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Do you still have those little incense and kind of-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. Do you want me to set up a little-- 
MARISHA: Little nap space? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: A little meditation space? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Imogen, would you stay with me? 
LAURA: Of course. 
SAM: It might help if you can sort of think horrible thoughts to sort of bring her out? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Because you were saying, it's sort of the darkest parts of you that activate her? 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: I don't know. Maybe? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to set everything up nice with some fabrics-- 
SAM: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: -- and some incense, crush up a little lavender and a little blue lotus. Sprinkle it around you. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: Do you want to try to suck out some of my soul? 
SAM: (gasps) 
LAURA: Wake her up? 
SAM: Whoa. 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: You would just give up your soul like that? 
LAURA: Well, I don't imagine she'd take all of it. 
SAM: It might spark Delilah. 
MARISHA: Let's try the more mild approach first. 
TRAVIS: Conservative. 
MARISHA: Yes. Yes. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: But I'll lay my head in Imogen's lap and get myself to that half asleep, half awake deep meditative space and focus and meditate on Delilah. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. And you're casting Shared Dream? 
SAM: Shared Dream. 
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll d20 and add your wisdom modifier, please. 
LAURA: Can I, at the same time, I want to cast Detect Thoughts. But I'm going to try to-- 
SAM: Wisdom. 
LAURA: -- focus through Laudna's thoughts and see if I can find another pathway. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Ooh. That's cool. 
SAM: 17. 
MATT: 17. Okay. 
SAM: This is a weird dice. 
LAURA: Well, we made those too. 
ASHLEY: Can I help--

LAURA: Those are ours. 
ASHLEY: -- you out in any way, since I'm setting up a little space? 
LIAM: Just keeps like odd. 
SAM: Huh? What? 
ASHLEY: Can I help you out in any way since I made a little space? 
SAM: I don't know. Can she? 
TALIESIN: Trying to make this calming or are we trying to make this uncomfortable? I'm not sure. 
SAM: Huh? What? 
TALIESIN: Do we want a calm space? Is that what we want? 
SAM: It's a calm space. 
ASHLEY: I mean, that's what I was going for. 
LIAM: Laudna said she wanted-- 
LAURA: As calm as it can be with you screaming in the background. 
TALIESIN: I'm taking a break right now. (laughter) 
SAM: (Ashton screaming) 
ASHLEY: Just finish the outline. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Does it hurt? 
TALIESIN: Yes. A lot. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: All right. You concentrate and focus and as you try and bring the image of Delilah into your mind, it's like you have a hard time remembering what she looks like. You know who she is, you've seen her before, but when you go into your subconscious, it's just a shadow. It's just an outline. Like she's perpetually backlit by a faint purple light and you can't see her face. It's hard to focus. Every single time you try and directly look towards it your attention drifts off to something in the background. 
LAURA: Can I try to help her focus? 
MATT: You would have if you were attempting, if you were successful in delving for any consciousness beyond hers. But unfortunately, you can see what she's seeing, but you don't sense another consciousness that you can connect with around or within her at the moment. You share in the space and you can see from her as Laudna is stepping through this calm field of purple orchids and other funeral-like flowers. You can see trees and the distant shadow of a city. Kind of familiar to the shadow realm that you fought Delilah in not long before, though also unfocused and blurred in places and amorphous and changing. You see as she walks, there's that shadow of a woman that walks in front of her and even you trying to focus on it, your attention keeps looking off into other surrounding details. The daydream fades as you hear the sound of creaking and the cheers of six or seven skeletal crew off to the side as a four-way game of Rollies came to a climactic-- 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: Multi-tiered stage conclusion. 
LIAM: (cackles) 
MATT: That's about as much as you can glean. 
SAM: I'm sorry. I failed you. 
MARISHA: What did you see? 
SAM: Just blurry purple shapes and nothing. 
MARISHA: Hmm. All right. Maybe that's a good sign. 
SAM: Do you feel any different? 
MARISHA: Do I feel any different? 
MATT: Sadly, no. 
MARISHA: Not really. But I'm rested. 
SAM: Hey, that's great! 
ASHLEY: That's good. 
MARISHA: The lavender is nice. 
ASHLEY: Oh yes, that was a little nice. 
SAM: Oh well. 
LAURA: Next time, suck my soul. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: (chuckles) 
MARISHA: Kind of hot. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: That's a great Red Hot Chili Peppers song. 
TRAVIS: That should be the tattoo.

MATT: Yes? 
ASHLEY: Is it just kind of, is-- 
TALIESIN: That was fast. 
ASHLEY: -- Cyrillia at the door, or is it just-- 
MATT: At the moment, no. The captain has gone to the upper deck and Cyrillia followed behind, about 15, 20 feet. 
TRAVIS: And upper decker. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: I was waiting for it. 
ASHLEY: I'm just going to walk around. I'm not really sure where anything is, and I'm just going to walk into the captain's quarters. 
MATT: The door is very locked. As you go for the handle-- (soft thump) 
ASHLEY: Shit. I'm going to try to open it. 
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That was the end of Fearne. (trap plopping) (laughs)

ASHLEY: (grimaces) 10.

LAURA: ♪ (sad whomps) ♪ 
MATT: You glance around, get down to where the keyhole is and it is an elaborate keyhole. It looks like an intersectional plus-like gap amongst a normal keyhole itself, and as you try and figure out how to use your lockpicks, you get two pieces in and the tumblers are odd. You've not encountered a lock like this and you quickly realize within about a minute or so, that there is no way you're getting through this. 
ASHLEY: There's no way I'm getting through this door. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: I'll just knock. I know he is upstairs, but just in case. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. You knock. (knocking) There's no answer, but a number of the crew who are down into the other chamber glance over at the sound of a gentle knock. Up on the deck, you glance up and can hear heavy footfalls (plodding footsteps) begin to approach. 
ASHLEY: Oh. I'll just start walking down the hall. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. 
ASHLEY: Where's the-- 
MATT: Descending, you hear a voice go, "Oh, I know, I know." 
ASHLEY: You know where the bathroom is? 
MATT: (laughs) You see the Captain Novos descending the steps, sheathing his new blade as he steps down to the shadow below. "Can I help you?" 
ASHLEY: Yes. I need to pee. I don't know if someone's already peeing in there. 
MATT: Gestures up to the deck. "Like the rest of us used to, overboard." 
ASHLEY: How does that work? 
MATT: "Or pick a bucket." 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh. Okay. But this is your area where you sleep? 
MATT: "Aye. If I see you too close again, we'll keelhaul you and make you one of the crew." 
ASHLEY: Oh. Do you have extra bed space in there? Just, I'm so tired. I'm so tired and I just want a nice place to lay down. I won't even be in your way. Just a little nap would be so, so, so nice right now, you don't even know. 
MATT: He looks up at you, because he is still a dwarven skeleton, and you stand a full two and a half, three feet taller than him, though he still holds a presence that looms large in the middle of this tight hallway. 
LAURA: Fearne's got a type. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

MATT: "I'm sorry." (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: "Are you suggesting that you, a flesh and blood horned beast as yourself, wants to come and lay down in the captain's quarters just to get a nice little bit of wink eye?" 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Wink eye. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
SAM: Come on! This is the most important roll of the campaign! 
TRAVIS: Get that wink eye! 
LAURA: Get it! 
MARISHA: Fearne's like: Can I take a nap in your RV? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: 21. 
MATT: 21? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. If not, I understand. I totally know it's such a forward thing to ask. I was just checking. No harm in asking, right? 
MATT: "No harm. Well, when the moon's up tonight--" 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: "-- you can rest." 
ASHLEY: See, that's funny because I feel like the moon is not going to come up tonight. because I don't think you guys see it out here. So I think you're telling me that I cannot come up here and sleep. Right? 
MATT: "I'll let you know." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. I'm going to go. I'm getting a tattoo. (laughter) 
MATT: As you step past, the captain sits there for a second. You see his head look at the ground for a minute, like if you ever see a skeletal ghost captain process-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: -- quietly to himself for a good minute. 
LIAM: (as Captain) "Did that just happen?" 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: Before he shakes his head a bit and steps back up to the deck. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. We're getting somewhere. We're getting somewhere.

SAM: Hmm? 
MATT: What's your passive perception? 
LAURA: It's over here. 
ASHLEY: 19. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: 19. 
LIAM: Pretty good. 
MATT: Almost out of nowhere, a voice creeps into your left ear. 
MATT: "What are you doing with the captain?" 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh, it's Cyrillia. 
MATT: You glance, and right there is Cyrillia, the navigator, uncomfortably close. You can feel the heat emanating from her smoldering bones at this proximity. 
TRAVIS: Smoldering. 
LAURA: Smoldering bones. 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to step on your toes if this is your thing. I wasn't even trying to do a thing. I was trying to get a comfy bed. I'm sorry. 
MATT: "Don't sleep with the captain!" 
ASHLEY: Because it's not great? What do you mean? (laughter) 
MATT: (ghostly wisp) She just steps back. (laughs) 
LIAM: She just wafts away.

SAM: We're working on our tattoos. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
MARISHA: Yes, how many of us have done the-- 
MATT: You finished your back piece and we'll say, moving through the table, Orym, you probably were the most eager to get yours done next. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: And one other person. For the next half day's journey or so, the rest of you will be able to be finished up. 
MARISHA: Where are you getting yours? 
LAURA: I don't know, I can't decide! 
MARISHA: I was thinking maybe back of the shoulder kind of thing, maybe? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. Oh, that would look good! 
MARISHA: I don't know. I also am very curious how this is going to work on my flesh. 
SAM: Me too. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I mean, it's basically parchment. It should just take fine. 
LAURA: Yeah, I could just draw on it. with pen and it'll stay! 
MARISHA: That's true. (laughs) That's true! 
LAURA: Well, you know. 
MARISHA: What about you, Letters? How is this going to work? 
SAM: I don't know. (laughter) 
SAM: I don't know how this is going to work. 
TALIESIN: Do the same thing we did with me. We'll just tap it in. 
LAURA: Etch it? 
TALIESIN: Etch it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, really. (metallic clanking) 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
MATT: Which is exactly what it sounds like. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's really annoying. (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's really annoying. 
MATT: But the final evening of the journey, as the rest of you are watching the sky turn to a dark, dark lightless expanse, the faint blue glow of the various lanterns that hang and swing with the ship as it rocks into the ocean waves, that the faint bit of glow that gives off to the heavy fog that vanishes into nothing. Eventually, the captain, who spent a majority of the day walking and looking out over the waters and occasionally pulling out his new sword and looking at it for an extended period of time before putting it back. 
LAURA: He's obsessed. 
SAM: That sword. 
LAURA: He's obsessed with that thing. 
MATT: Comes back and finds you, and goes, "The moon's out." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: "If you're to rest, now's the time." 
ASHLEY: Yes! Yes, of course. 
MATT: Steps back to his quarters and within the cloak pulls out this wicked looking thin skeleton key. It's almost bladed at the edge into multiple blades, and (lock mechanism clicking) puts it back in his coat and opens the door. 
LAURA: What is that sound? 
MATT: You're on a ghost ship. Shit's creepy. 
LAURA: Oh, it's just a creepy sound? 
MATT: No, I don't know what that is. (laughter) 
MATT: Trying to lull you into a false sense of security. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What do I see in there? 
MATT: On the inside-- Well, the door's open and it's pitch black in there. You can just see this faint bit of a bay glass window on the opposite side of the chamber that looks out into the almost completely dark seascape beyond in the mist that is faintly lit by the exterior lanterns. On the inside of it, as the doors open, interior lanterns (flames ignite) begin to light the chamber with a dull white blue flame. You can see there is a desk and there are shelves on the sides. There is a small collection of trinkets, though many of the shelves are bare, and you can see there is a canopy bed that is settled on the left hand side of the chamber as well as a sitting couch, like a fainting couch on the right hand side. It's very well-furnished. 
ASHLEY: I can absolutely take the fainting couch to nap on. It's totally fine. 
MATT: "Up to you." 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll take the bed. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Okay. Are you sleeping now, too? (laughs) Or just me? I was just going to take a nap? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "We don't sleep." 
ASHLEY: Oh. Oh. So you're not going to go to sleep? 
MATT: "No." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Are you going to sail the boat? 
MATT: "The boat sails itself." 
ASHLEY: Okay. That's a cool thing. 
MATT: "She's part of my deal." 
ASHLEY: That's part of your deal? So what's that about? Like, it's over once you get all your stuff? Are you cursed? 
MATT: "Maybe. I just need my things back and vengeance complete." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
LAURA: Vengeance complete. 
MATT: "Then--" 
ASHLEY: What's-- 
MATT: "Then we can do what we like." 
ASHLEY: So you get your things and then vengeance is complete. What does that entail? 
MATT: "Finding those who wronged us and end their bloodline." 
LAURA: (gasps) 
SAM: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: That feels like a lot of work. 
MATT: "It's good work, if you can get it." 
ASHLEY: So when this whole thing is done for you, is everybody else on the ship just free to go? 
MATT: "I don't know." 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: "We'll find out when we get there. So are you going to sleep?" 
ASHLEY: Well, it might take me a minute to fall asleep, but yes! 
TRAVIS: Why the full moon? 
ASHLEY: So the moon is showing? 
MATT: Mm-mm. 
LAURA: Mm-mm. Mm-mm. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, I'm going to go to the canopy bed. and lay down. 
LIAM: We're in the last night? 
MATT: This will be the last evening on the ship, yeah. 
LIAM: The last evening. Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: What did he say about bloodlines? 
MATT: The bed is chilly. 
SAM: End the bloodline. 
MATT: The sheets that remain there look like they've been untouched in a very long time. There is a layer of dust that sets upon the entirety of it. 
ASHLEY: (coughs) 
MATT: As you open the sheets a bit and pull back the blanket, they're very nice, a couple of crimson splashes stained across the exterior. 
LIAM: Oh, look at this! 
LAURA: (laughs) Mm! 
MATT: But-- 
SAM: Black light! 
MATT: It looks comfortable. 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to lay down and try to act like I'm falling asleep. 
MATT: Okay. A few moments pass before you hear the captain's voice, a little close. "You're very warm." 
LAURA: (squelchy) Oh! 
ASHLEY: (snores) 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Take one for the team. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Remember that conversation about sacrifices? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Never go full Penzance. 
ASHLEY: 12. 
MATT: 12? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Boom! 
MATT: "You're warm and you're awake." 
ASHLEY: Oh! You can lie next to me, get some warmth, if you'd like. Maybe you'll get a little nappy in. 
TRAVIS: Yo ho ho. 
MATT: "You offer some of your warmth?" 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: ♪ Fearne going to fuck a bone ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ Or die ♪ 
ASHLEY: That-- 
LAURA: I know! What if she gets cursed? 
SAM: Or what if it's the best sex of her life? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: What-- (laughs) What if? 
LIAM: Only one way to find out! 
ASHLEY: But that sounds so ominous, like I'm going to give you some of my warmth. Am I giving it to you forever? 
MATT: "My apologies, but everything I say comes out ominous." (laughter) 
MATT: "I wish I could control it. It comes with the territory." 
ASHLEY: Yeah? All right, well, hop in! Hop in. Hop in! 
MARISHA: If he doesn't kill you, Cyrillia will. 
LAURA: I know she's going to hex you. 
MATT: He scoots up onto the edge of the bed. It's funny, this captain who has given this intense presence on the ship, in this moment seems almost, I don't want to say sheepish, but careful. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: I'm not going to do anything. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to do anything. I-- So that sword that you have, I-- That was supposed to be for me. (surprised laughs) 
ASHLEY: I know in this deal, you know, we made you a deal for that sword, but I was wondering if there's anything else that maybe we could get. Listen, I know that's part of the deal. If, for some reason, you have it this whole trip and you're just over it, I will take it off of your hands. 
MATT: He steps up from the bed a little bit and takes a few steps away from you, looking out through the glass window that you can, now it looked like it once had this faint bluish glow from the dark interior of when you first entered at the captain's quarters, the interior light now makes it a black void beyond the windows. He pulls the blade out and looks at it and you can see it's still a massive, thick, cross-hilted sword. It looks too large almost, probably end to end nearly as tall as he is, but he still holds it off like it's paper in his hand as it glistens, and glances back over his shoulder at you, and blue flame crackling in his skull sockets. "It's quite a deal that was made for this sword. You're the first we've had on ship since we started. It was a fair trade and it's now one of my things." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I just say goodbye to it? 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
TRAVIS: I'm loving this. Love this. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it's cocked! 
LAURA: Ooh! That's good! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 26. 
TRAVIS: Not Ryan Phillippe. 
MATT: He looks at you-- 
ASHLEY: No, I'm so sorry. Why am I bad at math right now? 15 plus-- 
SAM: Now? 
ASHLEY: You said persuasion? 
MATT: Yes. 
ASHLEY: All the time. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: 26! 26! 
MATT: 26. Okay. Got it. Looks at the blade for a second. "For a moment." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: "Then can I have some of your warmth?" 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Just a little teensy. Don't take it away from me, but I will-- Okay. 
MATT: Hands you the blade. It touches your grasp. Your fingers clasp around at the cold metal in your fingers. You feel this flickering light that seems to burgeon in your palm and a voice comes to your mind. "You, lass of the Fey Realm--" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Ah, you hold within you a great power--" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "-- a power that was once taken from me, but you burn like a beacon. The path you walk in life has such purpose. You've been chosen, and together, we can do great many things." 
ASHLEY: Did it say something to you? 
MATT: "No?" 
MARISHA: No! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It didn't? 
MATT: "Give it back." 
ASHLEY: Do you want to stay with him? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, where you going? Where are you going to go? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Buffering, buffering. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You broke the game. 
LAURA: (laughs) You broke the game. 
LIAM: How are we all? 
ASHLEY: Sorry. (laughs) 
MATT: "You walk many paths, dance across the plains, the lands. There is much corruption in the world. And we can snuff it out. We can snuff it out." 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, I'm going to give this back to you, but I'm going to miss it. All right, get in the bed. Get in the bed. 
MATT, LAURA, and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: Immediately looks nervous for a skeleton. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm just going to go take a quick shower. (laughter) 
LIAM: I'm a little musky. (laughter) 
MATT: "It's been a long time since I have--" 
ASHLEY: Spooned? 
MATT: "Aye." 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Come, come, come, come, come, come, come. Come, come, come. (laughter) 
MATT: The crackling of his bones against themselves in the inside of his cloak-- 
ASHLEY: It's fine, I've had older. 
MATT: -- his jacket wrinkling heavily. The damp leather squeaking across the wood. Eventually curls up. "Am I spooning you?" 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no. Well, you're going to go in front of me and I'm going to spoon you with my warmth. 
MATT: "I've never been spooned before." 
ASHLEY: (gasps) It's the best. I'm going to wrap around him, put a leg over, and try to make him go to sleep. (laughter) 
MATT: As you curl up around the dread Captain Novos in his quarters-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- scourge of the seas that surround the Shattered Teeth. 
TRAVIS: Oh my gosh. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Big spoon to his little. 
MATT: (laughs) He doesn't breathe, but he sighs with a contentment that you can see the cold breaths emanate from beyond the back of his skull. Now outside the mouth, you cannot see. "It's been some time." 
LIAM: (quietly) It's been-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Here, I'll help with that. 
ASHLEY: It's been a long time since you felt the warmth of a woman's touch. (sighs) Where am I going with this stuff? (laughter) 
SAM: You're doing great. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'll stay here as long as you need and I'll just keep giving you my warmth. 
MATT: Okay. He rests for a good few hours. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to try to look around the room, try to take in the room and see what's around, if there's anything exciting that-- 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Is there a list? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Anything I can find in there. 
LIAM: Can I go on the Double Dare Toys "R" Us run? 
ASHLEY: Investigation? 
MATT: Roll a perception, as it were. 
ASHLEY: Perception, okay, okay. 23. 
MATT: 23. Glancing back from where you are, I mean, the desk definitely has drawers that are closed. You can see on the shelves there are some areas that are cluttered and some areas that are empty. There is a modicum of a collection that appears to be missing pieces. What you can see, it looks like there is a ring that is placed upon a stone or wooden hand that's carved, just on display. The hand that's on it, the carving, looks like it's been cleft in two to the point where it's almost broken apart into two pieces, but it still holds itself there. There's this wide gap in the middle of the hand. You can see there, it's a small porcelain statue. It looks somewhat chipped in places. It looks like a baby elephant that's been painted over. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: You can see that there is a chest that has a heavy lock on it that sits shoved off to the side of that fainting couch area. It has a musky doily thrown over it that has a mildewed twinge to it. 
MARISHA: A musky doily. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
LAURA: That's like a bandaid. 
MATT: (chuckles) A bandaid. 
ASHLEY: I'm just rubbing his back. (blubbery knocks) The ribs. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The ribs! (laughs) 
MATT: Roll a constitution saving throw for me. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: He wants some of your warmth. 
ASHLEY: Advantage against spells and other magical effects? 
MATT: This would be a magical effect. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 18. 
MATT: 18. In the time that you're there, as you're looking about, you exhale and have a moment where-- almost like you forget how to inhale for a moment. Your body temperature seems to drop and you feel this chilled essence begin to combat the fire that burns within your spirit. Do you relinquish the promised warmth? 
LAURA: (quietly) Oh... 
MATT: You've brought it from a compulsion to a choice. Do you relinquish the warmth you promised? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: (claps) Yes! 
SAM: Can always get it back. 
TRAVIS: Yes! Chaos Fearne! 
SAM: You can always get it back from your demon boyfriend. 
ASHLEY: I can always get it back. 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: He said share. 
ASHLEY: Yes! Listen, I'm all quid pro quo here. I give a little. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Wait, no. Wait, that's not what it is. 
MARISHA: (waffling mumbles) 
SAM: I mean, yeah, but if it's your choice, it's your power. Sure, okay. 
ASHLEY: If you give a little, you get a little. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, that can usually be-- Never mind, let's scrap that. 
MATT: The flame that ever smolders in your spirit dims ever so faintly as you feel that warmth leave you. The cold, long-dead captain seemed to have a moment of color return. The bone not pale, blanched white, stone-like gray, but almost like a bit of sunlight hits the exterior of his bones. Two things, and I'll talk to you at break about one of them. (oohing) 
MATT: Your hit points are permanently reduced by five. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
LAURA: Permanently? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, of course. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: And we'll talk about the other part at break. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (gasp) 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Stay after class. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: Then as that leaves, the captain, you hear go, "Ah, I like those who keep up their end of a bargain. That's what we live by. And I thank you for letting me know what it's like to be the small spoon." 
TRAVIS and SAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Course. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: "Anyway, I haven't left the ship to its devices this long before. I should get back to the deck." He sits up from the edge of the bed and steps off of it, adjusts his jacket. You can see the ice that seems to have gathered inside of his jacket, some of it has melted, and there's actually a damp puddle on the ground. "(groans) That's never happened before." 
SAM: Oh! (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Wet spot. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) That's fine. You're just getting a little warmth. Okay. 
MATT: "We should go." 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we should go. Just remember, if you don't want your sword, you know, and get a little warmth, just reconsider. But let's go. 
MATT: He leads you briskly out of the chamber. As soon as you leave the captain's chambers, he goes "(groans)," (scrapes) and closes the doors behind and you hear it lock. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, I'm going to walk back to everybody. 
SAM: Well, hey, Fearne. How you doing? 
ASHLEY: Hi. I'm all right. How are you? 
TRAVIS: Did you want to check your surroundings as you leave the quarters? 
LAURA: I know, Cyrillia, what's she's been doing this whole time? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: It's been hours, right? 
MATT: It's been a couple hours, yeah. The rest of you are doing what? 
LIAM: I've been on deck the whole time. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I know that I've seen Cyrillia come and go. 
MATT: You've seen Cyrillia has been keeping up on-- As you're keeping an eye, wherever the captain goes Cyrillia seems to shadow about 20 or 30 feet behind, like a bodyguard that's always keeping watch, sometimes visibly, sometimes skulking, but you're pretty perceptive and keep a bead. 
LIAM: Did that happen when Fearne went down below to the quarters? 
MATT: Make a perception check for me. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Down below? 
TRAVIS: In the captain's quarters. 
LIAM: (groans) That's a cocked natural 20. The other one's a 19, though. So let's roll it again. Okay, so 30. 
LAURA: Bummer. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: As the two of them vanish into the captain's quarters, as soon as they started conversing, you can see Cyrillia leaps up from the crow's nest and is peering down. When they both vanish from view, Cyrillia, in an almost panicked sprint, clambers down the mast and rushes to the top of the stairs, stops to look at the doorway, glances around with her one eye, frantically runs off to the top of the deck and seems to climb over the edge and vanish from view. 
LIAM: Excellent. 
TRAVIS: The side of the ship? 
MARISHA: She hanging over the side of the boat? 
LIAM: Because when that happens, Orym climbs up to the crow's nest. I remember Cyrillia taking out a spyglass, using it and putting it away. I want to find that. 
MATT: Okay. Easy enough to find in the crow's nest. There's a small leather pouch that's affixed to the side of the mast itself. That has within it crossbow bolts. It has extremely old bread. (laughs) It's just dust at this point with elements of dried crust from god knows how many decades passed. And indeed the spyglass that you saw. 
LIAM: I take it. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: And I leave. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: You're the one that's going to get us cursed. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I thought it was going to be Fearne. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Second stolen spyglass of this campaign. 
MATT: It's a theme. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: It's not the captain's. 
MATT: About an hour or two goes by before you hear the doors close to the captain's chambers and Fearne begins to gather with the rest of the folk. You've been on the deck this whole time? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Or you go down below? 
LIAM: No, I'm super on edge after having stolen the thing, and so I probably act casual and look out over into the fog again. 
MATT: You do not see Cyrillia anywhere. But Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Yes? 
MATT: The first moment that you're not directly conversing with your compatriots, you turn around and Cyrillia is right there in front of you. Now the heat you sense from her ever-charred skeleton is intense. You worry your eyebrows may be curling back or gone entirely. As the skeleton steps towards you, "What were you doing?" 
ASHLEY: Spooning. 
TRAVIS and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: "Don't ever touch the captain." 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. I wasn't stepping on your toes or anything. I don't know if there's already a situation going on between you two. 
MATT: "I will end you if you touch him again." 
ASHLEY: Fair enough. 
MATT: "I have to protect him." 
ASHLEY: Okay, I didn't do anything to him. He's totally fine. I won't do anything to him. I don't need to touch him. I don't need to-- 
MATT: "Didn't!" 
ASHLEY: I didn't? 
MATT: "You didn't." 
ASHLEY: I-- 
MATT: "You didn't cuddle, did you?" 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: It was more of passing some warmth. 
MATT: (intensely) "You gave him warmth?" 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: All of the veins of red flame inside the skeleton brighten to an orange-yellow, and the cold of the under decks becomes like a sauna in an instant. (flames whooshing) 
LAURA: Are we seeing this? 
MATT: Those who are below decks are definitely seeing this and feeling it. You, above deck-- 
LIAM: Mm-mm. 
MATT: -- see steam begin to rise out from the staircase below. 
LAURA: Can I try Calm Emotions on Cyrillia? 
MATT: Certainly. 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try it. 
MATT: Unfortunately, because she's beyond the status of a humanoid at this point, the spell does not find purchase. 
LAURA: Fucking hell. 
LIAM: She's just humanish. 
MATT: She takes a step towards you. 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't want him, okay? 
MATT: "The captain's--" 
ASHLEY: I don't want to hurt him. 
MATT: "-- my... charge." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) He is my boyfriend. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I apologize. He only talked about you, okay? 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
MARISHA: "He only talked about you." 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, AJ, let's go. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
SAM: He called out your name. 
ASHLEY: 14. 
TRAVIS: DEFCON 2. 
MATT: 14? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: "He did?" 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Uh-huh! 
MATT: "What did he say?" 
ASHLEY: He has been waiting for you to knock on his door at night. So you just need to gain a little bit of courage, okay? Do you mind if I touch you for two seconds? 
MATT: Make another deception check. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I swear I'm going to do something nice. Cocked. 
SAM: Cocked, cocked. 
MARISHA: How? 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
LAURA: Cocked. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Get rid of that one! 
MATT: That die! 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ugh! 
ASHLEY: Seven. 
MATT: Seven. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I was going to give you a little Guidance. 
MATT: "You're lying." 
ASHLEY: I swear I was not. I swear I was not. I just want to help you have a little bit more confidence because I'm, you know, overflowing with it. So you just need to go knock. You just need to knock on the door at night and be like, "Let's go lay down in that bed," okay? 
MATT: "Rest well. Enjoy your warmth while you can." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Steps back, steps back, and steps back. You hear beneath the cloak, a crossbow, (crossbow mechanism clicking) locking in, before they step back and vanish onto the deck. 
TRAVIS: You know, if you need companion-- I tried. 
MATT: (laughs) The rest of the crew is quiet, watching this whole thing happen. After a beat, "Right, so roll again, roll again!" 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: She's got it bad. 
ASHLEY: She's got it bad, she's got it bad. 
TALIESIN: Wow. That's so bad. 
LAURA: I mean, I think for your sake, we need to hook them up or else-- 
ASHLEY: I know. 
LAURA: She's going to try to kill us. 
ASHLEY: I'll work on it. I really was just trying to check out his cabin. I didn't realize I made such a mess. 
LAURA: What was that thing about warmth? 
ASHLEY: I don't know. We were just like... I was spooning him, and then I felt a little queasy for a little bit and then it went away. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But he felt warm, and he had a little bit of life. 
LAURA: A little afterglow. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he had a little afterglow. 
LAURA: Nice. 
ASHLEY: So I was like, you know what, I'm doing a great thing here. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Anyway. 
TALIESIN: None of that seems weird at all. 
LIAM: She was in a mood, Cyrillia. 
ASHLEY: She really was. Yeah. 
LAURA: Like somebody took one of her things. 
ASHLEY: I know. I didn't take any-- I did not take anything from her. I didn't take anything from her, Orym. 
LIAM: Oddly specific. 
LAURA, MARISHA, and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: Orym, your forehead tattoo looks so good. (laughter) 
LIAM: Thanks, it finally stopped hurting. (laughter) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Savior Blade. (laughter) 
LIAM: That's on my eyelids. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. (laughs) 
MATT: All right. Anything else you wish to do before the evening draws to a close? 
SAM: Oh boy. I think we've done everything in Dungeons & Dragons. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Only Fearne has done everything. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So proud. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Oh man. 
MATT: So you find your way to rest for what you believe to be your final evening of journey aboard the Crimson Abyss. As the sun first begins to rise and a bit of light begins to push its way-- 
SAM: ♪ Pushin' its way ♪ 
MATT: -- as best as it can, disseminated through the heavy fogs that consume these seas, you can hear the waves crashing against the ghostly ship as one by one you return to the conscious world, still cold, still riding this odd ever-cursed ship. Fearne, as you awaken, not far off, sitting in a stool looking at you is the captain, sitting. 
LIAM: Creepy. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Good morning. 
MATT: "Good morning. You and your compatriots have almost gotten to your destination. Um, do you have any more of that warmth to give? 
ASHLEY: Well, I feel like it made me feel a little sick, so I don't know, I don't know what you did, but I don't want-- I don't know if I can give you, I don't know if I want to give you anymore. 
MATT: "You have to... Maybe you have to work through the nausea, you know, and then it gets good a little after." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. I've been told that a few times. 
MARISHA: Oh, weird. Yeah. (laughs) 
LIAM: Quite a pitch. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I mean, I feel like, I feel like if there's any more warmth being given here there's got to be a better end of the deal here for me, because I don't feel like I'm getting anything out of this. 
MATT: "Not getting anything out of this?" 
ASHLEY: No. What do I get by giving you warmth? 
MATT: "You and your friends are still alive. You're the only folks to ever ride along with my crew and live to tell the tale, for now. You've gotten quite a bit out of this arrangement. You were kind to take a nap and offer me a bit of your warmth. If you want to make another deal, we can." 
ASHLEY: I don't know if I'm feeling kind anymore. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: "My apologies." 
ASHLEY: Now you're just-- 
MATT: "I'm not used to this." 
ASHLEY: -- being a little too much. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh no! Rejected! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
LIAM: Apologies. 
TRAVIS: (laughing) The mouth. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Sometimes it be like that. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: "Just think it over. I'll be in my quarters. (grunts)" Then he gets up and shuffles off. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: Right as he passes by and the doors closed, you see in the shadow, step forward Cyrillia, glaring at you with her one burning eye. The blue flame almost takes a purple coloration as the flames begin to grow more intense. 
ASHLEY: Now's your chance. 
LAURA: Yeah. In Cyrillia's head she hears: I mean, you are warm. 
MATT: "Hmm? What was that?" 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: "Who told me that? Who told me that?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: The crossbow comes out of the cloak. "(snarls)" 
LAURA: I'm going to say: Offer your warmth. 
MATT: "(confused snarls)" (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Chaos. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
MATT: The angle on this, are you genuinely trying to convince her or are you trying to trick her? 
LAURA: I'm trying to convince her to go. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
LAURA: But, I'm trying to deceive her that it's not me doing it. I want her to think it's just a "greater than" voice. 
MATT: This would be a deception check in that case, then. 
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me-- ♪ 
LAURA: 14. 
MATT: 14. "(snarls) (huffing) (grunts and growls)" Looks back at you, and begins to walk towards you from across the room-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: -- with an aggressive lurch. As she steps, the ghost wood, you could only assume, that make up the space, almost seem to blacken with each of her foot falls. As she approaches the bones glow brighter and more angry. The flame in her good socket burns more intensely and flickers up past the skull almost. "(snarls) What did you tell him? What are you two talking about?" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What did I-- What did we talk about? 
MATT: "I'll kill you." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No, there's no need, there's no need, there's really no need for that. You just-- I didn't tell him anything. I didn't tell him anything, I have no feelings for this man. I just-- You need to go in there. You know, get your little flare going in your body, the heat, and then just like, have a nice time. I promise you. I'm-- I can help you. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Because of past failures, this is not going to be super easy. 
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know. 
SAM: It will be for her. 
LAURA: Oh, ooh! 
LIAM: Come on. 
ASHLEY: That would be a 30. 
LIAM: Come on. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Jeez. 
TALIESIN: What?! 
MATT: The intensity of the flame dies down for a moment as her aggressive seething, ready to strangle the life out of you stance, her angry hunch that seems to have pushed you into the corner almost reverts. "My heat?" The crossbow (clatters), onto the ground. 
LAURA: I want that crossbow. 
LIAM: (twangy thunk) 
MATT: She stands up a little straighter, cocks the hip to one side. 
ASHLEY: Gorgeous. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: "My heat?" 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: There's no hair. (laughter) 
MATT: It's all just beneath the hood, just-- 
TRAVIS: (clunky clattering) (laughter) 
LAURA: Do the horns come out of the skull? 
MATT: She doesn't have horns. 
LAURA: Oh, she was a fire genasi. 
MATT: Yes, fire genasi. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: Is there flame hair? 
ASHLEY: You are a queen, and I want you to go in there, and I want you to go take what you want, okay? You're amazing. 
MATT: "I am amazing." 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: You got this. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: "Thank you." 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
MATT: Turns around, the rest of the crew has gotten up and is all on the side of the walls, just like-- 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: They've all-- It's a full-on crew hallway, tensely holding their breath, even if they don't breathe. As she-- (determined footsteps) 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Yaas. 
LIAM: Work. 
MATT: She steps down the hall. 
LAURA: Get it. 
MARISHA: Put those hips into it. 
MATT: She steps up to the door. 
ASHLEY: You better work, bitch. 
MATT: (knocking) 
SAM: Ken? (laughter) 
LAURA: Sublime. 
ASHLEY and LIAM: Sublime! (laughter) 
MATT: The door opens. 
MATT: "Fearne, are you-- Oh." 
MARISHA and LIAM: Ooh! (sympathetic groaning) 
MATT: "Cyrillia?" 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Why are you--" Her hand goes right onto the front of the captain's coat and you can see flames-- 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: (flames ignite) up the bones. He goes, "Ooh." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: "Ooh!" (laughter continues) 
LAURA: Amazing! 
MATT: She is reaching down to the captain, clutching the front of the coat. 
ASHLEY: "Ooh!" 
MATT: You can see the air around her is shifting from the heat that's emanating from her skeleton. "Word is you are looking for warmth?" (Captain) "Maybe." (gasping) 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
LAURA: I love that he's having to do both sides of this! 
MARISHA: (laughing) I know. We're so invested! 
MATT: (Cyrillia) "Well, Captain, perhaps we stop dancing around our roles and make a fire." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MATT: She pushes him into the room as the door closes behind. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! (cheering) 
MATT: And we'll go to break. (cheering) 
LIAM: You can't get stories like this anywhere else. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Fire and passion wins! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: They have a little happiness. 
LAURA: That was so great! 
MARISHA: Oh my gosh. You guys. 
ASHLEY: We match maker-ed them. 
LAURA: You brought them together! 
SAM: You did! 
MARISHA: You've done an amazing thing for this crew. We're basically like "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!" but for this ship. 
ASHLEY: Yes! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: So fucking great. 
ASHLEY: I'm so happy about this. 
LAURA: Amazing. 
LIAM: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Minus my five points. 
TRAVIS: Incredible. 
ASHLEY: It's fine. 
SAM: But you're going to get something else during break. 
LAURA: You got a lot. 
ASHLEY: And whatever else there is. We'll find out. 
MATT: That was a 25 DC on that final because of the failures, the progressive mistrust that she was building. I was like, that's going to be a tough one. Fucking 30, I love it. All right, well, we'll come back here in a few minutes and we'll pick up for where this journey takes us as we approach the island of Kalutha. See you all in a few minutes. 
TRAVIS: Amazing.

LAURA: The Midnight Queen is dead. As the bell tolls for Her Majesty, her succession looms in uncertainty, for with her dying breath, the queen invoked an ancient and deadly contest, compelling the Princesses of Twelvefold to meet in secret and battle one another, until the stroke of midnight reveals the victor, the new Midnight Queen. (fire roars) Erdene, the Gilded Champion; Dr. Lux, the Scholar Supreme; Rosaline, the Oneiromancer; Freya, Blood of the Tower; Hephesta, the Light Breaker; and then there's me, Boss No, the fairest of them all.

TALIESIN: Those that rise from the trenches only to boldly dive into the catacombs of the Fairelands are few and far between. Any investigator, be they soldier or civilian, will eventually find themselves forced to abandon what is right for what must be done. The scars of war are deep and timeless. Those who survive must balance on a delicate thread of ever-fraying purpose, for to stare too deeply into the chasm of the past is to see nothing but a reflection of terror. When retribution crawls from the darkness, our inner fortitude is put to the test. The Circle of Needle & Thread. Assignment #533: Eye for an Eye.

Narrator 2: - Utterly doomed Midst - Narrator 1: Yeah, it's still pretty doomed! Narrator 2: - At pretty much the moment where we last saw it. Well, that's not quite true. Narrator 1: It's a few hours later. Narrator 2: Stationary Hill is not looking so hot at the moment. Narrator 1: Garbage everywhere, flyers for the big sale of Midst strew upon the streets, doors open, broken boxes, crates, carts... Narrator 2: Abacuses, Welcome-to-the-Trust pamphlets. Narrator 1: It would be a nice place if it weren't for the colossally vast, quietly howling and increasingly close vast, terrifying, reality-gnawing tsunami of black fog ocean inbound rapidly. Narrator 3: Oh. that! Narrator 2: Oh, yeah. Narrator 1: It is a spectacularly terrifying scene. Listening to this, it may not seem particularly terrifying. But with the power of your imagination, you too can become very upset. Narrator 2: With our help.

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So. Here-- 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
MATT: The final leg of your journey. 
TRAVIS: What did we just do? 
MATT: The mists out before you. 
LAURA: I don't want it. 
MATT: The captain goes unseen for a while. 
TRAVIS: Wow, for a while? Is there steam coming out of the captain's quarters, under the door? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MATT: Do you want to go look? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Of course I do. 
MATT: Good, because as you rush over there, so do the rest of the crew. 
TRAVIS: What do you think? I got five dollars! I got five, anybody got 10? 10 for that action? Two for one, two for one odds! 
TALIESIN: Both you get the fuck out of my way. 
MATT: (laughs) There's a quiet period of time. 
TRAVIS: (thumps) 
MATT: No, no. But indeed-- 
LIAM: (mattress squeaking) 
MATT: Here's the thing. It is a very cold temperature in this ship, but indeed, steam begins to pour out from underneath the slight gap in the captain's quarters' doors. 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. 
LAURA: You did that, Fearne. 
MARISHA: Celia, she was looking through portholes, right? 
TRAVIS: Oh! You going to Spider Climb? 
MARISHA: Well, well, I could look through Pâté. I could send him around. 
SAM: Didn't we do this in Campaign Two? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yes. Yes. 
TRAVIS: That was on one of our own. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I'm doing it again! I'm telling Pâté to go invisible. 
LIAM: Bringing back all the classics. 
MATT: "What am I supposed to do?" 
MARISHA: Okay, there should be little porthole windows looking into this room, and I want you to go fly over there and look in. I'm going to look through your eyes. I want to see what's... I want to see. 
MATT: "What am I supposed to be looking for?" 
TRAVIS: Full moon. 
MARISHA: The captain, in full moon. 
LIAM: Boning. 
MARISHA: Boning. 
MATT: "I'll get right to it." 
MARISHA: Go invisible! 
MATT: (poofs) (laughter) 
MARISHA: I look through his eyes. 
MATT: You look through his eyes. Over the side of the ship, off to the back end of it. There are no portholes. There is a large, like a gable, segmented window on the back of the captain's quarters. 
MARISHA: Look in the window. Square window. 
MATT: He attaches to the side, crawls over to it. It's like staring into a sauna. You don't see anything except for just shapes moving occasionally through it. 
LAURA: ♪ Sexy ♪ 
MATT: The steam shifting in place. 
TRAVIS: The Kate Winslet hand. (laughter) 
MATT: A skeletal hand smearing down. 
TALIESIN: I'm dying. 
MATT: A non-smoldering one. 
SAM: Woo! 
TRAVIS: Oh, baby! 
MARISHA: It's so steamy, literally steamy. I just see figures. It's like looking at a burlesque performance in a shadowbox. 
MATT: "Do you need me to get closer in?" 
SAM: (whispering) Yes. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: How? 
MARISHA: How would you do that? 
MATT: "I don't know! You're the person who tells me what to do!" 
MARISHA: No, no, I think it's okay. I think it's good. 
MATT: "Okay." 
MARISHA: I know! 
TRAVIS: Aw, the disappointment. 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: But-- 
MARISHA: Good work, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I feel so good. 
LAURA: I feel like it's one of the best things you've ever done. 
ASHLEY: Do you? I do, too. 
LIAM: You primed that pump. 
MARISHA: You did. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I did prime that pump. 
MARISHA: Look at everybody. They're so happy. Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Mm? 
MARISHA: Before we go, we have to make a little name tag for Kyle. That's important. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: "Yeah, I'm fucking Kyle," right? That's what it said? 
ASHLEY: It's Kyle, right? 
MARISHA: Yes, "I'm Kyle, you fucking idiots," or whatever it was. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: And then-- 
TRAVIS: Messed that up. 
MARISHA: No, all answers are correct. 
LAURA: What'd you write? 
TRAVIS: It says, "I'm fucking Kyle." 
LAURA: I'm fucking Kyle? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Is there a comma, or just--? 
LIAM: Are you? 
TRAVIS: There was a G on the end of it, so "I'm fucking Kyle," which could be taken a couple of ways. 
LIAM: No, just two. 
TRAVIS: I'll get to work. 
LIAM: Two ways. 
MATT: (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Let's graph that sentence before we-- 
MARISHA: I feel like we've just done wonders for this crew and this ship. You know, we introduced them to a lovely new game. 
SAM: Yep. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: You were like a muse to the tattoo artist. 
TALIESIN: I feel changed, literally. 
MATT: The few burning lantern lights throughout the entire ship begin to shift from that dull, pale white blue into more of a soft orange-ish red color. 
SAM: Did we Pleasantville this ship? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: It just gets color? 
TRAVIS: Either that, or there's a new... captain. 
ASHLEY: Great reference. 
SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: The captain's getting peg-legged right now. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! (laughter) 
SAM: Yo ho ho. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The captain's getting peg-legged? 
SAM: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Wow! Wow! 
SAM: This should be Episode 69. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MARISHA: Nice. I just feel like this is probably our last night on the boat, so maybe we can-- 
TRAVIS: You promise? 
MARISHA: What if we have a little dance party on the deck? You know, we just-- Maybe we can get out some of our fabrics and we can decorate a little bit. Maybe we can have some sort of feast. Maybe you can bake some ghost cookies. 
SAM: I still have those drug brownies. 
MARISHA: You got the drug brownies! 
TALIESIN: I don't think they eat. 
LIAM: Ashton can make lights. 
TALIESIN: I can do that in theory, yeah, maybe. 
MARISHA: They've been such lovely hosts. 
ASHLEY: They really have. 
MARISHA: And I feel like we've been so amazing to them. We should, you know, have one final hurrah. 
ASHLEY: I love this, I love this. Look at all the good we're doing in the world. It really is amazing. 
MARISHA: It feels good to be effective. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Because the past several months, it's been a bit dire. 
ASHLEY: Doesn't feel that way. 
MARISHA: No. Feels like zero control over our lives and literally anything else. 
SAM: Small difference. 
TALIESIN: I'll take that win. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
MATT: The steam has subsided enough that the crew goes (gasps) and they all start scattering, going about their business like they weren't paying attention, all crammed into this tiny hallway listening for any possible signs. Eventually, the door (creaks) opens. Steam pours out from the inside. 
LIAM: Steamboat Willie. 
MATT: You watch as Cyrillia exits, still standing tall, and just walks across the room, picks up her crossbow, gives you a nod, and then steps back up the stairs with a gentle, confident waltz as the captain eventually emerges. Her coloration, her smolder, has cooled a bit, and the veins that were once a bright, burning red within her skeletal bones now sit at a gentle purple to a dull gray, and as the captain emerges from the last bit of steam that rolls off, you can see the fiery blue flames that burn within his skull now themselves also have purplish, cooler tint, and he himself stands with a bit of confidence and a bit of a limp. (laughter) 
LIAM: I was right. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Yes, sir! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Ow. 
MARISHA: What the fuck? 
MATT: "Crew, we're still on course? Keep to your business. Me and the navigator have had an important meeting." (laughter) 
MATT: Goes back up on the deck (limping footsteps) 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
ASHLEY: Wow. Wow. 
LAURA: That was great. 
SAM: Love is love-- 
LAURA and SAM: -- is love. 
TALIESIN: Unlives changed right there. Not lives changed, obviously, but unlives have been changed. 
ASHLEY: Matchmaking, it just feels really good. It feels really good. 
LIAM: Ghost sex is okay, you guys. 
TRAVIS: Are we still in a tremendous amount of fog? Is it a marine layer, day, night? 
MATT: It's late into the evening, probably early morning at this point, and it is extremely thick. 
SAM: As we've been journeying 
MATT: You can't see more than-- 
TRAVIS: It travels with the ship. 
LAURA: Did we sleep? 
TRAVIS: That's right. 
SAM: Yeah, we've slept a bunch. But did we pass any other landmasses on the way? 
MATT: You haven't seen anything. You've put your hopes in with this crew that they know where they're going and they're going to get you there, because all you've seen is maybe 20 to 30 feet of mist beyond the outside of the ship. The hint of the waters that you can hear below splashing and waves crashing, the occasional sea spray that hits over the deck, but you cannot actually clearly see the surface of the ocean. But thankfully, the weather has been kind, and there hasn't been any heavy storms that have blown past. Kind of a nautical Silent Hill experience, heading this leg of the journey. Do you rest for the evening? Any other business you wish to attend for the night? 
LAURA: Did you want a dance party? 
MARISHA: Tomorrow. 
LAURA: I think we're done tomorrow. We're exiting the boat tomorrow. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: I'll take some time to re-attune to the scythe. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Turmoil, and also the Butcher's Bib. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: Do we have one more night, or is this it? 
MATT: It says two to three days of travel. This is your second evening, so you assume some point tomorrow or late tomorrow. Unless something else occurs that could lengthen it, you're likely to hit land tomorrow is what you've been told. 
MARISHA: All right, so let's rest, and we'll do-- 
ASHLEY: We'll rest, maybe eat breakfast, brunch-y type of a party. 
MARISHA: That sounds good. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: A brunch dance party. 
MARISHA: It's just dark and moody all the time. So, you know. 
SAM: That's true. 
ASHLEY: We can have a little light. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Like those gospel brunches. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Spooky scary skeletons ♪ 
MATT: All right, you all find your evening's rest, take your long rest, and as you awaken to your third and final day of this trek across the seas, the captain has a spring in his bony step and walks below deck, blade sheathed, and greets all of you. "Good morning." 
ASHLEY: Good morning. 
MATT: "Looks like this'll be the end of your journey." 
TRAVIS: Oh no, say it ain't so. We never get enough time. 
SAM: We still might need to get back. 
TRAVIS: That's true! You know, we're really good at locating things, too. It feels like you're, you know, a little limited in your view. Maybe we could keep an eye out for some of your other items that you're seeking, if you gave us-- 
SAM: A list? 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Maybe. I don't know if there's any where you're going, but you can certainly keep an eye out." 
TRAVIS: And an ear. 
MATT: "But if you want return passage, that's another deal to strike." 
TRAVIS: Understood. 
MATT: "Aye." Looks over his shoulder at the crew. They're not paying attention. "But from the heart I used to have, it's not been too bad having some guests on the boat." 
SAM: We made friends! 
MATT: "Anyway, enough of that! You lily-livered livers! Because you're living! It's been terrible having you on the ship, and I can't wait to be rid of you!" 
LAURA: Can't wait to leave! 
TRAVIS: Really can't. 
MARISHA: How mu-- oh my god. 
MATT: The flame winks. 
TALIESIN: So terrifying. Very terrifying. 
LIAM: We're appropriately scared. 
TALIESIN: Yep, very scared. 
MARISHA: How much time, do you estimate? 
MATT: His flames flare for a second before they recede. "Oh, about four hours till we make landfall at Kalutha." 
ASHLEY: That's enough time. 
MARISHA: Perfect. That's enough time. Great. We have a little surprise we're cooking up. But I don't want to spoil anything. 
MATT: His blade pulls out and is at your throat. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: "I don't like surprises." 
MARISHA: Don't, oh my goodness! This is such an overreaction. Calm down, it's all good things. You can't threaten me. I'm not going to spoil it. (laughter) 
MATT: "I don't like how easily you dismiss my aggression." (laughter) 
MATT: "But I respect it." 
MARISHA: That's-- 
MATT: "Very well. Surprise me." 
SAM: Ooh! Progress. 
MARISHA: It's going to be great. Everyone, go in your room, go downstairs, and then we'll call when we're ready. 
ASHLEY: You don't look at the main deck area. 
MARISHA: Yeah, don't go on deck. 
ASHLEY: Look forward or behind you. 
SAM: We're going to decorate, too? 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: How? What do we have to decorate with? 
SAM: I don't know, paint? We have paint. 
MARISHA: We'll figure it out. 
LAURA: Do we have some dead bodies still? No, we got rid of those. 
TALIESIN: We might have got rid of the dead bodies. 
MATT: "Bones and ghouls! Our guests are preparing themselves some sort of... surprise." 
SAM: Boy, we better make this good. 
MATT: Everyone looks over. "No one goes above deck. Except you, of course, Cyrillia." 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
MATT: She's in the back, goes-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: "I'm going to my quarters." The rest of the crew continues going about their bored business, but they're all also looking over at you as you're talking. The look of children that know you've hidden presents in the house somewhere, and they're hoping to figure out some way to spoil it. 
LAURA: I love them! 
TRAVIS: I'm going to set up a caricature station. 
LAURA: That's great. 
TRAVIS: Where I take little planks of wood and I do portraits for one bone each, but I'm going to really fuck up the proportions, really make a mockery of all of them. It's going to be great. 
SAM: But in a fun way, not in a-- 
TRAVIS: No promises. This might be our death. 
ASHLEY: Like a small head, very big body. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Or vice versa. 
TRAVIS: Everybody's got freckles. 
TALIESIN: I'm opening the hole to see what we've got. Hold on. 
MARISHA: They're riding on skateboards. 
SAM: You're going to do lights? What are you doing? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try. 
TRAVIS: Eating ice cream. 
TALIESIN: I can't do lights. 
LAURA: I've got Dancing Lights. 
TALIESIN: That'll do it, then. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. 
MARISHA: I can take some of my red ribbon. I've collected a lot of bones from dead corpses. We could take some of that leftover fabric that we've stolen from the guards and stuff and make little garland. 
LAURA: I love garland. 
SAM: You can play instruments, right? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I can. Very well. 
SAM: Because FRIDA did this thing where they were able to record audio and play it back. I might be able to do that myself, so if you played some sound, I could take it and remix it. 
LIAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness. 
LIAM: Do you have to do this to make it happen? 
LAURA: Are you going to be a DJ? 
LIAM: What are you doing with your saw blade? 
TALIESIN: Very weird. 
LIAM: Oh, the saw blades! 
SAM: The saw blade! (record scratch) 
TALIESIN: You could really hurt somebody. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: I love this idea so much. What are you going to bake? 
SAM: Oh, I've already started. I've got four pot brownies. Not pot brownies, what is the drug that I have in my inventory? 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: It's the-- 
SAM: Hold on, I've got it here. 
MARISHA: All-Minds-Burn. 
SAM: I just wrote down "drugs." (laughter) 
LAURA: Is it All-Minds-Burn stuff? 
TRAVIS: Fantasy drugs. 
MARISHA: It's All-Minds-Burn stuff. 
LAURA: Oh, you don't want to do-- 
TALIESIN: No, that might be a bad idea. 
LAURA: You don't want those. 
TRAVIS: They're dead! 
SAM: It's already-- 
TRAVIS: They're dead. 
TALIESIN: That could get weird. 
LAURA: Nobody eat those brownies. 
SAM: We'll do small bits. They can microdose. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: Nobody eat those brownies. 
TRAVIS: It could "get" weird? It could get weird? We give fantasy drug brownies to a bunch of dead pirates. (laughter) 
SAM: That might get weird! 
LIAM: Are you going to put them out on display, on a platter? 
SAM: Oh sure, yeah. I'll need a platter or something. 
TALIESIN: Did you use all of the All-Minds-Burn stuff, or do we have some left after this? 
SAM: I don't know how much you gave me, but I put in an appropriate amount for four brownies' worth. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm going to use Seedling to send a vine from the mast to the railing to make a limbo vine. 
MARISHA: Oh, nice. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
TALIESIN: Solid. 
SAM: Great, great. 
ASHLEY: Wait, they can't eat, right? 
SAM: I know, but maybe... I don't know how drugs work. 
ASHLEY: Who knows? It's okay. 
LIAM: You wouldn't think they could shtup, either, but that worked out. 
SAM: That's true. I don't know how that worked. What will you add to this rave experience? 
MARISHA: I'm making little banners out of bones. 
ASHLEY: Banners, bones. 
MARISHA: And my ribbon and the fabric. 
LIAM: Also contributed the idea. 
SAM: Imogen, do you have a thing? 
LAURA: I'm doing Dancing Lights. 
SAM: Oh, you're doing the lights. 
LAURA: I'm doing rave lights, but I could, if... I could set up as a fortune teller or something, and just read their minds and try to give them fortunes. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, I love this. 
TALIESIN: We've got some stuff in the hole for this. 
ASHLEY: This is a fun party. 
LIAM: Clearly, there'll be a Rollies table. 
MARISHA: There's got to be a Rollies table. 
SAM: Clearly, classic. 
MARISHA: Yes. We can have betting. (gasps) What do we have for prizes? 
LIAM: What's in the hole? 
MARISHA: What's in the hole? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a lot of cooking supplies and food. 
LIAM: Still corpses? 
LAURA: No. 
LIAM: We threw them overboard, right? 
MATT: You put them over to the sea, yeah. 
LIAM: What a shame. 
TALIESIN: We still have all their clothing and fucking-- 
MARISHA: I have a disguise kit, so I could do face painting. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Fuck's sake. 
MARISHA: All right. Maybe they get caricatures and face painting. 
ASHLEY: I have lots of things that I could give out as prizes. 
TRAVIS: It's more of a relief. It's a relief carving. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh, you do. You have so many prize things. 
ASHLEY: I really have lots of things I could give out for prizes. 
MARISHA: Okay, all right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, so just in case. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: All right, we get to work. 
MATT: After a brief bit of work, I'd say it takes you altogether about a good solid hour, hour and a half to get to the point where you're comfortable and ready to present. With the musical remix that you've-- 
ASHLEY: I'll take out my dulcimer and then my pan flute-- 
TRAVIS: (rhythmic panting) 
ASHLEY: -- but have it how people have-- 
LAURA: ♪ Meet you in the garden ♪ 
LIAM and TRAVIS: (rhythmic panting) 
ASHLEY: Like how people have-- Like Bob Dylan with his harmonica, but I have it with my pan flute, so I can (blows) anytime I want. 
MARISHA: Where it's on the bar. 
ASHLEY: Where it's on the thing. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: You're a one-faun band. 
SAM: I'm just here. I'm loop pedals for you, so you can loop one sound and then loop another sound. 
LAURA: Amazing. 
MARISHA: That's great. 
ASHLEY: Wah-wah pedal. 
TRAVIS: (rhythmic vocalizing) 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (rhythmic vocalizing) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Let the beat drop. 
TRAVIS, SAM, and MARISHA: (beatboxing) 
ASHLEY: (dulcimer playing) 
TRAVIS: (buzzes lips) 
MATT: All righty. The crew begins to ascend to the deck one by one. The banners you've placed and decorated around brings a bit of vibrancy and life to a long-dead, long-stalking image of forever torture-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- and endless fear upon the high seas of the Shattered Teeth. 
LAURA: There's still bones dangling from the-- 
MATT: Tales and songs that have long spoke of bloodshed-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: -- and torment on the blackened waves! The promise of death and desolation from the long-cursed and ever-hungry crew of the Crimson Abyss is now a quinceañera! (laughter) 
MATT: One by one-- 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: -- these spectral skeleton crew step on with toothy grins. 
SAM: (techno beats) 
MARISHA: Give us some dance music, Matt. Give us some Boca lighting. I need it. Boca light is in! 
LAURA: My Dancing Lights are a mix of colors. 
ASHLEY: (jaunty pan flute) 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LAURA: It's not just-- 
TRAVIS: Boca lighting? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: I have some celebration tavern music in right now. It's a little low. 
ASHLEY: ♪ ("Axel F") ♪ 
SAM: (beatboxing) 
MATT: One by one, they begin to pick up a bit of a jaunty step to their feet. Some begin to line up and prepare themselves for the limbo. (laughter) 
MATT: Others begin to chant. 
TRAVIS: (laughing) The limbo. 
MATT: You notice after a while that no one's really gone towards the brownies yet. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh, they don't eat! 
SAM: Maybe I'll pass the hors d'oeuvres. 
TRAVIS: The tray pass. 
TALIESIN: I have an interesting idea. I'm going to try something. I'm going to go in and get my flask of truly intensely noxious whiskey that I have, and I'm going to open it up. I know no one can drink, but if you want to take a whiff and remember the good times, it is sitting right here. 
LIAM: Right down the middle. 
MATT: You set it there, and some of the crew looks over at each other, and you see Kyle in the back goes, "All good!" 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. No. Kyle, no. 
MARISHA: Aw! 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Aw! 
MATT: You can smell the brine, smell the brownies, man. Smell the brownies. 
SAM: Hors d'oeuvre? 
TALIESIN: Oh wait, maybe not! No, no, no, no, no! Shit! 
MARISHA and LAURA: No, no, no! 
TALIESIN: Put it down! Put it down. 
ASHLEY: Just a teeny niblet. 
SAM: It's okay, Kyle. 
LAURA: No, no, no. Don't do it, Kyle. 
LIAM: You're so young, Kyle. So young. 
SAM: It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. 
LIAM: Don't throw your life away. 
MARISHA: No, FCG! No! 
SAM: What? It's fine! 
LAURA: No, it's not! Don't give in! 
MARISHA: No, he's sober! 
LAURA: Don't let him give in, he's sober! 
MATT: "I'll do the limbo, I suppose." 
MARISHA: Do the limbo! 
ASHLEY: Do the limbo, do the limbo. Get face paint. 
SAM: He's sober? 
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, wait! 
SAM: He's straight edge? 
MARISHA: We have a present for you. 
LAURA: Yes! 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We actually have a present just for you. 
LAURA: He was an addict! 
MATT: "Wait, wh-what?" 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. I forgot about that. 
MATT: "Wait, they got a present for Kyle?" Kyle goes, "You said, you said my name." 
MARISHA: Aw! 
MATT: "Oh, him! I thought the other Kyle! (laughs)" Laughter goes about. 
ASHLEY: That's mean! 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's mean. His name is Kyle. You guys know this. 
TRAVIS: Kyle, this is from all of us, with love and admiration, and also so you can get some damn respect. I did the best I could on the opposite side-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It's good. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes. 
TRAVIS: It says: I'm Kyle, you fucks. 
LAURA: There it is! 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I hand it to him. It's got a little bit of black trim on the paint, and then a red background with white in the letters. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MARISHA: Beautiful. 
MATT: "Oh my goodness, this is so nice." 
TRAVIS: Yep. I also give him a little character painting that has him standing on top of Bruda and Vendallo, and it says "Boss" on his shirt. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes! (laughter continues) 
MATT: "Yeah, you see that? My name's Kyle, you fucks!" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: That's all you need. 
TALIESIN: That's all you need. 
TRAVIS: Get that alpha. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: RTA, bitch. 
MATT: "I greatly appreciate that. Thank you, thank you. I appreciate that you made those, but I think I'll pass as well." (laughter) 
SAM: Good for you, Kyle. Good for you. 
MATT: He goes over and tears a bit of material off of his short coat that he's wearing, puts it around these nails that he puts to the back, and wears it on his neck, the name tag. 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: Like a door sign. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: We made a difference. 
MARISHA: A good night. 
ASHLEY: We really did make a difference. 
TALIESIN: That's a ghost with commitment. 
MATT: Other ones, other crew members begin to reach out. You see Sanjay the musician reach out and grab one of the brownies and go-- (teeth clicking) It tumbles through onto the ground. (laughter) 
LIAM: (Cookie Monster) Cookie! 
TALIESIN: No, this could be a full Cookie Monster. 
MATT: "Very good." 
LIAM: Om-nom-nom. 
MATT: "Thank you." 
SAM: I'm glad you like it. 
TALIESIN: Just going to pick all that up when it's time. 
ASHLEY: It's good, it's good. (laughter) 
MATT: Others try and follow suit. Some of them chew a bit, and it tumbles through again, and they're all, (unconvincingly) "Mm!" 
LAURA: That's very nice of them. 
SAM: I think they're really stoned. 
MARISHA: That's good! (laughs) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: The captain sits at the very, very front of the ship, kneeling in the classic pirate pose, holding his blade in his hand and looking out past the mists, occasionally glancing up towards the crow's nest. You can see Cyrillia is up there leaning over, occasionally looking down at him, then pulling out and reaching over to the side and going-- (patting clothing) 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
LIAM: Oh, goddamn it. I thought the sex would have sufficed. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: "(frustrated sigh)" 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: You can see her looking down at the captain, and that intensity immediately deflates. 
LAURA: Oh, you lucky bastard. 
LIAM: I'm a halfling. 
LAURA: I'm going to go over to Laudna and grab her hands. There's not any pirates dancing yet, so I'm going to go out into the middle of the-- 
SAM: Lead it. 
MARISHA: Are we starting this dance party? 
LAURA: -- and start dancing and spinning around. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: (techno beat) 
MATT: You can see, as the music begins to swell-- 
LAURA: This is not how-- 
MATT: -- and fill the silent stillness of the morning mists, some of the skeletons watching, you hear this (rhythmic clacks) One of them is not even realizing that his leg is catching the beat, and looks over at Sanjay, and Sanjay pulls out his fiddle and begins fiddling with it. (gasps) 
LAURA: Yay! 
MATT: You can see some more of them begin to also hit their knees a bit, and then eventually, some of them start jumping into a jig, and they start whirling into a spinning array of very base dances. They're not trained dancers, it looks very rough, but it makes this fun cacophony of clattered bones hitting at joints and the ship. It sounds like a bunch of-- It sounds like a really slow rain stick at times. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (rain stick pebbles clattering) 
LIAM: Orym gathers up the shyest skeletons that are not dancing and starts to run a cardio ballet break dancing class in the corner. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: Run them through some moves. 
MATT: Odo and Vendallo definitely begin to pay attention and try and engage in with that. 
MARISHA: I go up to Ashton. How's this for your mutiny? 
TALIESIN: This is everything I could've ever wanted and more. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Fantastic. 
TALIESIN: This is fucking perfection. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: The first mate goes, "All right, everyone! Looks like we got land ho shortly! Right?" You see Cyrillia, "Ah, yes, right." The captain turns around. "All right, all you sorry lot. I need you all to stop your revelry now!" The music immediately comes to a halt, and all the pirates stop. It gets cold and quiet, the wind blowing through. They all begin to slowly approach and encircle your troop, closing around the captain, blade still out, dragging on the wood, as he steps from the bow of the ship to approach as well. "Now. You've all been privy to a singular experience, something not even I could have foreseen. If any of you tells a single soul that you've danced with the crew of the Crimson Abyss, your bloodlines will be on my list as well. There was no dancing. There was no laughter. There was no limbo!" (stifled laughter) 
LIAM: Orym subtly retracts the vine into Seedling. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (vine slurping up) 
MATT: "You were scared the entire time." 
ASHLEY: Terrified. So scared. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: "The threats will haunt you 'til the end of your days." 
TRAVIS: (mock trembling) 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "And if anybody crosses our path, they won't be as lucky." 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
MATT: "Right?" 
SAM and LAURA: Oh, yeah. 
MARISHA: Right, yes. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: That's a tale too tall to tell. 
TRAVIS: It made my hair fall out. 
TALIESIN: I can honestly say I screamed for over a day. 
MATT: "Great! All right, fantastic! Thank you all so much for coming." (laughter) 
MATT: "This has been an unexpected, memorable experience. Now, unfortunately, we're at your destination." 
SAM: Oh. Oh! 
MATT: "We've kept up our end of the bargain, as have you, and then some." Gives a wink over to you. "So, can't get too close to shore with the ship, necessarily, so you might get a bit damp on the way down, but shallow enough to swim and walk. Might be a bit chilly. There was one more thing, one more thing. Thank you." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
MATT: "Now, go. Quick!" 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: All right. 
TALIESIN: Yes, Captain. 
TRAVIS: I walk over and I hand the last caricature to the captain. If he unrolls it, it's him draped over Cyrillia, astride a dolphin, jumping through the ocean and shooting a crossbow through a big heart. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Shuts it immediately. Puts it into his coat. 
TRAVIS: Ah, so terrifying! Thank you for letting us live! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "It's a fine likeness." 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
MATT: His blue flames, now purple flames, burn bright. "Carry on the echoes of the terrible dangers you've seen here. Spread the word, that all shall fear our crew. Can we keep the banners?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Of course. Oh my gosh, I'm so honored. 
MATT: "Great. Go, go, get! Shoo, shoo, shoo!" 
MARISHA: Hopefully we'll see you again. 
TRAVIS: Was there anything you wanted us to keep an eye out for? 
LAURA: Oh, right, items. 
SAM: A list or anything? No? 
MATT: "Oh!" He goes and retrieves a small, folded up piece of tanned leather. "Here's a few that might be within your grasp. The others, I'm enjoying the hunt more." Passes it to you. 
ASHLEY: The sword, the sword! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: No? Okay, just when you're done with it. 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: I thought I was going to catch you off-guard. When you're done with it, you know who to call. 
MATT: "When I'm done with it, I'll bring it back." 
ASHLEY: Thank you, thank you. I give a wink to Cyrillia. 
MATT: "Now, get!" 
TRAVIS: We're going, we're going! 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: Are we just jumping in the water? 
TRAVIS: (flailing yell) 
MARISHA: Here we go! 
MATT: The whole crew is gathered, and as you're jumping off one by one, they're like, "Goodbye!" "Goodbye!" "Goodbye!" "Hey, goodbye, thanks for--" Cyrillia steps down as you're about to leap and touches your shoulder. 
SAM: Ugh. 
MATT: "I just wanted to say thank you. I think I've been a bit too shy for too long." 
ASHLEY: Listen, we all have those times, you know? Sometimes you just need-- 
MATT: "A shit-stirrer." 
ASHLEY: Yeah, a shit-stirrer, a little fire under your ass. 
MATT: "Heh." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I take her hand, her bony hand, and I give it a kiss. 
TRAVIS: Perfect. 
ASHLEY: You're lovely. 
MATT: It burns your lips just a little bit, but not in a way that you don't like it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Have fun. 
MATT: "I think I will." 
ASHLEY: Bye, now! 
MATT: (splash) (laughter) 
MATT: As you all leap down into the freezing cold waters-- 
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Ah! 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: White Lotus fall off the boat. (awkward slam) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Take off your fucking heels! (laughter) 
SAM: Oh god! 
MATT: It doesn't take too long for your feet to finally catch a under the water pebbled beach surface. You begin to go from not knowing which way is up to eventually discovering what would be the edge of the coastline. As quickly as you all catch your breath and get your bearings, you turn back, and the ship is gone. 
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out. How is that possible? 
ASHLEY: God, that was fun. 
LAURA: That was awesome. 
SAM: Did it really happen? 
LAURA: Was it all a dream? 
TALIESIN: Yes, it absolutely happened. We're missing a bunch of stuff that we left there for their party. I guarantee you, there is nothing in this hole anymore. 
TRAVIS: I pull down my pants and rub my sore ass cheek where the bell tattoo is. It happened, baby. 
LAURA: Do our tattoos look normal now that the ghost ship has gone away? 
ASHLEY: (coughs) Sorry. 
TRAVIS and SAM: It's okay. 
ASHLEY: Wrong pipe. 
MATT: You all right? 
MARISHA: You inhale some spit? 
MATT: Yeah. The area's still red and irritated from the fresh tattooing. The ink, while not perfect for the job, was functionally applied. It could use maybe a touch up in a few months. 
LAURA: Probably not very good that we jumped in the ocean right afterwards. 
MATT: It stings a little. 
TRAVIS: Salt water's good. 
LIAM: Something for the next artist to trace. 
TALIESIN: My carving is absolutely perfect. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Looks great. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: You all eventually begin to step out of the waters onto the black pebbled beach-- 
ASHLEY: (coughs) So sorry. 
MATT: -- Of what is your first sight of the island of Kalutha. 
ALL: Kalutha. 
TRAVIS: We're here! 
SAM: ♪ Kalutha, Bahama ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
TALIESIN: Fucker. 
MATT: This mist-framed lagoon that you step into is buttressed by and leads up into a tall, steep cliff face of dark basalt columns of endless hexagonal patterns that rise up in wildly uniform striations at varying heights. 
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes. 
MATT: Patches of vibrant yellow and green vegetation spring from breaks in the cliff and break up the graphite coloration of the island rock itself. The rolling waves, as you look down now and get a sense of the coloration, bright teal ocean water that is perfectly clear and flows up onto this beach. Here within the lagoon, the only way to reach this beach would have to be by ship or by swimming, but it is very rocky and dangerous beyond this lagoon itself, and you get the sense ships would only really beach here, and you're not sure if many do. But you all step out and shake off what water you can, a bit waterlogged from the sea salt, and the cliff that's before you is about 80 to 100 feet tall. The long, thin, continuous striation stretches of that hexagonal basalt pattern leave some semblance of climbability, though you're uncertain at what angle the steepness is this far below. At a quick glance, Orym, looking around this beach, you can see there are signs of what may have been a campsite or some sort of a place where some tent and/or fire had been set up. You can see there's some driftwood that's come up onto the shore and has been slowly sinking into the black pebbled beach, but there are some elements of structure that have collapsed, like hanging strips of canvas that has been weathered by time and the elements. 
LIAM: How close to the water? 
MATT: About 15 feet in. The beach itself is about 35, 40 feet at the lagoon before it reaches the base of the basalt cliff. 
LIAM: I wouldn't think, being close to the ocean, that something could last too long, but how old does it seem? 
MATT: Approach and make an investigation check. 
LIAM: Yes, I will do that. I'm not good at this. 
TRAVIS: 30. 
LIAM: 18. 
MATT: 18, the tide looks like it doesn't come close enough to pull this away into the ocean. In fact, looking at the shape of how the beach is set, it's not too far. It's about halfway to high tide, and at full tide, the beach would probably come close to but not up to where that site was. From what you can see, the way it's weathered, might be a few years old. 
LIAM: Any personal effects lying about, or in it? 
MATT: From what you can see, no. It's mainly a forgotten structure that eventually collapsed to time and disuse. What you do see, however, in this lagoon as well, is there are two openings in the basalt cliff now that you approach and the mist pulls away a little further in proximity. You can see there's one cavern about 10, 15 or so feet in diameter at the base of the lagoon. There's another one, about the same size, that's about 40 feet up the cliff. 
LIAM: I point all that out. 
LAURA: Caves? It looks like a cave? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: It looks like caves, yeah. Like natural lava tubes that emerge at this point. 
MARISHA: (sneezes) 
SAM: Gesundheit. 
LIAM: Gesund. 
MATT: Bless you. 
SAM: Stop it. 
ASHLEY: Stop it. 
MARISHA: Sorry! 
LIAM: Insanity. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That sneeze fuck you up? 
MARISHA: A little bit! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, dog! That was a good hit! 
MATT: Wow, never seen her sneeze and only part of her come back. That was... (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Going hard. 
LAURA: Your shirt came up. 
MARISHA: It did! I'm wearing a crop top! 
LIAM: You fucking with those brownies? 
MARISHA: Adjusting my head. 
SAM: So there's caves, but we're looking for the tree, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, but maybe the-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: I don't know, I just want to peek into the cave. 
LIAM: Where we are, there's no accessing, there's no going around to find other parts of the island? 
MATT: You can if you want to, but you're not sure, everything else is seaside cliffs that are at the same height, if not higher. You just got dropped at this lagoon that breaks in and is the one beachable area here, but that also ends at cliffs that climb up for about 80 to 100 feet. 
LIAM: Let's take a look. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Ashton? 
LIAM: Low or high? 
TRAVIS: Anything seem familiar? 
SAM: Oh yeah! 
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm going to walk up towards the cliffs, near where the... Are the two caverns almost parallel, or are they a little-- 
MATT: No, they're offset. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: How high up is the second one? 
MATT: Second one's about 40 feet up. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down and try and dig my hands in and try and breathe and get quiet, if that's even possible. 
MATT: Okay. You breathe for a bit. You sense your essence. Both of your essences, really, since you are a being in conflict at all times. You feel that buzzing in your head, and you feel that perpetual drum-like vibration that sits in your chest, of your elemental nature. This place is new to you. You can't shake the sense that there's something oddly familiar about it. You know you've never seen it. But you still feel compelled by it, and you don't know why. 
TALIESIN: We're in the right place. 
LIAM: You okay? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. This is... This is right. 
LAURA: Good. 
TALIESIN: This is very right. 
LAURA: Let's check out these caverns. 
TALIESIN: Do we want to try and get up there? 
LIAM: One low, one high. 
MARISHA: Could send Pâté for a quick scout. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Not a bad idea. Save us the climb. 
TRAVIS: New beach, new spot. Can I grab a hand scoop of pebbles and sand, and also is there any wood, driftwood or otherwise, lying around? 
MATT: There are a number of chunks of driftwood. Some of it looks like... Some of it looks like jungle tree that may have fallen off a cliff and has since been stripped and blanched with time. There are other bits that look like they may have belonged to a boat, but have since been rounded and smoothed by the elements and warped. 
TRAVIS: Both, bag of holding. 
MATT: There you go. 
TRAVIS: And some pebbles. 
MATT: Okay. You're sending Pâté? 
MARISHA: I'll make him go invisible again. 
MATT: "All right, you got it!" 
MARISHA: All right, try that top cave up there first. Be quiet. 
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check for Pâté. 
SAM: Guidance. 
MARISHA: Oh, do I-- 
SAM: No. 
MARISHA: No, you don't do that. 
TRAVIS: De-Guidance. 
MARISHA: De-Guidance? (laughs) 
MATT, LIAM, and SAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: I get that every day. 
LAURA: Can I look for pretty seashells? 
TRAVIS: Fail! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Are there any pretty seashells? 
TALIESIN: Putting that away. 
MATT: Make an investigation check. Investigation, perception. Your choice. 
TALIESIN: That's a good Command option. 
MARISHA: Is it my perception through him? 
MATT: It's his perception. 
MARISHA: He has darkvision. 
LAURA: 23. 
MATT: 23. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: The pebbles here range from dime-sized to twice the size of a grain of sand. It's not quite a full sand texture. It is a pebble beach. 
TRAVIS: Pulverized stone and shell. 
MATT: Yeah, exactly. Because of that nature and the water that comes in, you get the sense that a lot of shells don't survive and eventually get ground down into dust or calcium. 
TRAVIS: It's the best. 
MATT: And are lost to the waters. But you do find one shell that looks like it was sturdy enough and has survived at least in recent times. It looks like it was once a hermit crab shell that was abandoned, and the outside looks like bright white bleached bone, but the inside of it is this beautiful rainbow-like pearlescence, the smooth interior that even looking in with a light is beautiful, and if it were to be bisected and polished, it could be all manner of beautiful keepsakes. 
LIAM: It's your favorite color. 
MARISHA: 18. 
MATT: 18. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: As he flies up to the upper cavern, there is a... I always forget what the true pronunciation of this is. 
SAM: Siggle. 
MATT: Piton. 
SAM and MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah, like a-- 
MATT: Yeah, climbing materials. They're driven into the rock. There's two of them at the base, elements of an old rusted chain that hangs to one of them. The other one looks fresher, less rusted, but still weathered with time. It looks like people have climbed up and utilized this cavern. 
MARISHA: Okay, but in the cavern-- 
MATT: He goes into the cavern as well? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Looks around. This winds a bit and seems to curl a bit probably about a good 80 or so feet back, and then it comes to a fork, like a spherical chamber, an airburst in this lava tube where it's pitch black in here, but it looks like there's also a pile of refuse or some sort of other materials of leftover encampment that have since been abandoned. It's hard to make out too many details in here. There are two other tunnels that branch off in upward directions, out of sight. 
MARISHA: Go left. 
MATT: "Okay." Flies down, and it curves for another 120 or so feet, and at some point, it seems to dip, and then it shoots up, and then steadily, light begins to show. Then eventually, how long does the distance go for the-- 
MARISHA: I feel like it's 500 feet or something like that. 
SAM: I feel like it's 2,000 feet. 
LIAM: Frumpkin's was. 
LAURA: Was what? 
LIAM: A million, I think. 
LAURA: Oh, really? 
MARISHA: It's far, right? It's far enough. 
TALIESIN: Forever feet. 
LAURA: Forever feet. 
MATT: It's 100 feet to deliver a spell, but-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ Forever feet ♪ 
MARISHA: Pact of the Chain. 
SAM: ♪ I want to be forever feet ♪ 
TRAVIS: Even better. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: It's a pretty show. 
MATT: I think it's a pretty decent distance. It's not going far enough to break it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: But eventually, emerges from the shadow into a little more of the daylight. As Pâté emerges from this tunnel, the mist-covered island surface presents itself. You can see from his perspective as he adjusts. The mists aren't as strong in a southeastern direction from where he is. You can see this dense, beautiful jungle that tangles through, opens in places, and the basalt rock punches through in columns at odd angles at different places. Some of them stretch really far and bend and form odd arches and land bridges that punch through the top of the jungle and arc over, some of them ending prematurely, like a bridge to nowhere that drops off dozens of feet above the jungle canopy, giving this very alien landscape vibe to it. As the mist takes the jungle, you can just make out the barest shapes of its texture. Roll a perception check for Pâté for me. 
SAM: Come on. Come on, Pâté. 
MARISHA: Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy. 
SAM: "Eh!" 
MARISHA: Come on, buddy! 11. 
MATT: 11, and that's the extent of what he can see from his position. 
MARISHA: All right. It's pretty good, though. 
TRAVIS: We definitely go right. 
SAM: Best time he's ever-- 
MARISHA: Go right. I relay all of that. Looks like it's a little lava tube or a cave. I didn't catch any type of predators or monsters, not to say they're not in there. 
LAURA: But it'll get us up. 
MARISHA: But it could get us up in there, unless we want to try and see what this ground level cave is. 
TALIESIN: I'm already walking towards the ground level cave, just looking into it. Put my hand on the wall. In Primordial, just going to say: I'm here. I'm looking for you. I'm going to slowly start walking, taking a look in the lower cave. 
LAURA: ("Into the Unknown") ♪ Ah ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: You watch as Ashton vanishes into the shadow of the lower cavern. 
TALIESIN: Not too far. 
LIAM: I'm not going to let him go off on his own. 
SAM: Ashton's gone! 
LIAM: I'll trail behind 15 or 20 feet. 
MATT: You walk about 35 or so feet as it does a left, slow turn, before you reach the end of this cavern. It widens slightly into maybe a 20-foot width, and you can sense the moisture that gathers and occasionally drops from the inside of this cavern. But it is a... It is just the end of a cave. 
TALIESIN: Interesting. 
MATT: Here, the pebbled beach sands begin to give way to rougher basalt and volcanic rock, as well as crumbled elements of dust, and you do see signs of another encampment here, also long-abandoned. This one's in a little better state than the previous one. You can see two tents, one of which is somewhat falling against the cave side. You can see some scorch marks of where a fire once sat. But it looks like this was also used as a shelter by a person or people. 
TALIESIN: Any identifiers of who might've been there? 
MATT: Make an investigation check for me. 
TALIESIN: This'll go great, always does. 
LIAM: I'll help you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. Your investigation's possibly better than mine, but I'll roll it. 
LIAM: No, it's not. Different from perception. 
TALIESIN: Oh, then. Hey! Actually, okay! That's 17. 
MATT: 17, not bad. You do find a handful of tools, some that are broken, things for either building or repairing. A hammer, a crowbar. Sharpening, like a whetstone, for whether it be weapons or a bladed instrument that they used for cutting or shaping. You can see there's a flint present, likely used in starting the fire. But no other signs of life or movement. There's no bodies, there's no signs of a struggle or a fight. Just, whoever used it moved on. 
TALIESIN: I grab anything that looks like it's still usable. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I know it's old. 
MATT: You have a flint and steel. You have a hammer, whetstone. 
LIAM: Chet might be able to use that whetstone. 
TALIESIN: This is odd. I mean, how many encampments here? One on the beach. For some reason, they didn't use the cave one. The cave, I don't know. 
LIAM: Are they together, or are they apart? We'll have to look around a little more. 
MATT: Actually, I will say with what you rolled, too, the construction of the cavern encampment and what you saw on the beach appear to be of different materials and design. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: Multiple attempts. 
TALIESIN: It's something. 
LIAM: Maybe different people trying to come and find this tree? 
SAM: Yeah, if we wanted to get to the upper cavern, do we fly or climb? 
LIAM: Is it climbable with a hexagonal column? 
LAURA: It's only 40 feet up. 
MATT: It's climbable. 
LAURA: We could definitely get up there. 
MATT: It's not, you know, extremely easy. 
MARISHA: And it has the pitons. 
SAM and LAURA: Piton. 
TALIESIN: We just need a rope. 
SAM: We must have a rope, right? Should we go up? 
MATT: (Pâté) "Can I come back?" 
MARISHA: Oh, yes. Yes. 
MATT: Coasts on back and emerges. "Whee!" Returns to you. 
SAM: Is there anything else in the cavern down below that we need to investigate? 
LIAM: No, just some tools. Chet, do you need a whetstone? 
TRAVIS: No, I'm always sharp. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LIAM: Sorry I asked. 
TALIESIN: I had that on my list. 
MATT: I thought you were going to say something like that. 
TALIESIN: Crossing that off. 
LAURA: Stupid. 
ASHLEY: Were there two caves on the bottom? 
LAURA: Just one. 
ASHLEY: No, just one. 
LAURA: It was another 40 feet up. 
TALIESIN: Other than that, the only other way is to go around in that weird-- 
MATT: To swim around, and there's jagged rocks, which you can swim past, but it's its own danger depending on whether the tide's going in or it's coming out. You're not sure, coming in or going out. 
LIAM: I'm climbing. I'm climbing hexagonal columns. 
MATT: All right, make an athletics check for me. 
LAURA: I'm going to climb 10 feet and then Misty Step up the rest of the way. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: So I'll meet Orym. 
MATT: Make an athletics check for me. 
LIAM: Athletics? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: 11. 
MATT: 11? 
LIAM: (grunts) So little. 
MATT: You get stuck about 20 feet up. You get to a point where you grab onto one column and you step up, and where your foot and handholds are, you're able to sustain your height, but there's nothing to grab and pull within your grasp at the moment, and you're there. 
LIAM: Help! 
TRAVIS: Come on, young blood. 
LAURA: Is there anywhere I can tie off a rope in here? 
MATT: You (poof) appear up at the lip. Yeah, there are the-- 
LAURA: All right, I'm going to tie an end of the rope and then drop it down. 
LIAM: Thank you! 
LAURA: Need some help? 
LIAM: Yep, yep! 
MATT: Okay, after you poof up there and drop the rope down, how long is the rope again? 
LIAM: I'm just a wee fellow. 
MATT: Was it 50 feet of rope? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah, then with that, the rope dangles down to the base of the beach, and each of you can make your path up the side of the cliff. For that, let's make, for those who haven't rolled yet, a group athletics check. Because of the rope, it is a super low DC. 
TALIESIN: Ooh, wow! 
MATT: This is a 10 across the board. So, coming across here? 
TALIESIN: I somehow got a one. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: Okay. Fearne? 
SAM: Is this dex? 
ASHLEY: 14. 
MATT: 14, all righty. 
LAURA: Athletics. 
SAM: Athletics. 
MARISHA: Three. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Three. 
SAM: 13. 
LAURA: What the fuck?! 
LIAM: That tracks. 
TRAVIS: 14. 
MATT: 14. 
TALIESIN: Living hell. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: What did you roll for your original one? 
LAURA: I didn't roll. 
MATT: I said roll for the 10 feet climb to-- 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: -- go up there. 
LAURA: That's athletics? 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Say it. 
LAURA: Six. 
TRAVIS: What? 
TALIESIN: We started out so well. 
SAM: Oh boy! 
MARISHA: We have a rope. 
MATT: The slick mists have made the surface of this cliff a bit precarious, combined with the realization that the cliff face is not something you climb at a gradual incline, it is actually outward, and you're climbing-- 
TRAVIS: Decline. 
MATT: It's a decline from where you're heading upward, and it is a difficult hold. The rope hangs down, and it's less of you using the cliff to get up there and more having to use your whole body to climb a rope, which is not easy for all of you. 
TRAVIS: Some of us. 
MATT: You get there. But for those of you that rolled under a 10, you take a point of exhaustion. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
LAURA: For 10 feet? For 10 feet? 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MATT: Actually, no, because you teleport-- you used your spell, so you're fine, but everyone else who did the full climb. 
MARISHA: Can I Spider Climb-- 
MATT: You can, if you want to. 
MARISHA: instead? Once I realize how hard it is. 
LIAM: Once it gets hard. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll Spider Climb. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: This is hard! 
LAURA: So hard! 
TRAVIS: This is for your sword, Dread Captain Novos. 
MATT: Oh yeah, sorry. Mine again. 
LIAM: Fine Fezziwig. 
MARISHA: Oops. Sorry! 
ASHLEY: I tried. 
LAURA: We tried so hard to get it back. 
ASHLEY: I was going to steal it back, but that felt a little scary, and rude. 
MATT: All right. You all eventually, carefully, some of you tiredly, come to the mouth of the cave, and you see the smooth lava tube interior of this cavern as it begins to snake inward deeper into the cliff face and head towards where you saw. 
TRAVIS: Are we going to the left? 
MARISHA: So the left we know goes up and out. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, boring! 
MARISHA: Unless we want to be exploratory. 
TRAVIS: I could check out the right. 
MARISHA: Yeah, why not? 
TRAVIS: Report back. Got darkvision. I'll be back in a second. (rapid footsteps) 
SAM: You're going alone? Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Careful! 
TRAVIS: I'm (sniffs) smelling as I go in. 
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check for me. 
LIAM: That's what rogues do. 
TRAVIS: Fuck! That's not terrible, 12. 
MATT: 12, okay. As you skitter into the cavern, heading down the snaking hallway, the smell gets a little, I'd say sweeter. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: There's almost a, like a citrus, a grapefruit or citrus type smell. 
TRAVIS: Mm! Jackpot! 
MATT: It fills the cavern itself. You come to the large, spherical chamber that branches off into multiple paths, and you can see there's that pile of old encampment or so in the center. You have darkvision as a gnome, right? 
TRAVIS: I do. 
MATT: So you glance around, you see the pile, you see the two different tunnels that snake off. What do you want to do? 
TRAVIS: Does this come to the same place? Is this a middle spot? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
MATT: This is where it forks. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LIAM: This is the fork? 
MATT: So left and right. 
MARISHA: Okay. Oh! 
LIAM: Oh, this is the fork. 
LAURA: Oh, the OG fork. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: The OG fork. I thought you were going-- 
LIAM: I thought it was a new fork. 
MATT: There's a spherical chamber where now two other tunnels branch off. 
LAURA: Got it. Okay, that's where you were going. 
TRAVIS: That's where I'm going to go right. 
MARISHA: He was going right. 
TRAVIS: Because Pâté went left. 
LAURA: We're all going left. We all join him in the spherical thing. 
MATT: Okay. All right. So you dart through and head over. That sweet smell is extremely strong as you head through the center of this space. 
TRAVIS: Citrus-y, but not decay-y, right? 
MATT: Ah... 
MARISHA: Yeah, like fermented? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: "Ah..." 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: As you move through the center of the chamber, that hint of fermented putrescence underlines it ever so faintly. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: It's not bad. For scavengers, it is a swan song of-- 
TRAVIS: It's like my college mini fridge. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ew! 
LAURA: So we're all in this chamber now? 
MATT: It's just him. He ran off. Unless any of you guys are following him. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (sniffs) 
MATT: You head over towards the right entryway and hear this ever so faint sound of some rocks moving and a (slithering), like the sound of a thousand metallic armor scales gently brushing against rock. 
ASHLEY: Mm-mm. 
LIAM: (gasps) 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: I freeze and go invisible. But if it's doing this, then it probably isn't (slurping) doing that. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
MATT: You stand there for a second, holding your breath, frozen in place here in the lightless chamber as that weird slithering sound gets louder. (slithering) You see out of the right hand corner of your eye something large slither past you. I mean, about four or five feet in diameter, about that wide in places, but it's tapered towards the front. You can see at the front of it, it looks like a worm with a very thick hide. As it moves, you immediately clock that sound you're hearing is the texture of its hide gripping the rocks and pushing itself along. 
ASHLEY: Ew. 
MATT: As it moves around and seems to curl around on itself, almost forming a loop and a knot around its own body, you realize, it's encircling you. 
SAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: (gasps) Ruh-roh. 
SAM: Ruh-roh. 
LIAM: The hunter becomes the hunted. 
TRAVIS: I reach quietly into my bag of holding. 
SAM: They're a worm. 
TRAVIS: Take out the ♪ Horn of silent alarm ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check for me. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LAURA: Yeah! 
SAM: Did we keep the horn of silent alarm? 
LAURA: We all hear that he's-- 
LIAM: He calls us. 
MARISHA: He's fucked, yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: So do you need to see the individuals for that horn, or just think of them? 
TRAVIS: That's a good question. 
MATT: I'm trying to remember how this works specifically. 
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. I've only used it in seriousness once. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Horn of silent alarm. Four charges. Use an action to blow. One creature can hear-- 600 feet of the horn and not deafened, of my choice. 
MATT: Yeah, so yeah. So who do you pick? 
SAM: Oh, just one person, or? 
LAURA: Everybody? 
MATT: One creature. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, one creature. I'll send it to Imogen. 
MATT: Imogen, you hear (aggressive horn) the horn blasting into your head. 
LIAM: You all right? 
LAURA: Chet's in trouble. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Well, damn shame. Anyway. 
MATT: As you stand there, the horn still in your hand, that slithering sound, you see it's formless. 
TRAVIS: That's two. 
MATT: There's no legs, it's just moved around, almost knotted into itself, and the front of this odd, caecilian is the term for these creatures that have no-- 
LIAM: Sicilian. (laughter) 
MATT: Spelled differently. (sparse laughter) 
TALIESIN: Inevitable. 
TRAVIS: Are you sure? 
MARISHA: Inevitable! 
MATT: You watch as the front of it that you saw snaking, formless, seems to unfold a bit. As it unfolds, these two heads (thick slurps) pop out. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: No eyes, but you see these mandibles that are tucked in at the front of each of them as they both-- (moist searching slurps) 
LAURA: Mm-mm. 
MATT: They're looking in your direction. They know you're there. They're just pinpointing, playing, you're not sure. What are the rest of you doing? 
ASHLEY: Do we go-- 
LAURA: We're heading in. We're running in. 
SAM: Yeah, full force, or are we going stealthy? We're just going to run in? 
LIAM: What would we do? 
LAURA: I mean, if we think he's in trouble-- 
SAM: You doubled over in pain and said Chetney's in trouble. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I start running. 
LAURA: Yeah, I would run in. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Shit. 
LAURA: I would start going. 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I still have Spider Climb up-- 
ASHLEY: Let's go. 
MARISHA: -- so I'm going to skitter along the walls. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: Mage Armor as I'm heading out. 
SAM: As we go, I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. 
SAM: -- tap Ashton on the back and give him, what do you call it? Spare the Dying? No, that's not it. Death Ward. 
TALIESIN: Death Ward? 
SAM: Death Ward. 
MATT: You got it. 
SAM: Don't die, this is your-- 
TALIESIN: No, I'm into it. 
MARISHA: Mirror Image. 
SAM: -- your thing. 
MATT: All right. You all go-- 
ASHLEY: I'm also going to give Ashton a slap and give him some Guidance. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: For the-- 
MATT: Sure, yeah. For the next minute. 
ASHLEY: Just doing it for-- 
LIAM: Is that a slap attack? 
MATT: Do you have Mister out, or are you leaving Mister-- 
ASHLEY: Fly-by tickle. 
MATT: Do you have Mister out or are you-- 
ASHLEY: Yes, Mister is out. 
MATT: All right. (flaming monkey apparates) You all go charging down this tunnel quickly. You hear the sounds of the footfalls of your friends rapidly approaching. One of the heads (slurps) and the mandibles (wet chitters) You see as the mandibles open slightly, on the inside it's cylindrical rows of teeth that vanish into-- 
LIAM: Oh, worm shit! 
MATT: That head, while it looks off, the other one's still training on you. (thick slurps) 
TRAVIS: How far away from these heads of happiness am I, roughly? 
MATT: 10 feet. 
TRAVIS: (high pitch yelp) I'm going to learn from my past mistakes and I'm going to cover my mouth and bonus action hybrid transformation into a werewolf. I'm like-- (muffled straining) (laughter) (laughter) 
MATT: Roll a stealth check for me. 
LAURA: Oh man. 
MATT: (laughs) (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: 19? 19. 
MATT: 19? 
TRAVIS: 10 plus nine. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: You (restrained grunts) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You can hear the (joints cracking) 
MATT: Yep. And at the last minute, you go (tiny wolf howl). (laughter) 
MATT: Both heads immediately (rapid twist) back to you. Mandibles open up, and I need you to roll initiative. (excited exclamations) 
SAM: This combat is brought to you by WizKids Minis. Gather the Crown Keepers as they travel the lands of Tal'Dorei. 
MARISHA: Crown Keepers! 
SAM: From friendly contests on the rooftops of Emon to traveling the Rifenmist Jungles, capture some of your favorite moments with this band of misfits-- (oohs and ahhs) 
SAM: -- in miniature form. 
LAURA: There's a nest? 
MARISHA: Oh they got a nest? 
MATT: There is. 
LAURA: That's the pile. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: There's stuff in there! 
SAM: -- and many more Critical Role miniatures at wizkids.io/crminis, or your local game store. 
MARISHA: Do we all roll initiative or just Chet right now? 
LIAM: There's a sword in that nest. 
MATT: All of you will. Also, my minis are not at the table. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: No! 
SAM: Your minis were stolen by WizKids Minis. 
LIAM: Here, use these popcorn kernels. 
MATT: I'll use the popcorn kernels for now. 
SAM: Wizkids.io/crminis-- 
LAURA: Where'd they go? 
MATT: I don't know. 
SAM: -- to replace your stolen minis. 
LIAM: This one's Laudna. Put them together. 
MATT: They might be up here. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh, I hear running. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: This little one's Orym. 
TRAVIS: (rapid footsteps) 
LAURA: (yelling) Ah-la-la-la. 
TRAVIS: (rapid footsteps) 
SAM: CR Minis. 
MARISHA: All right. 
SAM: Wizkids.io/crminis. You'll never lose yours, if you get them at your local game store. 
MATT: I should have looked for those before we started tonight. That's on me. 
TALIESIN: It'll happen. 
MATT: Well, in the interim-- 
TRAVIS: They are going to get them. 
LIAM: Should we go through initiatives? 
LAURA: Do you want to go check your-- 
MATT: Yeah, give me-- I need my minis. 
ASHLEY: We could use-- 
MATT: I don't know where they are. 
SAM: I've got two hands! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: You've got FCG right there. 
TALIESIN: I've got a third hand. 
SAM: I've got an FCG right here. 
MATT: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: I've got an Ashton. We can do this. 
LIAM: Everybody, offer-- 
SAM: We can do this! 
TRAVIS: We could also just go get them. 
SAM: We've got a Laudna book. This could be Laudna. It says Laudna on it. 
MARISHA: Oh, yes! 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Well, in the interim, regardless-- 
SAM: This could be Fearne! 
MATT: Let's do initiative order. 
MARISHA: Let's roll initiative. 
MATT: So. Okay. 25 to 20? 
LIAM: Natural 20 gets me to 25. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm next? Yeah. Natural 20 gets me to 23. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
LIAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Look at you both. 
ASHLEY: (party horn) 
MATT: All right, 20 to 15? 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so it's Orym. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Ashton, Fearne. 
MATT: 15 to 10? 
SAM: 12! 
TRAVIS: 13. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: 12! 
LAURA: Chet, Letters. 
PRODUCER: Patrick is hunting down the last two. 
MATT: Thank you so much. Appreciate it. 
SAM: Hey, look at that. 
LIAM: There are the babies. 
SAM: A well-oiled machine. 
LAURA: That's weird, because you had that one that you were showing me earlier. 
MATT: That was not part of those. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: It was the player minis that was missing. 
LIAM: That was special. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: You all are back in this chamber here. 
SAM: Oh no, we're far. 
MARISHA: We're not far. 
LAURA: That's not terrible. 
SAM: I've got a wheel! 
MATT: FCG, you're back a bit that way, as is-- 
LAURA: I would've taken off running as soon as I heard the (horn blast), so. 
LIAM: Same. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Skrrt! 
MATT: But Ashton also has a faster running speed. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yep. I'm fast. 
SAM: Ashton's better. 
LAURA: Well, yes. 
SAM: Just in general. 
TALIESIN: In general. 
MATT: All right, so Chetney, and then FCG? 
TRAVIS: Yes. That was 15 to 10. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: And then? 
MARISHA: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Imo. Imo! 
LAURA: I got six. 
LIAM: 'Mogen. 
MARISHA: Nine. 
SAM: Oh no! 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Who got nine? 
MARISHA: Me. 
LIAM: 69. Nice. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
LAURA: (laughing) Hey! 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
TALIESIN: So last two are? 
LAURA: I'm last. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. Well, until it shows up-- 
ASHLEY: I didn't mean to slap your butt. 
MATT: I'm going to say this is you. 
LAURA: Hey. 
ASHLEY: I mean. 
MARISHA: Oh that's pretty good. That's great! 
MATT: Close enough for now. 
TRAVIS: Why does it have three heads? Two heads? 
MATT: The mini has three, but it has two. 
TRAVIS: Oh god, okay. Just two, for now! You bastard. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Best I could find that worked for what I needed. So. I don't even have Orym's mini at the moment. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
MATT: It's sure to arrive. 
LIAM: You can use my Ruidus die. 
SAM: This is the worst episode. 
MATT: I know. (laughs) This is on me, I should've double checked. 
LAURA: Here, use Sprinkle. 
LIAM: Oh yeah, that's the right size. 
LAURA: Use Sprinkle. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's good. 
LIAM: That's perfect. 
MATT: There we go. Sprinkle it is. 
LIAM: Ha ha! Kill me! 
TRAVIS: (Sprinkle) Why am I back? (laughter) 
MARISHA: I missed him! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (Sprinkle) This can't be real! 
LIAM: He's so cute! 
TRAVIS: (Sprinkle) A fresh new hell. 
MATT: From back there. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: I'll use this wraith as Laudna. There we go. 
ASHLEY: There you go. 
MATT: Hooray for proxying. 
MATT: All right, so Orym, you're up first. 
LIAM: I just run. Run all out. 
TRAVIS: (Sprinkle) Why have I avoided the eternal sleep? 
LIAM: I'll use my action to dash. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, so-- 
LIAM: So 60 feet. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Why have you avoided the eternal sleep? 
LIAM: (silly voice) Watch me go! 
MATT: There you are. 
MARISHA: Fuck, that's so good. 
MATT: There you are. Finishing your go. Ashton, you're up. 
LIAM: (silly voice) Dead again! 
TALIESIN: I'll run 40 feet, and then I will see what I'm going to see. 
SAM: Ragé, ragé. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Ragé ♪ 
LIAM: Sashay, smashay. 
MATT: How much? 
TALIESIN: 40 feet? 
MATT: 40 feet would be here. 
TALIESIN: Okay, can I see? I can get a view of that, then. 
MATT: Do you have darkvision? 
TALIESIN: Actually, no, I don't think I do. 
MATT: Do you have darkvision? 
LIAM: I don't think so. 
MATT: Both of you go running into pitch black darkness, and you have no idea where you are. Actually, as you're running, you're bumping into the walls and having to push past. 
LIAM: I have faith in Imogen. 
TRAVIS: Taliesin, grab it. 
MATT: Open that up and bring them in. 
TALIESIN: Yep, yep, yep. 
LIAM: Crack it open. 
SAM: Oh wow, we're opening a new-- 
LIAM: This combat literally brought to you-- 
MATT: Literally brought to you by WizKids! 
PRODUCER: (off screen) I don't know. 
LAURA: I don't either. 
TRAVIS: It'll work. 
MATT: It'll work fine. 
PRODUCER: (off screen) I have spares. 
MATT: That's good, that's good. This is why we have minis. That's on me. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to run in. I'm going to rage, I suppose. Let's see what the fuck is going on in here. Maybe that'll be just enough light to have a vague idea of what the fuck is going on. Cool, let's-- Nope, that doesn't cause even the slightest bit of light. 
MARISHA: Is that why you're holding your seat? 
LAURA: In combat, you're like-- 
MATT: There is Orym, great. Perfect. 
TALIESIN: How far away-- Well, I can't see anything yet, can I? 
CREW MEMBER: (off screen) I found them! I found-- Oh, fuck. (laughter) 
LIAM: He said, "I found them! I found-- oh fuck!" 
MATT: There you go. 
LAURA: Oh, Sprinkle! 
MATT: He's fine. 
LAURA: Treat him with respect! 
MATT: He's lived through worse. 
MARISHA: Clumsy waiter and he biffs it. 
LIAM: (Sprinkle) Put me back under the ground! 
MATT: Thank you, crew! You're amazing! 
MARISHA: Thank you! 
TALIESIN: I've hit a rage, but no one can see it anyway, so there's no-- Yeah, it doesn't change anything. 
TRAVIS: Doesn't give off light? 
TALIESIN: No, it's one of the ones that does not give off light. 
MATT: All right, so you rush in there. You don't hear anything, and it's just darkness, and you have no idea what's happening, so you go into a rage and you still have your action. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action to start moving around the wall to my-- 
MATT: You don't know there's a wall there because you can't see anything. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I thought I was-- 
MATT: I'm going to say from this point-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, it's my action? 
MATT: You've moved through the tunnel and felt your way through, rushing into darkness, and now you're here, you can move forward, but I'm going to say it's difficult terrain. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to-- 
MATT: It opens up, and you don't know where anything is. 
TALIESIN: -- come through and open up about 20 feet. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: To the mini's left. 
MATT: To the left here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, to there. 
MATT: There? Okay, all right. Finishing your go, Fearne, you're up, with Chet on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right, I have a 35-foot movement speed, so I'm going to run up as far as I can go. 
MATT: 30, 35, 40 puts you there. You're still in this tunnel. Do you have darkvision? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: You're also feeling against the walls with no light source. 
ASHLEY: I can't see! Would I be able to cast Daylight? Try to push it in there? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Whatever I think is the ceiling, try to push something forward? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I cast it. 
MATT: I'll say from this standpoint you, feeling through, there's a little bit of flame of Mister as he approaches that just gives enough light to show you that this tunnel opens up into a room, and you don't know what's in that room. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So you just-- 
ASHLEY: Throw up Daylight. 
MATT: Throw Daylight into that space. The room suddenly brightens up as if it was mid-afternoon in the center of this darkened chamber. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Ah ♪ 
MATT: The three of you can immediately see this large, coiled, worm-like creature that has tangled into itself and closed off part of the exit for the now wolven-ly transformed Chetney. You see two of these extended heads without eyes, mandibles snapping, and at the end of the tail, a massive, weird-looking, curved stinger that seems to whip behind it as it does. 
LAURA: Ruh-roh. 
MATT: So that's your action and your movement. 
ASHLEY: That is my action and my movement, and Mister is going to throw some flaming shit. 
MATT: How far can he move? 
ASHLEY: He can move-- ("Under the Sea") ♪ Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ♪ 30 feet. 
MATT: 30 feet, he gets about there. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: He can make the attack. What's the range on it? 
ASHLEY: 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet. Let's see if it's in range. 
SAM: That's close! 
MATT: He throws it, and it arcs. 
LAURA: Boo! 
MATT: Landing on the ground before it even reaches the creature, unfortunately. 
TRAVIS: Continues to burn. 
ASHLEY: That's fine. Okay. 
MATT: The smolder's important. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Finishing Fearne's go, Chetney, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
SAM: FCG on deck? 
TRAVIS: I'll take the Turmoil cane out and utter the word: Done! And it'll unfurl into a scythe. I'll use my bonus action to slice it up my quad, and flames erupt along the blade, and I will take a swipe, approach and take a swipe at the heads. 
MATT: Go for it. 
SAM: Where'd you get those? 
MARISHA: Ashley handed them off to me while I was going pee. 
TRAVIS: That's a 28 to hit for the first strike-- 
SAM: While you were mid-stream? 
TRAVIS: -- natural 18. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh! 
MATT: Natural 18 does hit. 
MARISHA: Close with all of our producers. 
TRAVIS: Come on, butcher's blade. No, a dirty 20 on the second one. 
MATT: Both of those hit. 
TRAVIS: Okay, great, I should roll the Crimson Rite, that's two points of damage for me, but that adds two. This is-- 
LAURA: Fiona! Fuck! 
TRAVIS: Four-- 
ASHLEY: Fi-- fuck! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Five, 10. 12 points of damage for the first one. Two of those are flame. 
MATT: Good to know. 
TRAVIS: Then nine points of damage on the second one, two, also of flame. 
MATT: Great. All right, you carve twice into this creature. These large gash marks opening across its thick, slithering, almost now you can see somewhat shiny hide. Like it has a viscous excretion that surrounds the exterior of its body. As you cut, its blood sprays outward, and you prepare yourself with a grin of like, "Okay, if it bleeds, we can kill it." What's that burning sensation? You take 12 points of acid damage. (groaning) 
TRAVIS: Just from it splattering on me? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Oh wow. 
MATT: You're not sure if it's the blood or whatever it secretes, but each time you struck it, you took acid damage. 
TRAVIS: Acid damage, okay. 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Okay, keep away. 
TRAVIS: Good to know, good to know, good to know. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TRAVIS: By the way, I lived after the long rest. 
MATT and LIAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: I forgot to roll. 
MATT: Good to know. All right. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: Finishing your turn. 
TRAVIS: (pained shout) 
MATT: Chetney, you done? 
TRAVIS: Cholesterol. Done! 
MARISHA: He drops dead of a heart attack in the middle of a fight. 
MATT: FCG, you're up. 
LIAM: I need to retcon that I died 30 minutes ago. (laughter) 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: How many days did we travel? 
SAM: I think I will-- 
MARISHA: Three, two? 
SAM: -- start by-- 
TRAVIS: That's the closest one yet. 
SAM: -- rolling 30 feet as far as I can roll. 
TRAVIS: If I roll trip zeroes-- 
MARISHA: Trip zeroes. Okay. 
SAM: It's not very far. 
MATT: 30, it gets you right behind Fearne. 
LAURA: Did you get a one? 
MATT: You have no view of the inside of the chamber from here, you see light coming through and you watch Fearne cast the spell and Mister (monkey screech)-- 
MARISHA: Jesus, one. Why? 
MATT: -- throw this flaming turd into a chamber that you have no particular view on, but you know you hear combat happening in there. 
SAM: Can I, boy, I don't know, I've never done this spell before, but can I activate the Staff of Dark Odyssey with one charge and use Misty Step to bonus action step into this room I've never been into before? 
MATT: Yeah, you can. 
LIAM: Misty die. 
TALIESIN: (like Sean Connery) Misty Step. 
MATT: (whooshes) 
SAM: (gasps) 
SAM: You take damage every time you use it. 
SAM: You do? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, you take damage every time you use that staff. 1d4, I think, for-- 
MATT: Each charge spent. 
SAM: Okay. I take three points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not scared! 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
SAM: Now that I can see what's going on in here, oh my god. Oh boy, it's far. I'm going to use my action to Sympathetically Bind myself to Chetney, Ashton, and whoever else is near me. 
MATT: Orym. 
SAM: Orym, yes. 
MATT: All right, so Chetney, Ashton, Orym, you're all sympathetically bound to FCG. 
SAM: We're in this together! Want some pot brownies? 
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. 
TRAVIS: Can you add four additional hit points? I only rolled 1d6, instead of 2d6. 
MATT: Oh yeah, got it. 
TRAVIS: I just rolled them. Thanks. 
MATT: You got it. All right, cool. It is now the basalt caecilian's turn. The creature, now seeing the others appearing at the bright light, not affecting it. 
TRAVIS: Right. 
MATT: It has no eyes. But it seems to notice the arrival and the footfalls of your companions and it slithers around this way back onto the top of its mound there. It's going to take two jagged mandible attacks. 
TRAVIS: Is that a nest of bones? 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Looks like it. 
TRAVIS: Oh god. 
MATT: Let's see, at its full, there is about 10-foot range. There we go, one head lashes out at you, the other's going to go for FCG. Against you, natural one. 
TRAVIS: Oh, thank goodness. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: As you've gashed it with the scythe before, it tries to lash out towards you and your scythe is already in the place and instead it bites the blade of your scythe and you just pull it free. 
TRAVIS: Ting! 
MATT: As it uses that momentum, it whips around, the other mandibles are going to strike towards you, FCG. 
SAM: No! 
MATT: That is going to be a 20 to hit. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: All right, you ♪ take. ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ On me ♪ 
MATT: ♪ Take on me ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Take me on ♪ ♪ I'll be gone ♪ 
MATT: 22 points of slashing damage. 
LIAM, TRAVIS, and LAURA: ♪ ("Take On Me" high-pitched singing) ♪ 
MATT: Plus-- 
LIAM: Ashley sang it better. 
MATT: Seven points of acid damage. 
SAM: Oh wait. Am I-- 
LAURA: Wha--? 
TRAVIS: Aw, yeah. 
SAM: I'm not. Okay. 
LAURA: "Take On Me." 
MATT: It's going to use its extend stomach attack. 
SAM: What now? 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Extend stomach? 
MATT: So the two-- 
LAURA: Ew! 
MARISHA: Like the starfish? 
MATT: The two heads that are snatching, you see where the two of the meet, something like an opening opens up between that fork-- 
LIAM: Hot Pocket. 
MATT: -- and the middle of its body seems to swell for a second and then suddenly-- (tongue waggling) (groaning) 
MATT: This mass of pale, colorless, white, capillary-like flesh extends and stretches out. 
LAURA: Oh, that's fucking terrible, I've seen those creatures before. 
ASHLEY: That's foul! 
LAURA: It is fucking awful. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: In a 30-foot-- 
LAURA: They are so, so creepy. 
TRAVIS: What the fucking hell? Like a gecko's tongue or something? 
LAURA: No, it protrudes out of the worm and it does, it looks like capillaries, it looks like they extend and they go-- 
SAM: Oh, I've seen those, too, they can't see, they just feel around. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: You know those little rubber doll toys, you squeeze them and their eyes go (pops). 
ASHLEY: I feel like I need to look it up. 
LAURA: Yeah, you really do, we should look it up, it's disgusting. 
MATT: It hits Ashton, FCG, and Orym. I need you all to make a dexterity saving throw for me. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Me too? Okay. 
MATT: No, not you. 
TRAVIS: This is when we should've used-- 
SAM: You all just rolled a bunch of natural 20s, right? 
TALIESIN: I don't have Guidance, right? 
SAM: Not yet. 
TALIESIN: No, I have, what is Guidance? 
ASHLEY: You do have Guidance, a d4. 
TALIESIN: That's an extra d4. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, extra d4, you also have-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, no, that'll work. 
LIAM: I'm going to spend a superiority die and use Zephran Heart to add to my low roll. 
SAM: This is dex? 
MATT: Dex. 
SAM: Save? 
MATT: Save. 
SAM: 14. 
MATT: 14, you take 34 points of acid damage. 
TRAVIS: 34? 
TALIESIN: Whoa. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Your maximum hit points are reduced by 10. (groaning) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Whoa, Matt! Hey, hey, buddy, chill! 
MATT: You're also pulled 10 feet to it as the stomach extension wraps around you and seems to begin the digestion process and yanks you as it pulls all of its extended stomach back into that hole, it's pulling all of you in that area towards it. So you get pulled towards it. 
LIAM: It's so far away from me! 17. 
MATT: 17, that's a success, you take half the damage. I said it was 30? 
TRAVIS: Four. 
MATT: 34, you take 16 points of acid damage and you're not pulled. 
TALIESIN: 16. 
LAURA: I just sent you guys a link. 
SAM: I was pulled? 
MATT: 16 just barely makes it. So you also take 16 points of acid damage and you are not pulled. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Five feet towards it or 10 feet towards it? 
MATT: He was pulled 10 feet towards it. 
TRAVIS: 10 feet. 
MATT: But he only had 10 feet to go. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, that disgusting. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: That's... 
TRAVIS: He's in it, he's in it? 
TALIESIN: No, why would you do that? 
MATT: He's not in it. He's just brought to it. 
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that? 
MATT: That's going to finish its turn. Laudna, you're up; Imogen, you're on deck. 
MARISHA: Oh, I'm up. Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: That's awful. 
MATT: I love nature. 
LAURA: Isn't it disgusting? 
ASHLEY: I hate it, I hate it. 
TRAVIS: Why is that shit on the outside? 
LAURA: Why does it exist? 
LIAM: Yeah, it's taking its innards and (bleh) and pull. 
ASHLEY: Does it go back in? 
LAURA: It's like a shark that can vomit out its stomach and then suck it back in. 
ASHLEY: That doesn't feel as gross, for some reason. 
MARISHA: I'm climbing against the wall, I'll hug to this side. 
MATT: 30 up to about there? 
MARISHA: 30, can I see it now, around this bend? 
MATT: You can, from above there. 
MARISHA: I've got darkvision. 
MATT: If you drop down, you can see it. From the ceiling, the opening, it doesn't give you enough of a view to actually see it from the inside, but if you drop to the ground, you'd be able to see it. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'll do that. 
MATT: Okay, you drop right in front Fearne, off the wall, and now you can see it over there. You watch as that extended capillary network of its organ has already been placed out and then withdraws back and FCG gets dragged along with it. 
SAM: (yells) 
MARISHA: (shouts) 
TRAVIS: Dude, what the hell, man? 
MARISHA: "What the hell" is correct. I'm going to go ahead and bonus action. 
MATT: Oh, I guess you also would've noticed, too, the wounds that you left on it seem to be in the process of sealing themselves up again. 
TRAVIS: Oh no, the wounds are starting to self heal it a little. 
MATT: So Laudna. 
LAURA: Oh fuck. 
LIAM: I'm sick of this dude. 
MARISHA: I got stuff for that. 
SAM: I don't like him. 
MATT: Imogen, you're on deck. 
LAURA: How high are the ceilings in here? 
MATT: In this room? About 20, 25 feet, not terribly high. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'll go ahead and bonus action Hex it. 
MATT: Actually, no, I said it's somewhat spherical, so it'd be closer to 30, 40 feet. 
LAURA: Okay, and the creature's how big? 
MATT: It's more of a dome, I guess you would say, or an egg shape. 
LAURA: How big is the creature? 
MATT: The creature, I mean, it takes up a four by four square, but it's 80, 90 feet long just coiled up. 
LIAM: It's huge, huge. 
ASHLEY: Huge. 
MARISHA: Huge. 
TALIESIN: Shite. Burned that, got to get rid of that. 
MARISHA: Do I want to do that? No, I don't do that. Not right now, not yet. I will go ahead and bonus action Form of Dread. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'll roll my 10-- 
TRAVIS: Holy balls, Matt! 
MARISHA: That real quick. Seven, great, plus three, okay, 10. All right, and then I will-- Okay, I will Chill Touch it. 
MATT: Okay, are you rolling to attack on that or is it a dex save or constitution save from him? 
MARISHA: I-- "On a hit," I roll to hit. 
MATT: Okay, go for it. 
MARISHA: Okay, sorry, sorry. 
SAM: Come on, dice. 
MARISHA: Ew, 17? 
SAM: That's great. 
MATT: 17 just hits. (oohing) 
TALIESIN: I'm writing that down. 
MARISHA: Okay, that's good to know, 17 is its AC. Takes six damage, six necrotic damage. 
MATT: Got it. 
MARISHA: So not great, but it cannot regain hit points. 
MATT: Until the end of its next turn? 
MARISHA: Until the end of its next turn. 
MATT: That's good to know, all righty. 
TALIESIN: Solid. 
MATT: All right. As the Chill Touch image shifts out as you extend your claw and it digs its way into its body, you can see the wounds that were closing seem to freeze over with magical ice and are no longer healing. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: Is that your turn? 
MARISHA: That's my turn. 
MATT: All right, finishing up your go, Imogen, you're up, with Orym on deck. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Laura Bailey. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: La Ba. 
LAURA: I am going to-- Oh, I'm going to come forward-- 
SAM: Emmy Award winning. 
LAURA: -- so I'm close. 
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30 gets you right next to where Fearne is in the space between her and Laudna. 
LAURA: That's within 90 feet of it? 
MATT: It is. It does have, from where you're standing, half cover because of the nature of the cavern there. 
MARISHA: It can't regain hit points until the start of my next turn-- 
MATT: Got you. 
MARISHA: -- is how it works. 
MATT: Good to know. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. I am going to reach my hand out and from the ground, it's going to start shaking and breaking open, and these giant tendrils of dark energy are going to reach up and around the creature and I'm going to cast Hungry Torrent. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Hungry what? 
SAM: ♪ Hungry Torrent ♪ 
MATT: That's a concentration? 
LAURA: It is a concentration. 
TRAVIS: Hungry what? 
MATT: What's the size of the radius? 
LAURA: It's a 20-foot sphere. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: A 20-foot square? 
MATT: It's a 20-foot square? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Hungry, excuse me? 
MARISHA: ("Hungry Eyes") ♪ Hungry Torrent ♪ 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Hungry, Hungry Torrent. ♪ Open up and there it goes ♪ 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
MARISHA: (quick flapping) 
MATT: Here we go. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Between you and I ♪ 
MATT: We'll put this right about there so it doesn't get in your face. 
LAURA: Okay, great. 
MATT: But there we go. All right, and what does it have to roll? 
LAURA: "When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there it has to roll a dexterity save." 
MATT: Cool, we'll come to that on its turn. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
MATT: Great. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: These dark energy tendrils of a deep reddish purple rise up, and you can see as they shift, it's not organic. They almost glitch and shift with the magical energy and these flashes of an arcane electricity that mingles with this atmospheric dark smoke that swirls around them. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? All righty, that brings us to Orym, with Ashton on deck. 
LIAM: Man, this thing is disgusting as shit. I'll hop up onto that little divider there, five, 10. 
MATT: Right here? 
LIAM: Yes, and I will slash Seedling through the air twice and-- 
LAURA: That was 4th-level. 
LIAM: -- cut the air and slice it from a distance. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LIAM: Natural 20. 
MATT: Woo! 
LIAM: That's balls, that is a 13, so that doesn't hit. 
MATT: Second one doesn't hit, but the first one is dead on with a crit. 
LIAM: I'm going to make it a goading attack. 
MATT: Sure. 
LIAM: Six and six is 12 plus the bonus. 
LAURA: You're going to be keeping distance. Okay, but I thought people would be keeping distance, that's why I did it. 
LIAM: So 14 dice rolled, goes up to 28. 
MATT: 28 damage, nice. 
LIAM: No, that's not right, that's not right. That's not all the dice. It's six, so 14 plus-- It's 20, 20 total. 
MATT: 20 total? 
LIAM: Is what that is. 
MATT: Okay, 20 points of damage on that crit strike. 
LIAM: And-- 
TRAVIS and LIAM: Crit strike! 
MATT: It's a wisdom save? 
LIAM: Goading attack DC, yes, wisdom 17, 
MATT: 15. 
LIAM: It got a 15? 
MATT: It got 15. 
LIAM: Fail. 
MATT: All right, so yeah, so any attack that doesn't include you is at disadvantage. 
LIAM: Yeah, and I think I'm going to use, with my boots, I'm going to spring to that column there and go another 10 to 15. I think I have five more feet to jump behind it. 
MATT: Over here? 
LIAM: Back out of view. So I'm hard to get to and keep that disadvantage up. 
TRAVIS: Except in that crevice. 
LIAM: Crevasse! 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: All right, Ashton, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
SAM: In a crevasse! 
TALIESIN: All right, I see what's going on here. So I'm going to keep running towards me. I'm going to get a little distance and then back up. Not quite into the corner but one to the right. Yeah, right back there. 
MATT: Yeah? 
TALIESIN: I've got a good line of sight on this thing and I'm going to take the little-- 
MATT: Move up against the wall. 
TALIESIN: Against the wall and which you can see very clearly through the hole in my head. So I'm going to figure out the right line. I'm going to take the hammer, I'm going to give it a nice good throw and it's going to hit him right behind his head on the corner. 
MATT: Oh, so you got space. 
SAM: Amazing. 
MATT: As he takes his massive hammer and swings it and releases it, it vanishes in the air and the creature all of a sudden behind it, the hammer pops out of nowhere as a small wormhole opens and it emerges with an arc. Roll for the attack. 
TALIESIN: I forgot to do that. Natural 20! (cheering) 
MATT: Dang! 
TRAVIS: Let's go! Barbarian's crit. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is going to be fun. So knowing, double checking, that means all attacks against this creature are made with advantage until the start of my next turn. 
LAURA: Nice! 
SAM: Oh wow! 
MARISHA: All attacks? 
TALIESIN: "All attacks against this--" Yeah, hold on, say it again. 
LIAM: It's at disadvantage and we're at advantage. 
TALIESIN: "Attack rolls against that creature are made with advantage until the start of your next turn." 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LAURA: Nice. 
TALIESIN: So now I'm going to hit this motherfucker with what I got. 
LIAM: (Bane voice) Like Bane. 
TALIESIN: Heh, that's fun. 
MARISHA: He has to roll a wisdom saving throw-- 
TALIESIN: 17 times-- 
MARISHA: -- against my shit. I forgot about that. 
TALIESIN: Actually, god, I'm just going to do math. 
MATT: Natural 19. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Can he be a-feared? 
TALIESIN: 38 points of damage. 
MATT: Woo! 
SAM: Dude. 
TALIESIN: Some of that force damage. 
MATT: No worries, thank you. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Catching back. That went rather well. (chuckling) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another angle and I'm going to throw another one. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit him over in a slightly different thing coming apparently from the roof. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Because, god, we're everywhere. 
MATT: It's like you see him swing at nothing. It disappears then he catches in the other side and then swings and it vanishes and it comes down from the top. 
SAM: Cool. 
MATT: Towards the creature. 
TALIESIN: Good luck, come on, come on, no whammies. Oh, actually I have advantage, don't I? 
MATT: You do now. 
TALIESIN: That was cocked anyways. Ah, that was cocked. 24. 
MATT: 24 hits, roll damage. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm doing that again. Not quite as good. 22 points of damage. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: 56 points of damage. 
LIAM: He's a barbarian. You remember Grog. 
TALIESIN: Trying not to talk, trying not to breathe, I'm so proud. 
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn? 
TALIESIN: That's my turn. 
MATT: All right. So as a lair action-- 
LAURA: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: (squeaky) Lair action? 
LIAM: Yeah, that's right. 
MATT: The creature, which is currently now starting to freak out a bit, you watch as it lifts its heads up and its mandibles open and they seem to chatter, but no sound comes out. 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
LIAM: Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
TRAVIS: Even my wolf ears hear nothing? 
MATT: For your wolf ears, you hear this very faint, high-pitched, horrid trilling sound. It's a piercing (trills) sound. 
TRAVIS: Did you hear that? 
MARISHA: Calling for friends? 
LAURA: Probably. 
LIAM: It's coming out of the bath tub drain. 
MATT: A bunch of unseen little-- 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: -- pods in the ceiling begin popping as-- 
TRAVIS: Popping?! 
MATT: -- tiny little larval things fall from the ground. 
LAURA: Nightmare, I had this nightmare. 
MATT: I'm sorry. 
MARISHA: I'm having a hard time. 
MATT: Everyone within the room, they hit and impact and burst. So everyone in the room takes-- 
ASHLEY: Now there's so many holes up there. 
MATT: -- four points of acid damage. 
TRAVIS: Everybody takes four points of acid damage? 
MATT: Who's in the room, which should be Orym, Ashton, FCG, and Chetney. 
SAM: Ow. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
MATT: That brings us to Fearne, with Chetney on deck. 
TALIESIN: You can hide from everyone but yourself. 
ASHLEY: This place gives me the willies. Okay, I'm going to try to stay in cover back there, but I want to be able to throw some Scorching Marisha Rays. 
MATT: Now, mind you, if you're in cover, he's in cover as well. So he has half cover, which means he gets plus two to his armor class against any of your attack rolls. So if you want to move out of cover to do it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll move out of cover to do it. I'll move out of cover to do it. 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20 will get you about there. 
ASHLEY: Perfect. I can always pop back in. 
TALIESIN: You have advantage on the attacks. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great, so advantage on all three? 
MATT: Let me see the ability again, just to check. 
LAURA: Do you have anything that can make it have disadvantage on dexterity checks? (laughter) 
SAM: Dexterity checks? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Not saves? 
LAURA: Saves, save, saves. 
MATT: This is from the-- Oh, it's from your Crusher, right? 
TALIESIN: I believe so? 
LIAM: (like Captain Picard) Wesley. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm pulling it up. Oh, I actually have Brutal Critical, which I haven't written down, so that would be another d6. 
MATT: I was going to say, critical. You need to do another d6 of damage on that one. 
TALIESIN: But that's okay. 
MATT: No worries, we'll get to it later. But yeah, these are with advantage, then. 
ASHLEY: All three? Okay, great. 
MATT: You can look up where the source of that critical ability is, just so I have that. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm trying to find it. 
ASHLEY: First hit. First hit is 23. 
MATT: 23 hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: No, it's Crusher. "When you score with the critical hit that deals bludgeoning damage to a creature," which I did, "Attack rolls against that creature are made with advantage until the start of your next turn." 
MATT: That's what I thought, that's great. 
ASHLEY: 25. Does that hit? 
MATT: 25 hits, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah. 
MATT: That's awesome. 
ASHLEY: That's cocked. 
TALIESIN: Got to remember the extra d6. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 27. 
MATT: (laughs) All right, so that's three hits, that's 6d6 fire damage. 
ASHLEY: 6d6 fire damage, plus I get my extra d8 because Mister's out. Okay. (disappointed noise) Okay, well. Wow, that's a lot of ones. (counting quietly) 
TALIESIN: Damn it. 
ASHLEY: 15, 18. 
TALIESIN: I got to remember that extra d6. 
MATT: You can roll it, if you want. 
ASHLEY: I don't understand how it works. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Does it get doubled or no, it's just-- 
MATT: No, it's just an extra d6. 
TALIESIN: Add two. 
LAURA: It landed on a seven! 
ASHLEY: I know, but-- (flustered bumbling) I didn't know how to do it. Okay, wait. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: What did I say? Oh yeah, 18, 19, 20. 20 points of damage. 
MATT: 20 points of damage to it, all right. 
SAM: Wow, that's great. 
MATT: All three rays blast on the side of it, lighting up the room even more. You see the body and the mandibles chatter and pull away from its weird, unheard screeching sound, recoiling from the flame, not knowing where the source is as both heads are looking around for what's making the sound or making the motion. That's your action and 20 feet of your movement. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to tuck back in. 
MATT: All right. how much more movement do you have? 
SAM: Tuck in. 
ASHLEY: I have 35 feet, so-- 
MATT: So you can move, that's 10. The space you would go is currently taken by Laudna but you can pull back, which still gives you half cover from it there. 
ASHLEY: Great. All right, Mister is going to shoot some shit. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Goddamn it. 
ASHLEY: Literally. 
LAURA: Literally. 
MATT: Now, the guy, he still has half cover unless Mister wants to move into the room. 
ASHLEY: Mister can move out a little bit and I'll let him go actually a little bit forward. 
MATT: So Mister moves about there. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he can be out there. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: (flames ignite) (monkey chitters) 
LAURA: Get him, Mister! 
ASHLEY: Go get him! 
MATT: (gun cocking) (laughter) 
MARISHA: So insane. 
ASHLEY: That's my big boy! All right. 
LIAM: Doves fly, slow motion. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: He gets advantage, too, yeah? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, all attacks. 
ASHLEY: Okay, amazing. 25 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. Doing a little teefies. 
TRAVIS: Not clownin'. 
ASHLEY: (silly voice) Teefs! 
LIAM: (like Gollum) Teef. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay, seven points of damage. 
MATT: Seven points of damage. All righty, does that finish your turn, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: That's my turn. 
MATT: Chetney, you're up, FCG, you're on deck. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: (Chetney voice) Uh, can I-- (deeply) Can I move towards the (normal voice) other doorway and I'll get underneath the arch and from there I will send-- I will expend the Shatter spell from the scythe. 
MATT: You got it. 
TRAVIS: At him. 
MATT: As you rear back and you swing the scythe upward, you watch the shockwave, like a blade of force power coasts along the ground. Very anime shockwave blast. That cuts and then detonates across the backside of this creature. 
LIAM: Hadouken! 
MATT: Rocks flying everywhere. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's just area of effect, there's nothing to hit, okay. So 4d8. 
MATT: He gets a constitution saving throw? 
TRAVIS: He does. 
MATT: That is going to be a 17. 
TRAVIS: Yes, he makes the save. 4d-- ♪ Ah ah ha, hey ♪ 
LIAM: Hit that bastard with all the status effects. 
TRAVIS: Nine, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18. 18 points of thunder damage. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Looks like it's sitting in a big, creamy poo. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh my god, get away from this thing. 
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I cast Blood Curse of Bloated Agony on him? 
MATT: Yes, you can. Just going to go ahead and consider this now cursed-- 
TALIESIN: I wish I could remember. I used to know what all those were. 
MATT: -- with a blood curse. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to remember. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: That means he has disadvantage on strength and dex checks. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: And if he makes more than one attack, he'll take 1d8 necrotic. That's my turn. 
MATT: Got it. All right, cool. Finishing your go, FCG, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Actually, can I amplify it? 
MATT: Yeah, you can. 
TRAVIS: Two points. Okay. So that's one minute, so it'll last for a minute. But he makes the con save every time. 
MATT: No worries. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
SAM: I think I am in a dangerous situash. 
MATT: (laughs) So-- 
MARISHA: Unnecessary abbreviash. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: I will-- Nobody's around it, right? 
MATT: Just you at the moment. 
SAM: Just me. Okay, I will-- 
LIAM: Letters has got this. 
SAM: -- use another bonus action. If I use the staff, that's not a spell, the staff's casting a spell. 
MATT: It's still considered casting a spell through the staff, so it does count against your spell. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Your one spell per turn. 
SAM: But I want to cast more than one spell per turn. 
MATT: Yeah, I know. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You should be a sorcerer. 
LAURA: That would be really cool. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM and TALIESIN: There's a feat for that. 
LIAM: Got that B-roll. 
SAM: Well, poop then. If I stay here, it will kill me. If I run away, it will swipe at me and kill me. I could use my stuff to get away from it, but then I wouldn't be able to do anything on my turn. This is the conundrum with the Dungeons & the Dragons. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Welcome to cleric life. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It would be good to have you alive. 
SAM: I know, I know. I guess I will use that same thing I just did, Misty Step and I'll bonus action Misty Step away from it. Which direction do you want to go? 
SAM: Just away from other people. It can probably still get to me, but-- I don't know, if we go back in the hallway, we're all bunched up there, that's bad. 
MARISHA: What about that hallway across the way? 
SAM: That if I go that way? 
MATT: All right. So, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. 
LAURA: All by yourself. You can Misty Step there if you want to. 
SAM: Maybe? Yep, sure. 
TALIESIN: Of course. 
MATT: You take 1d4 points of damage from the staff. 
LAURA: It's blind. If you don't make any noise, then-- 
SAM: That's one point of damage. 
TALIESIN: Hey. 
LAURA: It won't even know you're there. 
MARISHA: Not too bad. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's no sound to that. 
MATT: You shift over there and the creature doesn't seem to have followed you. Or at least where its attentive mandibles are. 
TALIESIN: It's having a very bad day, to be fair. 
SAM: But then I can shoot at it, but then it'll know where I am and it won't cause any damage. (laughs) So I guess I'll just use my action to hide. 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: You can buff other people. There are options. 
SAM: I can't, it's all bonus action buffs. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: Let me see here. No, I can't cast a spell either. 
TALIESIN: Oh well, there you go. 
SAM: I'm done, I'll hide. 
TRAVIS: (laughing) I'm done. 
MATT: Roll a stealth check for me. 
SAM: Okay. Ga-ga-ga-ga. Ooh, I get advantage. 16. That's it, 16. 
MATT: 16. So your version of stealth up here is landing and holding as still as you possibly can. 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: Perfect. All right, finishing your go, it is now the caecilian's turn. 
SAM: It only sees movement. 
MATT: Beginning of its turn, it is affected by your Torrent. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: What does it save, dexterity? 
LAURA: Dexterity save. 
MATT: All righty. That is going to be a 25. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: Guess it's a little dextrous. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MATT: Natural 19, sorry. 
LAURA: Wow. So it-- 
ASHLEY: Dang it. 
SAM: Also, when you're near someone. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: So it-- 
SAM: I don't know how. 
LAURA: -- still takes half damage. 
SAM: Gives advantage on you. 
MATT: Indeed. 
LAURA: So-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: What else does that do? 
MARISHA: But you already have advantage-- 
LAURA: Well, it doesn't do shit if he-- 
MATT: Makes the save. Got you. 
LAURA: -- saves. So. So five points of psychic damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Or no, of lightning damage. 
MATT: Gotcha. So the tendrils whip around and it slithers out past. Let's see if it-- It does get it back, okay. It will-- (thick slurping) 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- slither out this way-- 
MARISHA: Ugh. 
MATT: -- for-- 
LAURA: Is it fully out of the-- 
MATT: -- 20 feet of movement. It is not. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Is that magical effect a hazard for everybody? 
MATT: Actually, first-- 
LAURA: Why, yes it is. 
MATT: For everybody, yeah. It's going to slither up. Since you're moved over to that side. 
TRAVIS: Does it fuck you up if you go in, or just if you're in in it? 
LAURA: If you go in, if you enter it, and if you-- 
TALIESIN: I mean, it's been hit a bunch of times since I moved, but yeah. 
MATT: I know. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: But it felt where you moved. It moves forward first to try and move for where you would be, but there's nothing there. 
SAM: Oh! I'm gone! 
MATT: So it keeps shifting over in your direction. So I'm going to go ahead and make two jagged mandible attacks against you which are at disadvantage because of your goading attack. So the first one-- 
LIAM: (like Tony Soprano) This is how we do it in Sicily. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Goddamn it. First one's 16. 
TALIESIN: That misses. I just stay perfectly still. 
MATT: And slashed out and hits the rock behind you. 
MARISHA: He said it wasn't spelled the same, but I spelled it Sicilian. 
SAM: Oh, of course. 
MATT: I get it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I did, too. 
MATT: When I checked the pronunciation, I was like, "Please don't be Sicilian," and it was, and I was like, "(resigned) All right." 
TRAVIS: All right. Fuck my life. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LIAM: Where's the gabagool? 
MATT: That's going to be a 22 on the-- 
TALIESIN: That hits, I'm going to use Erratic Defense. 
MATT: Okay, to? 
SAM: Take the mandible. Leave the cannoli. No, wait. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: One? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use one. So let's see. The attack damage is halved and you have resistance against the attack. In addition, the attacker is pushed 30 feet directly away from you by the force of the attack. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: Towards me! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It'll back into the-- 
TALIESIN: So I'll take my hit. 
LIAM: You just club the massive-- 
MATT: All right, which is-- 
LIAM: -- millipede against the cavern wall. 
MATT: 22 points of slashing damage. 
TALIESIN: Is that before or after reduction? 
MATT: That is before reduction. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: Woof. 
TALIESIN: Reduced to 11 then reduced to five. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: What's with you and millipedes? Oh, you weren't there this morning. 
MATT: Then 13 points of acid damage. 
TALIESIN: Reduced to-- 
TRAVIS: Oh right, every time you hit it-- 
MATT: Reduced to six, reduced to three. 
TALIESIN: So eight points of damage. 
MATT: Yes. Well, you have reduction because of your-- 
TALIESIN: Hmm? 
MATT: Is that reduction part of that from your rage? 
TALIESIN: No, none of that. It's halved and your resistance-- Okay, no it's not, that's not with the-- So it's four points. 
MATT: Well-- 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: No, because you already have resistance against it but it does give you resistance against the acid, so that's good to know. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So, yeah. 
MATT: Then 30 feet away? 
TALIESIN: So that should be-- Yeah, 30 feet directly away from me. 
MATT: It slams into the wall there. 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
LAURA: Is it still in the-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's still in. 
MATT: It is. It has a lot of movement. It's going to shift over this way where all the blasts are, and it's going to-- (sloppy, retching expansion) (groaning) 
MATT: -- and extend its stomach into the tunnel where all the blasts-- 
LIAM: Gross. 
MATT: -- have been coming from on that side. 
MARISHA: Witches! 
MATT: All of you in that room, including Mister. 
LIAM: All the witches are in there. 
TRAVIS: Those bitches be witches! 
MATT: I need you all to make dexterity saving throws for me. 
SAM: Roll for Ashley. 
MARISHA: Does my Mirror Image work against this? 
LAURA: I'm not going to roll for Ashley. 
SAM: I'll roll for Ashley. 
LAURA: No, you don't get to roll for Ashley. 
SAM: I'm going to roll her weird dice that never-- 
LAURA: No, you don't get to roll for Ashley. 
MARISHA: A dexterity saving throw? 
LIAM: Is it a 20? 
LAURA: You don't get to-- Well, it's a 17. (laughter) 
LAURA: Hey! I rolled a 17, too! 
MARISHA: This is going to be bad. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: 10. 
MATT: 36 points of acid damage. 
LIAM: Dang! 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
LIAM: Dang! 
LAURA: 20. 
MATT: You take-- 
SAM: Roll a dexterity save, unless you want to use the 17 that I rolled. 
MATT: 17 points of acid damage. 
ASHLEY: Huh? What? 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Sorry. What do I do? 
SAM: You need to roll. 
ASHLEY: Roll? 
LAURA: Roll a dexterity save. 
ASHLEY: My dex is terrible. 
TRAVIS: Fuck. 
MATT: It was 18, sorry. 18 points of acid damage for you. 
LAURA: 18? What'd you tell me, 17? 
MATT: Yeah. So one more. 
ASHLEY: Eight. 
LIAM: You just went De Niro there. 
MATT: Okay. 36 points of acid damage. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
MATT: Both Laudna and Fearne-- 
LIAM: Jeebus. 
MATT: -- your maximum hit points are reduced by 10 for the time being. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: And both of you, as the stomach extends out-- (thick slurps) 
SAM: Welcome back. 
MATT: -- it pulls you both out of the chamber and into range with it there. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. (crazy laugh) 
MATT: Roll for Mister as well. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Aw, Mister! 
SAM: Mister about to be dead. 
ASHLEY: Mister, Mister, Mister. 
TRAVIS: Who does it follow in the initiative? It follows-- 
LAURA: Letters. 
MATT: FCG. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
TALIESIN: Then Laudna, Imogen. 
TRAVIS: Worm-- 
ASHLEY: Wait, how do I know what his dex is? 
LAURA: Can he hear or does he sense? 
TRAVIS: I think it's, yeah-- 
MARISHA: I think it's hearing. 
SAM: How many hit points does he have? 
TRAVIS: -- movement or hearing. 
ASHLEY: 50. 
TRAVIS: "Tremor." 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: Oh, maybe "Tremor." 
ASHLEY: How do I know his dex? 
MATT: It should be in his stat sheet. It's just whatever his dex modifier is. 
ASHLEY: That's right. I know, I remember that. 
MATT: That's okay. 
ASHLEY: 16. 
MATT: 16 just succeeds, so he takes 18 points of acid damage and is not pulled. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All righty. That's going to finish that turn there. 
TRAVIS: Hot/cold. 
MATT: Laudna, you're up, with Imogen on deck. 
ASHLEY: He's not cold? 
MARISHA: I'm not grappled, right? 
SAM: He's not pulled. 
MARISHA: I can get away? 
MATT: Yeah, not grappled. It just pulled you all towards it. 
MARISHA: Okay, gross. I am going to Blight him. 
MATT: Blight, all righty. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: Constitution save? 
SAM: Blight it up! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Natural one. (cheering) 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Okay. 8d8. 
TALIESIN: That's a lot of d8. 
MARISHA: That's a lot of d8. That's a 10. (panicked searching) 
TRAVIS: Did he make more than one attack on his turn? 
MATT: He did, so he takes-- 
TRAVIS: How many did he do total? Was it two attacks or three? 
MATT: It was two attacks. 
TRAVIS: Okay, so just one. 
SAM: That's great. 
MARISHA: That's great. 
TRAVIS: Seven points of-- 
TALIESIN: Two pierces against me and then the stomach. 
MATT: Extended Stomach is technically a third attack. 
MARISHA: What did you just say? 19? 
MATT: So yeah. 
TRAVIS: 15 points of damage. 
MARISHA: 28... 
MATT: Nice! 
SAM: Now you're up to 31. 
TRAVIS: Necrotic, if it matters. 
SAM: 31. 
MARISHA: Yeah, 31, and then that was six. 
SAM: Two more. So we have two more. 
LAURA: Two more. 
SAM: Damn! 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's great. So wait, that was 31, 39-- 
SAM: 45. 
MARISHA: 45 blight damage. 
MATT: Woo! That's necrotic, right? 
MARISHA: Necrotic. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Is that good or bad? 
TRAVIS: We don't know. 
MATT: Seems to be good. As you reach out and grasp your arm into it, 
MARISHA: I've wrapped-- Since it wrapped its stomach around me, I grip it for a minute and Blight its stomach. 
MATT: You watch as the bright white, colorless, pale extension of its internals that you've grasped go from blanched white to a deep, sickly black-green, like you extend your own essence through into it and as you do, you watch as both the heads pull back and shake, mandibles wide open and immediately withdraws it from the inside before it lands, and you can see the heads looking a bit panicked. 
MARISHA: Then I'm going to-- 
MATT: Does it have to make a save against your spell? 
MARISHA: Yes, wisdom. 
MATT: That is going to be a 12. 
MARISHA: Fail, so he is afraid of me. 
MATT: He is very much frightened and the creature is looking very spooked and very-- You get the sense it's starting to curl up and it's starting to try and find some sort of egress. 
MARISHA: Then, once again, I'm going to slam my hand into the wall and I'm going to quicken a spell and do Chill Touch again. 
MATT: Nice. 
MARISHA: The bone nest from under it, a hand forms out of the bone nest and smashes it in its head. 
MATT: That's cool, roll for an attack. 
MARISHA: 18, very close. 
MATT: Great. You have advantage on this, right? Because of Ashton. 
MARISHA: Ooh, that's right. 
TALIESIN: Still at advantage. 
MARISHA: Just in case I get a nat 20. Oh, nat 20! 
MATT: No shit! (cheering) 
MATT: Just in case, sure. I watched that shit happen in real time. I usually don't have that good of a view of the dice box to watch that shit (rolling). That was awesome. 
MARISHA: That's so funny. I will keep this dice roll because it's good, so that's 20 damage. 
MATT: 20 points of damage. 
MARISHA: 20, 20! 
TRAVIS: -ty! 
MARISHA: Then I still have my Spider Climb up, so I'm going to skitter up on the wall and hang upside down and just panic for a slight second. 
MATT: All righty. So we'll say you're up on the ceiling-ish in this area. 
MARISHA: Yeah, tucked, if I can hide from it a little bit, I guess. 
MATT: Best you can. Oh god. 
MARISHA: Ah! 
TALIESIN: We all-- 
MARISHA: Okay, that's my turn. 
MATT: All righty, finishing your go, Laudna, that puts us at Imogen, and then Orym. 
LAURA: Right as Laudna skitters up, I'm going to step right in where Laudna had been standing. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Put my hands on the side of my head, and shoot forward a lance with such force that all my hair shoots forward and my dress shoots forward, too, as it-- 
MATT: That's awesome. 
ASHLEY: Cool. So yeah, a Psychic Lance (whooshes). 
MATT: It's like three shots from different angles as you quietly scream. 
LAURA: Intelligence saving throw. 
MATT: Intelligence saving throw. This creature: not intelligent! It rolled really high. Natural 17 minus five to a 12. 
LAURA: Nice. 
TALIESIN: Woof. 
LAURA: Wow, minus five. I'm glad I didn't do that other spell, then, I wouldn't have been able to do it. 
TRAVIS: It's a worm. 
MATT: Yeah, it is not an intelligent creature. 
LAURA: Great, so that's 7d6 damage. (cheering) 
LAURA: And it is incapacitated. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: Oh, nice. 
SAM: Oh, really? 
TRAVIS: Oh, what does that mean? Like it's just there? 
SAM: You can't move or take an action. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Big money, big money. 
LIAM: 23. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Eh eh eh ♪ 
LIAM: 23 damage. 
LAURA: 12. 
SAM: Matt said huge. 
MATT: Yeah, it can't move, can't speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. 
SAM: Huge if true. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Oof. 
MARISHA: Unaware of its surroundings. 
LAURA: 25. 
SAM: We could just leave. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we could just move on. 
MATT: Oh, no, sorry, that's unconscious. Sorry, incapacitated. That was a different thing I looked up there. So incapacitated. 
TRAVIS: Isn't that on that DM screen? 
TALIESIN: Can't move, can dance. 
SAM: (laughs) It can only-- 
MATT: It can't take actions or reactions, that's it. So it can still move. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: I looked it up and the first thing was "Unconscious," and I'm like, "No, that's too much." 
TRAVIS: ♪ I can't ♪ So yeah, it just can't take actions or reactions. It can still move. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
TALIESIN: But only away from you. 
SAM: Does that mean that lair actions can't happen? 
MATT: Lair actions are separate from the creature's actual action. 
LAURA: Balls. 
MATT: Technically, it's the lair doing-- 
LIAM: How long does that last? 
SAM: And balls. 
LIAM: Or your turn? 
LAURA: That lasts until the start of my next turn. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Awesome. All right, does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: That's 25 points of psychic damage. 
MATT: 25 points? He's looking rough. All righty. 
LAURA: I will-- It has to move away from her, right? 
MARISHA: It can't move towards me. 
MATT: Can't move closer. 
LAURA: Does that mean it's going to step into the-- Is it already still in the-- 
MATT: It is still within your radius, yes. 
LAURA: Okay, great. 
MATT: It is so large that it has been unable to leave it based on its placement in this room. 
LAURA: Great, then I will-- 
MATT: Oh, did you roll concentration, by the way, from the damage you took? 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: On its turn? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Just to see if it maintains. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm great. 
MATT: Okay, good. 
LAURA: I will quicken a spell, and right afterwards I'm going to hit it with a Mind Sliver as well. 
SAM: Dude. 
MATT: Mind Sliver, the cantrip? 
LAURA: Yes, yes. 
MATT: You got it. He rolled a natural two to resist against your curse, by the way, so it's still there. 
TRAVIS: Oh snap. Okay. 
LAURA: So that's 2d6 if it fails an intelligence saving throw? 
MATT: I'm sure that cantrip will be fine. 
ASHLEY: Oh god, that's so good. 
MATT: That is a negative two. (laughter) 
LAURA: So an additional 2d6. Seven more points of psychic damage. 
MATT: You got it, all righty. Does that finish your turn? 
LAURA: Subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw you make. 
MATT: That's good to know. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MATT: All righty, I'll go ahead and mark that here to be at the ready. All right, that finishes Imogen's go. Are you going to move or stay put? Can't take any reactions, so. 
LAURA: I'll step back, then. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I think that'll be fine. 
MATT: About there, you'll be fine. All right, cool. 
TRAVIS: 1d4 from the next saving throw? That'll probably be mine. 
MATT: Orym, you're up. Ashton, you're on deck. 
TALIESIN: You get advantage. 
LIAM: So I'm going to leap up to the top of that column with my boots. See the thing looks like flailing about, or--? 
MATT: It's flailing and looks like it's getting ready to run. 
TALIESIN: Uh-oh. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: It's weird, you've never seen a massive worm creature look scared, but you can feel its instinctual fight or flight has kicked in and it's leaning more in the flight. 
LIAM: But we don't know where it's going to go, and I don't know that it's been afeared. I'm going to spring on top of it and start stabbing it. 
MATT: All right. Right, so here or here. On it? 
LIAM: On it. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Take the damage. 
LAURA: You'll take acid damage, Orym. 
LIAM: Is it splooging acid out of every pore? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LIAM: Good. 
TRAVIS: Yes, it is pore spoogy. 
LIAM: It's at advantage because of your-- 
ASHLEY: Splooge! 
LIAM: Okay. (laughter) 
LIAM: So, that's a 29. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
TRAVIS: That's a great word. 
LIAM: I'll make it a goading attack so I can-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Splooge. 
LIAM: 10 plus-- 
TRAVIS: Accomplishes a lot in just a few letters. 
LIAM: Oh, that's 15 total. It has to make a wisdom save. 
MATT: Indeed. Which would be-- 
LIAM: 17. 
MATT: Nine minus four, so that is a five. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So, yeah, big failure. 
LIAM: Anyway, I just wanted to get that in there and I will-- 
ASHLEY: Splooge is definitely-- 
LIAM: Do I have enough movement to fall off between it and the wall there? 
MATT: Here you can? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. 
LIAM: Okay. Then I'm going to look for-- 
MATT: That was your one attack, right? 
LIAM: That was one. All right, I'm looking for a vital spot. I'm going to wait until its head whips around, and as soon as I see one of its large circular mouths come, stab right into it. 
MATT: You do take six acid damage because you strike into first blow, and as you carve through, you get splashed with some of its, you're not sure if it's the blood or it's the secretion that surrounds its body, but it burns into your skin as it hits you. 
LIAM: (laughs) That's a 20 to hit? 
MATT: 20 hits. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
LIAM: I'm going to make a pushing attack. 
SAM: Actually, it's 10. 
MATT: Okay. You take nine points of acid damage. 
LIAM: All right. So that's 12. 
TRAVIS: You can choose the end of the road. 
LIAM: That's 18 total damage that time, and it has to make a strength save now versus 17. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Minus a d4. 
MATT: Well, it's for the whole next turn or just until the next one? 
LAURA: Oh, he only did it once, yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, he already did it for the last one. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: So that would be a 21. 
LIAM: Oh, totally. 
ASHLEY: Are you rolling with advantage for your-- 
LIAM: Yes, yes. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Ehh, I'll make him an offer-- 
LIAM: No, I'll Action Surge. 
MARISHA: You come to me-- 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Hold on, let me just make sure-- 
MARISHA: -- in my cave-- 
LIAM: -- I don't lose track. 
MARISHA: -- on the day of my daughter wedding. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Daughter's wedding. One more time, I'm going to make a pushing attack again. So this is at advantage. That's a 26 to hit. 
MATT: 26 definitely hits. You take nine points of acid damage. 
LIAM: Oh. Okay, 11 plus-- Oh, that's 14 points of damage. It has to make that strength save one more time? 
MATT: Indeed. 
TRAVIS: Disadvantage? 
MATT: With disadvantage, right? 
TRAVIS: Bloated Agony? 
MATT: Yeah. Well, that's ability checks, not saves. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, just dex and strength checks, right? 
MATT: Correct. That would put it at 16? 
LIAM: Fails. Pushes him 15 feet into Imogen's mess in the middle. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: Five, 10, 15. 
LIAM: So I'm a little guy, but I stab it right in the middle of that circle of teeth to wound it and get it to draw back. 
MATT: This is what it does. You hit in just a place where this thing has not been making any noise internally. All of its sounds it seems to be emitting are probably beyond your hearing and just borderline yours. This strike is the first time you all hear (screeches) this recoiling, guttural screech as it pulls back and slithers into the central space, spraying some sort of liquid from its body as it does. That damages you, but nobody else in the vicinity. It looks like it's cornered and scared. 
TRAVIS: I can hear it screaming. 
LIAM: I had one more attack, but I'm out of movement? Oh, no, I will cut the wind once. 
MATT: You have one more, right? 
TRAVIS: You will what? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Do that three times, right? 
LIAM: Yeah, three times. This is the last one. 27 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. You do not take acid damage because of the distance. 
LAURA: Yay. 
LIAM: 11 points of damage. 
MATT: 11 points of damage, all righty. 
SAM: Cut the wind! 
MATT: Ashton, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
TALIESIN: I've got a good sight. I got a good look at this. I see where everything's going. I think I can fucking try and give this a nice run. I'm going to do another Chaos Burst attack. I'm going to do another Wormhole Strike. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Reckless? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, just do it. 
TRAVIS: Can't get any further. 
TALIESIN: That's 26 to hit. 
MATT: All righty, that definitely hits. 
TRAVIS: Tax law in the state of Colorado. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's a five. 
LAURA: Fabulous! 
TALIESIN: 21 points of damage. 
MATT: 21 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: Damn, it's still standing. 
MATT: It's looking real hurt. 
TALIESIN: Taking another. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
LAURA: Come on! 
TALIESIN: Going for it again. 
LIAM: Squish it, squish it. 
TALIESIN: That's 23 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Channel your inner... 
TALIESIN: Ah, there we go. 10, 16, 18, 28 points of damage. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a run up, I'm going to swing, and I'm going to actually hop through my own portal and come jumping over it, hitting it on the way back. 
SAM: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Since I get that for killing it, and then right over the damn thing. 
MATT: As you teleport in the opposite side, full momentum rushing towards it, and then wham hit it from behind like a freight train, one of its heads detonates across the far wall as it splatters against the basalt rock. On this end where nobody is, the rock (crumbles) and some of it burns, and the pockmarks you can see barely settling in before it slowly neutralizes. The other head shrieks and it begins to try and pull away, but it bleeds out, and slowly. It begins to escape towards this tunnel where you are, and as it approaches you, it's like (flesh squelches) and its tail twitches and squirrels a bit before it eventually comes to rest. (laughs) 
SAM: You did it, Chetney. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) No problem. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Ashton, that was amazing. 
ASHLEY: That was so-- 
TALIESIN: That was fun. 
LAURA: Where's Pâté? I'm going to strangle him for not seeing that thing. 
MARISHA: Well, he went down the left path. This is the right-- 
TRAVIS: (deeply) It's my fault. I went down this way. 
MATT: Technically, this was the right path. This is the left path, this is the right path, this was the center chamber. He just didn't see it. 
MARISHA: Oh, he didn't see-- 
LAURA: He just didn't see it. 
MARISHA: Then I pull out Pâté and I give him to Imogen. 
MATT: "Oh, what's going on?" 
LAURA: You got to keep your eyes open, buddy. 
MATT: "I don't have eyes." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh. (laughter) 
MATT: "(groans)" (laughter) 
MATT: "(grunts)" 
TRAVIS: You just shook the shit out of Pâté's hair. 
ASHLEY: (groans like Pâté) 
MARISHA: Get in your house. 
MATT: "(surprised grunt)" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (like Pâté) I don't have eyes. 
SAM: Poor Pâté. 
TALIESIN: I poke this thing, just make sure it's still not twitching or anything. 
MATT: You poke it and it twitches. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit it again and again. 
MATT: (splats) 
TALIESIN: Fucker. Yeah, I'll take some damage for that. 
MATT: You do. You take-- 
ASHLEY: Can we go look his nest? 
MATT: You take another 16 points of acid damage. 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. Is it not twitching anymore? 
MATT: It is no longer twitching. 
TALIESIN: God, fucker. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Ah! 
LIAM: I wipe the pus-- 
TALIESIN: It was fucking moving. 
LAURA: Ew. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) I believe you. 
ASHLEY: I'm not a fan of this pus-y sploogy situation. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I don't like it at all. 
LAURA: I'm going to drop the Hungry Torrent, so people can look at the nest. 
SAM: ♪ Hungry ♪ 
MATT: It vanishes. A flash of light, and the slightly torn open portal vanishes. 
MARISHA: That's a new thing you're doing. 
LAURA: Yeah, I really like it. 
TALIESIN: That was very cool. 
ASHLEY: That was really cool. 
LAURA: I was taking inspiration from you a little bit. 
SAM: Yeah, I can see that. 
MARISHA: It was fantastic. I love it. 
LIAM: My face is burning. 
SAM: Oh no, are you okay? 
TALIESIN: No, it doesn't feel good now. 
SAM: Oh, yeah, you need some healing. 
LIAM: I mean, it's like a chemical peel. 
TALIESIN: I mean, we all probably need some healing. 
LAURA: You're going to look so young after this. 
TRAVIS: Is more of that sickly-sweet citrusy smell coming from that direction with the big wolf nose? 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: Or any light or anything like that? 
MATT: It's coming from the creature and this nest area in the room. It's the scent that either it gives off, the pile of refuse that it made into its nest gives off, or the combination of the two. 
TRAVIS: Got it. We know that there's light to the left where Pâté went. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Is there anything in the first 60 feet with darkvision into that right area that looks like it might be-- 
MATT: Are you going to go stealthily? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Make a stealth check for me. 
LIAM: Currently, Daylight's still up, right? 
ASHLEY: His mommy is still there. 
MARISHA: Yeah, she is. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck right off. 
MARISHA: The witches loot the nest. 
MATT: All right, we'll get to that in just a second. 
TRAVIS: 21. 
MATT: Okay. You slowly coil down the right-hand chamber. As you shift down, this one curves downward into the right side for a bit before it evens out. And you hear a noise. A bit like (intensifying whooshes). 
SAM: Wind? 
TRAVIS: Waterfall? 
MATT: You come up to the point where it ends and there's an opening. You look down and you can see that there is a small chasm beneath you where there is a lightless passage where ocean water is flowing beneath the island and filling it in this area. The sound you're hearing is bits of the tide that are pushing through and creating this odd tidal shift within this ocean river that's carved into the subterranean island rock. 
TRAVIS: Awesome. Sweet. If there are no bones, remains, or anything like that to search or signs of life, (chuckles) long-dead life, I'll walk back towards the middle area with everybody else. 
MATT: Okay. So the witches are searching the refuse pile. 
LIAM: (cackles) 
TALIESIN: I'm hoping to make sure that all of the acid meat is out of the way. 
MATT: Okay, so two of you can make an investigation check, or one of you can do it with advantage. Your choice. 
LAURA: Huh? 
LIAM: Who's got good investigation? 
ASHLEY: I have shit investigation. 
MARISHA: Shit investigation? 
LAURA: I am pretty shit. Oh, I have a four. 
MARISHA: I have a minus, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I have a one. 
MARISHA: So we'll give you advantage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Go for it. 
SAM: Guidance! 
LAURA: Guiding me. 
SAM: I'm guiding you. 
LAURA: Guide me, guide me. Oh, I'm going to use this thing. 
SAM: Oof. 
LAURA: Okay, well. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
LAURA: You guided me. 
SAM: You have advantage or no? What did we say? 
MARISHA: Yeah, she has advantage. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Ooh, okay, that's good. 18. 
MATT: 18. 18 was the DC on this. 
LAURA: Bare minimum? Okay, great. 
MATT: So as you search through this area, there is, it looks like, gathered bits of partially crunched and destroyed into pulp, driftwood and tree bark that has been used to create this nest, like it's been swallowed and then exuded to create a wall space around it. There are many, many bones that are clean. You get the sense that whatever this creature devours, anything that's not digested by its enzymes, which seems to be bones, is pushed back out and made to further this nest. You get the sense now, as you look around the rock and everything that's in the ground, most of the floor of this chamber is bone. There's a layer of it, elements of dirt and rock, and the elements have coated it with color and shale. As you pull through, though, you do pick up a couple of things that catch your eye. There are a number of weapons in here, what looks to be some broken longbows of a unique design you're unfamiliar with. What looks to be a longsword, but it is thin with a slight curve to it that comes to a tipped point at a slight angle. There is an odd texture to it, like a Damascus type, you know, acid scar texture to it. There is a ceremonial wrapping to the base, but it looks like the handle has sustained some damage over time. Quick question. The Shatter does thunder damage, right? 
TRAVIS: It does. 
MATT: It does? 
SAM: Did it break something? 
LIAM: Once we I find it-- 
TRAVIS: It'll break items in the area. Or it can hit items in the area. I think it was 18 points of damage? 
MATT: Indeed. All right, so you find one of these blades intact, you find a piece of chest armor of the same material intact, and you find another one of the blades that has been shattered. Not like it's been broken off at an angle or it's sustained a wound, like the vein of strength that holds it through just stopped holding it together and it broke into a hundred pieces. 
TRAVIS: And non-magical objects take the damage. If they're magical in any way, they're-- 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Is anyone here proficient with history? 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: Want to roll for me? 
LAURA: You could just shatter people's clothes off? 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LAURA: (startled yelp) 
SAM: Oh no! 
TALIESIN: Seen it all, I've seen it. 
LAURA: (feigned innocence) Oh my gosh! 
LIAM: Did I get guided? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: My dress just broke into a hundred pieces. 
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: 18. 
MATT: 18! Another baseline you needed. You've heard of this. 
TRAVIS: (mock innocence) Oh! 
LAURA: I feel like I've read that romance novel. 
MATT: You're starting to put the pieces together. You've heard different tales and learned bits of history that were just interesting trivia bits, but now you're starting to be like, oh wait, this all can apply to this experience of where you are. This material is referred to as woe steel. 
LIAM: Whoa. 
MATT: W-O-E. 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
MATT: W-O-E steel. 
LIAM: Yep. 
LAURA: Whoa, steel. 
MATT: It was an alloy metal that was created in the destruction of Domunas. 
MARISHA: Woe. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: It is very rare to find. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: Only within the Shattered Teeth, and it's considered sacred to the Ossended Host, one of the factions that maintains and protects both their culture and a number of the islands within the Shattered Teeth. 
LAURA: Oh great! 
SAM: We've heard that name. 
TRAVIS: They would be grateful to have that returned. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Woe steel, we'll say from a mechanical standpoint acts as a natural plus one weapon. 
LIAM: So not magical? 
MATT: Without magical, it just has plus one to attack and damage. But whenever thunder damage is sustained, it has a 30% chance of breaking. 
LAURA: Oh, it's just prone to thunder damage. 
MARISHA: Interesting. 
TRAVIS: (weak laugh) 
TALIESIN: Big cable to Damascus. 
SAM: Way to go, Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Sorry. 
MATT: You also find the only other thing that hasn't been destroyed by the proximity of the acidic nature of the creature that made this its nest is a unique charm hanging on a broken chain, a palm-sized woe steel cage-- 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: -- affixed to this dangling necklace charm. It encases a smoothed, reddish-brown stone of unknown origin that bears carved language written across its surface in multiple lines. 
LIAM: Is the language familiar to any of us? 
MATT: I don't believe so. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: If you'd like to make another history check. 
LIAM: Yeah, I would. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LIAM: Thank you. We're good, probably. It is 26. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I read a lot. 
MATT: The train of thought that brought you to recall the woe steel also is bringing you to some elements of the Shattered Teeth you'd heard about, read about. It's interesting, this is a part of, not just your training, I mean your schooling growing up, but also a general curiosity about Exandria and the world about you, and you'd forgotten about this. This is referred to as a Raito Charm. 
LIAM: Raito. 
MATT: The Raito Charm is of the Aishio culture here in Kalutha, one of the many communities that make up the Ossended Host across the Shattered Teeth. 
TRAVIS: What was the name of the Raito Charm? 
MATT: Raito Charm, R-A-I-T-O. It's the Aishio culture, A-I-S-H-I-O. 
TRAVIS: Boy, I just-- I can't do those. 
LAURA: I-- What? 
MARISHA: Aish-- Aish-- 
MATT: A-I-S-H-I-O. 
LAURA: I-O. Aishio. 
TRAVIS: Got you, thank you. 
MATT: Aishio culture. 
LIAM: Letters, what do you make of this? 
SAM: Do you want me to Identify it? I might need a short rest to do that. 
TALIESIN: I'm happy to take a short rest if anyone-- I'm a little exhausted. 
SAM: Well, I can-- 
MARISHA: Why don't we get out of this cave? 
TALIESIN: Well yeah, we'll get some fresh air in a second. 
TRAVIS: If we bear to the right, it's just a nice gradual drop. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, none of you understand the language that's scrawled on there. 
LIAM: All right. Yeah, I was thinking maybe with their lens. Maybe we should rest here, because things know not to come in here. 
LAURA: This does seem like a safe place now that this creature's-- 
TRAVIS: As long as the pustules don't pop anymore. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Are there pus buckets up on the roof still? 
MATT: You see a handful that are up there, but they don't seem to be reacting to your presence. 
TRAVIS: Yet. 
LAURA: Maybe they go off with vibration or sound. 
TRAVIS: (howls) Did anything happen? 
MATT: Nothing. 
TRAVIS: That's not a knock against the sound or the force with which I howled, it's just that we've killed this host. All right, fuck it. Let's rest. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right, so you're going to take a short rest here. 
LIAM: Short rest. 
SAM: Thank god. 
TALIESIN: Short rest. 
MARISHA: Are we able to-- Our docked temporary. 
SAM: Oh yeah, our temporary hit point things, maximum-- 
MARISHA: Are just docked until a long rest? 
MATT: Until your long rest. 
SAM: Ooh boy. 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
MATT: Except for the five that you lost with the captain, those are permanent. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, except for me. I made a bit of a boo-boo. 
MATT: But the 10 you've lost if you lost them during that battle from its extend stomach ability, those you get back at a long rest. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah. 
MARISHA: So should we gather up some of the steel then? 
LIAM: The woe steel, yeah. 
MARISHA: Take the woe steel, and I replenish my collection of bones. 
MATT: Plenty to pull from. 
MARISHA: Great. 
MATT: All manner of creatures, some humanoid, some non. Beasts. Roll a nature check for me. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: I'll assist you. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Hunter's Bane off. 
MARISHA: 13, not great. 
MATT: 13. 
MARISHA: Average. 
MATT: A lot of odd bone shapes and sizes around here. You can't pick out a lot from them. Some of them, some of the skull pieces with large tusks look hog-like, but large. A hog with this skull would probably be about eight to 10 feet end to end, unless its head is massive and the rest of it's body is tiny. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: There are other bones of other creatures you can identify that are also large and many small ones as well. This is a collection of whatever was either hunted or unfortunately found its way in here by accident. 
ASHLEY: Did you say that the five points from the worm that we got, that goes away. 
MATT: At a long rest, yeah. 
ASHLEY: At a long rest. That's right, that's right. I did hear you say that, sorry. 
SAM: Can I attune during this short rest? 
MATT: Yeah, for a short rest you can, yeah. 
SAM: Okay, I'll attune to the lens and I'll Identify that thing. 
MATT: Okay. This indeed is a Raito Charm. The Raito Charm, they are relics of deep personal importance to the Aishio people. Let me see what the spell tells you real fast.
LAURA: It's not magical? 
TALIESIN: I'm down a lot of hit points still. 
SAM: (yelling) (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. It is magical, but it doesn't identify all the details of its history and its purpose. You just know that it's important to these people. It seems to have protective magics about it. There is an abjuration quality to it, and it definitely-- The script on it holds importance to its purpose. 
TRAVIS: Hmm. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Abjuration meaning like a protective ward? 
MATT: Protective ward magic. 
LAURA: We should get it back to them. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. Well, we're rested. 
TRAVIS: I guess they didn't make their swords very strong. 
LAURA: We should make our way-- 
LIAM: Well, we've got bones. 
MARISHA: They're so old. 
LAURA: ♪ To the surface ♪ 
MARISHA: To the surface. 
MATT: I guess one thing you would know from that, technically, is it's not attunable by you or anyone. It is designed for a particular person. 
SAM: One person in particular. All right. 
LAURA: Interesting. 
TRAVIS: Could I use my Grim Psychometry-- 
MATT: You certainly can. 
TRAVIS: -- feature here? Standing in the nest, and maybe even coming over and looking at FCG holding that and see what I can tune into. 
MATT: Yeah, roll and add either your intelligence or wisdom modifier based on the build that you chose. Your spells intelligence based? 
TRAVIS: Let me take a look. 
MATT: Your hemocraft is-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Grim Psychometry is a history check recalling history. 
MATT: Right, history. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, history. 
MATT: So roll history for me. 
TRAVIS: Okay. It says I have advantage when it's Grim Psychometry, so. Oh! 16 plus three, 19. 
MATT: 19, okay. As you reach over and take it gingerly from FCG's hands and focus on it, you feel this warm rush of blood up the back of your neck into your head. Then you have this sudden headache that causes your eyes to blink and as you do, your vision goes red. Then that red vision, when you open your eyes once more, you see an older man in his 50s or so, long salt and pepper hair that's pulled into a very, very tight, large ball of a bun in the back of the head that has ribbons dangling from it with beads and other decorations that dangle from it. You see a heavy cloak that he wears that looks like it has textured moss, or at least moss-like texture on it to blend in with the surrounding jungles of greens and yellows and oranges. You see him with this very charm around his neck, the chain affixing it there and it looks like he's leading a hunting party. You see him quietly motioning for a few other compatriots to follow and then one of them vanishes. He goes over to witness where they are and it looks like there is an opening in the ground that they hadn't noticed. He goes in to investigate, and in that shadow, in that darkness, he goes to light a torch. As the flame ignites, he looks up into the glistening, snatching mandibles of a familiar beast as it immediately wraps around him and in that scuffle, the flames snuff, his scream silent as his existence falls to shadow. 
TRAVIS: Got it. (gasps for breath) 
SAM: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: You're awake, alive. Shit. 
TRAVIS: This was a personal effect of someone that was here before. 
MARISHA: How old do you think it is? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. These visions I'm granted, I'm not privy to when in time. Only that the gift is a singular one that I treasure. 
LIAM: Are you about to planes walk? 
TRAVIS: What? Not again, I am still on my sabbatical. 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
LAURA: So we should find who these relics belong to. 
TRAVIS: Yes, we should take the pieces of the metal. 
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it, and let's get up to the surface. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm sick of this dark-ass stanky cave. 
TALIESIN: Let's have some fresh air. 
MARISHA: Stanky. 
TRAVIS: I trip Imogen and shove her in the slime. 
LAURA: No! 
SAM: Gross. 
LAURA: Prestidigitation. Stop it. 
ASHLEY: (shudders) 
MATT: All right. As you all step up on the left path, previously watched and confirmed to be the seemingly safe one. 
TRAVIS: Fucking Pâté. 
MATT: You eventually watch as the daylight breaks through and you emerge from the depths of that seaside cavern to the lush jungle edge that encompasses the creeping valley of Kalutha. You can see what you had once seen through his vision, the sprawling, tethered jungle of vibrant greens and verdant, pale yellows, oranges, this patchwork of unique jungle colors, broken up by these massive pillars of basalt rock that defy necessary unified path. You can see some that seem to stretch on for hundreds and hundreds of feet through the air, gradually curving over into numerous archways that give almost a broken bridge-like arena around the entirety of this jungle. The mist is not as strong here, when it's further away from the sea, but it still grows thick towards the center of this jungle to where you can see the hills rise and fall. The further away it gets from you, you can see the shadow of the three massive mountaintops that mark the center of this island many miles away, what bit of that dark, looming shape that resides there. You're not quite sure how far it is to get there, the perspective challenging at this distance, but you do recall being told that somewhere near the base of those mountains lies a tree and with that tree lies answers. And that's where we'll end tonight's episode. (groaning and cheering) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Dang, it's the best. 
TRAVIS: Thank you, dread pirate Novos! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Thanks for all the ghost fucking. 
LIAM: Yeah, give it up to Fearne Calloway for seducing a dead pirate. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! Woo! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! MVP! 
ASHLEY: Just a little warmth, you know-- 
MATT: Not at all the direction I was expecting for that. 
ASHLEY: -- goes a long way. Little warmth. 
LIAM: This story is very hex positive. (laughter) 
MATT: So happy to finally get to the Shattered Teeth with you all for a bit. 
TALIESIN: So excited. 
ASHLEY: So cool! 
MATT: All right, we'll pick up there next week and see where it takes us. Thank you all so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)
