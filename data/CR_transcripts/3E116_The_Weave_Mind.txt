MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. (garbled nonsense) 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
MATT: That one. Thank you for joining us. Before we jump into our episode tonight, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with tonight's sponsor, which is Tales of Fablecraft. Sam, care to talk about it? 
SAM: Happy to, Matt. Tales of Fablecraft is a free-to-play virtual tabletop RPG that's easy to learn, a breeze to run, and gosh darn beautiful. The perfect TTRPG on-ramp, Fablecrap-- Fablecraft, not crap. (laughter) Fablecraft is on Steam, it just launched on iPad, and it's coming soon to Android tablets and will be available on mobile next year. And there's more! Um. Uh. 
ASHLEY: (sinister) What's the matter, Sam? Can you not remember what's next? 
SAM: No, no, it's just the prompter's glitching and I just can't seem to find the right page of the script. 
MARISHA: Everyone's watching you, Sam. (dramatic bass note) 
MARISHA: The entire audience is judging you. 
SAM: What? No. 
LIAM: (distorted whispering) And you're blowing it. Embarrassing yourself in front of thousands of people. 
SAM: What? No. 
ALL (except Sam): (ominous laughter) 
SAM: (screams) (gasps) (panting) Oh, thank god. It was all a dream. Woo. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: Quois? Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas? 
SAM: Wait, what? Well, I was having this nightmare where I was doing an ad for Tales of Fablecraft and-- Oh, sorry, what did you say? 
ASHLEY: Hmm? 
LAURA: Finis la publicité, imbécile! Rapidement! Allez! (dramatic bass note) 
SAM: I'm sorry, I don't speak French. W-w-what's going on? 
TRAVIS: Ton visage resemble à un chien galeux! Espèce d'Américain stupide! Hohoho! 
ALL (except Sam): (ominous French laughter) 
SAM: No! No! (gasps) (panting) Ah, whew, it was just another dream. (dramatic bass note) 
MATT: (in chorus) This isn't a dream, Sam. You're in hell. 
SAM: No, no! No! (gasps) (panting) Oh my god, you're all here. 
TALIESIN: Of course we are, buddy. 
SAM: And this isn't a dream, right? 
ASHLEY: Of course not, silly.

LAURA: Wow, okay, okay, okay. It's just so beautiful. 
TALIESIN: It's really pretty. 
ASHLEY: That was a weird one. 
LAURA: That was. That was-- 
ASHLEY: I liked it. 
MATT: That was the weird one. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (French noises) 
TALIESIN: Getting a little meta. 
MARISHA: Not as weird as when you were a baby. Still pretty weird. 
MATT: L'enfant terrible. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: C'est magnifique! 
ASHLEY: Enfant terrible.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off-- 
LAURA: (whimpers) 
MATT: -- the Mighty Nein after trekking alongside Bells Hells to the Red Moon Ruidus, keeping low within the core of the city Kreviris until they were notified that the assault in Malleus Key had commenced. They were likely in the best position to separate and tackle their two separate goals. The Mighty Nein set off with the Volition, waiting for a detonation on the outskirts of the Prime Pillar citadel, known as the Arx Creonum. With a massive explosion, a portion of the outside of this stronghold was destroyed and left exposed. You trudged up these cables that were fired upon it and then some of you fell from them. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Like we weren't supposed to. 
MATT: But managed to salvage-- 
TRAVIS: We're fucked. 
MATT: -- the arrival. 
TALIESIN: Gears of the realm. 
LIAM: Nearly all. 
MATT: Battle along the outskirts-- 
TRAVIS: There is hope for survival. 
MATT: -- of the exposed portion of the citadel. The exterior battlements, where numerous Reiloran guardians were defending the arriving attackers and yourselves as well, defeating a number of them and managing to dart into the exposed interior, among one of the many broken floor openings to the core of this stronghold. You began to sprint down one of these long marble hallways with the sound of Gaz Tomo covering your rear, charging towards where you think the Weave Mind might be hiding within. So Mighty Nein, as the seven of you are heading into the depths of the Arx Creonum, what would you like to do? 
SAM: (panting) What do we do? (laughter) 
MARISHA: You tried to kill me, you bitch. 
SAM: I wouldn't kill you. You're so powerful. It would've just stunned you for a while. 
ASHLEY: What the fuck? 
MARISHA: You were trying to shoot-- 
ASHLEY: What did you do that for? 
MARISHA: -- Yasha. 
SAM: What? 
ASHLEY: What is this going to help our situation at all? 
SAM: It would embolden me by making me feel like I did better and I won. 
LAURA: Hey, new rule. Let's not try to kill each other while we're fighting all of these bad stuff, okay? 
ASHLEY: Thank you, Jester. 
SAM: If that rule was in effect before, I would've followed it, but it was just put into effect right now. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh okay. 100 gold, says I kill-- 
LAURA: No. 
MARISHA: -- more-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: -- Weave Mind people than you do. 
SAM: Body count? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: All right. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
SAM: 100 gold? 
MARISHA: 100 gold. 
SAM: Let's go. Let's go. 
LIAM: Is anyone coming to kill us right now? 
TALIESIN: I mean-- 
LAURA: It's weird. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LIAM: All right. 1d20, I feel naked. 
TRAVIS: Stats. 
LIAM: Oh, it's terrible. Miss you, Orym. It's 14. 
MATT: 14. You hear the sounds of echoing footfalls throughout distance hallways. You're uncertain to figure out at the moment if they're getting closer, further away. You also hear the sounds of shouts, the impacts and crumbling of stone, and the occasional shaking of the Arx Creonum. The chaos right now is so fresh that you're unable to really ascertain any specific details. But you do know that there are other figures moving throughout these halls ahead and beyond. 
LIAM: So we just need to find five individuals inside of a massive complex that is many levels high. Maybe we start by moving inward. 
MARISHA: I mean, yeah. 
LAURA: Just keep moving towards the center, right? They're at the middle? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's a start. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. So the seven of you trudge inwards, still under the effect of Seeming, if I recall-- 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: That lasts for-- 
LAURA: Are we? Oh yeah, because you could-- 
LAURA: Let me see. 
LAURA: -- drop it if you wanted it. 
MATT: Seeming lasts for eight hours, and you were diminishing it and then, 
LIAM: But is it concentration? 
MATT: It is not. It is just eight hours that it lasts. 
LAURA: That's amazing. 
SAM: Anyone got a-- 
LIAM: Wow. 
SAM: -- healing potion or anything I could use? 
LIAM: So, did I look like a Reiloran flying around the sky when I was an eagle? 
MATT: When you're transformed to eagle form, I'll say you're an eagle with a little Reiloran head. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Or not. That's fine. 
MARISHA: Like a physics glitch, a floating Reiloran. 
LAURA: Just to make it stupider. 
LIAM: A red-- Like a-- 
LAURA: Just like you were a beetle. A mini Reiloran beetle Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, with a Caduceus face. 
LIAM: I was a red pterodactyl-ish. 
MATT: Yeah, Seeming doesn't change your form size, but if your form changes, just parts of you then remain. 
LAURA: Wow. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. Not very convincing for some, I guess. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Weird ragdoll physics. 
MATT: But you are a group of clustered Reiloran adorned in the ways of a standard Reiloran that you've encountered, as well as some of the other denizens that you've met or seen upon arrival on the exterior of Kreviris. Charging down this hallway, you see it begins to separate into a T intersection that continues onward. It looks like a staircase that arcs out of view into the right and left. The hallways turn and curve outward, a slight curvature. You can hear from the front and from the right-hand side, sounds of shouting as well as impact and people moving quickly. 
LIAM: So front means upstairs, and also down one passage of the T? 
MATT: Correct. Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: Let's keep moving forward. I'm sure there's a lot of fights happening in corridors through here. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Can we hear-- 
SAM: Then left? 
TALIESIN: -- what kind of movement is happening? Is it people-- 
LAURA: Is it dead end? 
LIAM: Where the T and are-- 
TALIESIN: -- panicking or-- 
LIAM: -- arching left. 
TALIESIN: -- or less panicking? 
LAURA: Arch up. 
LIAM: Forward and up. 
MARISHA: Arch up. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: I thought we're supposed to be going down. 
LAURA: Are we? 
SAM: Isn't it down? 
LAURA: You have a Keen Mind, Caleb, which way were we going, up or down? 
TALIESIN: 27. 
MATT: 27. 
ASHLEY: Wait, I feel like Bells hells are going down. 
TALIESIN: I'm back. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Wait, we're not Bells Hells? (laughter) 
MATT: Best that you could ascertain based on discussions you had with the Volition. None of their figures have been truly to the center of the Arx Creonum. The Pentathrone, the location of where the Weave Mind does the majority of their business remotely. 
SAM: That's what I want to see. 
MATT: The best you know it's probably towards the core of the actual Arx Creonum itself. You entered on the bottom side of it. After the detonation caused a big portion collapsed, you had arrived where you were least visible upon approach, and then climbed up into it. So you're likely towards the bottom area of the-- 
LAURA: Yeah, we should go up. 
LIAM: Would you say that with Keen Mind, who knows what north is on Ruidus, but if Caleb is oriented to going straight into this column that he would then be able to track direction-- 
MATT: I'd say with Keen Mind-- 
LIAM: -- off of the entrance? 
MATT: -- yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. Okay. 
MATT: And you rolled a 27. It sounds like to the right, the shouts are from guttural voices, the shouts are from guttural voices, non-Reiloran, not sounds of combat, more discussion. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Up above, you hear what sounds like conflict. 
TALIESIN: Interesting. 
LAURA: That means our soldiers are up there, right? 
TALIESIN: That means that there's fighting up there and plotting down here. We may want to maybe block our way up so that whoever's actually not panicking doesn't decide to head up and see what's happening. 
LIAM: If we can help but not let ourselves get drawn into any further-- 
MARISHA: Correct. 
LIAM: -- conflict ourselves until we get to the Big Bubba. 
TALIESIN: Your call. 
SAM: Caduceus as our group's only cleric, can you pump a quick-- 
LAURA: Yeah, do you have any-- 
SAM: -- 1st-level 
LAURA: -- healing with you? 
SAM: -- healing into me or something? 
TALIESIN: How bad are you? 
SAM: Just a little. 
LAURA: I think the whole group is probably hurting some from that. 
SAM: Is that true? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. All right. 
MARISHA: Eh. 
LIAM: I'm okay-ish. 
TALIESIN: Is everyone just-- 
MARISHA: I'm down-- 
TALIESIN: -- a little bit? 
MARISHA: -- about 20 points. 
LAURA: I'm down about 50 points. 
SAM: Whew. 
TALIESIN: Do we have a second or-- 
LAURA: How much is a second? 
MATT: That's up to you. 
TALIESIN: I could do 10 minutes or I could do really quick. 
MARISHA: We don't have 10 minutes. 
LAURA: Oh, like a Prayer of Healing? 
TALIESIN: All right. So we'll do really quick. I'm trying to remember. Here we go. 
LIAM: To be fair, you are our tank, so-- 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
SAM: Wait, what's Yasha then? 
LIAM: Our other tank. 
MARISHA: Our babe. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Our babe. 
SAM: What's Beau? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm finding it. 
LIAM: Not the tank. 
TRAVIS: An asshole. 
LAURA: (gasps) She's so tough. 
MARISHA: Hey. I mean, I'll take it. 
LAURA: Beau's super tough. 
MARISHA: Actually, that's really good. 
LAURA: How many hit points do you have? 
MARISHA: 200. Like my max? 
SAM: Jesus. 
LAURA: She's way more of a tank than me. 
SAM: Jesus. 
MARISHA: My max is 199. 
LAURA: Whoa. Oh. 
MARISHA: My current is 180 
LIAM: Did you take tough at one point? 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to do a Mass Healing Word really quick. 
LIAM: That's just 20 levels of monk? 
MARISHA: I think it's just 20 levels of-- 
LIAM: Sweet. 
MARISHA: -- me being a badass. Yeah, I don't have tough. 
TALIESIN: It's not much, but it'll put a little bit-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: In fact it's-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ I don't have much ♪ 
TALIESIN: -- not much at all. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: ♪ I don't have much ♪ Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
TALIESIN: Wait. Wait. 
LAURA: Wait. Wait. 
MATT: Wait. 
LAURA: Before you do it. 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
TRAVIS: The walk sign is on. (chuckling) 
LAURA: No, don't. Okay. 
MATT: (Don't Walk alarm) 
LAURA: I was thinking, what was that one that we had that can make any healing you do, does full healing? What spell is that? I know it. (laughter) 
SAM: That would be a feature, wouldn't it? 
LAURA: No, no, no. It's a spell. 
SAM: A spell that you have to cast with another spell? 
LAURA: Like you, it's an aura spell. 
MATT: Aura of Vitality? 
TALIESIN: Aura of Vitality. 
LAURA: Aura of Vitality. 
SAM: No, that's just one-- 
MATT: No, no. 
SAM: -- we can just keep on doing heals every round. 
MATT: No, it's Aura of-- 
TALIESIN: That one's very mild. 
LAURA: I didn't take it. It doesn't matter. I don't have it. 
MATT: No, hold on. 
TALIESIN: I can do it. That's why I usually save, is because if you're at zero or I'm unconscious, I don't have to roll you-- 
LAURA: No, it's not-- 
TALIESIN: -- instead of max. 
LAURA: -- a fucking feature. It's a spell. That anybody around you-- It's Holy Aura or something. 
ASHLEY: Oh, it might be Holy Aura. 
LAURA: No. Holy Aura is a high-level one. This is a lower-level one. 
ASHLEY: Aura of Life? 
LAURA: Aura of Life maybe. 
MATT: It's not Aura of Life. 
LIAM: This is just our whole table in a little Shriner's car-- 
TALIESIN: I know. 
LIAM: -- driving in a circle. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Also-- 
LAURA: But you know what I'm talking about. 
MARISHA: -- all these spells-- 
LAURA: It doesn't matter. 
MARISHA: -- sound the same. Holy Aura, Aura of Life, Vitality of Aura. 
SAM: I have one called Aura of Aura. 
TRAVIS: Aura of the Ouroboros? (laughter) 
LIAM: Only so many words in the thesaurus. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I don't make fun of the things you say when you're doing your thing. You know, I've written down what I can. I'm not-- 
LAURA: Okay. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: This is not my forte. 
SAM: Flurry of blows! 
TRAVIS: What's her thing? 
TALIESIN: Find us a bard. 
MARISHA: I let these do the talking. (smacking) 
TRAVIS: Okay. That's absurd. 
TALIESIN: You got five. Yeah. 
SAM: Oh no! He's doing something. 
MATT: There's an exterior, smaller detonation, either an additional assault or something-- 
LAURA: We got to keep going. 
MATT: -- a delayed detonation-- 
TALIESIN: Eight points. 
MATT: -- that causes the stronghold to shake, and for just a moment more, you could have a bit of a shock wave in dust, (air whooshing) push through the hall. Getting in your eyes for a minute before that settles. 
MARISHA: Eight points. 
LIAM: That was eight for all of us? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LIAM: All right. Thank you. 
TRAVIS: Cool! 
LIAM: Thank you, Cady. 
TRAVIS: Thank you, Ducey. 
ASHLEY: Eight to pass out between everybody? 
SAM: No. 
TALIESIN: Oh no, eight each. One, two three-- 
MARISHA: One for you-- 
LAURA: One for you and one for you. 
LIAM: Level 20 is amazing. 
TALIESIN: Werther's? Pfft. Anyway. 
MATT: Okay, so-- 
TALIESIN: Call back. 
MATT: -- who is helming the search through these tunnels towards where they think the Weave Mind might be and how are you planning to do so? 
TALIESIN: I'll help with that. 
LAURA: That's right, you've got good investigation. 
SAM: I have a very good investigation. 
MARISHA: I palm Veth's head out of the way-- 
SAM: Mine's better than yours! 
MARISHA: -- and then take-- Then go ahead. (laughter) Well, then work with me. Just keep up. Your stubby little legs. 
SAM: Oh really? That's what we're doing, personal insults? (laughter) You can comment on my character but not on my looks. Jester, hold me. (whimpers) 
LAURA: It's okay, Veth. 
MARISHA: All right-- 
LAURA: That's okay. 
MARISHA: -- your character then. 
SAM: That twiggy bitch called me stubby! (laughter) 
LAURA: Go help her out. It'll make your relationship-- 
MARISHA: Come on. 
SAM: All right. 
LAURA: -- stronger. 
SAM: Let's investigate. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Take out my pickle jar. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Goddamn pickle jar. Damn it! Where's Tasha? (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so, you can either both roll investigation or one of you can roll with advantage, your call. 
SAM: I'm rolling. 
MARISHA: I'm rolling, too. 
MATT: All right. Both of you roll. 
SAM: Let's see who wins. 100 gold. 
MARISHA: 100 gold! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Ugh. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: Total of? 
SAM: I think I get-- 
LIAM: It's going to be close. 
TRAVIS: Total of not good. 
SAM: I get that thing where I can just take a 10 on anything? 
MATT: You can, yeah. 
SAM: And so, 25. 
MARISHA: Uh, 15. 
MATT: 15. 
MARISHA: I rolled bad. 
MATT: You did. 
LAURA: Womp womp. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: There's an art to justice, but it can be done by luck alone. (laughter) 
SAM: My stubby fingers are waiting. (laughter) 
MARISHA: After. After. 
SAM: Oh okay, I'll keep tally. 
MARISHA: Yeah, well, keep a fucking tally. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye-- 
LIAM: There will be nothing to spend it on if we don't-- 
TALIESIN: -- round our backs. 
LIAM: -- do this correctly. 
TALIESIN: With perception to make sure we're not going to get surprised. 
MATT: Understood. 
TALIESIN: Thanks. 
MATT: Heading up the northern, I'd say, or the front pathway and up the staircase, it rounds twice and keeping an eye out here, Veth, with some help from your scrawny companion here, as you put it. 
MARISHA: Scrawny companion. 
MATT: (laughs) You keep an eye of two things. One, the pattern of architecture. There are areas where things look smoother and designed for function over aesthetic. You can see some places where the pillars, the lined decorative pillars, seem to be a little more dense and the presence of Ruidian glass veins are more cultivated and carved into the decor. Utilizing that pattern, you get the feel that that likely leads towards something of importance. 
SAM: So we follow the veins to the base. 
MATT: Oh yeah, you're following where they seem the most cultivated, carved, and most dense. 
MARISHA: Of course you would. 
LIAM: How do you it with Yezza? 
SAM: (chuckles) 
MATT: As you get up to a secondary floor, you immediately hear probably a dozen or so footfalls. And you watch as a group of armored Reiloran guardians, Arx Creonum guardians go rushing by a massive juggernaut looming behind them. All wearing long robes with gold filigree that marks the outside of their mantles and armor. They look like they're more interior guardians, ones that probably are stationed closer to more important things within the stronghold. As you all head to the top most of them rush by, and one of them turns towards you and looks for-- Who here in their illusion has visually the most station? 
LIAM: The most station? 
LAURA: Oh, that was Caleb. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Because he could speak in his mind. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. The one that's working, you see two of these Reiloran guardians stay behind the rest of the group as they rush past with the one juggernaut behind and turns to you and looks towards you and in your mind you hear, with a bit of a curiosity that makes you immediately nervous. That sweat begins to bead at the back of your neck. "You, where do you head? We need bodies." 
LIAM: We are beset on all sides. We are here to lend our aid. Protect. 
MATT: "Then come with us to the front." Make a deception check for me. 
LIAM: Ooh. Okay, okay, okay, okay. 20. 
MATT: 20. 
LIAM: Dirty 20. 
SAM: Dirty 20. 
MATT: It glances towards you, gives a nod, and then continues off in the direction where the rest of the group went, expectantly looking over its shoulder for the rest of you to follow, which is away from the direction you're supposed to be going. 
LAURA: I run in place. 
TRAVIS: (stabbing) (laughter) 
LAURA: Backwards. (laughter) 
SAM: You're so fast. You're so fast. 
MATT: You know what? I would like a group deception check as you all attempt to moonwalk your way out of this moment. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Group deception. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow! 
MARISHA: Jeez. Oh no, weird. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
ASHLEY: Deception check? 
MARISHA: Oh wait, I have advantage. 
LAURA: I have advantage on deception checks. 
MARISHA: That's much better. 
LAURA: I don't. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: Okay. Over here? 
TRAVIS: 28. 
MATT: 28. 
MARISHA: 24. 
MATT: 24. 
MARISHA: 23. 
MATT: 23. 
MARISHA: 23. 
MATT: Caleb? 
LIAM: You want one different than the 20? 
MATT: This is different from convincing them that you're okay. This is a deception check for you all to run backwards. 
LAURA: Oh no. Oh no. 
MATT: Oh, two. All right. 
SAM: 14. 
LIAM: It was a 24. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. Oh no. 
SAM: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: 17. How is this possible? 
LAURA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Five. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh no! (laughter) 
LAURA: It didn't work. 
ASHLEY: That helps, right? 
MATT: So as you guys begin to run backwards, you see-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- the juggernaut and the two straggling guardians, the one that that looked towards Caleb and spoke with you, are running past. They get about 30 feet down the hallway before the one stops and turns and sees you all kind of-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Whoa! What is happening? 
MATT: Cocks his head strangely, and then does a hand motion and points. The secondary Reiloran and the juggernaut, three of them turn, and they all come at a full sprint at all of you. What are you doing? 
MARISHA: Ah! 
LAURA: Should we turn and book it? 
SAM: No, they're going to follow us. 
LAURA: Will they? 
SAM: We have to kill them. 
LAURA: (groans) 
TALIESIN: Unless we-- 
MARISHA: How many are there? 
MATT: Three. There's one juggernaut and two regular Reilorans. 
LIAM: We're in an enclosed hallway with these things? 
MATT: Yeah, it's about 15, 20 feet from end to end. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Stone marble pillars around. 
LIAM: No windows, no doors except from where we came from. 
MATT: No windows and no doors. Correct. 
TALIESIN: She offers you a [inaudible] challenge. 
LAURA: How long does it stay in form? 
SAM: Should I try to Charm them? Charm them? 
MATT: As you guys are running backward and they're coming at you this direction, you're heading backwards down the hallway. You're backing into a T-intersection where another hall leads into an upper staircase that continues further up into the stronghold. You're now backing up into that intersection as they're starting to gain on you. What are you doing? 
MARISHA: Siphoning us out. 
SAM: I will-- 
LAURA: Um. 
SAM: Oh? 
LAURA: No, go. 
TRAVIS: (sneezes) 
MATT: Gesundheit. 
SAM: I will-- Fuck. -- take out a stick of incense and make a distinct pattern on my hand and I will cast Hypnotic Pattern. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That's good. That's good. 
MATT: You are filling the hallway ahead of them? 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: All righty. Let's see. What is the DC on that? 
SAM: 17 wisdom. 
MATT: 17 wisdom. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, the juggernaut. (heavy, rapid footfalls) It is running faster than the other two and it's coming at you like a steaming freight train. (heavy, rapid footfalls) Before it stops suddenly. Its dark, shark-like eyes go wide and blink and it stands there in place, reaching for something that's not there. One of the other ones looks confused and rushes up and then looks up, too, and stops and halts and grabs its shoulder and starts reaching out as well. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: The third one looks confused. 
SAM: They're floating buttons, shiny buttons. 
MATT: Shiny little buttons going around. The third one sees them doing this and is like: What the hell? Smacks the shoulder of the one to the left and is looking towards you and is going to come towards you. So one of them was unaffected. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: You see it's drawing this glass dagger out of his hand. 
SAM: Someone help me! 
TALIESIN: How wide is the hallway? 
MATT: About 20-ish feet. 
TALIESIN: So, is the big guy blocking everybody or-- 
MATT: He's not that wide. 
TALIESIN: He's not that wide? 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to use Command on the guy who's getting past. 
MATT: Okay. What are you commanding him to do? 
TALIESIN: Trip. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: However. 
MATT: That's going to be a failure on his wisdom save. So he (thuds) falls over onto the ground while the other two stand there. So he has now tripped for a round. 
TALIESIN: He didn't go down the stairs. Damn. 
MATT: No, this is a hallway. 
TALIESIN: Oh, it's a hallway? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm really quickly going to-- 
LAURA: We're going upstairs. 
TALIESIN: He's got a weapon or something? 
MATT: Yeah, he's pulling out a glass dagger. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Do we have time to grab the-- 
SAM: We have one round. 
LAURA: We have one round. 
SAM: That was your action. 
TALIESIN: That was mine. 
LAURA: That was your action. 
TALIESIN: Grab the dagger and knock him out. 
SAM: Someone go grab that dagger! 
MARISHA: I'll grab his dagger. Wait, why am I grabbing this dagger? 
SAM: So he can't stab us! 
TALIESIN: It's cool. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah! I grab his dagger. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay, so you dart up, he's on the ground. You're going to try and pull the dagger from him. That's going to be a contested strength roll. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll. 
MARISHA: He can't be that strong, right? 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: That's a face. That's a face! 
MARISHA: That is a face. 
SAM: He's pulling a face. 
LAURA: He has a 20. 
MARISHA: 15. 
MATT: It was a natural 19. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: You reach and grab the dagger, and as you pull upward he comes with it and gets right up in your face. (intense growl) This horrid growl-- 
SAM: We didn't have the strong person do it! 
MATT: -- from the sharpened rows of teeth. 
ASHLEY: Can I try to knock him out? What are you doing? 
LAURA: Inflict Wounds. 
ASHLEY: Oh okay. 
MATT: Inflict Wounds? 
LAURA: 3rd-level. 
MATT: 3rd-level. Roll an attack. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
SAM: The other two will stay like that for a minute unless we hit them. 
MARISHA: I know, we got to-- 
LAURA: I know, I know. 
MARISHA: -- get the fuck out of here. 
LAURA: (frustrated groan) 13. 
MATT: 13 will not hit, unfortunately. 
LAURA: Fucking hell. 
ASHLEY: Damn it. 
LAURA: I'm rolling like shit! 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to try to knock him out. 
SAM: Yasha, brain him! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try! 
MARISHA: Come on! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to (bonk). Or maybe-- I'm going to attack. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "Or maybe"! Confidence! 
TALIESIN: You got advantage. 
MATT: That's great. 
TALIESIN: You are at advantage. 
ASHLEY: Oh wow! 
MATT: He's prone, so you have advantage on the roll, yeah. 
ASHLEY: That's really, really high, but let me see if I get a-- Okay, it's the same. 30. 
LAURA: Yay. 
MATT: By the way, because he is prone on the ground, your spell attack, which is a melee spell attack-- 
LAURA: Would've been advantage? 
MATT: -- would've been advantage as well. So roll again. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Yes. 
LAURA: Oh, please be good. 
MATT: Because you did tell him to trip. 
MATT: (laughs) I tried. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Don't roll that piece. 
MATT: I tried. 
LAURA: The same roll. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: I tried. 
SAM: Dice don't lie. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: It rolled, I dropped it on a one. There. 
ASHLEY: I'm just trying to knock him out. 
LAURA: Everything's gone. All of you suck. Get better! 
MATT: What was that? 
ASHLEY: Am I killing him or am I just knocking him out? 
SAM and TALIESIN: Kill him. 
LAURA: Kill him! 
MARISHA: Do whatever. 
ASHLEY: All right. What did I get to hit? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Sorry, I can't think tonight. Or ever. Okay, let's see. Wait, am I still raging? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: It's up to you. You can hold your rage as long as you want to. 
ASHLEY: I can? Great. I'm still raging. Okay. Okay. 
MATT: Level 20 barbarian, yeah. 
LAURA: I rolled two twos in a row. 
ASHLEY: That first hit was-- 
LAURA: After a one! 20 plus 1d8 from Scaldsaber. 
SAM: Those will be the only twos of the night. 
LAURA: Feel my energy. Another one. 
SAM: My hands are so cold. 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's seven. 
SAM: So are yours. 
LAURA: Your hands felt warm. 
SAM: One one, two twos, now we need three threes. 
TALIESIN: Kind of what I was hoping would-- 
ASHLEY: 30, 30 and Divine Fury. 
MATT: What did you roll to hit? 
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm at 30. I rolled a 30 to hit. 
MATT: It definitely hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: Sorry. So now do damage on that. 
ASHLEY: So-- 
MATT: Everyone but Caduceus gets one round and then we're going to roll initiative if somehow-- 
ASHLEY: 40, 41 points of damage. 
MATT: 41 points damage on that first hit. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: The heavy smash. (groans) Still holding the dagger and getting up, has gotten up to one knee, is still prone, but is in the process of getting up. Still holding on, but looking pretty hurt. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll take my second hit. 
MARISHA: Kill it! 
ASHLEY: That is 22. 
MATT: 22 hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'll do this. 
MATT: You do not get a Divine Fury die for this one. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that is crazy. 
TALIESIN: Do you get to reroll those or no? 
ASHLEY: I don't think I get to roll ones. Okay, so that'll be-- 
LIAM: I'm so glad this conversation is being saved for posterity. 
ASHLEY: 15 points of damage. 
MATT: All right, 15 points of damage. Okay. Second hit impacts, extremely hurt and is now, you see the second hit, the dagger almost drops out its grip and it looks like it's looking a bit panicked in the eyes, and now its aggressive stance is now turning into offensive physicality. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LIAM: (slings spell) 
LIAM: Fire Bolt. 
MARISHA: Well, okay. 
MATT: Fire Bolt, roll. 
LIAM: Is it at advantage because they're down? Well, it's a ranged attack, so that'll be disadvantage actually. 
LIAM: So disadvantage, okay. Okay, that's fine. That is a 22 to hit. 
MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll damage. 
LIAM: Okay. But I'm conserving-- 
LAURA: Good for you! 
LIAM: -- conserving my energy. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: That's 4d10. (laughs) 
LAURA: What a good spellcaster you are. 
LIAM: Shut up, baby. I know it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: 21 points of fire damage. 
MATT: Okay. He gets to his feet and goes running back towards his other companions. You can see he's concentrating his mind on his companions that are currently still reaching for the mystical buttons before all of a sudden, (flames erupt), is engulfed in flames and then slams and skids on the ground, just (smoldering) in cinders, burning to death in front of his two friends who aren't even paying attention. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Whoa, that's dark. 
SAM: That's gross. 
MATT: But you have less than a minute. 
LAURA: Let's go! 
ASHLEY: Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
TALIESIN: Grab the knife. Grab the knife, I have a funny feeling. Then let's go. 
MARISHA: Okay, I grab the knife. 
MATT: Okay, you go up and grab the glass blade and then head up and down the staircase to the next floor. You're heading up there again, and (rumbling) you hear a bit of rumble and the ground moves a bit. The elements of this stronghold definitely took some damage, sustained some structural damage in the assault and you can hear the distant sound of bits of it and you can hear the distant sound of bits of it still breaking away on the exterior. You head up beyond this floor and you can still note as you have been, Veth, that the architecture here, now the arches are getting higher in these hallways and the pillars are now starting to incorporate carved pillars of the Prime Pillar glass itself. Parts of the halls are weirdly pockmarked bits of smoothed Ruidian glass with a strange, that odd pulsing energy vibe just, (soft strokes) streaking through as you go. As you move past it-- Are you leading the group? 
SAM: Yes, I am! 
MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: At advantage because we had a Heroes' Feast. 
SAM: You're totally right. 
MARISHA: We did. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Take that first one. 21. 
MATT: 21. You move past the glass and there's this little (soft thrum) this weird fuzzy static sensation that comes over your mind for a second. As you blink, your eyes shift and you're standing in the hallway with your friends, but there's almost a ghostly image of a figure drifting in the air not far from you. It seems to be searching, almost like it's sensed itself and is pushing itself to apparate and look throughout this space. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: This looks like a floating Reiloran, but it is long and stretched and it's adorned in dense robes that dangle and flow beneath it. It seems to glide through the air. A massive armored mantle and headpiece. It looks ceremonial and functional together with a strange constructed series of symbols and designs, both on the helmet and from a backward plate that rises up past its shoulders. It ghostly drifts there for a second, reaching out to try and connect with your mind. You just manage to push it out and it drifts from your periphery, but it gives you the sense that you're getting closer to your target. The last thing you hear, glancing off your mind, "Ah, visitors." 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
SAM: Uh-oh. Who is-- 
TALIESIN: Uh-oh? 
LAURA: As we come up: Cure Wounds. I'm going to 1st-level Cure Wounds you. 
SAM: Thank you. Thank you. They're trying to get into our brains. Who is susceptible to brain shit? 
ASHLEY: I mean, Caleb. 
LIAM: Yasha and I-- 
LAURA: Yeah, but Yasha's got a thing. 
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I've got a thing on 
SAM: Because I can give someone a thing. 
LAURA: 12 points of healing. 
SAM: Thank you so much. 
TRAVIS: What's the thing? 
SAM: Protection against psychic damage. 
LAURA: Cure Wounds myself. 
MATT: Let's go. 
SAM: Maybe I should give it-- It protects against psychic damage. 
TALIESIN: Probably Caleb would be the one that would need-- 
SAM: Aren't you protected already? 
LIAM: I am protected. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you are protected. 
LIAM: I took care of Yasha. 
SAM: I could do myself or I could do somebody else. 
MARISHA: Maybe do yourself? 
SAM: A cleric perhaps? 
MARISHA: Yeah, 
LAURA: I've got high, I've got good wisdom saves. 
TALIESIN: I also have good wisdom. 
LIAM: This is still on the move, right? We haven't-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're moving. 
LAURA: Yeah, we're going. 
MATT: You're moving and trudging that way, yeah. 
SAM: I want to use it on somebody. 
LAURA: What about Fjord? 
ASHLEY: Beau? Fjord? 
LAURA: How high is your wisdom? 
TRAVIS: I have a plus 10 to saving throws. 
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 
MATT: (snarls) 
LAURA: What is that? Wait! 
SAM: Maybe I'll just do it on me, I have plus seven. 
MARISHA: Do it on you. 
TALIESIN: Do it on you. 
MATT: -- guttural growling sound and what sounds like streaking claws or blades or nails being pulled across a chalkboard type sensations, moving rapidly in succession. Rushing around one of the nearby hallway intersections, you watch as these two massive, dark armored-skin feline-like entities, you can't tell if it's more dog or cat-like, but they're muscular and elongated and they're charging and rushing through. Where there would be a head you see the shoulders and a mouth that's buried in the torso. They both (ferocious snarls) crawl through. It looks like they're slipping on the ground itself with the sheer volume of intensity of their hunting. They both go charging through the hall in your direction. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: What do you do? (intense snarls) 
LAURA: Ball bearings! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Good idea. Wait, get across the hall and then-- (scattering ball bearings) 
MATT: Okay. Make an initiative roll for me. This is just you to see if they're able to get to you before you can leave them prepared this way. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
LIAM: I'm over Beauregard's shoulder, ready to act if the ball bearings do not go as planned. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 23. 
MATT: 23. 17 on their end. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: So as they're running, (massive gallop) you watch as, they're not necessarily focused on you, they're charging down the hall and one of them, (snarls), it opens its mouth and its tongue whips around like it's tasting the air and then it shifts slightly to begin going straight at your troop. You all dart across this intersection to the opposite side of the hall as you throw the remainder of your ball bearings? How many do you have? 
MARISHA: Yeah. Well I have a bag of a 1,000. 
ASHLEY: Infinity. 
MARISHA: So I imagine maybe I used half before. 
LIAM: It's like feeding birds, right? 
MATT: So 500 ball bearings. 
MARISHA: Yeah, feeding the birds. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Maybe 500. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Feed the birds ♪ 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: ♪ Tuppence a bag ♪ 
MATT: All right. So as both of these come charging in your direction and you scatter the rest of your ball bearings across the ground here. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's the best item in the game. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: It's pretty great. But now it's spent. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So mark that. Natural 10. Nope. Natural seven. Nope. Both of them skid underneath and slam on the ground and continue to skid past and further down the hallway. (screeches) Arms up in the air, trying to grab for whatever they can while they're both skidding along. 
LIAM: I light one up as it passes me by. 
MATT: Roll an attack. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: That is a 24 to hit. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll Sacred Flame it. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: The other one. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: Natural 17. This is dexterity? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, that'll be a 22. 
LAURA: Of course, because I suck at everything. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Doh, doh, doh (no, no, no). 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: Laura. 
LIAM: Laura Bailey. 
SAM: He's right. 
LIAM: But I hit and do 23 points of fire damage. 
MATT: Okay, good to know. Okay. 
SAM: She's really gone down hill-- 
MATT: So they both go skidding past. 
SAM: -- in the intervening years. 
MATT: As you head across the way to the hall, you see as you head downward it continues on for a bit and you can see a bit of light at the end. A light that is similar to what you arrived from. Meaning you are coming to a point where the hallway itself is a collapsed and exposed portion of the Arx Creonum. There is a staircase to the right that you see immediately that heads upward and you continue up that way. Just as you all step out from that point, you are now in a partially exposed part of the exterior of the Arx Creonum. You're on an upper floor now, further up than you were. 
LIAM: Look out at the chaos? 
MATT: But you're looking out now among, from a higher position, the exterior, the stronghold portion of it collapsed and fallen and you can see those two towers that were set on two parts of the battlements just outside of where you are. One of them is partially broken and being held ever so slightly with its base right there. The other one's still shooting upward to an upper level with a secondary balcony platform that sits above that has a massive crack and looks like parts of it are hanging and about tumble from underneath. As you all step out onto that space, seeing the various flying feskuls darting around, snatching other soldiers and other members of the attacking forces that are also clambering up and following up the cables that they can. You can see one feskul comes flying by as two figures on it are battling, on its mounted space and it goes (whooshing), slamming into the ground before catching itself out of sight. Right around this point, another (rumbling) explosion rocks from below and the hallway that you're on begins to (cracking) crumble. 
LIAM and SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: I need everyone to make a dexterity saving throw. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Jeez Louise. 
TRAVIS: If you're within 10 feet of me you get plus five to your dexterity saving throws. 
LAURA: Are we all within 10 feet of you? 
MATT: You're all pretty closely clustered, so. 
MARISHA: Plus five, you said? 
TRAVIS: Plus five. 
ASHLEY: I get advantage on dex. 
TALIESIN: I do not get advantage on dex. I have a weird green thing, but I don't think it means anything. 
MARISHA: (laughs) A natural 20. 
TALIESIN: Plus three on? 
TRAVIS: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20, nice. 
TALIESIN: Does that count? Shit. It left. Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
TRAVIS: Dirty 20. 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
LIAM: I failed with an 11, I assume, but I'm going to use my Ring of Evasion to auto-succeed. One charge on that ring. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: 23. All right. 
LAURA: 12. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: One. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Dirty 20. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: As you all switch back to head in the direction that you rushed from in the lower floor to head deeper into and away from the exposed war-torn exterior of the stronghold, that explosion rocks it for a second and the ground cracks. It doesn't give way, and you all hold on for a second and then feel comfortable before the shadow begins to grow darker around you and you realize that one massive pillar that was barely holding on-- 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: It's collapsing over in your direction. Majority of you dart down the hall to the way, however, it slams into the ground, sending debris flying outward in all directions, not crushing your companions, but Caduceus and Jester, who are just outside of its crushing space get completely ransacked with a number of pieces of flying debris and stone and glass shards-- 
LAURA: Ow, ow, ow, ow! 
MATT: -- both of you taking 14 points of piercing damage. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Ah. 
LAURA: Just healed myself. 
LIAM: But they don't go flying out the edge? 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: But you rolled a one, right? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Hmm. As it slams down, Jester takes the hit from the side, but manages to catch up with the rest of you. From your perspective, where the pillar slammed, you do not see where Caduceus is. 
SAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: Did I see Caduceus? Did I see it when I jumped? 
MATT: You both tried to, you saw it falling and you rushed. You get blasted with it. You catch yourself, the dust settles and you turn and you do not see Caduceus. 
LIAM: So did we see Caduceus go flying, or just disappear under rubble? 
MATT: You just saw the pillar slam and he's not there. 
LAURA: Caduceus! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to run over and try to start looking, Caduceus! 
LAURA: Can I look over the edge? 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm over the edge. 
MATT: The pillar's on the opposite side of you, so it's where you rushed inward deeper into the the citadel, the pillar slammed and closed off the path outward-- 
LAURA: Outward. 
MATT: So you're not certain. You can try and climb over it, you can try and-- 
LIAM: I'm going to scramble up and try. I want to make sure that he's not hurtling down. 
LAURA: Same. 
MATT: All right, so Caduceus, make a strength saving throw for me if you don't mind. 
SAM: That'll be fine. 
MARISHA: He's been doing great. 
SAM: We all knew the risks. Let's keep going. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Strength saving throw, huh? 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 12. 
MATT: 12? Okay. 
TALIESIN: Good for me. 
MATT: Okay. You guys all clamber up over the broken parts of this column just enough to look over to the side where the portion of the ground that was in the brink of collapse is about to collapse and there on the opposite side, just barely clutching onto the end, his fingers slipping, is Caduceus. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab, I'm going to grab him. 
LIAM: I'm going to mutter an arcane word and cast Telekinesis and grab Caduceus and lift up. 
MATT: Okay, Caduceus has never been this light. As you reach over and grab and lift him up-- 
ASHLEY: What the fuck? 
TALIESIN: Whoa! Oh oh! 
MATT: He keeps going up and keeps going up. 
TALIESIN: Every time, every time we get together. 
MARISHA: It wasn't the ball bearings was it? 
TALIESIN: No. 
MARISHA: Oh thank god, all right, let's go. 
ASHLEY: This is already so stressful. 
LAURA: It was definitely the ball bearings. 
TALIESIN: Last time there was a death, we killed a guy, I forgot to use Circle of Mortality and not that-- Keeper of Souls. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I would love to really quickly vague retcon and give, however many hit dice that character had into-- 
MATT: Six hit points. 
TALIESIN: It was six? 
MATT: Or six in dice, yeah, so you get six. 
TALIESIN: Six points to you. 
LAURA: Oh great. 
ASHLEY: Sweet. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: So with that, you pick him back up and leave him over the other side, landing as you do. In the moment, thanks to your Seeming spell that still holds up, it looks like you have not yet drawn the attention of any of the other flyers and people that are engaged in defending the battlements, the exterior of the Arx Creonum. So you head back into the core of this stronghold, back into the long hallways, the smooth marble floors themselves, somewhat cracked and adjacent. You see elements of what once was beautifully carved and polished ground before you, that's broken and jutting up in places. The hallways are partially collapsed on one side and you can see the veins of the prime pillar's Ruidian glass growing more and more dense the further in you get until eventually the walls are almost equal parts, darkened Ruidian stone, red dust-packed sandstone material, and alternating with the faintly glowing and pulsing teal green Ruidian glass, almost like this weird pattern tunnel the further down you go. (pulses) Each time you pass through one, that weird static begins to settle in. Yeah, I would like a group wisdom saving throw. (groaning) 
TRAVIS: Plus five. 
MARISHA: With advantage. 
MATT: You all do have advantage. 
LIAM: Would Mind Blank-- 
TRAVIS: Plus five. 
LIAM: -- knock this out for me? Or no? 
MARISHA: What the fuck? 
MATT: Let me check. 
LIAM: Caleb/Yasha. 
MATT: Both Caleb and Yasha are immune to this. 
LAURA: Oh, that's great. 
ASHLEY: For you. 
MATT: But the rest of you... 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Fjord. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Think he's looking it up. 
TALIESIN: 32. 
MATT: 32. 
LAURA: 30. 
MATT: 30. 
SAM: The dirtiest of 20s. 
MATT: I knew it. Beau. 
MATT: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
TRAVIS: 22. 
MATT: 22. (intensifying pulses) That strange buzzing boundary, that invisible pattern of mental static that seems to pass with each one of these dense portions of Ruidian glass, you all hold your sense of self close to you and close off the rest of your mind best as you can, and with each passing pattern, you can feel on the periphery of your vision, shadows, shapes of figures that are waiting, looking, seeking, sensing and not quite able to grasp who and what you are in the moment, but it seems everywhere you turn, wherever a bit of the light seems to fade, you swear for a moment you can see another one of these floating shadow entities and they're getting closer. 
SAM: I'm going to cast Intellect Fortress on myself. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Mm. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
SAM: Just to protect against more psychic things. 
TRAVIS: Good to know. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: We're getting closer, aren't we? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: How much farther does it look like we have? 
SAM: It's scary. 
MATT: You're not certain because now we're going to go into the next portion. 
LAURA: Oh god! 
MATT: Searching throughout, who is helming this leg of looking for your target? 
LIAM: I will, since I saw Veth waver for a moment because of this fuckery going on from the Weave Minds. 
MATT: Okay, what are you planning to do to help you search through? What are you looking for? What are you finding? 
LIAM: I'm going to use my spatial awareness of where we are to try to go more central inside of this giant pillar. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Want to go in deeper. 
MATT: I would say for this it would be either investigation or survival, your call. 
SAM: Hundred gold says he does well on this check. 
LIAM: Oh. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Huh? 
SAM: Hundred gold, I'm betting on this ability check. 
TRAVIS: No bets! No bets! 
MARISHA: Wait, we got a running tab. I'm a little bit in debt, I think. 
LIAM: What the fuck is an ability-- 
MARISHA: She also bullied the fuck out of me before and threatened to kill my girlfriend. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I didn't-- We need to be saving money right now. (laughter) 
MARISHA: True, we're thinking of adopting. 
SAM: Oh. 
LIAM: Well, Matthew, it's a one. 
MARISHA: You owe me $100. 
SAM: Fuck! God dammit, Caleb, you fucked me. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: See, this is the betting, though that I think is great. 
TRAVIS: It's not very helpful at all. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: There's no pockets in your burial shroud, just try and remember. 
MATT: You all, following Caleb's lead, heading down this hallway, the Ruidian glass begins to give way to a brass patterned metallic shell of an arched hallway, which you're like, this is a grandiose presentation to it. It definitely has, this probably leads to something of equal prestige. It begins to head up and up and up and there is a door there, a large metal gate-like door that you go to see if it's locked, but it is partially open. It looks like there was some sort of locking mechanism that is broken, not necessarily forcefully, but the actual mooring of the door has been adjusted in the impact of the recent assault on the Creonum itself. Right at that point, the door opens up as you see one, three, six, 12 of these red, armor-skinned creatures, these orb-like entities with scales and a singular central burning yellow eye in the middle, rows of teeth and they (chittering slurps) a swarm them, each about maybe three feet in diameter from down this hallway that look like they are free and hungry and all look at you from me on the doorway. 
SAM: Ruh-roh. 
LIAM: Oh dear. I will use Telekinesis to move 1,000 pounds of weight and shut the door if possible. 
MATT: Okay, what 1,000 pounds is coming from what? 
LIAM: I don't know how much the doors weigh. 
MATT: The door itself? 
LIAM: I'm trying to do, you said it was slightly ajar, so I'm trying to go-- (crumbling push) 
MATT: Okay, the door, (impact) you push it back into place and it grinds and (intense crumbling) on the ground. It's not fitting perfectly, but that might be to your advantage. At that point, the rest of you see (impacts) all the entities behind it are now forcing their weight and impacting and you hear the sound of scraping and scratching like they're trying to burrow their way through this door or its surrounding material. 
SAM: Shape stone or something? 
ASHLEY: Going to push up against it and help Caleb-- 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: -- give him time until we figure out-- 
LAURA: Is there anything around to put in front of the door to block it? 
MATT: It looks like this hallway comes to this point. This is where these were kept or wherever they were deeper inside they've been freed, and are now trying to escape. 
LAURA: Do we need to get through there or is this-- 
MATT: So it's 1,000 pounds. 
MARISHA: Is this the way to go? 
MATT: With your help on this, okay. 
LIAM: I mean, there's no safer material, right? So it's just the duration of the spell? 
LAURA: Can I help Yasha also push? 
ASHLEY: Extra strength. 
LAURA: Extra strength, that's-- 
ASHLEY: You're strong. She's so strong. 
MATT: So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to make a roll for them based on the DC of what you're doing. The DC of you already holding this Telekinesis is going to put it at a 20-- I'll say 24. And then with each of you helping, that'll increase it to a 26, I'll say. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So I'm rolling this with all of them putting their weight behind it and it is a bunch of these creatures and there are I'd say about a dozen or so of them at about three foot high and they're all telekinetically floating and all (intense impacts) slamming into it and trying to push through. I'll put them in a total of plus eight, so they're going to have to roll pretty high on this, which they do not with a natural two. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: So it's holding for the time being. You don't know how long it'll hold, but you can either continue to hold that with Telekinesis, you can try and relinquish it and head backward. What are you planning to do? 
LAURA: Do we have to get through there? 
LIAM: We do not know. 
ASHLEY: Wait, so we walked up to this door? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Sounds like a dead end to this. 
ASHLEY: Went in and then closed it? 
MATT: Correct. Now the rest of you, you've been following a pattern of more and more Rudian glass. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: But this path seems to have less and less of it. 
LAURA: So maybe we went the wrong way. Maybe we turn and go another direction? 
ASHLEY: Might've gone the wrong way. 
TALIESIN: I want to make a quick perception check in the room to see if we're being misled, if there's-- 
LAURA: We're in a hallway. 
MATT: You're in a hallway that went sets of stairs, but the material this hallway's made out of has gotten to more of a darker brass material. 
TALIESIN: But there's no sort of obvious hidden door or anything like that? 
MARISHA: Did we run past a splinter hallway? 
MATT: Make a perception or investigation. Well, you were below. There were numerous other hallways and splinters, but-- 
TALIESIN: Investigation, not perception? 
LIAM: Caleb was trying to-- 
TALIESIN: Damn it. 
LIAM: -- use his awesome spatial awareness with a one to go inward. 
TALIESIN: Why did I try this? Nope. My investigation already sucks, but it's good to get that one out of my system. 
MARISHA: Let's go back, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, let's go back. 
TALIESIN: Right, another way. 
LAURA: Find another path. 
LIAM: Find another way. 
MATT: Okay, so you head back down, going to try again. Natural one, all right, so for the time being they're held. You all trek back down to where you've last splintered off to this path that led you astray. 
LIAM: I'm going to lift a bunch of the stone that collapsed and try to block the path from that we came out of. 
MATT: Okay, so it'll take you a moment, but you begin to manipulate and shift over all these large clusters of collapsed stone from nearby parts of damaged hallway and ceiling, which there are a number of pieces of debris that you can manipulate. While that's happening, who else is helming to try and find the right path deeper into this? 
SAM: Fjord, navigate us through this. You're a captain. 
TRAVIS: On the moon? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Moon captain? 
SAM: These skills translate. 
LAURA: He's an admiral now. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll try and-- 
MARISHA: Space admiral. 
TALIESIN: I believe in you, Sailor Moon. 
TRAVIS: Space admiral! 
SAM and LIAM: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Yep, I will look. 
TALIESIN: How did that only hit you? Thank you. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay, so you're just trying to look for patterns to lead you deeper into it? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Okay. Make a perception or investigation check, your call. 
LAURA: Guidance. 
SAM: 500 gold says he fails. 
LAURA: I Guide him. 
TRAVIS: What is Guidance? 
LAURA: Get plus four-- plus a d4. 
TALIESIN: Slap on the butt. 
LAURA: Yeah, heck yeah, I pinch his butt for Guidance. 
SAM: 500 gold says he fails. 
TRAVIS: 34. 
SAM: Oh fuck! (laughter) 
SAM: You never take it, you never said you take it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No, no, Veth, you need to keep to your gambling. 
SAM: Yeah, I got it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Your bets, you're getting stiff. You're getting pretty high here, hot table. 
LIAM: She's running around with little bookies. 
MARISHA: I know. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You've got a visor. 
MATT: So Fjord, as you all head down, you can see there are numerous hallways that splinter off. Other soldiers begin to rush past. Other Ruidian guardians are now moving out from deeper into these tunnels. You all step off to the side and let them move past without directly running in the opposite direction of them to cause their attention. Waiting for that moment to break in that pattern, you take the group and then head down a separate path. This one now, the hallways grow wider. The Ruidian glass archways are more and more intricate and have metallic rings placed in sections. Once again, that (intensifying vibrations) that static passes over you each time you push through. You've already tuned your minds to try and not be affected at the moment, but those shadowy forms that drift on the periphery of your vision, every time you focus on something, you see it drift just on the edge of your horizon. As you look, it's gone, and then feel it over here. And they're getting more and more present, to the point where you start feeling this odd funny bone-like vibration within your body. Something within your spine and your neck and the back of your head is feeling slightly fizzy. Eventually, this hall opens into a large antechamber. You can see this almost a negative pyramid space that comes to a point, and up above it you can see beautiful reliefs in these designs and shapes that speak to almost like a series of historical images, though they are now cracked and sections of it have fallen and broken in and leave piles of debris around, none of which is familiar to you at all. But on the far end of this negative pyramid space, there are two large doors at one of the opening points that are both open, like double doors, and from the inside, you can see quite a strong and from the inside, you can see quite a strong teal glow that emanates from within. 
SAM: Just from one of them? 
MATT: From both of them. 
SAM: Oh, from both. 
LAURA: That's promising. 
MARISHA: Really quick, I don't want to take time, but can I glance at this mural, this relief, and see if I can glean any type of information? Is it a founding myth? What is it? 
MATT: At a quick glance? Sure. Make an investigation check or a history check. 
SAM: Come on, Cobalt Soul. 
LIAM: Ruidian cheat code in glyphs. 
SAM: Don't you have some sort of feature? 
LAURA: Guidance. 
MARISHA: My history is very high. 
LAURA: I pinched your butt. 
MARISHA: Ooh! (exclaims) 
LIAM: Let's go, nerd. 
MARISHA: Jeez, what the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck! Guidance. Fuck! 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
LAURA: Sorry, I distracted you. 
MARISHA: 22. 
LAURA: I was trying to help. 
SAM: 22 is good. 
MARISHA: 22 is good, but my history is plus 16. 
LIAM: What do you expect when you go around pinching everyone's bottoms? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I pinch your butt. 
LIAM: Oh! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: At this brief moment where it seems the rumbling of the Arx Creonum has stabilized from how deep you are within it, you look upon the ceilings above. You can see images that seem to correlate to a pale blue celestial object that you quickly ascertain to be Exandria. It looks like this is a reverse celestial calendar in places, where, instead, the time is kept by the position of Catha and Exandria in the Ruidian sky. From that, you also see things that depict the core of this. As it goes down to the sedimentary layers of its history, you can see the reliefs that are meant to, and actually use Ruidian glass to show up and are carved to show the core itself reaching out like the branches of a tree. The deeper down it goes, there's almost a golden color that goes to a white or silver at the edges. Everything seems to be like it is expressing an outward interest, something of moving beyond, reaching upward. There's no real text. It just looks like a lot of intent to be free. 
MARISHA: Free. Okay. Okay. Cool. 
TRAVIS: These doors don't look promising. We should go down and keep looking. (laughter) 
SAM: What are you talking about? It's glowing teal. 
TRAVIS: That's never good. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I vote we leave now. 
TALIESIN: If it's going to glow a color, this is a nice one. 
LAURA: I really don't like these old guys. 
MARISHA: It's got a nice glow. 
TRAVIS: Is it two sets of double doors or just double doors? 
MATT: There are two sets of double doors. At the far end there-- 
TRAVIS: The one on the right. 
MATT: -- it looks like there is almost where two tunnels escaped from this reversed pyramid antechamber. It looks like there are two doors on opposite sides of a heavy corner that both lead into the same chamber, and both of them are open. Not intentionally open, but partially open, and a strong teal glow from the inside. 
TRAVIS: I go to the set of double doors on the right-hand side and slice the pie as we look in, barely revealing ourselves as we look around the edge. 
LIAM: We're going to toss in, while Beauregard was studying the wall, Caleb held a pearl to Jester's forehead and cast Fortune's Favor on you. So you have one re-roll at some point. 
LAURA: That's really useful. Thank you. 
SAM: (like Jester) That's really useful. (Veth) She's eating a pastry. 
LAURA: Uh-huh, I have candy. 
SAM: Profiterole. 
LAURA: Do you want some? 
TALIESIN: Will I also sound sarcastic if I eat it? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool. Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: What do we see when we start entering? 
MATT: As you peek around through this entryway, first off, the light is pulsing, not dissimilar to the pattern of pulsing that you see throughout the Prime Pillar exterior, but here it is quite vibrant. (undulating buzzing) Glancing inside immediately to your left and near the doorway, you see some a stair step construct what looks to be a massive arch, a singular arch of mostly carved or shaped Ruidian glass that itself is glowing in a pattern, almost like a massive horseshoe that is 20, 25 feet tall. You can't even quite see the apex of it beyond where you stand looking through this open doorway. Beyond that, you can see the chamber spreads out before you with raised areas. Some small bridges that head to a upper platform that you can't quite make up the details from where you stand, but this looks like a larger chamber within. That static sound. That (buzzes). That feeling itself is now ever-present. 
LAURA: Oh, I think we're here. 
MARISHA: Do we see any signs of Weave Mind? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
SAM: The Weave Mind, man. 
TRAVIS: I'll assist you. 
MARISHA: Assist? I'll take it. 
LAURA: I'll pinch your butt. 
MARISHA: (exclaims) 
TRAVIS: Stop touching other people's butts so much. 
LAURA: It helps them. It makes them feel good. 
MARISHA: Oh it did. That one did do good. What was it, perception, you said? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: 24. 
MATT: 24. You see no sign of the Weave Mind. You see no other entities in there. It's a barren chamber. Looking past, as you focus around with that glance through there, you can see there are rich veins of exposed Ruidian glass that punch out from the ground and are built along its base to blend in with the surrounding architecture, but they themselves pulse in the same pattern. Beyond that, you can see there are full pillars of Ruidian glass that also pulse and glow in the same pattern that rise up to the top of the ceiling. 
TALIESIN: I know this is not going to do anything, but I'm going to burn an Eyes to the Grave, because why not? 
MATT: Eyes to the Grave, which does? 
TALIESIN: Lets me know if there's any undead within 60 feet. 
MATT: Fair. 
TALIESIN: Because why not? 
MATT: No worries. You do not sense any undead. 
TALIESIN: All right. Yeah, I wanted to give that-- 
LAURA: Scritch Sprinkle on my shoulder. I'm getting really nervous, you guys. 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, I think this is it. 
SAM: Should we-- 
MARISHA: But I don't, I don't see them in there, but I'm sure they're-- 
LAURA: They're going to appear. 
MARISHA: -- there. 
SAM: Should we spread out, so we're not-- 
LIAM: Yeah, don't bunch up. 
SAM: -- bunchies? 
TRAVIS: Could I pull out Star Razor, and I will cast See Invisibility. 
MATT: Sure. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Beau, do you mind throwing the dagger? 
MATT: You're looking in there as well? 
TALIESIN: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: 450 gold. 
TRAVIS: Excuse me, butt pinch. 
LAURA: Pinch, pinch, pinch. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
LAURA: I double-pinch. 
SAM: Fine! 
MARISHA: (chuckles) 
LIAM: (Jester) Right on the gooch. 
SAM: 1,000. 
TALIESIN: Certainly. 
SAM: 1,000 gold says one of us dies here. 2,000 if it's me. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: 19. Okay. So as you pull the Star Razor ahead and you cast the spell itself, the beautiful sweet smell of fresh ocean spray coming into your nostrils, your eyes crystallized, and within the pulsing glow of the energy throughout this Ruidian glass structures within, you go from seeing nothing in the chamber to two figures that have been masked by some power, are currently focused on one of these multiple pillars of Ruidian glass come hovering next to it. Concentrating. 
LAURA: The Weave Mind are in the pillars. 
MATT: Floating just beyond it. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
MATT: But focused on it. You see with it pulsing, the same energy pulses around them, and you see them concentrating on these things. 
TRAVIS: Maybe concentrating on the things we were getting bombarded at this box. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Are we seeing the wizard? 
SAM: Well, we're not seeing anything. He's seeing it. 
TRAVIS: These two guys are focused on one single pillar? 
SAM: What do they look like? 
MATT: What you see is a Ruidian-type physicality, if stretched. Their limbs, their arms, their fingers, what bit of the legs you can even see on one of them that dangle from these long robes that drift in the air, hanging from their heavily-dressed body. You can see these pale gray and gold robes, multiple layers of it that come to a point in the center. Looks like metallic long bands of ornamental outfit decor around them. This multiple patterned mantle of gold and brass metals that have all manner of runes and various symbols carved throughout these large points that jut out from the center of the mantle where the head is set. What little you can see, facets of the Ruidian red skin between their bracers and their armor. It is withered and wrinkled. Where their head crest is, and it is a very long head crest that winds out into multiple carved points. A heavily patterned and chain-dangling helmet, more or less, or a mask sits on top of it and covers the majority of their head crest. You see beyond the mantle itself, among two of them, on top of their helmet and crest, there are different symbols, large structures. One, you can see it has almost like a crescent moon with a smaller circle within and a larger echo of that symbol pattern that emerges from the back of its mantle. The one beyond that, you can see that's a little further into the chamber focusing on another piece of crystal. It seems to have almost like a curved hourglass-esque type shape. They look ornamental and differentiating what would otherwise be, from your perspective, fairly identical looking entities. 
LAURA: They're each focused on a different crystal? 
MATT: Yeah, the two that you can see are focused on different crystals. 
LIAM: Only Fjord sees only-- 
MATT: Only Fjord sees them. The minute you see them, the one turns its head and you hear in your mind, "Welcome. Do you wish to come converse a bit?" 
TRAVIS: They are talking to me. 
LAURA: What are they saying? 
TRAVIS: In my mind. 
LAURA: Who? 
MATT: You glance back in the room and the other one's now looking at you as well. (oohing) 
TRAVIS: They're looking at me. 
LAURA: Creepy. 
TRAVIS: They're asking if we want to come converse. 
LAURA: Tell them no, tell them to suck it. 
TALIESIN: I mean, is there any reason not to have a talk? 
LIAM: Fjord, where in the room are they? 
TRAVIS: They're on the pillar. How many pillars are in the room, half dozen, dozen? 
LAURA: Five. 
SAM: Five. 
TRAVIS: Five? 
MATT: From what you can see in here? You're just looking through an open doorway. You can see there's a large arch, and you can see on the far end of the room, there is an elongated pillar. There's a small cluster of Ruidian crystal as well that juts from the ground. That's about all you can make out. Maybe a little bit of an upper platform area towards the back, where you can see another section, but that's about all you can make out from where you currently stand. 
TALIESIN: I'd rather know more now than make the assumption that where we are is where we can find any kind-- 
LAURA: Tell them to come out here if they want to talk. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'd like some visibility. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe just be like: Hey, what are you doing? What are you guys doing? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Please, no. 
SAM: Hey. 
TALIESIN: No, it doesn't. 
ASHLEY: Hey, you guys. 
TRAVIS: I think we might beyond the point of conversing, unless you wanted to step outside. (laughter) 
MATT: A third one drifts in. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: Looking at you. 
TRAVIS: There's three. They're here. Not two, but there's three of them. 
MATT: They all (soft whoosh) floating in space. You hear three voices in your mind go, "We insist." Make a strength saving throw for me. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: A strength saving throw? 
MARISHA: Ooh, they're about to Force Pull your ass. 
TRAVIS: (hums) 
SAM: It's cocked. He's strong. Don't worry. 
LAURA: He's so strong. 
SAM: He's been working out. 
TRAVIS: Oof. 
SAM: He's been working out. 
TRAVIS: (whispers) Six... 
MARISHA: Yeah. I can-- 
TRAVIS: 12. 
LAURA: No! 
MARISHA: Oh my god, we're doomed. 
SAM: We knew the risks. 
MATT: The rest of you watch as Fjord-- 
TRAVIS: No, no, strength saving throw. 
MATT: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Sorry. (laughter) 
SAM: 11. 
TRAVIS: 14. 
LAURA: Oh, so much better. 
LIAM: I've been waiting for this. So if I see his body jerk, do I have the ability to try to tug-of-war them? 
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah. 
LIAM: Ja. 
MATT: So you all watch as Fjord suddenly (swooshes). The feet skidding and slipping on the ground, all of a sudden (zoom) starts being pulled towards the entryway. This is a contested role. Roll a d20-- 
SAM: It's okay, Jester. You'll find someone else. 
MATT: -- and add your spell-- 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: -- ability. 
LIAM: Modifier? Yeah. 
MATT: So just add your intelligence modifier. 
LIAM: Oh, natural 20. 
MARISHA: 20. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Natural 20 for a total of? 
LIAM: 25. 
MATT: 25. Okay. That's interesting. You both got the same number. They didn't roll a natural 20, but they have a higher modifier than you. You both got 25, so Fjord slides into the doorway and he's now being held there, and being pulled in two different directions. (oohing) 
MATT: Fjord. 
TRAVIS: How far away? 
MATT: Fjord. 
TALIESIN: How far? 
TRAVIS: Yes? 
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw for me. 
TALIESIN: I was-- 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: How far away are they-- 
MATT: Because you are being pulled apart right now. 
TRAVIS: -- roughly. Okay. 
MATT: From two massive psychic forces. 
TALIESIN: He's not close enough to tap, is he, or no? 
MATT: If you want to. 
TALIESIN: I was going to give him a little tap for resistance and cast Resistance. 
MATT: Okay, well, first, we'll get to that in a second. This is happening (rapid thuds) really fast. You're now moving forward to do this. So first, we'll see how much damage he takes if he rolls this. 
TRAVIS: 31. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: 31. Okay. So you only take six points-- 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
MATT: -- of bludgeoning damage, as your body is now being (intense tearing) ripped apart from the inside on both points. 
TRAVIS: Roughly, how far inside this room are they? 
MATT: The one that's closest to you is about 40-ish feet. 
MARISHA: Oh that's close. 
TRAVIS: 40-ish feet? Could I-- 
MATT: 40, 50 feet. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: As I'm getting (grunts), fuck this, I'm going to try and cast Faerie Fire inside the room. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Nice. 
MATT: Sure, sure. 
MARISHA: I was hoping someone had Faerie Fire. 
LIAM: (deeply) Faerie Fire. 
LAURA: (deeply) Faerie Fire. 
MARISHA: One of the best spells. 
SAM: (distorted) Faerie Fire, fire, fire. 
MATT: Okay, so 20 foot cube on him. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, 60 feet. 
MATT: Yep. Natural 20 on the dexterity saving throw. 
MARISHA: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: God, definitely saves. 
MATT: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Where was that when I was contesting the earlier roll (laughs). 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: So you (grunts) cast Faerie Fire and you watch as it drifts and then dissipates around the exterior of your target. This member of the Weave Mind still floating untouched, unfazed, looking at you. 
LIAM: So there was only one individual in that glitter bomb. 
MATT: Yeah, it's a 20 foot cube. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they're spread out? 
MATT: The two that he saw were far apart, and the one that just coasted, it was from further back even then. 
LIAM: I don't want to squish Fjord. What are we doing? 
SAM: It's okay. 
MARISHA: I am going-- 
LAURA: Stop. 
MARISHA: Go ahead. 
TRAVIS: I have a bonus action. 
LAURA: Stop. Why? 
MATT: You do. 
SAM: I'm nervous. 
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I'm going to (whoosh) disappear by casting Far Step. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: At 5th-level. 
SAM: And cast Far Side and do-- 
TRAVIS: And I will appear-- 
SAM: -- keep continuing by casting. (laughter) 
MATT: You will appear where? 
TRAVIS: -- right behind them. 
MATT: Right behind-- 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: -- which one? The one you targeted the Faerie Fire, the one that's closest to you? 
TRAVIS: Maybe the one that's farthest back in the room, so that if I appear behind him, maybe the other two with these enormous ornate domes don't quite notice. 
MATT: From where you stand, they're beyond 60 feet from the entry where you are. 
TRAVIS: Oh I'm sorry. I thought you said they were 30 feet from where-- 
MATT: No, the one that's closest to you is about 40, 50 feet from where you were. 
TRAVIS: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. 
MATT: You could teleport behind that one. 
LIAM: And they're still invisible? 
LAURA: They're still invisible. 
MATT: You all don't see it. 
LIAM: Right. 
LAURA: (groans). 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll jump in there. The guy that's 40 feet, because that's within 60 of Far Step. 
MATT: Yeah, so (whooshing) you appear behind him in that space. The rest of you watch Fjord (grunting) (fizzing) and dissipate in the hallway. 
LAURA: No! What happened?! 
SAM: They killed him! 
MATT: You no longer-- 
MARISHA: 1,000 gold. 
LAURA: Stop! Stop betting on my fiance! 
MARISHA: Sorry! (laughter) 
MATT: You no longer have a grasp on your friend. 
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: He's vanished from your hold and from all of your sight. 
LAURA: Fjord! 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
ASHLEY: We go in? 
MARISHA: He just went in. I'm going to take a cue from Captain and I am going to, we're going to have to talk about this because I haven't done this (mumbles). I am going to spend four ki points. You see Beau throw her arms out and her head back, You see Beau throw her arms out and her head back, and her eyes gloss over white, and she slowly, from the top down, starts to disappear. 
SAM: What? 
MARISHA: I'm going to cast-- Well, it's not a cast, I just do-- 
LIAM: She's starting to believe. 
MARISHA: -- Empty Body. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: So I'm invisible and I have resistance to all damage except for force for one minute. 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
SAM: What? 
MARISHA: This isn't the Invisibility spell, so I can punch. Okay. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: It's just raw energy. 
ASHLEY: That-- 
LAURA: What? That's amazing. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Dope--- 
LIAM: But you can't see it. 
MATT: -- Monk-- 
LAURA: Shit. 
MATT: -- Shit. 
ASHLEY: I can't see her-- 
SAM: Oh no! They killed Beau! 
ASHLEY: -- but she's so hot. (laughter) 
LAURA: They're making both of them disappear! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh god! Traveler, help us! 
SAM: (retches) I just barfed on the floor. 
MARISHA: And I'm going in. 
MATT: All right. So, you watch Fjord (whooshing) vanish after being nearly torn in twain in the doorway by psychic force. Beauregard-- 
MARISHA: In twain! 
MATT: -- shoots into I Am The One Mode and then also vanishes. What are the rest of you doing? 
ASHLEY: I'm going in. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm tapping you on the way in. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Good luck. 
LAURA: I can't see anything. 
TALIESIN: I'm casting Holy Weapon. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Holy Weapon on-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: -- Yasha. All right. 
TALIESIN: That's an extra 2d8 radiant with every hit. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: All right, we'll note that. The rest of you? 
LIAM: Entering. 
MATT: Entering as well. Okay. As the rest of you rush into the chamber in pursuit of your friends, we're going to go to break. 
SAM: What? (exclaiming) 
ASHLEY: What? 
MATT: It's an earlier break, but I'm going to set what has now been the beginning of a battle in the battlefield there. Or at least a series of tense moments are likely to turn into battle, and I want to set the stage for it, so-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll see you all here shortly.

Greetings, Mages! This is Tales of Fablecraft. Fablecraft is a virtual tabletop RPG. It's a lot like that game with dragons and dungeons... only easier to GM and play. Even seasoned adventurers haven't met a virtual tabletop this simple and intuitive. and the RPG-curious finally have the perfect onramp into the TTRPG genre. Whether you've watched people play or you've tried to tame an owlbear in a past life... Fablecraft uses its own D6 system that's built to be accessible. We do the math so you can enjoy the game. And since we're a digital product, we do something interesting with our dice. Their faces evolve as characters level up. Interactive combat lets you focus on fighting monsters, not manuals. Move and attack with ease. No need to rifle through a handbook or dense menu, but you'll still need to master turn based strategy if you're going to stand a chance against the mighty Highland Dragon. Running a game for your friends? Fablecraft all but eliminates GM prep time. So, if you're looking for adventures you can jump into in minutes, Fablecraft is perfect for your party. No rails, no problem. When the party goes rogue, simply drag and drop new environments, NPCs, and battlemaps to adapt to their off-course antics. Finally, homebrew. We're in early access, so our list of homebrew tools is steadily growing. Soon you'll be able to customize virtually everything. Whether you're new to TTRPG or a grizzled veteran of the genre, Tales of Fablecraft is made for you. Play in person or remote across Steam and iPad. Mobile support is coming soon. It's free-to-play and available now.

(epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music) 
TRAVIS: Move the rook to B6. 
MARISHA: Okay, see if that opens it. 
LAURA: I'm trying it. [clicks] (gasping) [metal clattering] (cheering) 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Wait, it's blank. There's nothing in here. What the hell? 
TALIESIN: The phonograph said that the answer would be in the journal. 
TRAVIS: Oh, maybe we missed something, like some clue we're not thinking of! 
LAURA: Ah, we only have four minutes left! 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, think. 
TALIESIN: Okay. The song said, "Look to the beacon." Look to the-- 
MARISHA: Right. Beacon. Light. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (gasp) The lightroom! 
LAURA: Get it out. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh, uh! 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: The cryptex! 
LAURA and MARISHA: (scream) 
TALIESIN: The key is in the cryptex! 
LAURA and MARISHA: We know! 
LAURA: So if every other letter-- 
MARISHA: Times two. 
LAURA: -- is the combination-- 
TRAVIS: Did you say times? Times, like a clock. It's in the clock! But how do you open it? 
LAURA: (uncertain noise) 
MARISHA: Okay. What is it? 
LAURA: Okay, it's six. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Two. Four. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: 624? It's 6:24! 
LAURA: Uh. Zero. [unlocking] 
MARISHA: (gasp) 
LAURA and MARISHA: (excited noise) 
TALIESIN: Guys, guys, I think I found it! 
TRAVIS: But it's not opening! 
TALIESIN: So how do you unlock this? 
MARISHA: That's not the cryptex. This is a cryptex. 
TALIESIN: Wait, I think if I push my fingers into... No, that's not working. 
MARISHA: We just need the code word. What's a six-letter code? 
TRAVIS: I think it's jammed! 
LAURA: Arlo said that in order to find the answer we need, we have to look to the beacon. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Right. But Colonel Popcorn's telegram says-- 
TRAVIS: (grunts) [clattering] 
MARISHA: "Be Aware -(STOP)- Exciting New -(STOP)- Amazing -(STOP)- Critical Role Content Available at Beacon.tv. -(STOP)- Oh my god. No Idea How to Finish this Fake Telegram -(STOP)-" 
TRAVIS: Reveal your secrets to me! 
TALIESIN: Can either of you help me, help me with the-- 
MARISHA: That's not a cryptex! 
TALIESIN: I am very aware. (groans) 
LAURA: Okay. What about this? Huh? Um, it says, "Try using Beacon." [shattering] 
TALIESIN: Hey, Travis. Could you help with the-- 
TRAVIS: Not now, dude, I'm trying to save us! We've only got 90 seconds left! [slamming] 
TRAVIS: (shrieks) 
LAURA: "10% off merchandise. Members-only Discord. Exclusive new series." Is that a clue? 
MARISHA: I don't know, it just feels too obvious, like something that a lazy writer would try and shoehorn into a script. 
TRAVIS: (shrieks) 
LAURA: Well, that would also explain this. 
MARISHA: I know. That's useless. 
LAURA: Literally no one says "literally" anymore. 
MARISHA: Exactly. 
TRAVIS: We're running out of time, people! Come on! 
MARISHA: Uh. Okay, we just need a six-letter word that unlocks this artifact and also unlocks amazing content! 
LAURA: Also, would it kill you to try to help us, Ashley? 
ASHLEY: What do you think I'm doing? While you all are busy sucking eggs in La La Land, I was making an improvised munitions charge that'll blow this door off with minimal loss of life and hearing. 
LAURA: You don't explode a door, Ashley! That's not how an escape room works! 
ASHLEY: Oh, really? Because that is literally what this is, an escape room. 
LAURA: She just said "literally." 
MARISHA: "Literally." 
TRAVIS: 30 seconds! 
TALIESIN: Help! It's again! 
ASHLEY: Fire in the hole! 
LAURA and MARISHA: (scream) [lever slams] [alarm buzzes] [door clacks] 
KYLE: Hey, guys. Uh, good job or not, I guess. Tried your best. 
LAURA: Did we do it? Did we escape? 
KYLE: No. No, no, you didn't. 
TRAVIS: Oh, so close. 
MARISHA: It was the stupid cryptex. The code word was too hard. 
LAURA: It was impossible! 
KYLE: Was it? 
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah! 
KYLE: What was the name of the detective? 
LAURA: Detective Beacon. 
KYLE: Yeah, it was Beacon. Yeah? And where did the murder take place? 
MARISHA: Beacon Street. 
KYLE: Yeah, yeah. And what was the name of the law firm that hired Detective Beacon to exonerate the Beacon State graduate from the murder on Beacon Street? 
MARISHA: Beacon, Beacon, and Associates. 
LAURA: And Associates. 
TRAVIS: So what was the code word? 
KYLE: It's Beacon! It's Beacon! 
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh. 
KYLE: Yep, see? Here's the room key and here is all the cool new info about Beacon, our new membership program that offers discounts, early access to the Critical Role podcast, and new content like "Critical Role Abridged" and "Re-Slayer's Take," along with exclusive content like "Fireside Chats," "The Crit Role Cooldown," and many more to come. 
TRAVIS: So how do you get into the clock? 
KYLE: You don't! That's just a clock! 
TALIESIN: Kyle. 
KYLE: What... 
TALIESIN: I have a problem. 
KYLE: What did you do? Those weren't even here for the escape room. Where did you even get those? (sighs) ♪ (gentle, upbeat music ♪ "Hello Bees") ♪ 
THE BEE KINGS: ♪ Hello Bees, it's me again ♪ ♪ Look to the Beacon, ♪ my old friend ♪ 

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, players, come to the table please. 
TRAVIS: I want to see. I want to see. I want to see. (noises of excitement) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Oh no! 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LAURA: A totally empty room. 
TALIESIN: No! 
ASHLEY: That is so pretty! 
TRAVIS: It's all lethal. Look at him, at them, it-- 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: -- I can't tell. What the fuck? 
LIAM: Arx Creonum. 
SAM: Wow. 
LAURA: They're big. They're bigger than I thought they were. 
LIAM: Portal in the middle? 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Where does the portal go? Where does this arch go? 
LIAM: What does it mean? What does it mean? 
TRAVIS: Stargate. It's a Stargate! it's a Stargate! (laughter) 
LAURA: Wait, how many? 
LIAM: Yeah, get a picture so that we can remember this. 
LAURA: One, two-- 
ASHLEY: I know. 
LAURA: -- three, four, five. So five of these pillars and then, wait four regular pillars and one chained pillar? What does the chained pillar mean? 
TRAVIS: Get Kurt Russell and James Spader on the phone. 
MATT: That is crystal, this is crystal, this is crystal. This, this are crystal, that's crystal, that's crystal, that's crystal. And in the walls back here. 
TRAVIS: The crystal with a dot has got chains on it! What's happening? 
LAURA: I know. That's what I mean! What is that!? 
TALIESIN: Crystal they use to escape. 
LAURA: Then the thing in the ground, is that also crystal? 
TRAVIS: Oh god. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: There's archways and shit. There's a circle and-- 
TALIESIN: That's a "Stargate" prop. Those things go about three hundred-- 
LIAM: Fjord is right with that fool? 
MATT: Yeah. He just teleported behind him. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Oh god. And which door-- 
MATT: The rest of you all just rushed in through this doorway. 
LAURA: -- that door? 
LAURA: Fuck! 
LIAM: Oh. 
LAURA: So both doors were like-- 
LIAM: Custom pieces. Look at these. 
MATT: Right. So Beauregard, you rushed in. What was your speed? 
SAM: This right here, this whole thing is brought to you by WizKids minis. Bells Hells unpainted miniatures available now. Bring the Bells Hells to your tabletop with new, upcoming, unpainted primed minis. Get them at wizkids.io/crunpainted. Thank you, I did my job. 
MATT: Good job, buddy. 
TALIESIN: We're going to die in the-- 
MATT: Beauregard. 
TALIESIN: -- Fortress of Solitude. 
MARISHA: Okay. Here's my question. 
MATT: Yup. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: We're going to die. 
LIAM: Even these pieces are so cool. 
MARISHA: Did I see where Fjord directed his Faerie Fire since I was? 
MATT: You would have, yeah. I mean, you see it blasted through and it went to this area here. 
LAURA: I don't want it anymore. 
MARISHA: I can see Fjord-- 
LAURA: I don't know what to do, we're trapped. 
MARISHA: No, Fjord went invisible. 
MATT: Yes. Wait, no, no. Fjord didn't go invisible. He just vanished from sight. 
MARISHA: He just-- 
LIAM: He poofed inside. 
MARISHA: He poofed. 
MATT: And you rushed inside. So, you'd be rushing in. Your movement is? 
MARISHA: My movement is 70. 
MATT: 70, so back there. 
MARISHA: I would try and head towards Fjord and towards where he directed it. 
MATT: 50, 55, 60, 65 70 would get you about, actually-- 
MARISHA: Right up to him? 
MATT: -- Right up to him. 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go. 
MATT: If you want to. 
MARISHA: And I am also invisbable. 
MATT: Correct. So we have both you guys onboard. Yasha. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
MATT: You rush in as well? 
ASHLEY: I do. 
MATT: Your movement is? 
ASHLEY: My movement is, I think it's 50? It's 50 feet. 
MARISHA: Did you fart? 
MATT: 50 feet. 
SAM: I was scared by this. 
MATT: You get about there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Rushing in. 
MARISHA: I thought you farted and it spooked you. (laughter) 
LIAM: (fart noise) 
ASHLEY: I smell a fart. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Nobody farted. 
TALIESIN: Damn it, Liam. 
LAURA: I don't know. 
ASHLEY: Then why does it smell like a fart? 
MARISHA: (cackles) 
MATT: That's the smell of fear. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Probably. 
LAURA: Slowly leaking out. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that feels good. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: That feels good. 
MARISHA: Why does my butt hole tickle? 
ASHLEY: Can I do something or should I wait? 
MATT: No, no, we're just placing everyone, and then we're going to go into initiative. 
ASHLEY: Got it. Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Since people are rushing in. 
LIAM: This is my other friend, Crystal. 
TALIESIN: Crystal from Ohio. 
MATT: So, with your placement there. Veth, what's your movement? 
SAM: 30. 
MATT: 30, you would be getting in just about at the door there. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: I'm going to have to rely on some of you guys to help me move some of these around on the far end. 
TRAVIS: Just to say it, they did ask if we wanted to converse. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Before we start swinging on these cats. 
LIAM: Well, we can't even see them. 
MATT: Jester, you rushed in as well? 
LAURA: Can I cast something on myself before I go through the door? Or is it too late? 
MATT: You can either go through the door or you can cast something on yourself. I'm saying right now this is all happening at once, and then we're going to go into initiative. 
MARISHA: Maybe we can try to talk. 
MATT: If you wanted to cast something on yourself, you can, but I'd say then you'd begin your next action-- 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Or next turn running in. 
LAURA: Then I'm going to cast Blink on myself. 
MATT: Blink on yourself. 
TRAVIS: That's the one I wanted to cast. 
TALIESIN: Are we-- Okay. 
MARISHA: Don't forget. 
TRAVIS: That's the good Far Step-- 
MARISHA: I have this. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Which is I can pick a vulnerability-- 
ASHLEY: So one of them has a hourglassy mantle and another one has a-- 
MARISHA: The next spell that hits them-- AJH: -- moon mantle? 
MARISHA: -- they take double damage. 
MATT: Well, you haven't seen them yet. 
LAURA: We haven't seen the mantles. 
ASHLEY: We haven't seen them yet. Okay, okay. 
LAURA: Only Fjord has-- 
MATT: Marisha, would you place Jester outside of that door? 
ASHLEY: So one of them fucks with time? 
MARISHA: Here-ish? 
MATT: About 15 feet that way. 
LAURA: Would I have been that far? Because I would have rushed to Fjord the minute he was like, (grunts). Being cut in half. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I held it in because he said and then, but I was (grunts) Jester would have moved towards him. So I would have been towards the door. 
MATT: Okay, I'll put you five feet closer on the door. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Because he was right there in the doorway. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm not going through the door. That's where he was being stuck, right? 
MATT: Caleb, Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: You first or me? 
MATT: You move through the door, or do you stay out there? 
TALIESIN: I'm probably going to stay out there because I want activate my armor because this feels inevitable. 
MATT: Okay. So place this by Jester for me, please. Then, Caleb, are you moving in or are you staying out there and casting something? 
LIAM: I am going to be at the doorway peeking in. 
MATT: Okay, that'll work. 
SAM: ♪ Peek on in ♪ 
LIAM: Just half-cover from the doorway, but I want to be able to see what's happening. 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I only used a bonus action. So if I can get near him to-- 
MATT: A bonus action to operate your armor? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, then. Yeah, if you wanted to move in a little closer. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, a little closer. 
MARISHA: I have a feeling they're trying to keep it in. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Or something crazy? 
TALIESIN: Want to be able to see. 
MATT: Okay. Now I would like you all to roll initiative, please. 
SAM: Oh boysies. 
LIAM: Oh jeebers. 
SAM: That's not good. 
TALIESIN: Roll low, roll low. 
TRAVIS: Hey, there's a 20. 
MARISHA: Roll high. 
TALIESIN: Yay. 
LIAM: That's pretty good. 
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh. 
TRAVIS: Did I got to a new page? 
MARISHA: And I got my boots. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I get advantage. 
MARISHA: Boots, boots, boots, boots, boots. 
SAM: I got boots, they're made for walking. 
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry. 
ASHLEY: That was sad. 
TALIESIN: That was sad. 
MARISHA: 16 plus five is 21. 
ASHLEY: That was really sad. 
MATT: 25 to 20? 
TRAVIS: Natural 20. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MARISHA: 21. 
LAURA: What does that put you at, Fjord? 
TRAVIS: 20. 
MATT: (laughs) Okay. 
TRAVIS: I have no initiative bonus. 
MATT: So we have Beauregard at 21. 
MARISHA: 21. Ugh. 
TRAVIS: And then Fjord. 
MARISHA: Uh oh. 
MATT: Then Fjord. 
TRAVIS: Good, we can talk. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: At 20. 
MARISHA: I mean, I was going to come out swinging. 
MATT: All right, 20 to 15? 
TRAVIS: We can talk. 
LIAM: 15. 
LAURA: 16. 
TRAVIS: Probably be swinging anyway. 
MATT: 16, what's your dex? 
MARISHA: We can swing while we talk. 
LAURA: Oh gosh, plus four. 
MATT: Plus four, okay. 
TALIESIN: Jester. 
MATT: So we'll say-- 
TALIESIN: Caleb. 
TRAVIS: Beau, Fjord, Jester, Caleb. 
MARISHA: Jester, Caleb. 
MATT: Caleb, what's your dex? 
LIAM: My dex is shit, it's 12. 
TRAVIS: Why are you asking? 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's got to be a baddie. 
MATT: Okay, 15 to 10? 10 to five? 
SAM: Eight. 
TALIESIN: Five. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm six. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
ASHLEY: So you're five? 
TALIESIN: I'm five. 
MATT: So, Veth, Yasha. 
LAURA: That's actually the best place for a healer to be. 
TALIESIN: Yup. 
LAURA: That's great, Caduce. 
SAM: I still don't know how to spell Caduceus. 
LAURA: I just put Cad. 
TALIESIN: Just put Cad. 
LIAM: Cad-duce-eus. 
SAM: Caduceus. 
TRAVIS: Caduceus. 
MARISHA: You say that, and it's not helpful. 
LIAM: Treat it like a Latin name, like a Roman. Caduceus. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: They were Greek, I believe. 
MATT: Friends. 
TRAVIS: Oh god, oh god, oh god. 
MATT: After the psychic tug-of-war upon Fjord Stone, he vanishes into a puff of magical energy. Beauregard turns invisible and charges in after, where you see him within the chamber standing there at the ready. You're uncertain, you cannot actually see anything in here at the moment, but you can see where he's standing and where he's focused on. You rush up to feel that (magical pulsing) that static sensation is strong, this intense pressure on your consciousness, just by proximity, right next to where this crystal is right there. You're uncertain if it's the crystal or where this entity might be, but you can kind of, given that you're a monk with that high enough wisdom, know that it's nearby, and you also have initiative. Beauregard, what would you like to do? 
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to run up and scream for Fjord. Fjord! Where is he? What are we doing? 
TRAVIS: He's right in front of me. 
MARISHA: (grunts with effort) I'm going to swing. 
MATT: Okay. Jumping into combat, let's go. 
MARISHA: Yeah. ♪ Poppita-poppita pop-pop-pop-pop ♪ 
MATT: All right, your attacks have disadvantage because you cannot see what you're attacking. 
MARISHA: Okay. That's fair. That's fair. Okay. 
LAURA: I wonder how best if they can all be made visible? 
MARISHA: Sorry. Let me get-- 
SAM: Maybe hitting them will make them...? 
MARISHA: First attack. Ah! It's a natural 20 and a natural 16. 
SAM: Pretty good. 
MARISHA: Which is going to put me at 29 to hit. put me at 29 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. Roll damage for that strike. 
MARISHA: Let me do my second attack? Actually, no. Let's start with this one. 1d12 plus seven. 
TALIESIN: Crit with regular damage was 29. 
MARISHA: Okay, that's good. That's going to be 16 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Stunning Strike. 
MATT: Stunning Strike. Yeah, that's a 29. 
LAURA: What?! 
MATT: I rolled really high. (laughs) 
MARISHA: 29. 
MATT: I rolled really high. 
TRAVIS: Nice. Warm it up, Matt. Warm it up. 
MARISHA: Second attack. Ugh! What the fuck? Another natural 20 and a two. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: So 15 total. 
MATT: 15 fails. 
ASHLEY: Ugh! 
MATT: You impact, and as your fist hits, the first hit, (forceful impact) the rest of you can see this psychic ripple in this space in the general shape of this entity that you had seen, but the rest of you caught at the periphery of your vision on the arrival to this area, to this penta-throne region. 
MARISHA: Shakes a little, you said? 
MATT: You see, in the air, this "Predator" shifting ripple in the air, and then it vanishes. Your second strike goes wide however, almost like it's deflected off some sort of a psychic barrier, not even air pressure, but some force pushes your fist away to hit nothing. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: We don't see Beau striking because she's invisible? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Oh man. 
MATT: The rest of you see (energy warbling), this ripple in the air. 
SAM: After it gets hit, does it become visible? 
MATT: Nope. 
LAURA: Cool. 
LIAM: Cool. 
SAM: Cool. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: What the fuck? 
TRAVIS: That's a good shirt. 
MARISHA: It's actually a really great shirt. 
LIAM: Wow. 
MARISHA: It might be my favorite one. 
LIAM: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) "Oh wow." 
ASHLEY: Oh, gorgeous. 
TALIESIN: Wow, that was a long time ago. 
ASHLEY: That's a good one. That might be my favorite. 
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows. 
MATT: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: That was a weird night. 
MARISHA: Man, I've got some good rolls here, but that's going to be an 18. 
MATT: 18 misses. 
ASHLEY: Ugh! 
LAURA: Fuck! 
MARISHA: 18 misses. Second one. 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
MARISHA: Oh, well that's a nine. Oh, wait, but it's disadvantage, no. 17, miss, miss. 
MARISHA: Miss, miss. 
MATT: (punching air) It's almost like something is catching your blows and shearing them off in different directions without seeing where it is, some sort of sourceless force. 
MARISHA: They said, "Let's talk," in his head, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: We don't know that. We just know that he got bamfed in there and then-- 
TRAVIS: I did say they wanted to talk. 
MATT: You did mention that out loud. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, but then you got bamfed in and you were like-- 
TRAVIS: I bamfed in before. 
LAURA: But we don't know that. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: This is the initiative count 20. 
TRAVIS: Can I use the beginning of my turn to reach out and try and stop the swinging of arms that I'm barely catching in my periphery? Beau, no, wait, wait. 
MARISHA: What, what, what? 
TRAVIS: You want to converse. Now would be the time. This is easily the most architecturally impressive area we've seen since we've landed on this moon. What is this? Who are you? What are you doing? 
MATT: The figure, as you see it, turns and drifts, its arms dangling at the side, its fingers reaching out, and as it does, it lifts up. As it breathes in, you see all the crystals in the chamber light up with its breath and then slightly fade as it breathes outward. You can see in this chamber the other one that you saw here. One up here. 
SAM: Wait, they're all becoming visible? 
LAURA: No, only Fjord can see-- 
MATT: No, but it's Fjord's turn, and he can see them. 
LAURA: -- all of the-- Because he's got True Sight up, right? 
TRAVIS: See Invisibility from the sword. 
LIAM: Bitchin' miniatures. 
MATT: You also, at a glance, you can see in some of these, the heavy pulses, shifting, movement, imagery, for a brief second, that seems to connotate something beyond just the presence in the room, and you see the focus onto this core bit there. You glance around your shoulder towards that archway, and there's a ripple in the space there where you can see what looks like the shadow of a battlefield, of hundreds of people colliding. 
TRAVIS: That's the other fight. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: They're using these to (energy blasting). 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: VR, VR-ing in. 
TRAVIS: Feels like it. 
LAURA: This is how they fucked up Vex. 
TRAVIS: Maybe. 
MARISHA: Yes. Because they were bamfing beams. That's 100% what it is. 
ASHLEY: That's the archway or the circle? 
LAURA: It's focusing it through the circle? 
MATT: That's what it seems to be. At least, from you, you glance over here. There's a sparkle of energy here, and in that archway there, you can see that ripple and the imagery moving forward. It fades for a moment as all of them turn towards you. They just wait. 
TRAVIS: No answer to the question? Oh god, I'm talking with my mouth. Do they do that? No way to know. Cool. 
MATT: They've been talking into your mind. But the initiative count is paused for the moment. They seem to be waiting. 
LAURA: Waiting for what? 
SAM: For him to talk. 
TRAVIS: I asked a question. 
MARISHA: Are they talking in your head? Beau asks Fjord. Are they saying anything in your brain? 
TRAVIS: No, no, nothing in my brain. I'm of my own free will at the moment. 
LAURA: Tell them to stop attacking Exandria. 
TRAVIS: That's my friend, Jester. She would like you to stop attacking. 
LAURA: I'm his fiancée. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, yes. My fiancée, Jester. I don't think he's attacking, they're attacking Exandria. We're on the moon. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: I think we're trying to understand what it is that's happening in this room. Are you the Weave Mind? 
MATT: You hear the gentlest of mild chuckles. 
MATT: You hear the gentlest of mild chuckles. "(chuckles)" That begins to break into a dozen, and then dozens. It's almost like the laughter's coming from all directions around you and all of them drift about a foot more off the ground, and without words, your answer is placed within your psyche. They all seem to be looking expectantly towards you as the five voices at once layering over each other into your mind say, "Why have you come?" 
TRAVIS: We've been tasked with stopping Predathos, 
TRAVIS: We've been tasked with stopping Predathos, but there's division amongst those that we've come from. Some say he should he stopped. Others say he should be let loose. What say the one, two, three, four, five of you? 
MATT: "We ensure the future of our people. We seek the Blue Dream that you squander. We are the vessels for its will, and we will see our people freed. So where do you stand, Fjord Stone?" 
TRAVIS: Oof. That's very personal. 
MARISHA: What'd he say? I still don't know if this is in his head only. 
MATT: This is in his head. The rest of you are just standing in the door watching this. 
TRAVIS: We have the pleasure of being in the presence of the Weave Mind. They are tasked with being the vessels of Predathos, and they aspire to one day inhabit the Blue Dream that we take so-- take for granted. 
LAURA: They want to be the vessels? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA: Of Predathos? 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
LAURA: But didn't Ludinus say that he wanted to have the vessels of Predathos? 
TRAVIS: You make an excellent point. Where does Ludinus Da'leth fit into all of this, as the vessels of Predathos? 
MATT: "We are the vessels of his will." 
LAURA: I don't think that you are. I think he's planning to betray you. That's just-- I'm not hearing that. Shit. Sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) Everyone that's outside the doors, make a strength saving throw. 
SAM: Outside the doors? 
MATT: Yeah. Including you, Caleb. So it'd be Jester, Caduceus, and Caleb. 
LIAM: You have Fortune's Favor, too, remember, Jester. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 20. 
MATT: 20? Okay. 
LAURA: 11. 
LIAM: 17. 
MATT: 17. Both Jester and Caleb, you feel this force grasp your shoulders and you both get shunted into the room. 
LIAM: Am I able to fight it-- 
MATT: 30 feet. 
LIAM: -- myself with my own Telekinesis, which I think I'd be on the tail end of? 
MATT: Sure, I'll allow it. Let's roll off. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Bye! 
LIAM: So it's just modifier plus the roll, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: That's just a 13 for me. 
MATT: 24, unfortunately. 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: So, both you and Jester get moved 30 feet into the chamber. If you wouldn't mind-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- shifting over there for me. Thank you. 
LIAM: Place them where you want. 
MATT: You get shunted to about there, Jester. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: And Caleb, about there. (forceful shove) You resist this? 
TALIESIN: I resist it, but just to be that person, I'm going to walk in. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I feel it but I'm going to make it clear that-- 
LAURA: That's awesome. 
MATT and LIAM: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I will, actually-- They're going to shut the door, aren't they? 
MATT: So you step in on your own will? 
TALIESIN: I'm stepping in on my own will and I'm going to gently close the door behind me. 
MATT: Okay, hand me Caduceus-- 
TALIESIN: To make a point. 
MATT: -- if you don't mind. 
LIAM: Yeah. You got it. 
MATT: As he steps into the chamber. That's his concentration marker there. The doors-- (slam shut) You turn to move it and then they slam immediately shut. 
TALIESIN: I was going to get it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Wow, this is a really cool big, empty room. 
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I just do my Far Step to the opposite side of where this particular member, Steve, of the Weave Mind is? And say: Listen, everyone. They have something to tell us. 
LAURA: I don't see them. 
LIAM: Where are they, Fjord? 
TRAVIS: If you would be so kind, it might help with the conversing. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
MARISHA: Come on! Come on! 
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on. 
SAM: Yeah, persuade them. 
MATT: As this one drifts up into the air. 
TRAVIS: What about a deception check instead? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It goes into the air? 
MATT: Well, so you're trying to convince them to reveal themselves. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Perception, or persuasion? 
MATT: This is persuasion. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: He drifts up into the air above you both. 
MARISHA: Would that proc my Sentinel Strike? Because he's leaving my range. 
MATT: If you'd like to hit him, yeah. 
LAURA: But that might-- 
LIAM: Probably squash the convo though. 
TRAVIS: 16 on persuasion. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Which isn't great. 
MATT: What would like to do? 
LIAM: We want to see them. We want to see them. 
MARISHA: Ah! Shit. 
LIAM: It's better if we can see them. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Swing away, bro. 
MARISHA: Swing away? 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: What are you doing, Beauregard? 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll pop him. Let's go. 
MATT: All right, roll for an attack with disadvantage. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: ♪ Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ♪ Fuck! Wait, disadvantage? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I mean, I don't know why I'm-- I didn't hit. I didn't hit. 
TRAVIS: Well, actually-- 
LIAM: They both sucked. 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: You go to punch and your fist feels like it's pushed-- 
MARISHA: We can still talk. 
MATT: -- out of the air by some intense pressure in the immediate atmosphere and your arm goes down to the ground as it glides up about 30 feet into the air. Now all of you can hear throughout your minds the singular woven dynamic of their five voices speaking as one-- 
LAURA: Whoa! 
MATT: -- like a perpetually shifting discordant series of phrases. 
LAURA: Have you guys ever thought of becoming a barbershop quartet or something? 
TRAVIS: ♪ (barbershop quartet-like hum) ♪ 
TALIESIN: Quintet? 
MATT: "You arrive here for the purpose that all do in times of challenge and war, to stop us. A shame. Throwing your lives away when they could be so much more useful." 
TALIESIN: Why are we here, really? To stop you, why? Why should we stop you? 
MATT: The voices all trickle into your mind. All of yours, but yours, specifically. "You would destroy the beginnings of our home and trudge through our halls, killing our kin to do something other?" 
TALIESIN: I'm not going to say that isn't a possibility. But it didn't have to be that way. What do you want? 
MATT: You see one of the other crystals, there's a flash in it from that shade of other combat that's going on, and you see a dulled detonation within the image within that crystal. It seems like others in this chamber are still focusing on the crystals nearby and keeping their attention elsewhere while having this conversation. 
TALIESIN: I thought you wanted the Blue Dream. 
MATT: "We will have it." 
TALIESIN: You will not. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You're so clever and you're so foolish. You're going to kill it. You don't know what it is. You're not prepared for what's down there. It's going to die, and you will be left with less than what you have now. 
MATT: "Exandrian rodents. Insignificant beings." 
TALIESIN: Without mice, all of it dies. Everything dies without mice. 
LAURA: And bees! 
TALIESIN: And very much bees. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't begrudge anyone wanting a little change of scenery, you know. If you want to move, that's fine. But doesn't sound like you're going to play nice with the rest of us, so, (clicks tongue). 
TALIESIN: Place will not be nice if you burn it down. 
LAURA: The shit of it is that the first person you met was Ludinus, you know, he's a really bad guy. I mean, he's sweet and all but I think he has bad intentions and-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, he's not sweet. 
LAURA: He's probably misleading you guys and you think it's okay, but it's really not. You shouldn't attack everyone. That's not the way to get down there. 
MATT: "Ludinus is serving his purpose. When his purpose is complete, he won't be of concern." 
SAM: Ooh, that's juicy. 
LAURA: Oh, they're going to kill Ludinus. That's exciting. 
SAM: That's juicy. 
TALIESIN: Oh, he knows that. 
MARISHA: I love it when they all think that they've got the upper hand. 
ASHLEY: They're in 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: That somehow they think that person hasn't-- 
ASHLEY: No, I'm in charge. 
TALIESIN: -- figured it out, and-- 
ASHLEY: No, it's me. 
TALIESIN: -- they're already planning how to deal with it. 
LIAM: Like how Mighty Nein all spoke at the same time. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: We've heard this shit before. 
LIAM: Yeah, that tracks. 
TALIESIN: This is embarrassing. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: We also share a mind. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: "You may sit down and watch as we work, or we can finish this charade and send you on your way." 
SAM: There's no chairs in here. 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
SAM: So I guess we have only one choice. (loads gun) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Put it in the trailer. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: "There's no chairs." 
MATT: Okay. I'm going to consider that putting us on initiative point 20. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: All the crystals at once (energy pulsing) flare up. 
LIAM: Time to go to work. 
MATT: You see the one that got punched by Beauregard. It seems like its field, that weird shimmering force field around it, seems to strengthen back to where it was previously. 
LIAM: Still only to Fjord? 
MATT: Yes, because no one else can see them. 
LAURA: Nobody else can see. 
TRAVIS: My Faerie Fire fizzled out. F-f-f. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Faerie Fire. 
SAM: Fjord's Faerie Fire fizzles. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: For fucks-- Okay. 
MATT: And also, we're going to say for its lair action here-- (groaning) 
TALIESIN: Oh, we're going there, are we? 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Shared groan! 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LAURA: We're in trouble. 
MATT: Okay. We're going to go with-- 
TALIESIN: I'm in danger. (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm in danger. 
SAM: We're in danger, girl. 
MATT: Yup, I'm going to mark that for now. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Good pull. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: So that's going to finish the initiative count 20. Initiative count 19-- 
MARISHA: They just charged up some shit or something? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: -- brings us-- These all vanish from sight for those who cannot see them. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
LAURA: What all vanish from sight? 
MATT: Meaning these here, only Fjord can see on his turn. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: The rest of you have to guess until you can figure out a way to-- 
SAM: There's one more. 
LAURA: There's another one. 
MATT: This one here is its turn. It's going to glide up over this direction. 
MARISHA: Fuck. 
MATT: This is the-- 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: -- Weave Mind manipulator. 
MARISHA: Weave Mind manipulator. 
LAURA: So we're just hearing voices in a big empty room. 
SAM: We got to able to see-- 
LAURA: Except for Fjord. 
SAM: -- these guys. 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: Does anyone have any-- 
MARISHA: Does anyone else have Faerie Fire? 
MATT: You see the crystals in the chamber flaring with certain flashes and bursts of energy. 
LIAM: But it's limitless in small spaces. 
MATT: Okay, it's going to use Horrid Puppet on Beauregard. Beauregard, can you please make a wisdom saving throw for me? 
MARISHA: Now, I am also invisible. 
LIAM: You have an advantage on wisdom saving throws. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Do they have true sight? Can they see me? 
MATT: They don't seem to be bothered by your invisibility. 
TRAVIS: Dang! You said that casual as fuck, dog! 
MARISHA: I know. (laughter) 
MARISHA: All right. Don't seem to be bothered, okay! Let's get these out of here. Fuck off. All right, all right, all right. Advantage on wisdom saves. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: 23. 
MATT: 23 succeeds. Okay. You feel something try and pry into your mind. 
MARISHA: Oh, 28 because I'm next to him. 
TRAVIS: It's fine. 
MATT: That's right, yeah. As it tries to dig into your psyche, you feel like something is trying to pull at your muscles, at your bones, and then you intensify your sense of self and that rock of consciousness and willpower within you and it withdraws. This one here is going to go ahead and shift up to here. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
MATT: Then vanish from sight. 
MARISHA: Okay, so 23 saves. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: So what we'll say here is when it's their turn and they take an action, you watch the air shift in their shape when they do something. 
LAURA: Then they disappear again? 
MATT: So you see a brief ghostly image of where they were and then it dissipates. 
LAURA: Disappears? 
MATT: That finishes its go. Jester, you are up. 
TALIESIN: I have no idea, hold on. Let's find out. No, sorry. 
LAURA: I'm going to look over at Sprinkle. I'm going to look at him and go: I think it's time for something really big to happen. I'm going to ask the Traveler-- 
MARISHA: (claps) Yes, yes, yes! 
LAURA: -- for Divine Intervention. 
MARISHA: This is the time! 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: What's the plan? 
LAURA: I'm going to see if he will-- 
MARISHA: She's Divine Intervention-ing. 
LAURA: -- light up-- 
LIAM: Give us all true sight? 
LAURA: -- all of them, so we can see them. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Yass! 
ASHLEY: Come on, Traveler! 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
SAM: Does it just work? 
LAURA: It's-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Yeah, at level 20 it happens automatically, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Whoa! 
LIAM: You have to wait a week to use it again. 
MATT: Yeah. So as you look towards Sprinkle, Sprinkle is curled up and shaking. All of a sudden, gets relaxed, the eyes flare green, and it looks over towards you. "My goodness. It's hard to see in here. Perhaps you need a little more light." Sprinkle's little claws snap. As it does-- 
TRAVIS: Sweet! 
MATT: -- this bright greenish white light apparates outward. As it does, you watch as that shimmering energy seems to scatter off of it, like dust being knocked off of an antique with a burst of wind. 
TRAVIS: Clutch. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
MATT: Where the Weave Mind stand, even if they try and focus down, their bodies trying to shimmer again. There's this weird flash of energy in the shape of numerous small spectral golden dicks that just-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- scatters it off again and float around-- 
TRAVIS: First dick on the moon! 
MATT: -- like tiny little spectral sprites. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
MATT: They are all now visible. Yeah. 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Jessie! 
LIAM: Clutch. 
SAM: I believe! 
ASHLEY: That was clutch. 
TRAVIS: That's my bitch! 
SAM: I believe! 
TRAVIS: A-ma-zing. 
MATT: Actually, this one was here. 
MARISHA: Bitch be cool. 
ASHLEY: You're doing it, Peter. 
LAURA: You're doing it! 
TRAVIS: Be cool, bitch. Bitch, be cool! 
MATT: All righty. So that's your action. Do you want to move? 
SAM: That's huge. 
MARISHA: That's massive. Let's fucking go. 
ASHLEY: Yes, baby. 
LAURA: Yeah, I will shimmy over this way. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: You shimmy? 
LAURA: (warbling shimmy) 
MATT: 30 can get you about there if you want. 
LAURA: Okay, and then as a bon-- That wasn't a spell, that's Divine Intervention. 
MATT: That's an action, yeah. 
LAURA: So I could cast a bonus spell. 
MATT: You can. 
LAURA: As a bonus spell, I will cast-- Where is it? I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: At-- Fuck. I'm going to do it at 7th-level. 
MATT: 7th-level Spiritual Weapon. 
SAM: Damn! 
MATT: Let's go! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: A spiritual lollipop. 
SAM: Of course. 
TRAVIS: Serrated. 
LAURA: Can I hit it right here and hit him? 
MATT: 30 feet? Sure. 
ASHLEY: ♪ 7th-level ♪ 
LAURA: It's the most beautiful, giant-est lollipop you guys have ever seen. 
SAM: 'ginas? 
ASHLEY: 'ginas? 
LAURA: It's the most 'ginas-- (laughter) 
LAURA: -- lollipop, with 'ginas serrated blades coming off the sides. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Does it have a 'ginas tip? 
LAURA: The ribbons that are normally tied around the pole of it have two maces dangling like-- 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
LAURA: -- balls 
SAM: Just for extra. 
LAURA: Just for extra. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Balls? 
MATT: Great. I love it. 
SAM: Truck nuts. 
TRAVIS: Sugar and balls. (laughter) 
MATT: Perfect. All right, so roll your attack with your Spiritual Weapon against-- 
LAURA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: ♪ 'ginas ♪ 
MATT: -- this member of the Weave Mind. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. That would be-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ 'ginas! ♪ (vocalizes) 
LAURA: I don't know which one that landed on. I won't roll that one. 
MATT: (laughs) Okay, roll again. 
LAURA: 18. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
MATT: 18, unfortunately, misses. 
TALIESIN: That's right, that's right. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: (striking sound) It strikes down and you watch as the Weave Mind, now visible, flicks its hand and this psychic shield deflects it off the top of it. The giant serrated lollipop (sawing sound) tries to chainsaw into it. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MATT: Sparks flying off, divine energy before it pulls back. 
LAURA: I see you! 
MATT: Turns to you. "I see you." 
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to roll a Blink! Oh, and I didn't. Damn it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: All right, Jester, that finishes your turn. All right, that means it's now going to be one of the Ego Hunters here. 
ASHLEY and SAM: Ego Hunters? 
LIAM: Oh! 
SAM: Don't like that. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: (heavy exhale) 
MATT: Yeah, since you're the one that just tried to strike it, Jester. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It's going to try and come after you with Mental Evisceration. Roll a wisdom saving throw for me, please. 
LAURA: That's advantage because we had the Feast. 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: That's a 23. 
MATT: 23 is a success. Which means you only take half damage on this. 
LAURA: Jesus. 
LIAM: (heavy exhale) 
LAURA: Thank god it was at advantage because the other one was a one. 
ASHLEY: I'm stressed. 
TRAVIS: Are you? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Why didn't I Blink?! 
SAM: I don't know what to do. 
MATT: So you take 19 points of psychic damage. 
MATT: So you take 19 points of psychic damage. 
LAURA: Yowza! 
MATT: That's for half of it. And that's all the effect it has on you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: And then it's going to (drifting sound) drift back onto this bridge here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Floating above it. 
SAM: Should we attack the pillars? Should we attack them? Should we attack the central pillar? What are we doing here? 
MATT: Sense Render's going to go now. 
SAM: I don't think we can kill them all. 
LAURA: Okay, wait. 
TALIESIN: Clearly, all of it is-- 
MARISHA: You don't think we can kill them all? 
TALIESIN: The pillars heal, which-- 
SAM: There's five of them. 
TALIESIN: -- makes me think they would be easy to kill. 
LAURA: Since they have-- Wait, you said-- what did you call the first one? 
MATT: I'm talking out loud for my things. There's the sense render, the ego hunter, and the manipulator were the ones that I've mentioned. 
TALIESIN: Ah, fuck. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MARISHA: Sense render. 
LAURA: The ego hunter is the one that just hit me. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so they're all different kinds of hunters? That's fun. 
MARISHA: Ego hunter. 
MATT: This one here is going to drift-- 
TALIESIN: Sense render is blind-- 
MATT: -- up a bit to about here. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: It's going to focus down in that cluster there. 
LAURA: They've all got different arm positions. That's so cool. 
MATT: Yeah, definitely within range. So it's 20 foot within Yasha. That's going to be Veth, Caduceus, Yasha, and Caleb. 
SAM: Oh god. 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: I need you all to make an intelligence saving throw. 
LAURA: Intelligence saving throw? 
ASHLEY: Do I do any because I have Mind Blank? Does this do anything? 
MATT: We'll come to that here in a second. 
LAURA: I don't have to-- 
LIAM: Oh, you don't have to roll. 
LAURA: I'm not in the bubble. 
SAM: I get advantage on this. 
ASHLEY: Intelligence saving throw. 
TALIESIN: That's bad. Let's see, I think I have a thing that will help. Nope. Here we go. 
SAM: Wow, good. 
TALIESIN: No one told me there'd be intelligence saving throws. 
MATT: All right, Caleb. 
TALIESIN: (grimaces) 
LIAM: 25. 
MATT: 25. You take no psychic damage and you are unaffected by this effect. Veth. 
SAM: 28. 
MATT: 28, you take half damage, so you take 21 points of psychic damage. 
SAM: I'm also now resistant to psychic damage. 
MATT: So you take half of that. 
SAM: So that's 10. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right, Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: 11. 
MATT: 11. I just said it for you, it was-- 
SAM: 21. 
MATT: 21, so you take 42 points of psychic damage. 
LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
MATT: And you cannot take reactions until the Weave Mind's next turn. Yasha, what was your roll? 
ASHLEY: 17. 
MATT: 17. That's a failure. You cannot take reactions, but you do not take any psychic damage because of your spell. 
LIAM: Because of Mind Blank. 
MARISHA: And also Mind Blank. 
MATT: So as this rippling burst of crackling psychic energy burns in the space-- 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
MATT: -- it affects some of you, but Yasha and Caleb both shrug it off mostly and you can see the Weave Mind take note of this. In your minds you hear, "Ah, they came prepared. Shifting of strategies then." 
SAM: I'm holding concentration. Do I have to roll anything for that? 
MATT: Hmm? 
SAM: Because I just got hurt. 
MATT: Correct, yeah, if you're holding, you're holding a spell. so roll. 
SAM: 15. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. It's a constitution saving throw to see if you maintain concentration. You're fine. All right, that finishes its go. Caleb, it's now your turn. 
TALIESIN: I have-- 
LIAM: So Caleb hears that in his mind and says, Strategy, ja. You hear his voice echoing with arcane sheen: Halt. And he just ceases to be as I cast Time Stop. 
MATT: Ah. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Whoo! 
LAURA: Sickest spell. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! What? 
LAURA: I want that spell so bad. 
TRAVIS: What?! 
MARISHA: Who went where? 
TRAVIS: Zoop! 
SAM: On time. 
TALIESIN: 20 on the-- Actually, it's a constitution save. 
LIAM: I just rolled a d4. I rolled a four on the d4, so I have five. 
MATT: Five rounds of preparation-- 
LIAM: Five rounds of prep. 
MATT: -- which you have, correct. You basically have five rounds to do whatever you want to until you cast a spell on another creature. 
LIAM: That hurts. Yes, that hurts a creature, yes. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You can, or everybody can? 
MATT: He can. 
LIAM: Okay, well, I'm-- 
LAURA: You can do five rounds and stuff-- 
LIAM: You guys are (slow motion). 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: -- while we're all frozen. 
SAM: He's the flash. 
LIAM: So I'm watching everything frozen in place. 
MATT: It's not about even damage, it's a spell that affects another creature. 
LIAM: Affects a creature. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Including me? 
MATT: No, another. 
LIAM: Another creature. 
LAURA: Oh, so you can't affect anybody else. You can only prep on yourself? 
TRAVIS: But you could set them up to go, right? 
LIAM: Right, so, I have five turns. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: First turn 
TALIESIN: Whoo! 
LIAM: -- is-- 
ASHLEY: Wait, what do you mean he has five turns? He can do five things right now? 
LAURA: But it can't affect anybody else. 
SAM: Well, the last one can. 
TRAVIS: Let's watch the chef cook. Let's watch the chef cook, yeah. 
MATT: Please, describe to me what it looks like as Caleb Widogast stops time. 
LIAM: Well, all of the five are glowing with little golden celestial dicks around them and they all freeze in place. Caleb looks and turns and sees all of the Nein frozen in place looking forward, and he begins to walk this way and I cast Mirror Image-- 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
LIAM: -- to begin. I cast Fire Shield, so there are, in this slowly-stretched time, there are three Caleb Widogasts all burning like the human torch-- 
ASHLEY: Someone starts, someone starts. 
LIAM: -- As he walks through space, one, two. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. 
MATT: Part of those are concentration, right? 
LIAM: None of them are concentration. DM, you said that their computer HUD of the battlefield is where in this space? 
MARISHA: Kind of where the stargate is. 
MATT: The what? The computer HUD? 
LIAM: They were looking at the battlefield. Is it here? 
MATT: Oh. 
LIAM: Is it between these pieces? 
MATT: I mean, they're looking into crystals and then there was a brief shimmering image of the battlefield in that arch. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh. In the arch. 
LIAM: I would like to use my-- 
TRAVIS: Don't walk through there, I've seen "Harry Potter." 
LIAM: -- my third action, because I still have Telekinesis up-- 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: -- to grab hold of this arch and try to rip it broken down. 
MATT: Okay. All right, so go ahead and make a d20 roll adding your modifier. 
SAM: Strength or-- 
LIAM: Ah, shitty! 12. 
MATT: 12, so you focus in. 
LIAM: 1,000 pounds. 
MATT: The arch begins to crack and cracks begin to sow through it. As it cracks, you can see all the other crystals flare a little bit-- Or they would, but time has stopped. So it cracks a little bit. You can continue to try again if you want to, to keep pulling on it, but it is reacting to your telekinetic grab and yank. but it is reacting to your telekinetic grab and yank. 
LIAM: I'll return to that. So all this time, because I have so much movement, I've been moving this way and in Caleb's mind, he's thinking that with Mind Blank, hopefully they're not able to track him, so by the end of this, he's going to be behind this pillar. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: Okay, cool. 
LIAM: But on the way, I will next slam bat guano and sulfur between my hands and twist it in a disc and pull my hands apart and shoot out a little mote of fiery light that pauses in the air, right in the middle, and freezes in place and it's-- 
MATT: Delayed Blast Fireball. 
LIAM: -- Delayed Blast Fireball. (oohing) 
LIAM: Its trigger is the end of this Time Freeze. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Fucking cool. 
LAURA: Sick. 
MATT: Okay, I'm going to, because it's fun to do. 
ASHLEY: Kaboom! 
MARISHA: Look at that. 
LIAM: So the 20 feet from each of those three triangulated in there. 
MATT: Uh-huh. You got it. (sizzles) 
LIAM: That's four actions. For my fifth action, as I step behind this pillar, I throw out a Fireball at 7th-level. 
SAM: Yeah! 
MATT: (laughs) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Wait, so you're double Fireballing? 
LAURA: A double fireballing. 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
MARISHA: (intense explosion) 
LAURA: Sick. 
MATT: Hell yes. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's some wizard shit. 
TRAVIS: (explosion) 
TALIESIN: That's wizard shit right there. 
MATT: So, as soon as you cast-- 
LIAM: I can't believe I rolled a four. 
MATT: As soon as you cast that last Fireball, the bead goes out and (brief interrupted explosion) suddenly the time flow begins to rapidly move again. In that moment, there's this flash out of nowhere. Caleb is gone. Then (massive explosions)-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: -- a chaotic series of extreme detonations that almost deafen everyone within the chamber, causing dust and stone to fall from above the ground. 
MARISHA: Guys, it's the Resistance. Yeah! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: (claps) All right, so yeah. 
TRAVIS: It's not the Resistance. 
MATT: I'm not even going to have to measure the fireball radius on this one. 
TRAVIS: It's him. 
MATT: That catches all three of those. 
LIAM: Regular Fireball at 7th-level is 11d6, and the Delayed Blast Fireball is 12d6. 
MATT: Correct, so do them-- 
SAM: 23d6. 
MATT: You have to them separately because they're two different saving throws. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LIAM: Seven, eight, nine, 10. The first one to hit would be the regular fireball. 
MATT: Correct, I will say-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- because you did this as part of a Time Stop, they're going to have disadvantage on their dexterity saving throws since they literally-- 
LIAM: Are frozen. 
MATT: You just vanished and it all happened at once, so it's a brief instinct where in that brief little fraction of a second, they psychically acknowledge-- 
TRAVIS: C4. 
MATT: -- "Oh shit." That's the only reaction they have, so I'll acknowledge that there. 
LIAM: Whah! 
MATT: All right, so this guy here on your first, so roll damage on this. And then we'll-- 
LIAM: Two, five-- 
SAM: My dead Katzenprinz. (laughter) 
LIAM: 15, 18, 21. 27, 30, 33. 33, 37, 39. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: For one. 
MATT: Makes the save there with natural 20 and natural 18, so even with disadvantage. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Woo! 
MATT: That is a success. 
TRAVIS: You need to roll like this, Herr Mercer. 
LAURA: Is that the one, which one had the Fireball? 
MATT: That's this one here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All three of them, all three of those get hit twice. 
LIAM: Did I say 39? 
MATT: Yes, 39. 
SAM: 39. 
MATT: So he takes, so it'd be-- 18, right? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: That's 18 damage. 
SAM: No, 19. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
MATT: No, sorry, 19 damage from that one. Damage there, this one here, that's going to be a 20. What's your DC? 
LIAM: Oh, 22. 
MATT: 22, yeah, so there's going to be 39, and then this one here. Ooh, less, so another 39. Okay, and now for the other one. 
LIAM: Two, four, make sure I have the right number of dice, six, eight, 10, 12, yeah, okay, we're good. 
SAM: ♪ Too many cooks ♪ 
LIAM: Three, nine, 14, 18, 20, 27. 34. 
LAURA: (coughs) 
TALIESIN: Bless you. 
LIAM: 41 that time. 
MATT: 41, all right, so over here, disadvantage. Fail. 
SAM: Nice. 
MATT: This one here. Fail again. This one here. That is going to succeed with a 24. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So, (double blast exploding) the blasts explode and the three of them are engulfed in two layers of arcane fire. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: That's going to be a total of-- 
LIAM: Goodbye, 9th-level spell slot. 
LAURA: Worth it. 
MATT: 178. 
ASHLEY: Worth it. 
TALIESIN: What a-- 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
TALIESIN: What a-- 
ASHLEY: That was cool. 
TALIESIN: That was a baller move. 
ASHLEY: That was fucking cool. 
TALIESIN: Does the fireball damage the crystal towers, too? 
LIAM: That's up to the DM. 
ASHLEY: I think it does. 
TALIESIN: That'd be cool. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to-- 
LAURA: I think it probably does. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm pretty sure. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to comment without-- 
LIAM: These flames burn different. 
TALIESIN: Without a-- 
LAURA: Do the flames affect the crystals? 
MATT: These crystals are immune to fire. 
TALIESIN: Gotcha. 
MATT: The flames coursed around them and have no effect on the crystals themselves. As those three take the impact, the shields around them seem to absorb some of it and the rest that burns through, you watch as all five of the Weave Mind react to the pain. (oohing) 
MATT: And the ones that are impacted don't look as hurt as they should have been, and ones that weren't impacted-- 
LIAM: They dispersed it. 
MATT: -- seemed to take a little bit of a hit. Even though they were outside the blast. 
LIAM: Those motherfuckers dispersed it. 
LAURA: Interesting. 
ASHLEY: They dispersed it between? 
LIAM: They're a hippie commune. 
LAURA: That's cool. 
MATT: The temporary hit points of all of their shields currently are gone. (oohing) 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: Since they share the damage amongst themselves. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Interesting, okay, so you'll be able to get-- 
LIAM: With their images. 
LAURA: Their AC is down, basically. 
MATT: Well no, their-- 
TRAVIS: Temporary hit points. 
MATT: -- The temporary hit points are gone. 
LAURA: Oh, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it. 
LIAM: We're whittling away. 
MATT: All right, Caleb, that finishes your turn. 
LIAM: Oh ja. 
TALIESIN: Damn. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
LAURA: Ooh, damn. 
ASHLEY: Finishes your turns. 
MATT: Okay, the other ego hunter that was caught in this blast, looks around and its mind reaches out and can't seem to find yours because of your Mind Blank. Let's see. Roll a stealth check for me. (laughs) This is a contested stealth versus its-- 
LIAM: It's a one! (oohing) 
LIAM: It's because I'm on fire. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Over here! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: It does -- 
MARISHA: You think they can see me? 
LAURA: You don't see me! 
ASHLEY: I'm hidden, you guys. 
LIAM: There's three burning. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Inflatable tube guys. 
MATT: It's going to-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
MATT: Yep. (laughter) 
MATT: This one is going to drift out. 
SAM: Oh no! 
MATT: Up to about here to get it within 30 feet of you, Caleb, and is going to Gouge Ether on you. 
ASHLEY: This is such a cool map. 
LIAM: Is it a spell? 
MARISHA: Gouge Ether? 
MATT: This is a-- 
LIAM: Or a feature? 
MATT: It is a feature, it is an ability, yes. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Ether. 
MATT: 26 to hit? 
LIAM: Ja, that will hit. 
MATT: You do have Mirror Image on you. 
LIAM: I do. Yeah. 
MATT: So roll to see if it hits you or one of your images. 
LIAM: One of my burning duplicates. 
SAM: Your burning men? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
ASHLEY: One of my burning mens. 
LIAM: So it's with a six or higher. It's a two. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: A wha? 
MATT: So it-- 
SAM: So that was not good. 
MATT: It reaches into the very essence of what makes you a channel for Arcana. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: And tears something from within that spiritual fiber. You take 28 points of force damage. 
LIAM: Not psychic damage. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Force damage. 
MATT: They've shifted tactics. 
LIAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
MATT: So it's force damage. And roll a d4 for me. 
MARISHA: Their headdresses-- 
LIAM: Oh dear. 
MARISHA: -- are different too. Just saying. 
LIAM: Drive it like you stole it. That's a three. 
MATT: Three, you lose three spell slots. 
LAURA: (gasp) 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: Three levels of spell slots. 
LAURA: Three levels of spell slots. 
SAM: What does that mean? 
LIAM: Wow. 
SAM: Three level ones or-- 
LAURA: Three level ones. 
LAURA: Or one three. 
MATT: Your choice. 
LIAM: It's my choice. My choice, okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Oh my geebees. What if all you have is high-level spells left and they do that? 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
LIAM: I know. I know. I'm looking at what they are. 
ASHLEY: Then you can't do anything. 
MATT: Then you have to start-- 
LIAM: I have Shield for free-- 
MATT: -- casting lower levels. 
LIAM: -- because I'm a level 20 wizard and that's a feature. 
MARISHA: That sucks, bro. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: But you did a lot. 
SAM: You can always cast a level one spell at level two. 
LIAM: Soften them up. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you softened them up. 
MATT: As a bonus action-- 
MARISHA: Wowzers. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: -- it's going to Fold Space. 
LIAM: Wow. 
LAURA: Fold Space? Okay. 
SAM: Fold Space. 
MATT: Teleport here to the ground. 
ASHLEY: Zoomp. 
MATT: At the end of its turn, they're going to use one of their communal legendary actions for that one up in the air-- 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: -- to Fold Space as well. This one's going to teleport. 
SAM: (screams) 
ASHLEY: Hello. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
SAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh no. 
LAURA: Eat it! 
LIAM: Gotcha. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Suck it, manipulator, or whoever the fuck you are. 
TRAVIS: That's Carl. (laughter) 
MARISHA: He's like, "I'm just a janitor!" 
SAM: "I work in accounting." 
ASHLEY: Put in front of-- by you. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh, I see it, yeah. 
TRAVIS: "We're in the middle of an audit." (laughter) 
MATT: And then now this-- 
TRAVIS: "I'm so excited." (laughter) 
MATT: -- one who just teleported over there is going to-- Want to see if it gets its-- 
TALIESIN: Where are you? 
MATT: The other manipulator is going to use its Horrid Puppet-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm right after you. 
MATT: -- on-- 
ASHLEY: Horrid Puppet? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what they tried to do to Beau before. 
TRAVIS: Don't you mean Pleasant Puppet? 
MATT: It's going to do it on you, Fjord. 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: Fjord, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw. 
LAURA: No, Fjord! Don't give in, Fjord! 
MARISHA: Wisdom save. You got this. 
LAURA: Just imagine I'm pinching your butt. 
LIAM: At advantage! 
TRAVIS: At advantage? 
LIAM: Because of the dinner, the Heroes' Feast. 
TRAVIS: That's really good. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good. 
TRAVIS: (adding) 34. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Yeah, you resist it no issue. There's a brief moment where you feel like they're trying to push into your consciousness and then you hold your eyes tight and that calm of the Wildmother's protection sends this breeze through your consciousness. 
TRAVIS: Jester. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Bachelor party. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: That's going to finish its turn. 
LIAM: It'll be like the housewarming. 
MATT: At the end of its turn, the whole group's going to use three legendary actions. 
LAURA: Jeez. 
MATT: To do Entropic Storm. 
TRAVIS: What did you call it?! 
MARISHA: Entropic Storm, like the entropic force. 
SAM: Entropic Thunder. 
TRAVIS: Entropis. 
MATT: So, well, actually, this one can move a little bit this way. 
MARISHA: It's going to make us age or something. 
TRAVIS: Stop giving him ideas. 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Shut your fucking mouth. 
LIAM: We don't need any help, okay? 
SAM: Is it? 
MATT: Between those three there, all that are triangulated between them are affected, so that's going to be Fjord, Beau, and Yasha. 
TRAVIS: Triangulated off of the Weave Mind members? 
MATT: The three of these here. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: All of you between there. I think Jester is just outside of that range. 
TRAVIS: That's a large AoE. 
LIAM: No idea if this has anything to do with the brain, but Yasha's got Mind Blank. 
MATT: I know. So I need you all to make intelligence saving throws for me. 
TALIESIN: I should've gotten the intelligence save. 
ASHLEY: I'm so smart. 
TALIESIN: I thought it was going to be wisdom. 
LIAM: Come on, roll high. Come on, Johnson. Come on, Barb, let's go. Roll high or low? 
ASHLEY: Natural 20. (cheering) That'll come in handy. That'll come in handy. 
LIAM: No Barbara Downs. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: No. Yeah. Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: So that's a success. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: You take no damage. 
ASHLEY: Take no damage? Okay, okay. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Barbara Downs 
MATT: Beauregard? 
MARISHA: 30. 
MATT: 30. So you take half damage. You take 21 points of psychic damage. 
MARISHA: I am resistant to all damage. 
MATT: So half that, you take 10. 
MATT: Fjord? 
TRAVIS: 22. 
MATT: 22, just barely succeeds. So you also take 20 points of psychic damage. 
TRAVIS: Dude. 
LIAM: Plus you're invisigable. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
MATT: All right, that's going to finish their go. Veth, you're up with Yasha on deck. 
TRAVIS: Rough. 
SAM: Is it within melee of me? 
MATT: It is. 
SAM: Jesus. I can't even move. But it probably can't hit things. 
TALIESIN: You have a knife. 
LIAM: You can disengage as a rogue. 
SAM: But I want to use my bonus action for something else. 
LIAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: French kiss. 
LIAM: They have really weak noodle arms, though, so-- 
SAM: That's what I think. 
TALIESIN: They might have the ability to cast a spell. 
TRAVIS: Jokes on you! 
LAURA: Oh, that's true, war casters. They're probably war casters. 
LIAM: Yeah, war casters can hit you as you go. 
TRAVIS: We used TRX bands. (laughter) 
SAM: Wait. So I tried to make a glass crossbow bolt at some point and then also they gave me a glass knife. What do those do again? 
MARISHA: You crit on like a-- 
LIAM: They light up-- 
MATT: 19 or 20. 
MARISHA: -- 19 or 20. 
LIAM: Because they're sharp. 
MATT: And if psychic damage is dealt to the target-- 
SAM: To me, or to my target? 
LAURA: To your target. 
MATT: It helps somebody who is psychically-focused to further hinder the target of the blade. So it opens up the target to a little bit of psychic damage. 
SAM: I see. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay. 
SAM and LAURA: (meow) (laughter) 
SAM: And I have a feature called Naturally Stealthy. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: That says that I can hide behind someone who's bigger than me? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. Even though that guy's right next to me, could I hide from it (laughs), if I went over to Yasha? 
ASHLEY: Hide behind me? 
MATT: Yasha is bigger than you, yeah. 
SAM: I know, but would it lose? I'm right next to it! Does that make any sense? 
MATT: Yeah, no. It's like the, what are they, the announcers of Digitopolis in the Phantom Tollbooth animated movie where they all hide behind each other and then sneak each other behind. So you just run behind Yasha and, like a cartoon character, disappear. If you went ahead-- 
LIAM: Yeah, sure, sure. 
SAM: Does he get an attack on me as I go? 
MATT: It can choose to if it wants to, and it does not. 
SAM: Oh great. 
LIAM: For a split second, I thought you were making a "Megalopolis" reference. (laughter) 
SAM: Yeah, so as I run, 
ASHLEY: Come to my protection. I'll just go, "Look over there!" and then I'll hide behind Yasha (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Why not? 
SAM: I'll use my bonus action to hide. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: From the MENSA-level psychic-- 
SAM: So I roll stealth? What do I roll? 
MATT: Yeah, roll stealth. 
SAM: At advantage. 
MARISHA: Makes this a little bit more valuable. 
SAM: A million. 35. 
MATT: Okay, you feel pretty well-hidden. 
SAM: Uh-huh. You literally just walked past her behind and, like closeup magic, you just don't exist anymore. 
SAM: Great. 
LAURA: The Weave Mind's like, "Whoa, whoa!" 
MATT: "That's crazy! How'd you even?" 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: The prestige. (laughter) Then, I will duck down, lift up Yasha's cloak from between her legs and I'll fire on this guy right here. 
MATT: Go for it. Roll an attack. 
SAM: Eight plus something. Come on, be a big number. 21 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
SAM: Hey! And I get sneak attack. 
TALIESIN: Now we know. 
MATT: You do. 
SAM: (snickers) Yeah. Okay. 
LAURA: All of the sneak attack. 
TALIESIN: Somewhere between-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, somewhere between there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, somewhere between 19 and 21. 
SAM: What is that? 30-- 
LAURA: (intensely sings battle music) 
SAM: 38 points of damage. 
MATT: 38 points of damage on that one. All righty. 
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry, plus seven. So 45 points of damage. 
MATT: All right, so this would be-- 
MARISHA: If I can get Extract Aspects on it, I can see if they're resistant to things. 
SAM: That's my bonus, that's my move, that's my-- 
MATT: As you fire, it strikes it, (grunts) in the side of its torso. You see all the other Weave Mind react slightly to the impact and all the crystals in the chamber also flash and flare in a connected impact. It looks over towards you and you feel that (static pulse) pressure on your mind, like its focus is now on you. 
SAM: Yeah, but I duck down behind Yasha, so maybe it doesn't see me anymore. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) "So maybe." 
MATT: All right, that finish your turn, Veth? 
SAM: Yes, that's all I can do. 
MATT: All right. Yasha, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait, but if we kill them-- 
MATT: Actually at the end of your turn, they're going to use their last communal legendary action. 
TALIESIN: We need to kill them. 
MATT: This one's going to-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, we also need to break the crystals-- 
MATT: -- going to Fold Space. 
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind. 
SAM: Folding space. 
TALIESIN: He's moving away from you. 
MATT: It's going to teleport back-- 
ASHLEY: Damn it. 
MATT: -- up here. 
MARISHA: Aw! 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
LIAM: It's doing this. It's the ant, and you just go: Boop! 
LAURA: Yeah, it's the tesseract. 
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Tesseract! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but if we kill them all, are we going to have to take their place or something? 
SAM: No, that's Bells Hells' problem. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All right. So, ♪ What I'm going to do is ♪ 
LIAM: Kill. 
ASHLEY: I know. Do I go for one of them, or do I go for the arch? 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, I think you're close enough to get to that crystal there. 
LIAM: There's one on the ground. 
ASHLEY: Oh, there is one on the ground? The one over there? 
LIAM: Yeah, but it's a good-- What's your movement? 
MARISHA: Where are you? 
TALIESIN: Is it just the columns, or is it also the little beat points? 
LAURA: No, the little glowing ones in the middle and the arch. 
MATT: As far as what? 
TALIESIN: What seems to be connected to this circuit of light? 
MATT: Oh. This, this, this, this-- 
TALIESIN: Okay, those. 
MATT: -- this, this, this, and that. 
LIAM: Can you wingyour way up here? 
ASHLEY: I can, but that is an action. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay, wait, wait. 
TALIESIN: You could try and beat up that crystal. 
ASHLEY: Could I get to the one over there? 
MARISHA: How far can you go? 
LIAM: Depends on your movement. 
ASHLEY: You know what? I'm going to go for the arch. I'm going to go for the arch, but first, as a bonus action, I am going to release a battle cry. 
LAURA: Fuck yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah! 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
MARISHA: Those are dope. 
ASHLEY: 10 creatures of your choice, all of you, if you're within 60 feet, you get advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
LAURA: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Within 60 feet of Yasha is-- 
LIAM: I might be out of that. 
MATT: No, you are within 60 feet of Yasha. 
LIAM: Yeah! 
LAURA: Everybody! 
TALIESIN: All right! 
MATT: Just barely. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: So yeah, that's all of you. 
LAURA: Advantage on what? 
ASHLEY: Advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. 
TALIESIN: And saving throws. 
LIAM: Dang! 
ASHLEY: Until the start of my next turn. So this round. 
TALIESIN: So one round. 
MARISHA: For one round. All right, all right, all right. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Hell yeah. 
ASHLEY: Then, I am going to at least-- 
LIAM: Fuck, she is so metal. 
ASHLEY: -- try to help our friends on the battlefield. So I'm going to go up to the arch and I'm going to start wailing on it. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: ♪ Wailing on the arch ♪ 
LIAM: ♪ Wailing on the arch ♪ 
MATT: Up the stairs here to the arch up there? You have enough movement to get there to it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So-- 
TRAVIS: Do you want some help? Oh! Nicely done. 
ASHLEY: All right, my first hit. 
MARISHA: Any one of those could have helped, and we didn't. 
MATT: Now as a note, the lair action that they had used that hadn't apparated yet is Drain Prowess. So all players within 20 feet of a glass crystal, their weapon attack roll is reduced by 1d6. So tell me what you roll. 
TALIESIN: Also, you have advantage on attacks. 
MATT: Because of your battle cry. 
LIAM: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I do. 
LIAM: It's like reverse Guidance. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: But the attack will be d6 down. 
MARISHA: Within how far of a crystal? From how much? 
MATT: 20 feet. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so-- 
LIAM: And she went running right up to it. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 28. 
LIAM: Oh, good. 
MATT: 28? 
ASHLEY and MATT: Minus-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, to hit. 
MATT: -- four. 
LAURA: So 24. 
MATT: So 24, still hits. 
TALIESIN: Oh wow. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. So first hit. 
MATT: This is slashing damage? 
ASHLEY: This is slashing damage, so I'm going to use my calculator. 
TRAVIS: (announcer voice) This is slashing damage! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: WPAQ. 
LIAM: So anyway, this is "Wonderwall." 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That joke never gets old. 
MATT: Never. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm at 14. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Don't judge me, I'm doing-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's genius. Are you kidding? 
SAM: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: So-- (sighs) Minus Divine Fury. 
SAM: I don't remember. Let's look it up. 
ASHLEY: That's a six. Sorry. Where's my sixes? Okay. 
TRAVIS: Act confident when Matt is looking. Don't show weakness. 
MATT: (chuckles) 
ASHLEY: Plus 10. Shoot, what was that? I'm so sorry. My math is so bad. 
SAM: I am so sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: So 15-- 
MARISHA: Oh, his glasses? 
LIAM: Just cycling through. 
MARISHA: It cycles through. 
LIAM: Yeah, glasses-- 
MARISHA: It's the best one. I know. It's the best one. 
ASHLEY: Five. 
SAM: 40 was Keyleth. 
LAURA: Damn it! 
ASHLEY: Okay, first hit is 49 points of damage. 
MATT: 49 points of damage. 
ASHLEY: Then also-- 
TALIESIN: Some of that's radiant? 
ASHLEY: So seven points of fire damage, which doesn't really do much. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Then, there was-- 
MATT: So seven points of that was fire? 
ASHLEY: Seven points of that was fire. 
MATT: Okay, got it. 
ASHLEY: Then, 15 of that was radiant. 
MATT: Okay, so let's say, because it is immune to fire, the crystals, that would make it 42. 
ASHLEY: 42. 
TALIESIN: Plus your 2d8. 
ASHLEY: Then plus 2d8 from holy weapon. 
TALIESIN: Radiant. Yeah. 
LIAM: Wildmother magic. Wildmother blessing. 
ASHLEY: Which is 10 points radiant. 
MATT: So 52? All right. 
ASHLEY: 52. 
LIAM: Wildmother up in here! 
TRAVIS: Up in here! 
ASHLEY: Then-- 
MATT: Okay. So-- Okay, so the slash of your weapon seems to not have the strongest of impact on the crystal. The damage still goes through, but it appears to be resistant to slashing damage. 
LAURA: Oh, come on! 
MATT: It is immune to fire. But the radiant still carves through and a heavy hit comes to the crystals as you swipe it with your blade. It's already heavily cracked now, still damaged from when Caleb tried to pull on it earlier. It looks like it's pretty heavily shaken in its foundation. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I can give it another go, but it's not radiant. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
ASHLEY: Well, I guess I would get to do 2d8 again? 
TALIESIN: 2d8 again every hit. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, second hit. Let's go. Ooh, that's not good. 
TALIESIN: Is that with advantage? 
ASHLEY: That is not with advantage. Thank you. 
TALIESIN: Here to help. 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's much better. 27. 
MATT: Minus six is 21. Still hits. 
TALIESIN: Oh, jeez. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! Mercer, Mercer, Mercer! 
ASHLEY: So we've got-- Let's go with those two. Okay. Ooh! Okay. 
MATT: How much slashing damage? 
ASHLEY: 11 plus 13 is 24? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: So 24 slashing. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: And another 2d8. 
SAM: That's okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Nine points of radiant damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Is that with the-- Oh yeah. Yeah, I see what you got. Everything makes sense. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm just not doing this yet. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: No, no, no. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
MATT: If you could hand me that. 
LIAM: Oh, this crystal? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Oh, it's gone! 
MARISHA: You tried to turn on the crystal? 
MATT: As you carve it through with the second slash and it shatters and crumples to the ground in a rain of glass splinters-- 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: -- that scatter all across the floor. As it does, there's a reverberating psychic blast that seems to reciprocate through the room and you watch as all the Weave Mind around here turn and shift at the shattering of the glass with renewed intensity. You feel in your mind that staticky pressure. (static buzzing) 
LAURA: Ooh, they're mad. 
MATT: But your Mind Blank keeps it at bay. 
TRAVIS: Oh! Yasha! 
ASHLEY: (gleeful laugh) 
LAURA: (satisfied laugh) 
LIAM: Yasha! 
ASHLEY: Fun, fun, fun! 
LAURA: Mind Blank is not concentration? 
LIAM: No. 
LAURA: That's fucking sick. 
ASHLEY: Oh, so cool! 
LAURA: Give it to all of us. 
MATT: All righty. Does that finish your turn, Yasha? 
ASHLEY: Yes, it does. 
MATT: Hell yeah. Caduceus, you're up. 
TALIESIN: Huh. 
LIAM: What level is it? 
LAURA: Why did you give it to all of us? 
ASHLEY: Wait, how much movement did I take? I'm so sorry. 
LIAM: It's a high level. 
MATT: That would've been 40. 
LIAM: I did it the night before resting. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so can I take the rest of my movement? 
LIAM: It's an 8th-level spell. 
MATT: Yeah, if you want to. 
ASHLEY: Up to 10 feet? I'll start, just 10 feet down the stairs. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: If you can touch. All right, that's my turn. 
TALIESIN: I'm debating whether or not this is too much for a Divine Intervention. 
ASHLEY: Oh, what you're about to ask? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: I want to win. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I am curious if I can, just due to the nature of my magical ability, of my cleric abilities, make each of the crystals vulnerable for one hit. First hit against them is vulnerable and then they go back to normal. 
MATT: What are you asking the Wildmother? 
TALIESIN: Do you want to hear my prayer? 
MATT: Yes. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: I want all of their butts to be on the front of their body. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take one of the pieces of shattered crystal and I'm going to take some soil out of my pouch. The first body in our charge was made entirely of violet crystal. It never sprouted any plant. It never sprouted tea. It never sprouted a flower. It only gave us the grove itself. This is where we'll begin the next graveyard. I'm going to put it in the ground and I'm going to try and turn each of these crystals, briefly, that beautiful violet amethyst. 
MARISHA: What? Don't ask briefly. Ask for more, and then she'll negotiate. 
TALIESIN: One round. I know what I'm asking. 
MATT: As you focus down the fine stone work of this polished throne room of the Weave Mind, you watch as bits of the stone and marble begin cracking like a Bugs Bunny crack across the ground, spiraling off in different directions. Within each of these green crystals, as these carving lines meet their base, you watch as little splinters of purple crystal begin to pierce them from within, outward. As it does, elements of the crystals seem to almost crack where tiny little spider fractures begin to appear in the crystals. Until your next turn, the first attack on each of these, they are vulnerable to hit. 
TALIESIN: We got one round. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
TRAVIS: Copy that. 
TALIESIN: Who will be the first? 
LAURA: The first attack on each of the crystals? Okay. 
TALIESIN: Crystals. Yeah, one attack on all the crystals-- 
MATT: But these are attacks. 
TALIESIN: -- for one round. 
MATT: Not spells. 
TALIESIN: Not magic. 
LAURA: Got it, got it. 
TALIESIN: Physical attacks. 
LAURA: Physical attacks on the crystals. 
TALIESIN: Which of you will be the first to be interred? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Fuck this noise. I'm going to back over here and get a little clearance, try and get a little bit of cover. Head over here for a little cover. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, into the little grove. 
MATT: Into that grove. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Can you close those doors for me, by the way, because they had slammed shut. 
MATT: Thank you. That's great. 
TALIESIN: I don't really have much to do for the bonus action, do I? Do I get my reaction back? 
MATT: Not until that Weave Mind's next turn. Actually, you know what? I'll say no. You do get it back now on your turn. 
TALIESIN: Okay, well, now that my turn's over, so yeah. I do get five more points because of my armor. 
MATT: Okay, finishing your go. Beauregard, you're up, with Fjord on deck. 
MARISHA: Well, Caduceus just changed things. 
TALIESIN: You're welcome. 
MARISHA: I feel like I should attack these crystals, if that's the case. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I feel like I should attack these crystals ♪ 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: One big heavy hit. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: A-pop-pop on this guy right next to me. 
SAM: Just pop. Not pop-pop. 
MATT: I'm sad that arch got lost. 
SAM: Just pop. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you want one big hit. 
MARISHA: I guess I can, but I have to do-- 
MATT: This was lined up in a particular way for a reason. 
LAURA: Oh, they were going to do something big? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: The arch was? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what happened? 
TALIESIN: You want one big hit because the psychic hit-- 
MATT: You prevented me from doing something cool, which is awesome, well done. 
TALIESIN: So double damage. 
MARISHA: My two initial attacks, my attacks time two, do I have to do those to the single target or can I attack, move, and then attack-- 
MATT: You can attack and move. The first hit on each crystal is vulnerable, too. 
MARISHA: Right. 
MATT: So if you hit the same crystal twice, only the first one's going to be vulnerable. 
MARISHA: Right, so I can break up my first attack? 
MATT: Oh yeah, you can attack, move, attack. 
SAM: Oh, but it's vulnerable. It doesn't mean necessarily that one attack will destroy it. 
LAURA: No. 
LIAM: It's not going to pulverize it, it's just going to take more damage. 
MARISHA: Just the first one-- 
LAURA: Does more damage. 
TALIESIN: The first attack does double damage. 
MARISHA: These are just straight rolls, correct? 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: Which means if you roll a 20, it's quadruple damage. 
MATT: Actually, no, these are with disadvantage because-- Well, you have advantage from her battle cry and it's disadvantage because you're within the range of the crystal. So it's just a single roll, yeah. 
MARISHA: Disadvantage within range of the crystal. I thought you said minus. 
MATT: Sorry, no, you're right. It's with advantage with a minus six. I got that wrong. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: So it's an advantage roll minus six. 
MARISHA: Yes, that's going to put me in a 20 total. 
MATT: 20 total, minus five. 15. That's going to miss. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MARISHA: Second hit. 
MATT: You go to strike once and you hit it, but you feel your strength sapped out of the blow and your knuckles (impact) against the crystal. (groans) Your next attack? 
MARISHA: 21 total. 
MATT: 21 total? 
TALIESIN: That's with advantage? 
LAURA: You're rolling with advantage, right? 
MATT: With advantage, yeah. 
MARISHA: I have an advantage. So I didn't do those-- 
MATT: So both of those attacks would be that one roll. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: The first attack. 
MARISHA: The first attack would be 21. 
MATT: Which misses. With minus four, it would be 17. 
MARISHA: Okay. Next attack-- 
MATT: So your next attack with advantage, correct. 
MARISHA: -- with advantage. 
MARISHA: Sorry, I never rolled the advantage. 
MATT: That's okay. 
MARISHA: Much better. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Yes! Yes. 
MATT: Oh boy! 
LIAM: Oh wow! 
MARISHA: Jeez Louise. 
LIAM: So a crit with vulnerability. 
MARISHA: Vulnerability. 
TALIESIN: Times four. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Well it's just-- Yeah, whatever your crit damage is-- 
MARISHA: My damage doubled. 
MATT: -- then that's doubled. 
LIAM: Turns to dust. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: This may be-- 
MATT: So roll your dice. 
TALIESIN: -- a one-inch punch. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Maybe. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: One punch Beau? 
LAURA: Fingers crossed. 
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on. 
MARISHA: Please, please, please, please, please. It's fine. It's not great. That's going to be 11, so doubled-- 
MATT: 11 total with the crit? 
MARISHA: 11-- No. 
MATT: Sorry. 
MARISHA: 11 on my-- sorry. 
MATT: 11 on the dice? The dice is doubled. 
MARISHA: The dice is doubled. So that's going to be eight plus seven. 
TRAVIS: 15. 
MARISHA: Which is 15. 
MATT: Doubled is 30. 
MARISHA: 30. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: All righty. Whack! Second hit comes through (cracking). Cracks begin to spiral through it. It's taken some damage. 
TALIESIN: Fuck it up. 
SAM: "It's taken some damage." 
MARISHA: Feels like it's-- (laughs) I'm trying to figure out if it's a waste of fucking time or not. 
ASHLEY: I know, me too. 
TALIESIN: They were clearly not happy with it. 
SAM: Do it. We've got nothing else to do. 
MARISHA: All right. Flurry of Blows. 
LAURA: Other than attack the Weave Mind. 
SAM: Well, yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: I guess one other thing we could do. 
MARISHA: Okay. 30 total. 
MATT: 30 hits, roll damage. 
MARISHA: Second one is going to be-- 
MATT: These are bludgeoning, which it is not resistant towards. These do full damage. 
MARISHA: Right. And then a second Flurry of Blows is going to be 25 total. 
MATT: 25 total damage? 
MARISHA: So 30 and 20-- No, no, no. 30 and 25 for my pop pop. 
MATT: Sorry, right. 
MARISHA: For my Flurry of Blows. So now damage. 
MATT: Oh, that's right. Sorry, that was it. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Which is going to be-- 
MATT: Minus four, 21 still hits. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Then two attacks. Pop pop. 
MATT: Oh, right. So the first one-- 
MARISHA: Was 30. 
MATT: 30, yep. 
MARISHA: Then the second one was 25. 
MATT: Yep. Both still hit. 
MARISHA: Okay. Then that is going to be 11 damage for one. Then it's going to be 13 damage for the other. 
LAURA: We're nerds. (laughter) 
MATT: So-- (bashes) The final punch. (shattering) 
MARISHA: Thank god. Okay. 
TALIESIN: One round. 
MATT: Explodes outward. The shards stuck into your knuckles, but not enough-- 
SAM: Ow. 
MATT: -- to hurt you. 
LAURA: Okay, is that seems like a good thing. 
TALIESIN: That's some bling. 
LAURA: The crystal's gone. 
TALIESIN: That's bling. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Well, and they don't do that aura around them, which is good. 
LAURA: Right. 
MARISHA: So we don't get our-- 
LAURA: We don't get weakened-- 
MARISHA: -- attacks nerfed. 
LAURA: -- to stand around them. I got to figure out what I'm going to do. 
SAM: Me too. 
MARISHA: I will move and get base to base with this guy. 
MATT: Over here? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (pops) 
SAM: ♪ Is dancing with me ♪ 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Actually, you know what? No. 
MATT: No? 
SAM: Base to base. ♪ There's no-- ♪ 
MARISHA: Where are you going to go? 
SAM: ♪ --body here ♪ 
MARISHA: Are you going to stay put? 
TRAVIS: Uh-uh. I'm running. I'm going for a crystal somewhere, because it's the first attack-- 
MARISHA: It's just the first attack, yeah. 
LIAM: Can I ask a question? 
MATT: Sure. 
LIAM: Of the three that got charred at the beginning-- 
MARISHA: Are you going to go? 
LIAM: -- during Time Stop, where have they dispersed to? 
MARISHA: To the top? Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going all the way up. 
MATT: This one. 
TRAVIS: I think I'm going to try. 
MATT: This one. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Either that one or-- 
MATT: It would be-- 
TRAVIS: -- that one I'm going to get. 
MARISHA: Well, actually Matt, I'm going to shift around-- 
MATT: This one. So it's these three here. 
LIAM: They dispersed all of their pain equally. 
MATT: It seemed to be. 
LIAM: It felt like-- Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'll stay there. 
MATT: You'll stay there? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: All right, finishing Beau's go. Fjord, you're up. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Because I don't have the 40 foot ruler, could I see what a Far Step bamf would get me if I went in this direction, how far I could go? 
MATT: A Far Step bamf would be 60 feet, right? 
TRAVIS: I think it's only 40. Let me check. 60 feet. I'm a liar. Yep, 60. 
SAM: You can't get sneak attack damage against an object, can you? 
MATT: Far Step is 60 feet, which should be about there. 
TRAVIS: Come up around the daises. 
MARISHA: Surprise! 
MATT: Can definitely do that. 
MARISHA: Just a crystal. 
MATT: You want to? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'll come all the way up from-- 
ASHLEY: Boo! 
TRAVIS: Not on the circle, because I don't know what shit that is. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: Is it glowing in the same way as the other crystals? 
MATT: This is itself, like a really dense crystal in the center, yeah. 
TRAVIS: So I (foomph) appear up there. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
TRAVIS: I take the Star Razor, I swing it over my head. As I'm doing that, does the circle around that little daises have any engravings that match the fucking Teletubby markings on these guys? Or is there anything that like-- 
MATT: Oh, numerous. There are runes and markings all throughout this altar-like section of the Pentathrone Chamber. 
LAURA: Where is Fjord? 
TALIESIN: He he went for the ice cube. 
TRAVIS: But none that look like the half moon or the hourglass or the circle-- 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: 16. 
MATT: 16. At a quick glance in the middle of battle, you don't see anything. If you want to spend your action to really look, you could try again, but-- 
TRAVIS: No, I'm not that guy. I will take three swings at this center crystal that's got the big chains in the very middle of the-- 
MATT: You got it. Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Get it, get it. 
LIAM: They're all the same-- 
ASHLEY: Get it. Get it. Get it. 
TRAVIS: Is that 14? 14. That's a 30. No, sorry, yeah. Jesus, I can add. 28 to hit? 
MATT: 28 minus 6. 22, still hits. 
TRAVIS: Oh great. 
ASHLEY: That's with advantage? 
TRAVIS: That is. 
ASHLEY: Doesn't matter. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Second one. 
TALIESIN: I mean, a nat 20, a nat 20. 
TRAVIS: 24. 24 to hit. 
MATT: 24 minus 4 makes it 20. Just barely hits. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
TRAVIS: Just barely hits? Last one. Hell, yeah. 16. That's 30. 
MATT: 30, yeah. Even, yeah-- All three hit. 
TRAVIS: Okay, great. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Pour into that first one. 
TRAVIS: I have nine. 19. Wait, 17. Plus, yes. 27. 
SAM: Your lollipop's right next to-- 
TRAVIS: 35. Last one. 
SAM: If you want to, probably. 
TRAVIS: 40 plus eight, 48. 48 points of damage. 
MATT: 48 points of damage from the first hit? 
TRAVIS: From all three together. 
MATT: Well, the first hit has vulnerable against, so what was damage of the first hit? 
TRAVIS: I don't know. I added them really fast. 
MATT: An estimate? 
TRAVIS: I think it was... 
SAM: We are recording. 
TRAVIS: I think it was 18 or 19, I think. 
MATT: Right. 
TRAVIS: Or 17. 
MATT: Which would've been an additional 18 points damage, which would be just enough. 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
MATT: As this central piece now, right here. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Shuts off. 
LAURA: Oh. (gasps) 
MATT: Well, this one would still be on there. But yeah, this one here is completely-- 
LIAM: Get wrecked. 
MATT: -- broken and ruined there. 
LAURA: Oh my god. Sick. I don't know what it did, but-- 
SAM: It turned off a light and started playing Luther Vandross. 
MATT: Yes. (laughter) (crashes) It shatters within. This wind (whooshes) emerges from within. 
TALIESIN: He got the one in the center. 
MATT: This deep, warm wind. 
LAURA: It tooted. It's like a big butt hole. 
ASHLEY: Wait, you were going for-- 
TRAVIS: Did you say it was 
ASHLEY: --the one in the center? 
TRAVIS: -- a big butt hole? 
ASHLEY: Or the one in the-- 
LAURA: No, he went for the-- He went for the center hole. 
MATT: They did. They said it was a big butt hole. 
LIAM: It's loose, so it's (whoosh). (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Boy, it's been a theme of the day. 
SAM: Predathos, god eater. (laughter) 
SAM: God farter. 
MATT: (blows) (laughter) 
MATT: It was a (fluttering exhale). (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (trumpeting) (laughter) 
LIAM: Fjord's like, "Ugh." 
TRAVIS: The circle. 
LAURA: (like Fjord) "This was a mistake." 
MARISHA: Is it the circle or the square one? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was aiming for the one with the chains attached to it. 
LAURA: Oh no, go for the circle, though! 
MATT: Oh, I thought you meant the circle one. Which would you prefer? 
TRAVIS: I said the chains. 
ASHLEY: I thought he was saying the chains. 
LAURA: Okay, you said the chains. 
TRAVIS: But the circle seems pretty cool, too. But I said what I said. 
LIAM: Put the plug back in. 
MATT: I know. 
SAM: Turn on the Vandross. 
MARISHA: I didn't know that was your first one. 
TRAVIS: See, I just asked. He said there's all sorts of runes in there. But I mean, look at the chains, man. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, it does seem like an important-- 
MATT: (crashing) 
LAURA: Okay, that breaks. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: So as that shatters, (crashing) shards splintering everywhere. You guard yourself as it does. The Weave Mind draw back once more. The whole room now seems to quake with rage. 
LAURA: Oh. But the warm hole wind did not come out. 
MATT: No. (rewinding speech) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: He's holding it in. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Bee bah bah do ♪ ♪ Bee bah bah do ♪ 
ALL: ♪ di di ♪ 
ASHLEY: ♪ Di, di, di. ♪ 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that finishes my turn. 
MATT: You haven't moved. 
TRAVIS: I haven't. But-- 
MATT: You just teleported. You want to stay put? 
TALIESIN: At the very least, somewhere you can't get-- 
TRAVIS: I'm in eyesight of a lot of things and 40 feet won't really get me out of-- They're positioned pretty well. 
TALIESIN: No, but you could get somewhere where they can't get behind you and pin you. Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, they could. 
TRAVIS: Never mind, that doesn't really make sense. 
TRAVIS: I'm okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: He said, regretting his choice later. 
MATT: Finishing your turn, that brings us to initiative count 20. All of their shields (whirring) regenerate a little bit. (exclaiming and groaning) 
MARISHA: A little bit? 
MATT: But far reduced with the destruction of a number of crystals. 
ALL: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Aha ha! 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Their temporary hit points-- 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Okurr. 
MATT: -- are not restored to their previous strength. Also choosing a new lair action. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
TRAVIS: What's it do, Matty? 
MATT: We're already in the narrative [inaudible]; we're going to go to Psychic Pressure. (magical pulse) 
LIAM: (winces) 
MATT: All players that begin their turn within 20 feet of a crystal or move through 20-foot range of a crystal on their turn, their movement is halved and they take psychic damage. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: The whole room is just-- 
LAURA: Are any of us-- 
MATT: (static buzz) 
LAURA: -- within 20 feet of a crystal right now? 
SAM: Fjord is and Caleb is. 
MARISHA: Caleb is. 
MATT: Fjord is. Caleb is. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Now, Caleb and Yasha don't take any psychic damage. Would it still affect movement with Mind Blank? 
MATT: It is, because one's the damage to your mind, the other is the pressure of the psychic power pushing down on you. 
LIAM: Sure. Bad vibes. Bad vibes. 
LAURA: Wow. 
MATT: It's like the atmosphere grows dense and intense. 
LIAM: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Mind power. 
MATT: Finishing that go, the Weave Mind manipulator's going to take its turn. See if gets its-- 
LIAM: It's manipulative. 
MATT: -- Horrid Puppet back. It does not. So instead, it's going to take two telekinetic blast attacks. Yeah. It's going to telekinetic blast towards you, Veth. 
LAURA: Which one is the manipulator? 
MATT: Manipulator's right here. 
TALIESIN: Oh, doing the big arms. 
LAURA: Doing the Michael Jackson-- 
MATT: Yes, that one. 
LAURA: -- ♪ (vocalizes) ♪ 
ASHLEY: Manipulators, mount up. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: It was a clear, white Ruidus. So clear. 
MATT: (chuckles) 
LAURA: I like the smarmy one over here that's going, "Hmm." 
MATT: He's kind of fun, yeah. It's going to drift over here. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: Then it's going to aim towards you, Veth, with one of its telekinetic blasts. That's going to be a 30 to hit. 
SAM: Oh boy. Yeah. 
LIAM: Manipulator. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: 30. 
TALIESIN: You can't get away from the arms. 
SAM: These aren't spells, these are just attacks? 
MATT: Correct. You're going to take, that's-- (quiet math) 
TRAVIS: These minis are awesome, Matt. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
LAURA: They are. 
TALIESIN: Almost makes it okay. 
MATT: 31 points of force damage. 
SAM: Can I-- 
MATT: (forceful bash) 
SAM: What can I do as a rogue again, Liam? 
LIAM: Dexterity stuff. 
SAM: Uncanny Dodge? 
MATT: You can Uncanny Dodge to reduce it by half. 
LIAM: From an attack you-- 
SAM: Yeah. I'll do that. 
MATT: Okay. It was 31, right? I said that you would take? 
SAM: Yep, 15. 
MATT: 15 damage. Make a strength save for me. 
SAM: Strength save. 
LIAM: You still an advantage from Yasha? 
SAM: I get advantage on everything, right? 
TALIESIN and MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Until Yasha goes. 
ASHLEY: Attacks and saving throws. 
SAM: Garbage, 15. Strength? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: 16. 
MATT: 16 does not make it. You get pushed and it impacts you. 30 feet, up to 30 feet in the direction. It's going to push you over to where Jester is, just (bash) 
SAM: Oh hi! 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
SAM: That's fine. We're together now. 
TALIESIN: No, it's not. 
SAM: Detectives! 
MATT: The next one's going to fire at you, Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. 
MARISHA: They're definitely stacking you guys up. 
MATT: That's going to be 23 to hit. 
TALIESIN: That hits. 
MATT: Okay. You take-- 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Hold on. 
MATT: Sorry. 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: 37 points of force damage. I just rolled an 11 and nine and a nine on these. 
TALIESIN: Oh, hold on. 37 points? 
MATT: 37 points of force damage. 
LAURA: Remember, you can't take a reaction. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. No, that's over. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. Phew. 
TALIESIN: That is over, right? 
MATT: We decided to go at the end of your turn because it makes it easier to track. 
TALIESIN: Okay, one second. I'm sorry. If an effect targets only me-- I'm sorry. Okay, that wasn't a dex save though. But if dex save, I don't get to roll for lowering damage? 
MATT: For? 
TALIESIN: For the attack that just happened? 
MATT: Using what? 
TALIESIN: Oh, you just attacked me with-- Okay, yeah, with that hit. So, yeah. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: I'm sorry. I was thinking about that attack. My brain is broken. 
MATT: That's okay. 37 points of force damage on you. 
MARISHA: Caduceus is like, "I'm a crystal now." 
LAURA: 37-- (laughs) 
TALIESIN: There's no extra thing. Okay. 
MATT: I need you to roll a strength saving throw. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: ♪ 37 points of damage ♪ Boop. All right, and strength saving throw. 
MATT: A strength saving throw. 
TALIESIN: 13. 
MATT: 13. (forceful bash) You get force punched out of the corner, knocking you in the air at an arc. Throwing you-- 
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no! 
MATT: You fall for an additional-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: Because it hit you in an arc. 
LAURA: I don't trust anything-- 
MATT: For an additional six points of bludgeoning damage. 
LAURA: -- that makes us in a group. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving throw. See if you maintain your spell. 
MARISHA: You're all right in front-- 
LIAM: At advantage. 
MARISHA: -- of that lens. 
LIAM: Give it a shot. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: 13, 19, 22. 
MATT: Yeah, you maintain your concentration. All right. 
TALIESIN: All right, got to think about this. 
MATT: All them got their legendary actions back. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Happy Birthday, Chris Willmott! 
SAM: Whoa! 
LIAM: Did he get one? 
TALIESIN: Aw. 
MARISHA: I'm assuming so. 
SAM: Why do we get these? 
MARISHA: Because it's Willmott's birthday. (laughter) 
SAM: Happy birthday? 
LIAM: It is a very specific kink. 
ASHLEY: For Chris' birthday. 
MARISHA: Ooh, are these cream filled? 
LAURA: I think those are the frosting-filled ones. That's not cream filled, it's frosting. 
SAM: Is this Krispy Kreme? 
LAURA: Yeah, that's frosting. 
MATT: That's going to finish that one's turn. 
SAM: I hate Krispy Kreme. 
LAURA: (gasps) How dare you! 
MARISHA: You hate Krispy Kreme? 
LAURA: Take it back! Take it back! 
SAM: It's too sweet. 
ASHLEY: Get away from the table! 
MATT: It's a little too sweet. 
TALIESIN: Attack him. 
MATT: Jester, your turn. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LAURA: It's my turn. 
LAURA: I don't trust-- 
SAM: Oh, I'll have one. 
LAURA: -- whatever it is-- (laughter) 
LAURA: -- that they're trying to clump us up for. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it is bad. 
SAM: I need napkins though, napkins. 
LAURA: So I'm going to run over here. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, she took them all. 
LAURA: Wait, how far can I move? 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
LAURA: 30 feet. Is each square five feet? 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: It stinks like-- 
LAURA: One, two, three-- 
SAM: -- theme park funnel cake. 
LAURA: -- four, five. 
TALIESIN: It's 40% chemicals. So good. 
LAURA: Did I count that right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: That's 25 feet. 
MATT: That's 25 feet? You can move one more. 
LAURA: I can do like this? 
MATT: Yep. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay, I'm going to move my-- Oh my god. Wait, why are you skipping me? 
TRAVIS: Y'all don't focus. Focus, Jester! 
LAURA: I'm-- Listen! It's important! 
ASHLEY: I'm listen! 
LAURA: I'm going to use my spiritual giant, giant vaginal weapon. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Vaginas! 
LAURA: What did I say it was before? 
TRAVIS: 'Ginas. 
LIAM: Can't take it back now. 
LAURA: 'Ginas, and it's going to hit the crystal. It's going to try to hit the crystal. 
MATT: Crystal here? 
LAURA: Yes, that crystal. 
LIAM: It's going to clap it. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: It's building on itself like a Pokemon. This is its next form. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Scraping off the sugar. 
LAURA: That is 21 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. Roll damage. 
TALIESIN: Was that at advantage? 
LAURA: It wasn't at advantage. Let's see if I get-- It's higher, but it's not-- 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: That's fine. Still hits. 
LAURA: That's 3d8-- 
ASHLEY: Mm! plus however much. 
LIAM: Oh, it's so sweet. 
MATT: It'd be eight plus your wisdom, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. One, whatever. (trills) Plus, it's very low. I rolled very low. 
SAM: Oh shit, it's my turn next. (laughter) 
LAURA: 13 points. 
MATT: It's not. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: 13 points of bludgeoning. Or I guess that would be radiant. 
MATT: It would be radiant, I think it is. 
LAURA: Radiant, so that's times two, because it is vulnerable. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. So 26. 
MATT: This time, as it was frustrated, whatever consciousness your summoned lollipop would have. 
LAURA: It definitely has a consciousness. 
MATT: Totally, and it comes back with even renewed fervor, a vengeance in its weird lollipop eyes? I don't know. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: (grinding) Grinds in like the Judge Doom hand blade as it cut through the chain at the end of "Roger Rabbit." 
TRAVIS: Yeah, good! 
MATT: Just like (grinding) It carves a section of the crystal off. It looks like it's sustained some damage. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. (sighs) My other thing I'm going to do-- 
SAM: That's bonus action, right? 
LAURA: That was my bonus action. For my spell, I'm going to-- Would you say I'm within-- 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched noises) 
LAURA: (high pitched) Would you say that I'm within-- I don't think I can get all three of those with that-- Would three of those be within 100 feet of each other, if it was a line going between them? 
SAM: Hmm. 
MATT: In what way? 
LAURA: Am I 90 feet from that guy? 
MATT: He's within 90 feet of you. Yes. 
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to try to cast Blade Barrier. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
LAURA: In the sky, it's a giant wall of blades. So all these shimmering, swirling dervishes are going to start floating around, and it's going to create a wall of craziness around them and it's 100 feet long. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: It is... The sense render is going to use its reaction to use Rend Arcana because you are within 30 feet of a crystal. We get to roll contested to see if it dispels your spell. 
TALIESIN: Are you 30 feet? 
TRAVIS: You do good on these. 
TALIESIN: Wait, 30 feet? 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier. It's going to roll here. It's contested with a plus eight. 
TALIESIN: Five, 10, 15, 20. I guess you are barely within 30 feet. 
LAURA: I'm going to use Fortune's Favor. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I already said it. Do I get to know what you rolled and what I rolled before I do? No, I'm going to use Fortune's Favor. 
MARISHA: Roll high, roll high. 
LAURA: No. Fuck. Does the Fortune Favor completely cancel out the first one or can I use a higher roll? 
MATT: No, you use the higher of the two. 
LAURA: Okay. 17. 
MATT: It was an eight plus eight, which is a 16. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: So I didn't need to use Fortune's Favor. Wait, so I didn't need to use Fortune's Favor. 
LIAM: But you did. 
LAURA: But I didn't know that. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: But you did. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LAURA: Okay, fine. That's fine. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is good. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay, so that's a Blade Barrier. 
MATT: Okay. So it is a straight wall 100 feet long, 20 feet high, five feet thick, so it'll-- 
LAURA: Or I can do a 60 feet diameter... circle. 
MATT: Right. So it would be a-- 
SAM: Circle or sphere? 
MATT: -- an outer wall like this? 
LAURA: Yeah. Can I make it at a rotation if it's 20 feet high, if it's at a (grunts) so it gets the one on the ground and the two in the sky? Or is 60 feet big enough to get the three in the sky? 
SAM: Does it have to be a perfect circle? 
LAURA: Does it have to be a perfect circle? Can it be an oval? I've never done this before. 
TALIESIN: That album was pretty good. I don't think you can do anything else. 
MATT: It is designed-- if you're going to change the two shapes, it's meant to be a cylindrical shape if you're doing it that way. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So it would be, yeah, a ringed wall. 
LAURA: A ringed wall. 
MATT: So it would be-- It says 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and five feet thick. So you can't turn it and have it float in space. 
SAM: But it's 20 feet high. 
MATT: It's 20 feet high. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Right? 20 feet high is that tall. 
SAM: Oh wait, it comes from the ground? 
LAURA: Oh, it has to come from the ground? 
MATT: The vertical wall appears within range, which is 90 feet. Oh, you know what? 
TALIESIN: It's blades, so. 
MATT: It's just blades. I'll say you can make it higher if you want to. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's just blades. 
TALIESIN: It's just blades. 
MATT: So yeah. If you want to create it, it can hit either two of these guys or two of these. That's how it works. In order to get all three, these two are within 20 feet of each other and these two are within 20 feet of each other but not all three. 
TALIESIN: Got to cast uphill. 
LAURA: Okay. If I did a straight wall, I could get these two or those two. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Basically, you get two of-- 
LAURA: I can get two. 
SAM: -- of anybody you want. 
MATT: Correct. Depends on the order of how you want to do the wall. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to do the two high-ties because, the two that are highest in the air, because I feel like that's what we're not going to be able to reach otherwise. 
MATT: So you're wanting to do-- 
LAURA: Zoop! 
MATT: -- these two in a straight line? 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Up in the air. 
LAURA: Yeah, it's 10 feet in the air. So it goes up to hit them. 
MARISHA: 20 feet. (pigeon coo) 
LAURA: Yeah, it's 10 feet off the ground. 
MARISHA: 20 feet in the air? 
MATT: Now you were concentrating on what previously? 
SAM: 30 feet from the sky. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: On anything? 
SAM: 40 feet from the ceiling. 
LAURA: I don't have any concentrations up. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: That was for-- 
LIAM: I have all these sprinkles in my dice tray. 
MATT: I don't remember. 
LAURA: That was for, I think the last game, something. 
MATT: I put that on there intentionally, but it's okay. 
LAURA: Was it Blink? But Blink's not concentration. And Spiritual Weapon is not concentration. 
SAM: Matt, I just rolled to see-- 
MATT: That's right, yeah. So you're good. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: I just rolled to see if I could maintain my concentration, and I rolled a natural 20. 
MATT: Okay, you're good. 
LAURA: I'm sorry that took so long to create a wall. 
MATT: It's okay. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So I'm going to mark these here. It's 100 foot wall, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So I'm marking it here. 
MARISHA: Does it stay? 
LAURA: Yeah. Up to 10 minutes. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: In the sky. 
LAURA and MATT: In the sky. 
TRAVIS: If you get hit, does it-- 
TALIESIN: ♪ (battle music) ♪ 
MATT: So it's about-- 
LAURA: It's in the sky. 
MARISHA: Can you move it? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. You said that. (laughter) 
LAURA: Look, I thought I was going to be able to get more of them because I thought it was going to be a ring. I thought I could do an oval, but I can't. 
MATT: That's okay. So they both get a dexterity saving throw. 
MARISHA: Ovaltine! 
MATT: The one on the left. 
MARISHA: Can you move it? 
MATT: Ooh. 
MARISHA: On your turn? 
MATT: That's a 13. 
LAURA: Sweet. 
MATT: Failure on the left, the one on the right, that is going to be, I believe a success, with a 25. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
MATT: All right, so roll your 6d8 slashing damage. 
LAURA: It's 6d10. 
MATT: Sorry. 6d10. My bad. 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
MARISHA: 6d10. 
SAM: There's no way Laura has 6d10. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Do you need to borrow some d10s? 
LAURA: Shut up. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: Three, four-- 
TRAVIS: Actually, though. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: -- five. I'll just do five-- 
SAM: What? 
LAURA: -- six, well I'll do it the other way. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Stop it. I'm sorry. I'm dumb, y'all. 
TALIESIN: Are you kidding? We take forever. 
LAURA: Ooh, this is a good roll! 15, 20, 20 plus 16 is 36. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Plus another eight. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Whoa! 
MATT: All right, so 44. 
SAM: 44. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
SAM: Damn! 
ASHLEY and SAM: (humming battle music) 
LAURA: I took 10 minutes for that. I'm sorry. 
MATT: No, it's okay. 
SAM: Yeah, it's worth it. 
MATT: So, as the two get tossed around in there, the blades skirting by, most of their psychic shields deflect most of the impact. But it carves through the majority of all of their shared shields. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: (slurred) Shared shields. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Shur shur. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: So they all take that. 
TALIESIN: The initial shields are on all of them. 
MATT: Temporary hit points. Regenerating temporary hit points every term, but it's lesser because of the destroyed crystals. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
MATT: Is that the line where you want the Blade Wall to be? 
LAURA: Sure. But-- yeah. 
MATT: But 10 feet up, you said? 
LAURA: Yeah. So that we can run and don't get damaged. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your turn? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: That was great. 
MATT: Finishing Jester's turn, it's going to be the ego hunter right here. This one is going to go ahead and drift up into the air this way-- 
SAM: Ah! 
MATT: -- to that point, up to the edge of the wall. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I knew this was coming. 
MARISHA: Did you move, Jester? 
LAURA: I moved away from the other two. 
MARISHA: Okay, good. 
MATT: Okay. Oh, it needs to see if it returns to Mental Evisceration. It does. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. Sorry. 
MATT: All right. It's going to float up there, look at you. 
LAURA: Oh wait! Wait, hold on. 
MATT: "Wait, hold on!" Yeah. What you got? 
LAURA: I Blink out and I'm ethereal. 
MATT: Okay. You-- 
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh) 
MATT: You are currently on the ethereal plane. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: Between spaces. 
ASHLEY: Fun. 
SAM: You've condemned us to dying. 
MATT: It drifts up to look towards you, you vanish out of sight. (shifting) I need you to make a wisdom saving throw, Veth. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Now, they are looking at me through a barrier of blades, right? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: So they can't really see me. 
LAURA: You do get actually anything-- 
ASHLEY: You get cover? 
LAURA: Yeah. Let's see. 
TRAVIS: But it's in the sky, right? 
SAM: It's a spell, probably. 
LAURA: It's in the sky. 
MATT: It's a spell. 
LAURA: Oh, well. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: 20 feet up 10 feet from-- 
SAM: Okay. Before he casts, or they casts, or she casts, or it casts. I don't know what this thing is. 
LAURA: So it goes 30 feet in the air. 
MARISHA: 30 feet. 
SAM: If it's casting a spell on me-- 
MATT: It is an ability, it's not technically a spell, but it is a saving throw. 
SAM: Okay. Then I will use my saving throw. 
MARISHA: So is it 20 feet tall, the wall is? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MARISHA: 10 feet in the air. 
LAURA: Yeah. So it goes up to 30 feet in the air. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: That's two natural ones. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
ASHLEY: Aw! 
MATT: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: That's really, that's an accomplishment. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: That's intense. Okay. 
LAURA: What were you rolling for? 
SAM: A save of some sort. 
MATT: Against Mental Evisceration. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ASHLEY: What? 
TALIESIN: Not with a one. Let me see what I have, maybe. Hold on. Shit, fuck, balls. 
SAM: Mental Evisceration. We are Mental Evisceration. Thank you, Cleveland! 
MARISHA: It sounds pretty metal. 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. 
LAURA: This is bad. 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
LAURA: This is real bad. 
TALIESIN: It goes down after my turn. 
MATT: You take 76 points of psychic damage. 
SAM: Halved. 
MATT: Halved. 
SAM: Because I'm resistant. 
LAURA: Resistant. 
MATT: That's true. Yeah. 
LAURA: Thank goodness. 
SAM: 38. 
MATT: Yes you do. So take 38 points of psychic damage. 
TRAVIS: Holy balls. 
MATT: Then make a constitution saving throw to see if you maintain that. 
SAM: Still advantage on everything. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Still advantage. 
SAM: 15 and an 11. Oh. 15 plus what? 
MATT: Constitution saving throw. 
SAM: Oh, 24. 
MATT: Yeah, you maintain your concentration. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) And you are sluggish. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Which means you can only take an action or a bonus action on your turn. 
SAM: Can I move? 
MATT: You can move, but you can only take one or the other. Yeah. So that's that one. 
SAM: Oh, my stomach's rumbling. I feel a little logy. (laughter) 
MATT: Then bonus action it's going to Fold Space-- 
SAM: A little logy. 
MATT: -- 30 feet. 
TRAVIS: Origami. 
LIAM: Son of a bitch. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Where's Beau? 
MATT: That's going to finish its turn. 
MARISHA: I'm over here with this one. 
MATT: It's now the sense render's go. 
LIAM: Son of a bitch! 
TRAVIS: "Sense render's go." 
MATT: It does get its Rend Arcana back. 
MARISHA: So you're next, right? 
TALIESIN: If you hold your action next turn-- 
LIAM: I'm next, yes. 
SAM: One action. 
LIAM: (sighs) Three in a row. Goddamn it. 
MATT: Oh man, the Sense Render up there. Yeah. It's going to move down to here. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: It's going to use Divide Cognition. 
TRAVIS: These fucking names. (laughs) 
MATT: All creatures within 30 feet. You're ethereal, so it doesn't even affect you. But Yasha, Caduceus, and Veth, I need you all to make a constitution saving throw. 
SAM: Jesus. 
TALIESIN: Okay, cool. 
ASHLEY: All of us? 
MATT: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: We have advantage. 
TALIESIN: Bless your advantage. 
TRAVIS: You did it again? 
SAM: I'm not making it up. 
TRAVIS: Two ones? 
SAM: Two ones. 
ASHLEY: No! 
LIAM: Ah! 
MATT: Sam! How? 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
MARISHA: So that's four ones back to back. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: So the 20s are coming. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's bad. 
MARISHA: What is the statistical probability of that? 
SAM: It's pretty low. 
LIAM: Pretty low. 
LAURA: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Honestly, it's technically the same statistical probability as any other roll. 
MATT: Yasha? 
MARISHA: Well-- 
ASHLEY: 23. 
MATT: 23. You succeed. 
TRAVIS: 1%. 
MATT: Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: 10. 
MATT: 10. 
MARISHA: When you multiply-- 
MATT: As it lowers down, it puts its arms in front of itself and the air around you (staticky rumbling) seems to streak and move, like your entire consciousness in this space is being dragged and torn, and there's a pop sound in the center of both of your heads and you are both blinded. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Who's this, by the way? We got a second. 
MATT: Then it's going to Fold Space-- 
LIAM: Goddamn it! 
MATT: -- back this way. 
LIAM: Stop fucking moving. 
TALIESIN: Oh, we're about to get whaled by that dude. Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Fuck. 
MATT: End of its turn. 
TALIESIN: Where's my reaction? 
MATT: They're going to spend three of their combined legendary actions-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
MATT: -- to do an Entropic Storm on those that are triangulated. 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
SAM: Is it entropic depression? 
MATT: Yeah, it can't get Beauregard on that one. So this one here, it's going to get Yasha, Caduceus, and Veth. 
SAM: (wails) 
MATT: I need you all to make intelligence saving throws for me, please. 
TALIESIN: Just straight intelligence? 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Didn't roll a one. 
MARISHA: Google is-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god. 
MARISHA: -- telling me that it's a-- 
TRAVIS: I'm disappointed. 
MARISHA: -- one in 160,000th chance. 
SAM: Oh shit! 
MARISHA: To roll four ones in a row. 
LIAM and SAM: Wow. 
MATT: Yasha? 
MARISHA: On a 20 sided die. 
ASHLEY: 18. 
MATT: 18 is a failure. 
TRAVIS: Lottery ticket. 
MATT: You take no psychic damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But you gain a point of exhaustion. 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Which affects skill checks. 
MATT: Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: Nat 20 for 21? 
MARISHA: I knew it was going to do something like that. 
MATT: Nat 20. That succeeds. So you take half damage. You take 21 points of psychic damage. 
TRAVIS: Gosh. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But you do not get a point of exhaustion. 
SAM: 17. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: 17. With the two natural ones you said, right? Yeah. 
SAM: Or no, this was a, yeah, this was a 17. 
MATT: Yeah. So that would be a failure. So you take 42 points of psychic damage. 
SAM: Halved 
MATT: Halved. So 21, make another constitution saving throw for me please. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
SAM: Natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: There you go. That Battle Cry is saving everyone's ass. 
ASHLEY: (relieved sigh) 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It's gone, though, soon. 
MATT: You do take a point of exhaustion. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Wow! Fuck. 
SAM: Where do I put that? Conditions, right? 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: Caleb, you're up. 
MARISHA: Jeez! 
LIAM: So I saw all of that. 
MATT: You're watching these flashes of energy and, while your friends all notice, their brains are in the middle of this psychic soup. All of your friends, for the most part, there's blood running from their nose and their ears, corner of their eyes, and you watch them get rocked, almost like they're being dragged around by an invisible wind, falling to a knee. You see veins bulging in their heads, and you're just standing back trying to figure out what to do. 
SAM: I'm currently blind, sluggish, exhausted. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Can you remind me what Jester's Wall of Blades is? 
MATT: It is a straight five foot wide Wall of Blades-- 
LAURA: It's 10 feet off the ground. 
MATT: It's 10 feet off the ground and 20 feet tall. It just (blades vibrating). 
LAURA: So you can crawl under it. 
LIAM: Is there a room up here, though, since it's all imaginary? 
MATT: At the very top? Yes. 
LIAM: Yes. All right. 
MATT: Well, actually, the height of the ceiling, what you have, the 30 feet up would be the height of the ceiling. So the wall, you'd have to go underneath it unless you want pass through it. 
LAURA: You can pass underneath it. 
LIAM: Yeah. Okay, so-- 
MATT: These represent near the top of the chamber. 
LIAM: Caleb says-- He sees Veth, goes ballistic. So we're doing trigonometry today, are we, motherfuckers? He will use his Stormrider Boots to blast off. (whooshes) If he has to go through the swords, the blades, he will. 
LAURA: Don't do it. 
LIAM: To this point. 
MATT: To get there, he would have to. 
LIAM: Yeah, I will do it. 
LAURA: He could go-- But you could-- Couldn't you go (whoosh) and curve? 
LIAM: I don't want to, I want to do this. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Could you curve up in there? 
LIAM: Well, it's only temporary, Matt, so you don't need the miniature but he's going to fly right up to here so that he sees this motherfucker's head converge with this one. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: He's going to throw a bunch of iron filings in the air and blast his hand through it and cast Gravity Fissure, which is a straight line from head to head. This one, if it's within 10 feet of that beam, which it should be, is also going to get pulled into that Gravity Fissure. So a line-- 
LAURA: Which means they would all be pulled into it. 
MATT: Those two are already in it. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
MATT: So you don't take it by being continued to pull into it. He would, over there. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So as you're up in the air putting this together, since the sense render did receive its Rend Arcana back. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: You are within 30 feet of a crystal standing up in the air-- 
SAM: It's trying to negate it. 
MATT: -- it's going to attempt to try and counter your spell. So this is going to be another roll off. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So roll d20. 
LIAM: Is he Counterspelling or using a feature? 
MATT: It is a feature that acts as a Counterspell. 
LIAM: Okay. So I couldn't Counterspell his feature, right? 
MATT: Um. Technically-- 
SAM: Because it's not a spell. 
LIAM: Right. That's my question. 
MATT: It's not a spell. I don't think you can, yeah. Because it's Rend Arcana-- 
SAM: Damn it. 
MATT: -- it's not a Counterspell. 
LIAM: That's fine, that's fine. 
MATT: But we still get to roll off to see if it happens. 
LIAM: It's all good. So what am I rolling? 
MATT: You're rolling a d20 and you're adding your intelligence modifier. 
MARISHA: So much. 
TRAVIS: We're in deep. 
MARISHA: So much. I know. 
TRAVIS: We're in deep. We're in it. 
SAM: We're in deep level 20 shit. 
MATT: That's only a 15. 
LIAM: 21. 
MATT: 21, no effect. The spell goes through. Gravity Fissure (slicing). So describe what we see as you open this dunamantic fissure in the middle of spacetime. 
LIAM: The air crackles with dark nebulous magic and a streak that is a foot wide and jagged in the air goes (crackling) straight through this one's head, all the way across the chamber to the other. That is 8d8 force damage on a failed save. So they have to make constitution saves. 
MATT: You got it. All right. 
LIAM: 22. 
MATT: So that one there is going to constitution save. 
MATT: So that one there is going to constitution save. Fail. 12. 
LIAM: Five, six, 11, eight. Okay. 
MATT: So how much did that damage? 
LIAM: Eight, 13, 16, 20, 26, 28, 32, 36 total. 
LIAM: Eight, 13, 16, 20, 26, 28, 32, 36 total. 
MATT: 36. 
LIAM: Dunamantic damage. 
MATT: All right. The other one there. That is going to be a 24. 
LIAM: Does succeed. 
MATT: So it takes half damage. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So it'd be plus 15. No, sorry, 18. 
LIAM: What the hell did I say? 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: All right. Then the one across that way. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Fails with a two. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So that'd be plus another 36, all right. That's 18 damage to each of them, 17. But the last of their temporary hit points have been taken. 
LAURA: Do they get sucked into each other? 
MATT: The ones that failed do get pulled 10 feet in, right? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: This one succeeded, but these are the two targets. So they both stay where they are. That one manages to pull away. It still remains in the Blade Barrier right now. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: But the two that you impact (blades slice) still take the hit and stay where they are. 
LIAM: Now Caleb, with those boots, he did this mid-movement. He has 90 feet of movement with that flying from his boots. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: So he would have streaked up maybe 30 or 40 feet? 
MATT: It would have been about 40 feet to get there at the very top, yeah. 
LIAM: I'm going to use the rest to streak past these-- 
MATT: 30 feet. 
LIAM: -- as lightning from the boots goes (lightning crackling) and fries them on the flyby. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Then I might have to crash landing a bit, but I will do that. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LIAM: So that is just a little bit of lightning damage. 
MATT: I'd say it would take 40 feet of your movement to go underneath and up to where you need it to go without getting the Blade Barrier. And so, whatever left you have to go there. It's how much? 
LIAM: It's 2d8 lightning damage. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: So that is just five for each of them. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: You have 90 feet of movement with your boots? 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: So you would have-- 
LIAM: So if I have to crash, I will do that. 
LAURA: -- 50 feet left of movement. 
LIAM: Well, I used some to get up. 
LAURA: 40 feet, he said, to get up to where you were. 
LIAM: 40, and then probably like 70-ish, so then I would go on a straight angle down to the ground to hopefully not hurt myself. 
ASHLEY: Into the Blade Wall? 
LIAM: Off to the side. 
MATT: There is where you would be. All right. 
LIAM: Okay. All done. 
MATT: Oof! Well done. Finishing Caleb's go, it's ego hunter. 
TRAVIS: What was his name? 
MATT and MARISHA: Ego hunter. 
MATT: It's going to see if its Mental Evisceration comes back. 
LIAM: Actually, Matt? 
TRAVIS: He is Ego! 
MATT: Yeah? 
LIAM: Would you mind if he, instead of veering-- 
MATT: Does not get it back. 
LIAM: -- down this way, he veered down this way? 
MATT: Sure, he will go through the Blade Barrier if you do it that way. 
LIAM: I'll take it. 
MATT: Okay. So-- 
TRAVIS and MATT: Jester. 
LAURA: What? 
LIAM: What's the damage for Blade Barrier? 
MATT: Roll your Blade Barrier damage. 
LAURA: Oh, I did. Should I roll it again? I just rolled it at the start of your turn. 
MATT: Yeah, so that would be for-- 
LAURA: That was 38 points. 
LIAM: 38, is there a dex save or? 
LAURA: Oh yeah, it's a dex save. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay, let me roll to see if I make it. I don't, so I'll use the second of three charges on the Evasion Ring to auto-succeed and I'll take half damage. So the full was what? 
SAM and LAURA: 38. 
LAURA: So 16? 
LIAM: So, 17? No. 
MARISHA: Do you still have your Mirror Images up? 
LIAM: Oh, I do. 
MATT: Mirror Images aren't affected. 
LIAM: But that wouldn't affect dexterity stuff. 
MATT: It's attacks against you. 
LIAM: 18. 18 points of damage. 
SAM: It's 19 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay, so (slashing) you come crashing through this Blade Barrier (thud) land on the ground. (crackling) Crackles on the ground. 
LIAM: Have to get out of that triangle. 
MATT: All righty. Now the ego hunter does not get his Mental Evisceration back. He's going to bonus action-- He's going to bend-- Fold Space to 30-foot teleport to there. 
LAURA: Jeez. 
MATT: So it's approximately from that point. 
MARISHA: Did he leave my range? 
MATT: He teleported out. (quick whoosh) 
MARISHA: So I can't Sentinel him? 
MATT: Correct, because he does not leave your combat range. Technically, he just appears elsewhere. 
MARISHA: ♪ That answers that question ♪ 
LAURA: It's like they knew what our strengths were. 
MARISHA: I know. It's like they watch us-- 
MATT: It's like they could, yeah, see you and-- 
MARISHA: Step in our dreams. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Quick, have confusing dreams to throw them off our scent. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, it's going to Gouge Ether twice on Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: You are blinded. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: So it has advantage on its attacks against you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, fuck a duck. 
MATT: So for that is going to be a 23 to hit. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: Okay. So you take-- 
SAM: What's going on, Caduceus? I'm hearing sounds. 
TALIESIN: What? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You take 27 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay, this is not a spell and there's no dex save. 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: Just checking. 27 points of force damage. 
MATT: Correct, now roll an intelligence saving throw. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Oof. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I might have to do something pretty wicked in a minute. Intelligence save, come on. Oh wow, that was almost awful. 18. 
MATT: 18 fails. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
MATT: So roll a d4 for me. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: It was awful. 
TALIESIN: I rolled a 17, man. Two. 
MATT: Two, so you lose three levels of spells. 
TALIESIN: Oh! Three levels of spells. 
MATT: Of your choice. 
TALIESIN: Of my choice. 
LIAM: All the ones! 
MATT: The second Gouge Ether at you with advantage is going to be a 29. 
TALIESIN: That somehow doesn't hit-- yeah. I'm still losing three levels of spells. 
MATT: 28 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: 28, 28 points of force damage. 
LAURA: Wait. 20 hitpoints? 
MATT: 28 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: One second. That may be enough, hold on. Just let me finish losing spell slots. Three spell slots? 
LAURA: Three levels of spells. 
TALIESIN: I'm down. 
MATT: Caduceus crumbles unconscious onto the floor. 
TALIESIN: Pop! Death Ward, ha-ha! (laughter) 
MATT: There you go. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Does that mean blindness goes away because I dropped? 
LAURA: Blindness goes away when you go unconscious and come back? 
MATT: No, because he never went unconscious. 
TALIESIN: Technically, are you sure? 
MATT: It reduces you to one hit point. 
TALIESIN: I thought it popped you back up. Let me double check. 
MATT: Double check. 
TALIESIN: You're probably right. 
MATT: But also the blindness effect doesn't go away when you go unconscious. 
TALIESIN: I know, but still. 
TRAVIS: Power reboot, power recycle. (laughter) 
LAURA: Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in? 
MATT: Turning your cleric off and on again. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, no, you're right. 
MATT: But go ahead and roll another intelligence saving throw for me, please. 
LAURA: (groans) Jeez. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to lose this one, I'm well aware. 
ASHLEY: I am so stressed. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I rolled 15s, I'm fucked. 
MATT: All right, so roll a d4 for me. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I'm fucked, four. 
MATT: Four, so you lose five levels of spell slots. 
SAM and LAURA: (gasp) 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: (groans) 
MARISHA: That's worse than being dead. That sucks. 
SAM: He should have stayed dead. 
MARISHA: Just stay down. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Just lay down. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'll figure that out that five levels. 
MARISHA: Play possum! 
LAURA: You can do like one 5th-level or a 3rd and a two. 
MATT: One 5th-level or a 4th and a 1st or five 1st-levels or however you want to differentiate. 
SAM: How do you want to screw this? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm losing a 3rd and a 2nd. 
LAURA: I literally was thinking, "Oh, at least we have a decent amount of spells going in." 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: He's going to move-- 
MARISHA: That's brutal. 
TALIESIN: I do not have a lot of spells left. That's not true. I'm okay-ish. 
MATT: Going to move-- 
MARISHA: It's still the top of... 
MATT: -- over here. 
ASHLEY: I feel like you keep moving. 
LAURA: Yeah, they're trying to triangulate. 
SAM: Stupid geometry. 
MATT: It's actually going to reduce itself a little lower. 
LAURA: Be smart, guys. 
MARISHA: Here's my question, even though Caduceus is down, do we still-- ish-- do we still have the vulnerability on the crystals? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Because it's not the top of his turn yet. 
TALIESIN: Not the top of my turn yet. So they're still purple. 
SAM: It was also granted by a divine being, not dead. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. I have to roll to see if my spell stays up also. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: How many times do I have to roll? Con save? 
MATT: Both times you took damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Con save. 
MATT: So constitution save. 
TRAVIS: The crystals aren't hurting us. They are. 
TALIESIN: 20. 
MATT: 20 is good, yeah. 
LAURA: The crystals are hurting us, though. 
TALIESIN: 19, 21, 24. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine, so you maintain that. 
MARISHA: Weaken us and they buff them. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I might blow it at the end of my-- We'll see. 
ASHLEY: That's fine. 
TALIESIN: Wherever you end up, anybody 30 feet who I don't like-- 
MATT: Now it's going to be the manipulator's turn. 
SAM: Jesus. 
MATT: Which is-- right this guy up here. 
TALIESIN: I don't like any of this. 
SAM: This is the worst turn. 
TRAVIS: Amygdala? 
MATT: (laughs) Manipulator. 
TRAVIS: Manipulator. 
MATT: Let's see if it gets its Horrid Puppet back. 
TRAVIS: Caligula. 
MATT: It does. 
TRAVIS: Everybody loves Caligula. 
LAURA: Of course it does. 
MATT: This one is going to go ahead and... 
MARISHA: So you're up, Caduceus, right? 
TALIESIN: I am one point, but I'm up. 
LIAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Yup. It's going to shift down 10 feet and it's going to use Horrid Puppet on you, Beauregard. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: I would like you to make a wisdom saving throw. 
LIAM: Not a spell, right? 
MATT: Not a spell. 
TRAVIS: You said the first attacks on the crystals were vulnerable-- 
MATT: The first hit against it. 
TRAVIS: But a ranged Eldritch Blast is not a-- 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. It counts. 
TRAVIS: -- melee? Oh, okay. 
MARISHA: Is that a 16 or 19? That's a 16. Saving throw, so that's 26. 
LIAM: Nice. 
MATT: 26 is a success. Dang. Haven't been able to get that go off yet once. Fucking-- 
LIAM: Sorry, baby. 
MATT: No, it's good, it's good. I mean, it's well-planned. 
MARISHA: You've done so much. 
TRAVIS: We're decimated. 
MATT: It's fine. It's fine. 
MARISHA: I don't feel bad. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Fucking screws all our plans and everything. 
LIAM: Murdered a cleric, our one cleric. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: All your enemies are standing. 
MATT: It's going to shift over this way. 
TALIESIN: I fucking hate all of it. 
MARISHA: It's trying. They're trying for it. 
MATT: It's just going to stay there. All right, finishing its go, Veth, you're up with Yasha on deck. 
SAM: First off-- 
MARISHA: Get the fuck out of there. 
SAM: First off, are we counting Caduceus as dying on that turn? Because that's a thousand gold. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: How much do I get for killing both of you? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I know how to hide a body. 
MARISHA: It's two, Caduceus, if you go down. 
SAM: And one if someone else does. 
MARISHA: But I was betting for someone going down. 
SAM: Well, so was I. 
MARISHA: Oh fuck! (laughter) 
MARISHA: You didn't make that clear. 
SAM: I'm blind right now. I got 300 that I can still score a hit while blind. 
MARISHA: Deal. 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm going to move towards this guy up there. 
MARISHA: Miss. 
TRAVIS: You got a lot of money. 
LAURA: Up on the pedestal? 
SAM: Up on the pedestal, yeah. 
LAURA: Where the arch used to be? 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Yes. And I'm going to use-- 
LAURA: I think Matt might need some help. 
MATT: It's fine, I'm getting there. 
LIAM: Further, further, or there? 
SAM: He gets nothing from us. Is that as far as I can go? 
MATT: Your movement is 30. 
LIAM: You want to get outside that triangle? 
SAM: Yeah. 30. 
MATT: You can get five more feet that way. 
SAM: I'll just walk around behind. Well, first, let me get it, first. 
LAURA: As you're like. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That's about there. 
SAM: So I will Shocking Grasp that dude. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Is he wearing any metal? 
MATT: There are metal bits of his adorned equipment and armor. So yeah. 
SAM: So I will attack him with advantage. 
MATT: All right. You have disadvantage because you're blind. 
SAM: But I don't because he's within 10 feet of me, and I can see anything within 10 feet of me. 
MATT: (laughs) Nice. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
MARISHA: Ranged attack. 
SAM: That is-- 
MARISHA: Ranged attack is what I thought you meant, you bitch. 
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Fucking hustler. 
SAM: This is blindsense. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: If I'm able to hear, I'm able to be aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature. 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Does that count if I am blind? They're not invisible. 
MATT: No, no. 
LIAM: It's all Daredevil hearing. 
MATT: No, if they're within 10 feet, yeah. You can totally. 
SAM: So then I will attack with advantage. 
MATT: Yeah, with advantage, go for it. 
LIAM: She gets that from walking through her house at night and not stepping on Luc's LEGO. 
SAM: That's right. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Double ones. 
SAM: Two 12s. (laughter) 
SAM: Which is plus nine, 21? 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs! (laughter) 
MATT: From another campaign. (laughter) 
LIAM: Ooh! 
SAM: Just 16 points of electric damage, lightning damage, whatever it's called, plus they can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. 
MATT: Right. 
SAM: And I'm out of the fucking triangle. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Unless it moves five feet. 
MATT: Okay. That one you did that to is the ego hunter. So no reaction. Okay. Got it. 
SAM: That's all I can do, no bonus action allowed. 
MATT: All right, that finishes Veth's go. Yasha, you're up with Caduceus on deck. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So, I am going to move up so I can get a Sentinel situation with that boy up there. 
MATT: Okay, up whereabouts? 
ASHLEY: I'll just get in front, maybe turn around, as close as I need to get. 
MATT: There you mean? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. To get that advantage and to take a swing. LAURA- Fuck yes, Yasha. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to hit him. All right, so I'm going to hit him, and I get advantage because of the Sentinel situation, right? Am I making this up? 
LAURA: Are you flanking? Because you're flanking. 
ASHLEY: Because I'm flanking, I mean. 
MATT: You are flanking. 
ASHLEY: Okay. (Australian accent) All right! So. 23? 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: Great. Okay, so first hit. 
SAM: Oh, do I get to save for blindness or anything at the end of my turn? 
MATT: Oh, you do, yeah, make a constitution saving throw. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: 300 you fail the save. 
SAM: You're on. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to re-roll these. (laughter) 
SAM: That is a 25? 
MATT: 25 succeeds, you're no longer blind. (laughter) 
MATT: Marisha, can you take off that blind token for me? 
MARISHA: No! 
MATT: I'm not trying to rub it in, you're just the closest to it. 
LAURA: Aren't you? 
SAM: Oh no, oh no. I'm stuck blind forever. 
MATT: Yeah, sorry. There you go, thank you. 
ASHLEY: Teefies. 
LAURA: Teeny, just a tad. 
LIAM: (high pitched) Teef. 
ASHLEY: Teef? I love when you do that so much. Okay, so now 2d8 fire damage. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Or radiant. Great. 
SAM: Why is my iPad dead? 
LAURA: Oh, because they were updated, which means you're going to lose battery so much faster. 
SAM: Fucking Apple-- 
ASHLEY: All right, so, we've got-- 
LAURA: Shh! 
TRAVIS: You mean "and oranges and bananas," right? (laughter) 
SAM: This is a Fisher-Price device. 
LAURA: Hey, stupid, it's not plugged in. 
SAM: It's not charging for some reason. Stupid Apple. 
TRAVIS: Apples and bananas. 
ASHLEY: 17 points of slashing. 
MATT: Yup. 
ASHLEY: Five points of fire damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 15 points of radiant damage. 
MATT: Okay, for 37 total. 
ASHLEY: And another 13 points of radiant damage. 
ASHLEY: And another 13 points of radiant damage. 
MATT: Okay. So that first strike (slashing). You're doing a second attack? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I'll do a second attack. (whistles) Aw, that was almost so good. I don't think that hits, 16? 
MATT: 16 does not, unfortunately. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
LAURA: Do you get another attack? 
ASHLEY: No. 
TALIESIN: You don't get three attacks? 
ASHLEY: No, I get two. 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
LAURA: Even at level 20? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Bonus action? Something? 
ASHLEY: Let me see if I got anything else in my bonus actions, but I don't think I do, guys. 
MATT: Big, heavy overhand swipe (sword thudding) strikes it after the Shocking Grasp through its armor. It's already jolting through its body. It impacts, and all five of them (grunts) wince from the impact, sharing the damage amongst them. All the crystals flashing as they do. 
ASHLEY: Damn, that's my turn. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's my turn, and I'm going to stay there. 
MATT: Finishing Yasha's go. Caduceus, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Just keep them in. 
TALIESIN: Have I seen these guys close enough to see if they have eyes, out of curiosity? 
MATT: Well. 
ASHLEY: Great, great. 
MATT: The one that's closest to you, you would if you weren't blind. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going to start by casting Heal on myself. 
MATT: Casting Heal on yourself? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. So I pull out a little mud and I wipe it from my pocket and I wipe the wet, mossy mud over my eyes because it heals that, and I get my sight and 70 points back. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Hold on a second. 
LAURA: 70? 
MATT: Hold on, before you do that. 
SAM: Uh-oh. They're going to try to arcane cock-block you. 
LAURA: What are you doing? 
MATT: Yeah, you're within 60 feet. He's going to use his reaction to use Dampen Divinity. 
TALIESIN: Anybody want to-- okay. 
MARISHA: Do what? 
SAM: I Undampen Divinity. 
MATT: Your spell continues, but you heal half as much. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: 35. 
TALIESIN: 35. 
MATT: As it absorbs the divine power out of your Heal spell into itself. 
MARISHA: Into itself? 
MATT: No, it doesn't heal itself. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: But it does steal the heal. (coughs) 
MATT: You good there? 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: (hoarsely) Steal the heal. (laughs) She was making a cool rhyme but didn't get it out. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that didn't work great. 
LIAM: (like Dr. Evil) I'm hip. I'm with it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'll take my hits. That's my action. I'm going to turn around. This guy, does he have eyes? 
MATT: You are blind, you don't know. 
TALIESIN: I fixed-- my eyesight's back. Heal. 
MATT: Oh, Heal cures that as well. Oh yeah, then you, glancing around in that direction, underneath its massive helmet and its head-adorned headdress, you can see the blackened shark-like eyes that sit within its Reiloran face, sunken deep into the ridges of its skull, and as you focus on it, you have a hard time focusing on its eyes, almost like it's pressing your attention away from meeting its gaze psychically. 
TALIESIN: Rude. And I use my bonus action to end the Holy Weapon. 
MATT: Which does what? 
TALIESIN: 30, anybody, anybody within 30 feet that I choose. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Where are we? 
LIAM: It's got an EMP blast? 
TALIESIN: It's got an EMP blast. 
SAM and LIAM: Whoa. 
TALIESIN: Where is my Holy Weapon? Sorry, I'm trying to find it. 
LAURA: I didn't know it could do that. 
TALIESIN: Oh, here we are. Let's see. You can dismiss the spell, causing the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a constitution saving throw. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That is not a spell I have ever taken. 
MATT: It does so. Ooh, that's going to be, that's going to be a fail. It's going to burn a Legendary Resistance to succeed. 
TALIESIN: Okay. It still is going to take, it's going to take half the damage that it's going to take, anyway, so. But boo. 
LIAM: With all the burning and the dunamancy, how did he look? 
TALIESIN: Is there anybody else within 30 feet that I'd want to hurt? No, not really. 
MATT: Feel like they've been hit a little bit. 
TALIESIN: Ugh, not great. 
SAM: They're surrounded by golden dicks. 
TALIESIN: 13. 16. 
MATT: Every time one of them gets hit, it's divided amongst all five of them. So all five of them have taken a little bit of damage. They're showing a little wear and tear. 
TALIESIN: Eight points of radiant damage. 
MATT: Eight points of radiant damage. 
LIAM: Should be keeping count of it. 
MATT: Which is-- All righty. Okay. All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to move, now that that's my action and bonus action, I'm going to move, I'm going to try and get out of the triangulation. 
MATT: Okay. So 30 feet, which way? 
TALIESIN: I think this way will get me out of there? 
MATT: So five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. There? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. About there, if that does it. 
MATT: Sure. Okay, that finishes Caduceus' turn. At the top, Beauregard, you are up at the top of the initiative order, with Fjord on deck. 
MARISHA: Okay, is this guy in the blade of the walls? The Blade Wall? 
MATT: He currently is, yes. 
MARISHA: Blade Wall. If he moves in that Blade Wall, does he get hit again? 
TRAVIS: Gets shoved around. 
MARISHA: Does he get shoved around? 
LIAM: If he leaves it. 
MATT: If he leaves it and gets pushed back in, yes. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: Or if he starts his turn in it. 
MATT: Starts his turn, right. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: So he will get hit if he stays put. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, when it's his turn, he will take damage. 
MATT: His turn is after Fjord's, he goes right before Jester. So at the start of his turn, he will take damage. 
MARISHA: After Fjord. All right, all right. I think I can actually, possibly, five-- 
LAURA: I wanted us to be able to get out. 
MARISHA: 40, 45, 55, 60, 65, 70, 
MATT: 70 is your speed? 
MARISHA: I might be able to make it to this guy. 
MATT: Yep, that'll get you into the melee. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Sweet. 
LIAM: Fucking parkour over there. 
LAURA: Wow. 
LIAM: Fucking get his ass. 
MARISHA: Can I get here? 
MATT: No, unfortunately, 70 feet gets you on the-- 
LAURA: In the middle of the-- 
MATT: -- on the steps. 
MATT: Next to Yasha. 
MARISHA: Fucking triangle. But I mean, if I-- 
SAM: Next to your wife. 
MARISHA: If I jumped up this wall instead and swung wide? 
MATT: You started here. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: You swinged it-- That's a straight path, so no, it wouldn't. 
MARISHA: That's okay. 
MATT: Yeah, it's a straight shot to get there. 
MARISHA: That's okay. 
SAM: Are you even-- 
MARISHA: Well, I'm technically base to base, I'm on this-- Huh? 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Does we see you yet? 
MARISHA: No. 
SAM: Cool. 
LAURA: Oh, so you're still invisible. 
ASHLEY: I can smell her. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Where the fuck is Beau? Oh. 
LAURA: Because she doesn't ever bathe. 
SAM: What does she smell like? 
MARISHA: She likes it. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm into it. 
MARISHA: She likes my natural musk. 
ASHLEY: I like her natural pheromones. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That's called bacteria. 
SAM: But she shaves her pits, right? 
MARISHA: Pop, pop, pop. 
SAM: Does she shave her pits? 
MARISHA: Oh wait. Do I still-- 
ASHLEY: No! 
MARISHA: -- have advantage? 
MATT: No, because her turn's done. 
ASHLEY: Grow all that shit. 
MARISHA: Okay, well, one's a natural 19 and the other is a one. 
MATT: Okay, so the 19 hits, the one does not. 
MARISHA: Okay. So for the 19-- 
LAURA: Pop. 
MARISHA: Pop. 
SAM: Whock. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take that. It's fine, it's not that cocked, so that is going to be 15 damage. 
MATT: 15 damage. All righty. 
MARISHA: Stunning Strike. Let's go for it. 
LIAM: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
LAURA: And if one is stunned, they're all stunned. 
MATT: That's not how that works. 
MARISHA: That's how it works, right? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: If one of them dies, they all die. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: I mean, actually, technically, that's true. 
LAURA: That is what would happen. 
SAM: If they die in their nightmare, they die in real life. 
MATT: If they die in the game, they die in the game. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so it's a constitution saving throw. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 300, they fail. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
MATT: That is a natural two. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: Going to spend another Legendary Resistance. 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: Oh! 
SAM: Well. 
MARISHA: But they still failed. 
MATT: They still failed. It automatically succeeds. (laughter) 
LAURA: No, not that. 
TALIESIN: Call it a tie. 
ASHLEY: Rollies! 
MARISHA: They're on my side. 
LAURA: I think Veth takes that one. 
MATT: You guys decide what you want. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: The rules as written. Rules as written is you can use the Legendary Resistance to automatically succeed. You all can debate. 
MARISHA: That's balls. (laughter) 
SAM: I'm taking the money. 
MARISHA: But that's fine-- No! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Bam. Let me-- 
LIAM: You owe her so much imaginary money. (laughter) 
MARISHA: It's okay. I'm rich. (laughter) 
LAURA: I'm imaginary rich. 
SAM: Wait, when did Beau get rich? 
LIAM: She has tenure. 
MARISHA: Yeah, tenure, yeah. 
TRAVIS: She's a Lionett. 
SAM: She's got a teacher's salary? 
LAURA: She's still got the vineyard. 
MARISHA: Yeah! I come from money. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
MARISHA: I get that sweet life insurance policy. 
SAM: Would he leave his stuff to you? 
MARISHA: Probably not. A-pop pop. 
LAURA: He will after I do some Modify Memory on him. 
SAM: Oh, oh, oh, oh. Put it to good use. 
TRAVIS: Isn't that insurance fraud? 
LIAM: She has a brother. 
SAM: That's true. 
MARISHA: Okay. Flurry of Blows. 
SAM: I have a small-- 
TALIESIN: It's the pop pop. 
MATT: Let's go, yeah. 
LAURA: I do think our shipping company is-- 
MARISHA: One is going to fail, but the other is, hang on, let me mark this, confirm.. 
SAM: (like Jester) I think you want to do business with us. 
MARISHA: The other is going to be... 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Dubba, dubba, dubba, da, 21. 
TALIESIN: Shipping business is up. 
MATT: 21 hits. 
TALIESIN: This is "What We Do in the Shadows." 
MARISHA: Okay. 12. No, no. 22. 
MATT and MARISHA: 22 hits. 
TALIESIN: You don't remember it. 
MARISHA: 22 hits. 
TALIESIN: But you were happy. 
LAURA: But you were happy. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay. 17 damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: And then Extract Aspects. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Extract that aspect. 
MARISHA: I've been waiting for this. 
LAURA: Extract that ass. 
MATT: Okay, what do you want to know? What's it say in there, specifically? Remind me. 
MARISHA: With Extract Aspects, I analyze a creature. When I hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by my Flurry of Blows, which I just did, I can analyze it. When (mumbles), okay, okay. Additionally, I learn all of its damage vulnerabilities, resistances, immunities, and condition immunities. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, so they are resistant to psychic damage. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Shocking. 
MATT: They're immune to being blinded, charmed-- 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
MATT: -- frightened and paralyzed. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MARISHA: Frightened. Okay. And paralyzed. They're immune to that? 
MATT: Yeah, I will also, not that you haven't picked up on this, but their communal abilities are all bound to the present crystals in this field. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: So we got to knock those crystals out. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: You don't have to. 
TALIESIN: But it would help. 
TRAVIS: Which we've been doing. 
LAURA: Yeah, it would help if they were-- 
MATT: The choices is yours. 
LAURA: -- all of the crystals. 
MATT: But like, because you're extracting the aspects as you strike it and pull its energy to understand and merge your spiritual energy with itself for a second, you feel suddenly connected, like a relay to all the remaining crystals in the chamber and the other ones, before you pull out of it and you're like, okay. So everything here is tethered. 
TALIESIN: Every little bit helps. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Choice is yours. 
MARISHA: Do they have any-- 
MATT: By the way, just to clarify, this is all just, these four here are just background. 
LAURA: Okay, those are just props. 
MATT: It's these, that and those. 
ASHLEY: Well fuck. 
TRAVIS: And the circle, right? 
MATT: And the circle, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
LAURA: So many things. 
LIAM: So you shout that out to your buddies? 
ASHLEY: So many. 
MATT: This one's taken a big hit. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Right, because Jester hit that one, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I say out loud. 
TALIESIN: I'd pop that one there. 
MARISHA: The crystals are giving them their combined shit. 
SAM: Who said that? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, I'm also right next to you. (screams) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: The Wildmother's returned. 
SAM: I'll fucking kill you! 
MARISHA: So they have resistance against psychic, immunities to blind, charmed, frightened and paralyzed. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Do they have any vulnerabilities? 
MATT: No vulnerabilities, no. 
MARISHA: And no condition immunities. 
MATT: Correct. No, no, those are-- 
MARISHA: Oh, those are their, and no damage? 
MATT: But no damage immunities, no. 
MARISHA: Okay. I say: Avoid psychic. Everything else is fair game. 
LAURA: Can any of us do psychic damage? 
SAM: I can. 
MATT: Fjord. 
SAM: But I won't. 
MARISHA: Hang on. 
MATT: Oh. My bad. 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
LAURA: But wait! 
MARISHA: But wait. 
LIAM: Wait. 
MARISHA: No, wait. 
TALIESIN: Wait. 
MARISHA: That was my bonus attack. 
TALIESIN: No, wait. 
TRAVIS: Wait. 
MARISHA: Extract Aspects. 
LAURA: Wait. 
MATT: That was your movement, your action, your bonus action. 
SAM: And you're a force ghost. 
MARISHA: And I'm a force ghost. Okay. 
MATT: Yep. Fjord, you're up. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to move five feet. Just one direction over this way a little bit. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you're going to whack-- 
TRAVIS: I'm going to send the first of, yee-haw, four Eldritch Blasts, goddamn! 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Towards the one that you were just pointing at. 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
LAURA: Jester's? 
TRAVIS: That Jester's all jiggity jacked up. 
MATT: Okay, so the first attack, roll that damage. 
TRAVIS: 24 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. Roll damage on that one. 
TRAVIS: Okay, that is 1d10. Seven, 12, 12 points of damage. 
MATT: 12 points of damage. Okay. I need its-- how much, what type of damage? 
TRAVIS: Force damage, all the way. 
MATT: Force damage. It impacts, (heavy impact) and the crack, (sharp cracking) spirals all through it, more so than you expected from a blast of your spell. 
TRAVIS: Force damage. 
ASHLEY: Force damage is the key. 
TRAVIS: Cool, I'll take a-- I'll try it again. 
LIAM: What was-- 
TRAVIS: Same one, 12, 20-- 
LIAM: -- still have vulnerability? 
TALIESIN: No, they're gone. 
LIAM: That's gone? 
TRAVIS: 23 to hit. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, one round. 
MATT: That hits. 
LIAM: One round, total. 
ASHLEY: ♪ My buddy ♪ 
TRAVIS: Nine, 14 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: I can't use that. 
LAURA: Do you think maybe I can get up and hit-- 
MATT: (shattering) 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Nice, nice! 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
SAM: He's out? 
MATT: You-- 
TALIESIN: Oh man. 
MATT: -- managed to tear that crystal into shards. It flies and scatters across the room, (clattering) spraying against the wall, and gathered in the far corner, that was the three, or the three that are nearest you. But the whole Weave Mind (shudders) and you watch the focus suddenly shifts to you down below there. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: They're all directed to that area, but they're starting to remember that you're present. 
TRAVIS: I got two more and I'm going to throw them down at the little circle in the daises there. 
MATT: Let's go. 
SAM: Diocese? 
TRAVIS: The dais? D- hmm. 
LAURA: Get that warm hole. 
TRAVIS: 27. 
MATT: This is which one, the-- 
TRAVIS: The circle on the floor. 
MATT: There? Yeah, that hits. 
TRAVIS: That's six, 11 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Blast through that hole. 
TRAVIS: Last one. 
LAURA: That would be-- wait, 11, but that was the first hit on it. So that's-- 
MATT: That was for the last turn. 
SAM: What? I thought it was the first hit on it? 
MATT: Until his next turn. 
TALIESIN: Until the end of my turn; it was one round. 
LAURA: Why did you do that? 
SAM: Your god sucks. 
TALIESIN: Because that's all how it works. 
MATT: Because it's an extremely powerful ability that just happens. 
TALIESIN: It's not my fault that no one took it. Well, you know. 
LAURA: I tried. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, people did. 
ASHLEY: I tried. 
TALIESIN: We did well. 
MATT: It's all good. 
TRAVIS: 24 for the last one. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Yeah, we have one round in. 
MATT: Yeah, that hits him. 
TRAVIS: Then eight, five-- 
TALIESIN: Force damage. 
TRAVIS: 13 points of force damage for the second shot into the dais. 
MATT: (force whooshing) Both blast into it. (cracks spread) It is extremely damaged, but still holding on. It's pulsing and flickering in the center. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: You hear the voices in your mind. "You fool, we'll tear you and your friends apart." 
TRAVIS: I hear it. 
MATT: "Your home will be ours." 
TRAVIS: I walk towards the edge. 
MATT: "Our people will infect--" 
TRAVIS: No, it's too bright. 
MATT: "-- and rend, and make what was yours, mine!" 
TRAVIS: No, no, whoa! And I'll fall off the side, and as I'm falling towards the ground, I'll (whooshing) vanish and I want to Far Step underneath this bridge, tucked under-- 
MARISHA: Oh cool. 
LIAM: Sick. 
MATT: Cool. 
TRAVIS: That's my turn. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
MARISHA: That's sick. 
MATT: All right, finishing Fjord's go, that brings us now to 20, which means they get their Legendary Actions back. All of them refill some of their temporary hit points here at a much lesser amount with the shattered crystals. 
SAM: Did we? 
LAURA: It would've-- 
SAM: No, but it's gone. 
TRAVIS: Matty, just-- 
MATT: Yeah? 
SAM: Goddamn it. 
TRAVIS: -- right here, I'll be under this one. 
SAM: It's a waste of Divine-- 
TRAVIS: Just for ref, we don't have to move it, under this corner. 
LAURA: It's force damage. 
TALIESIN: You want-- 
LAURA: I know. 
MATT: Okay. With that, we're going into... yeah, we're going to do Drain Nerve as the new-- 
TRAVIS: Drain nerd? 
MATT: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: Drain Nerve. 
SAM: That's not going to affect me, I'm not a nerd. 
LAURA: Ha ha. Yeah, right. You've been around us too long. 
SAM: Nope, I'm a cool kid. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LIAM: Tell me more about a capella. 
MATT: This guy starts his turn in the Blade Barrier. He's going to make a dex save, and he fails, so-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: -- Laura, go ahead and roll your 6d10, isn't it? 
TRAVIS: Nerd on nerd crime. 
LAURA: Okay. 11, 16, 20, 27, 29 points. 
MARISHA: Wait, you said-- Yeah, I think force would be better. 
TRAVIS: Force, yeah. 
LAURA: Force is good. By the way, Spiritual Weapon does force damage, not radiant damage. 
MATT: That would've been good to know. 
LAURA: That would've been good to know. 
MATT: But now we know going forward. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty, so. 
LAURA: We won't be able to get to any other weapon. 
MATT: This guy takes the damage and then shifts out of the blade beam. He's going to turn back this way, focused-- Let's see. Versus the manipulator here. 
SAM: Manipulator. 
MATT: Oh no, that one's the manipulator. He is the-- No, he's the other manipulator, he is. See if he gets his Horrid Puppet back. 
TALIESIN: What can I do, what can I do? 
MATT: He does get it back. 
SAM: Uh-oh, he's going to try this stupid Horrid Puppet thing. 
LAURA: On Beau or Yasha? 
MARISHA: He wants it so bad. 
LAURA: Or Caleb? 
LAURA: Or Fjord, all of everybody's within-- Are you under the bridge, Fjord? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: ♪ Only a man down there ♪ 
SAM: (laughs) 
SAM and ASHLEY: ♪ Is where I drew some blood ♪ 
SAM: ♪ (screech-singing) ♪ 
MATT: I'll say, in the instant, it does-- So you didn't hide, but you vanished from sight into a place where they did not see. Their mental awareness of being able to read minds nearby would at most times make them able to acknowledge your placement. However, they're also a little scrambled from the destruction of the crystals around them. So I'm going to say it does not know you're there. 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: So instead, it's going to go ahead and... underneath here, to that side beneath the Blade Barrier. 
TALIESIN: I don't know. I think it's going to-- 
MATT: It's going to Telekinetic Blast Caleb. 
LIAM: Ja, okay. Is this a dex save or... 
MATT: No, it's just an attack roll against you. 
LIAM: An attack roll. So I have to roll for my three Mirror Images. 
MATT: Correct. It's 23 to hit. 
LIAM: Yeah, hits. 
MATT: Okay, so roll for the first one. 
LIAM: That's a one. 
MATT: Oh, buddy. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Level 20. 
MATT: All right. So that's going to be 31 points of force damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Make a strength save for me. 
LIAM: Okay. That is a 10. 
MATT: 10. It launches you in the air and you land and impact, taking an additional one point of bludgeoning damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: But-- 
LIAM: I'm a little ouchie. Okay, okay. 
LAURA: You're a little ouchie? 
LIAM: Probably not as ouchie as Veth, though, right? 
MATT: You concentrating on a spell at the moment? 
SAM: Well, you're more ouchie than me. 
LIAM: No, I have no concentrations up. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Yeah, Mirror Image-- Oh! No, never mind. Never mind. 
MATT: It's going to do Telekinetic Blast again. It has a range of 120 feet. I don't know if Caduceus is in range. 
TALIESIN: It can see me? 
MATT: If it can-- Yes, it can, actually. Come over here. It stops at the Blade Barrier and that doesn't block you entirely, but you do have half cover, 3/4 cover. So you get a bonus to your AC. But you are within range, so it's going to attack you. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MATT: For 3/4 cover you get plus five bonus to your AC. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm still going to get nailed. 
MATT: That's going to be a 25? 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: That misses? 
TALIESIN: It misses. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Might be the-- Wow. Wow. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: What the-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: There's all this dust suddenly. Ah. Oh yeah. 
MATT: All right. Then at the end of its turn, it's going to Fold Space over this way. All right, finishing it's turn, Jester, you're up. You return, (foomph) into your space. 
LAURA: (grunts) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: If I can move 20 feet, is it going to reach that? It's probably not going to reach this crystal, is it? 
SAM: You're talking about moving your lollipop. 
LAURA: My Spiritual Weapon wouldn't hit that. 
MATT: It can move 20 feet in a turn, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So it would go, you wouldn't get the full distance, no. 
LAURA: But can it get to the guy then? 
MATT: It can, yeah, if you want it to. 
LAURA: Okay then I'll get it up there. 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20. 
LAURA: It's going to try to hit the guy. 
MATT: Let's go. 
SAM and LIAM: (exclaiming) 
ASHLEY: You did it! 
MARISHA: You succeeded. 
LAURA: 27. 
MATT: 27 definitely hits. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Kill him. 
TRAVIS: Did the crystals have a natural barrier at the beginning that the roll of die and minused it or something? 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: 20 points. 
SAM: Of force damage. 
LAURA: Of force damage! 
MATT: That was a lair action. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
TRAVIS: Lair action. 
LAURA: 20 points of force damage to the guy. 
MATT: To the guy? Awesome. 
MARISHA: He renewed the crystal as a lair action. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MARISHA: I see. 
LAURA: How's everybody looking? 
SAM: Eh. 
TALIESIN: A little rough. 
LIAM: Ouchie. 
ASHLEY: I'm okay. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I'm fine. 
TRAVIS: You're beautiful. 
MATT: They're starting to look a little hurt. 
LAURA: Oh really? 
MATT: The Weave Mind. They're starting to show a little wear and tear. 
LAURA: What does that mean? 
MATT: A little bloodied. 
LAURA: A little bloodied? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I don't know what that means. 
TALIESIN: They got a nosebleed. 
MARISHA: Halvsies. I feel like bloodied-- 
LAURA: Does that mean that's lower than 50 health points or lower than a hundred health points? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: Tell us exactly, Matt. 
LIAM: That's always the question. 
MATT: No. 
TRAVIS: No! (laughs) 
MATT: So, Jester, what would you like to do? 
LAURA: Fuck. (sighs) 
TRAVIS: You know what to do. 
LAURA: Is it time for a real heal? 
TALIESIN: I mean, up to you. 
LAURA: You're about to die. 
TALIESIN: I've got options. Yeah, I'm doing okay. 
LAURA: On another hit, though. 
TALIESIN: On another hit, I'm bad. 
MATT: Actually, at the end of the last turn before it comes to your turn. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: Don't say that out loud, damn it. 
LIAM: You want a doughnut, Matt? Do you want a doughnut right now? 
MATT: I'm okay. His legendary action for this guy-- 
ASHLEY: It's Chris' birthday. 
MATT: -- to go ahead and-- 
ASHLEY: Distract. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: He's going to Fold Space to there. 
LAURA: So would I have been able to hit him with my--? 
MATT: So, yeah, sorry. At the end of that. So if you want to do that. You can move this here to hit him, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: What was the Weave Mind's plan? What do you know about triangles? 
MATT: (chuckles) 
LAURA: Ugh. (sighs) Okay. Fuck. 
TRAVIS: Can you physically back up out of that triangle? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try to move out of the triangle. 
LIAM: Get out of it. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: It might be time for a heal, I don't know. 
LAURA: I'm, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. 
LAURA: I'm, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. 
SAM: Just leave. There's a door right there. 
MATT: The door's technically closed. 
LAURA: Oh right. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: This is out of the triangle. I guess if I'm next to Caduceus, I'm out of the triangle, right? 
SAM: Unless they move the triangle, yeah. 
LAURA: Currently, I'm out of the triangle. 
MATT: That's your max movement there, though. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Out of the triangle ♪ 
LAURA: And within 30 feet of all of these guys? 
MATT: Yeah, I think so, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Bermuda. 
MARISHA and SAM: (laugh) 
MARISHA: ♪ Bermuda, Bahama ♪ 
LAURA: I'm going to Mass Heal. 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (hum "Kokomo") 
LIAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to 9th-level up some healing for you guys. 
SAM: Whoa. 
LIAM: Cleric just rolled up. 
MARISHA: How much? 
SAM: Uncharacteristic. 
LAURA: I'm going to Mass Heal. I know they're probably going to cut it. 
TALIESIN: No, you divvy it up, so. 
LAURA: I'm going to divvy up 700 hit points, but I know they're probably going to take away half of it. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: 350? 
MATT: Let's see. That guy does not get a reaction-- 
SAM: No, because I biffed him. 
MATT: -- because of you. He already took one. I don't think you're within-- 
TRAVIS: MJ'd out of here. 
MATT: 80 feet of that guy. So he doesn't get a reaction. This guy, this guy's within 80 feet of Caleb, so he could technically get Caleb or Beau. This one could get Caduceus or-- 
LIAM: But they can see Beau. 
MATT: Yeah, so that's the range there. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: And it be canceled. 
MATT: And-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: So I'm going to try to get Caduceus up to full. 
MATT: Caduceus, how much would that heal you? 
TALIESIN: That would be math. One second. 
MATT: (laughs) That would be math. 
TALIESIN: It'd be 131 points. 
MATT: Okay. So you heal for half of that as he uses his reaction to-- 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. 
LAURA: To take it? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Can I hit him again? 
MATT: No, because it all happens at once. 
TALIESIN: But if you're doing Mass, you can, yeah, throw it to a bunch of people. 
LAURA: So that's 131 gone, right? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: And then, how much do you need? 
SAM: 96. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Mass Heal is so good. 
LAURA: Yeah, and how much do you need? 
LIAM: 80. 
LAURA: Okay, you have 80. 
TALIESIN: 66. 
LAURA: How much do you need? 
MARISHA: 21. 
LAURA: You take it all. What about you, Yasha? 
ASHLEY: 35. 
LAURA: All right, you take it all. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: And I need however much is the rest, and that's plenty. 
MATT: Great, there you go. 
TRAVIS: (indignant splutters) What? 
LAURA: You're not within 30 feet of me, Fjordy. 
MATT: You're not within 30 feet, buddy. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Sorry. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: Wedding's off. (laughter) 
LAURA: Listen, Mr. Bachelor Party, Mr. Always Saying, Yay, I'm Single Again; maybe it's coming back to haunt you. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Co-bachelor- bachelorette party. (laughter) 
MATT: Amazing. 
MARISHA: You guys have to stick together. We already sold out fucking Radio City. 
LIAM: Did Caleb get zapped at all by divine whatsit? 
MATT: You were in range for the other reaction. So how much would you to heal? 
LIAM: So I half it? 
MATT: Yeah, whatever you healed it would have been halved. 
TALIESIN: I'm at three digits now. I'm happy, and honestly-- 
SAM: Fjord, do you still need the number for that stripper? 
MARISHA: (laughs) What? 
SAM: You asked me to find you one. 
LIAM: Are you available? (laughter) 
SAM: No? What does this mean? 
TRAVIS: (noises of nervous distress) 
MATT: Jester, does that finish your turn? Bonus action, movement, and action, right? Okay. 
TALIESIN: Lollipop's good? 
MATT: Lollipop already attacked. All right, finishing Jester's go; that means it's going to go to the ego hunter on the far end. 
SAM: They're really cool-- It gets its reaction back. 
SAM: -- they come dressed up as a zhelezo. 
MATT: All right. Does it get its-- 
TRAVIS: Zhelezo? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Dressed as a zhelezo? 
TALIESIN: That's much better. 
MATT: It does not get its Mental Evisceration back. So instead, it will Gouge Ether. 
LAURA: Oh wait! 
TRAVIS: Blink. 
LAURA: Nope, I'm still up. 
MATT: Okay. It's going to Gouge Ether. I'm going to say-- 
SAM: That was clutch, Jester. 
LAURA: Thanks. 
MATT: That was really clutch. 
LAURA: Thanks. 
SAM: We're going to win now. 
MATT: It's going to Gouge Ether once to you, Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Then Gouge Ether once to you, Caleb. 
LIAM: Gouge my ether. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Am I under cover or no? 
MATT: You have half-cover from where it's standing. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: But that is a natural 19. So that's a 32 to hit you. 
TALIESIN: Misses. No, it doesn't. All right. 
LAURA: Wait. What is Gouging Ether? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
SAM: That's where you lose your spell slots? 
LAURA: Oh, that is-- 
MATT: That is going to be 24 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: And I need you to make an intelligence saving throw. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I no longer have advantage on the intelligence saving throw, do I? 
ASHLEY: Naur. 
MATT: You are correct. 
TALIESIN: Naur. Okay. 
MARISHA: Naur. 
TRAVIS: Naur. 
LAURA: Naur. 
TALIESIN: All right, and intelligence saving throw. There but for the grace of the gods go we. 
SAM: Hello, yes? 
TALIESIN: That's 13. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Hm? 
TALIESIN: 13. 
MATT: 13, okay, so you take 1d4 plus one spell slots, or levels of spells. So two levels. 
TALIESIN: Two! Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
MATT: Oh, that was so close to a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
MATT: All right, Caleb, that's going to be 30 to hit you. 
LIAM: All right, so maybe one of my mirrors will serve me this time. Nope! 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: That's a four. 
MATT: Come on, Caleb, I want this for you so much! 
LIAM: Just has to beat a six. 
MATT: I know! 
LIAM: It just has to beat a six. 
MATT: I know! (laughter) 
MATT: Bro! (laughter) 
LAURA: They look cool, though. 
MARISHA: It looked so cool. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: They're just flitting around. 
LIAM: Three Johnny Torches here. 
MATT: 31 points of force damage. 
LIAM: Dang! 
MATT: I need you to make an intelligence saving throw. 
LIAM: (groans) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's the best! 
MARISHA: He comes with his own fire spells. 
LAURA: They're dodging it on purpose. 
LIAM: 15? 
MATT: 15. Roll a d4. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Okay. Where's my d4? There it is. That's a four. 
MATT: You lose five levels of spells-- 
SAM: (groans) 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: -- of your choice. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Jeez Louise. 
LIAM: Jeez Louise indeed. 
MARISHA: That-- 
ASHLEY: This is rough. 
MARISHA: I would be-- 
SAM: Wait, wait. 
TRAVIS: Give a toe instead. 
SAM: Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. You did that wrong. You did that wrong. 
LIAM: There it is. 
SAM: No, you still did it wrong. 
LAURA: What? 
MATT: You're not losing five slots. 
SAM: No, that's a 1st-level, that's, 2nd-level is two. 
LIAM: What? 
MATT: Correct. It's five levels of spell slots. 
SAM: Yes. 
LIAM: So I lose-- 
SAM: Clear your 2nd-levels. 
LIAM: Clear them, cleared. 
SAM: No, no, no, I mean, they're all gone. 
LIAM: Oh, you mean block them out. 
SAM: Yeah, but you don't have to touch the 3rds. 
LIAM: Huh? 
MARISHA: You could use-- 
SAM: You did one level of 1st-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: -- and two 2nd-levels. Each of the 2nd-levels are two levels. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: For five total. 
TALIESIN: Five levels. 
SAM: That's five total. 
LIAM: So tiers are gone? 
SAM: No. 
LAURA: No, five spell slots. 
SAM: I got him. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: So five 1st-levels-- 
LIAM: This is the first game this has ever been in. 
MARISHA: So you could-- 
MATT: I know, it's all good. 
MARISHA: -- theoretically lose one 5th-level spell slot. 
LAURA: Or you could lose a 4th and a 1st. 
MATT: A 4th and a one. Or a three and a two. 
LIAM: So how many more? I don't even know what I pressed anymore because you badgered me. 
SAM: I remember. 
LIAM: Just do my work for me. 
SAM: I will. 
TRAVIS: There you go. 
SAM: There, you're good. 
MATT: Great. Friendship. 
SAM: You're good. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, get rid of the low-level ones. 
MATT: It's going to Fold Space into the corner over there. Sam or Liam, if you can move-- 
SAM: Oh, yes. 
LIAM: I don't feel like it after that business. 
ASHLEY: Does he get an attack of opportunity? 
MATT: No, because he teleported. 
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Boo. 
SAM: Uh-oh, we're all in the triangle again. 
LAURA: Are we triangulated? Are we triangulated? 
SAM: Yup. 
MATT: That's going to end its turn. 
LAURA: Shit. 
SAM: We really are. 
MATT: At the end of its turn, they're going to use three-- 
MARISHA: Oh, this is bad. 
LAURA: That's a big triangulation. 
MATT: -- of its legendary actions to do Entropic Storm. It's going to hit everybody except for Fjord, who is currently underneath the bridge. 
SAM: Fucking bridge troll. 
LAURA: I tried to back up! 
MATT: All right, I need all of you to make an intelligence saving throw. 
LIAM: Oh, come on! 
SAM: What is this, intelligence? 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: We don't-- 
LAURA: Ah! That was-- Okay. 
TRAVIS: That's usually a-- 
SAM: Is this an intelligence saving throw? 
TRAVIS: -- really good expression. 
LAURA: Intelligence saving throw. 
MATT: That balanced it a little. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: Intelligence saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Damn it! 
LAURA: Oh no. 
SAM: Okay, good. 
ASHLEY: Damn it. 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That's my weakest thing. 
ASHLEY: 11. 
MATT: 11 is a fail. You take 55 points of psychic damage. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Which I don't? 
LAURA: Which is halved-- 
MATT: Which you don't! No, you take none. 
LAURA: Oh, not at all! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't at all. 
MATT: You do take a point of exhaustion. 
ASHLEY: I take another point of exhaustion? Shit. 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
LIAM: Which, I think it-- 
TRAVIS: You got to start chopping. 
SAM: Slows you, I think. 
MARISHA: So you are. That's two levels of exhaustion? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Jeez Louise. We're doing-- 
TALIESIN: It'll tell you what level two does. 
SAM: Half your movement, I think. 
LAURA: -- rough. 
LIAM: Speed halved, yup. 
MATT: Caduceus. 
ASHLEY: Speed halved. 
TALIESIN: Fail. 
ASHLEY: Shit, okay. 
MATT: All right, so that's 55-- 
MARISHA: But he said that it was looking rough. 
MATT: -- points of psychic damage. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: And then you take a point of exhaustion. 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
MARISHA: Wait, what did you roll, Caduceus? 
TALIESIN: Nine. 
MATT: Jester? 
LAURA: 14. 
MATT: 14. 55 points of psychic damage. 
LIAM: Oh. 
MATT: And take a point of exhaustion. Veth? 
SAM: 26. 
MATT: 26, a success. So you only take half of that, but then you're also still resistant because you maintained the spell, right? 
SAM: Correct. 
MATT: So that would be 27 halved to 13? 
TALIESIN: I might be able to do a thing. 13 points of psychic damage. Caleb? 
LIAM: 17. 
MATT: 17. You take 55 points of psychic damage. 
LIAM: Mind Blank, so no psychic damage. 
MATT: That's right, no psychic damage. But you do take a point of exhaustion. 
LIAM: One point of exhaustion. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: So ability checks, okay. 
MATT: Beauregard? 
MARISHA: 23? 
MATT: 23 is a success. So you only take 27 points of psychic damage and do not take any exhaustion. 
MARISHA: Which is halved again-- 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: -- because, so that's-- 
MATT: So that's 14. Or no, half of 27, 13. 
LIAM: Because you are in full diamond Emma Frost mode. 
SAM: I also just rolled to maintain my concentration. I rolled a 13, so that's a 22. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. 
LAURA: I rolled a 23 total to maintain my concentration. 
MATT: Yeah, you're great. All right, cool. That's going to finish its go. 
MARISHA: Wowzers. 
MATT: Now, we move over to-- 
SAM: We're dead. 
MATT: These guys are pissed. 
SAM: This spell is the greatest thing I've ever done. 
MATT: The sense render. The sense render-- 
LIAM: Sense render? Another thing? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, they're the two that go in a row in that order. I'll pick up that dice later. All right, so it does not get its Divide Recognition back. 
LIAM: Oh no. 
MATT: But does it get back its Rend Arcana? It does get back its Rend Arcana. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: Yeah, they lose an element of legendary stuff there. So it's going to-- That is that one over there. 
SAM: You've used Haste before. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Does it affect the current turn? Can you Haste yourself and then use its benefits in the same turn? Can you use a second action? 
LAURA: I think so. 
LIAM: Boy. Mine was weird because it was-- 
TALIESIN: Working on it. Got it. 
LIAM: -- a bonus action. 
LAURA: I think it does. 
LIAM: A spell is an action. 
LAURA: It immediately takes-- 
LIAM: You can use it to attack. 
LAURA: Yeah. You can't do another spell. 
MATT: That one is going to Psychic Tempest that same cluster right there. 
LIAM: It'll increase your AC, right? 
MATT: It's a 20-foot burst starting there, which gets all of you, again, in that space. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. Yeah. 
LAURA: That's 20 feet? 
MATT: So I need all of you there to make another intelligence saving throw like you just did. 
TALIESIN: I'm so fucked. 
SAM: Dear lord. 
ASHLEY: Damn, this sucks. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh. 
TALIESIN: Maybe. 
MATT: That's real bad. 
TALIESIN: Maybe, maybe. 
LIAM: I'm rolling dog shit. 
MATT: That's a balance to the last one. All right, so 28, so it'll be 28 points. 
SAM: Is this a spell? 
MATT: No, it's a-- 
SAM: God damn! They don't have spells. 
LIAM: They have no spells. 
MATT: They're not spellcasters. 
LIAM: They're psionic nightmares. 
MATT: It's all psionic alien shit. 
MARISHA: 28 total. 
MATT: Success. So you take 14 points of psychic damage reduced to half, so seven. 
MARISHA: This Empty Body is sick, yo. 
LIAM: I got a, what is it, 15, but Mind Blank, so no psychic damage. 
MATT: No psychic damage. But you cannot take reactions until your next turn. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Veth? 
SAM: 23. 
MATT: 23, yeah. You take 14 points I said it was? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah, 14 points of psychic damage reduced to seven. 
SAM: Seven. 
LAURA: I take 14 points. 
MATT: 14 points of psychic damage. 
TALIESIN: 20? 
MATT: 20 is a success. So you take 14 points of psychic damage. 
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural 20. 
MATT: Natural 20. So you take-- 
ASHLEY: So 21. 
MATT: -- no psychic damage to you. 
ASHLEY: So I'm okay? 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah, and you can still take your reactions. All right, great. Awesome. That's going to finish its go. At the end of its turn-- No, that's it. It's going to hold onto the rest of the legendary actions. Caleb, you're up. 
LIAM: Okay. DM, you landed me equidistant on four squares. Can we say it's this square? 
MATT: Yeah, that's fine. 
LIAM: Okay. Five, wah! 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. I'm pressing myself against the wall slightly out of that triangle. 
LAURA: I don't know if you're out of it. 
LIAM: Well, that's fine. I'm going to look up at the one floating, mutter an arcane word that will reverberate through the chamber, and cast Power Word Stun. If it is 150 hit points or less, it will be stunned and fall from the air. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: That creature is instantly stunned-- 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: -- and plummets. 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
MATT: (plummeting descent) (thuds) Impacts on the ground, falling 30 feet because the ceiling up here is 30 feet. 
LIAM: Eat shit. 
MATT: So it takes-- 
LIAM: 3d6. 
MATT: Actually, I'll let you roll the damage on that. It's more fun. 
LIAM: Yay. Oh, I rolled real good. 16. 16 points of falling damage, bludgeoning damage. 
MATT: Which they all take, separated. 
LIAM: (laughs) Everyone takes three points. 
MATT: Yep. All righty. Crack, and it is stunned, and it gets a save at the end of each turn to try and get rid of it, right? 
LIAM: Yes, con save. 
MATT: You got it. Okay. Awesome. One of them is currently out of commission until it can manage to pull itself free. 
TALIESIN: Which means very easy to hit. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's great for you guys. 
ASHLEY: Yep. 
LAURA: Because hits are advantage because it's prone, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Also, the triangle is changed. 
MATT: It's also stunned. 
SAM: Wait, ranged-- 
TRAVIS: Actually, this one, the triangle over there. 
LAURA: Well, that triangle-- 
TALIESIN: Range is harder to hit. 
LAURA: That's why you're still in a triangle is because of that fucker. 
MATT: That also means attack rolls against it have advantage regardless. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Because it's stunned. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: It would be a straight roll for ranged. 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: Yeah. Yep. So anyway, that finish your turn, Caleb? You still have a bonus. 
LIAM: You said I didn't have reactions until my turn. So my reactions are back now, right? Because now it's my turn. 
MATT: Correct. Because, yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah, because the way the order was for that, it didn't quite have the impact. 
LIAM: Right. 
MATT: All right, cool. Finishing Caleb's go. That one over there is going to take its turn. The ego hunter. All right. 
LAURA: Another one's going? 
SAM: Shit. 
MATT: It's going to be that one there, I think. That one's going to be-- Let's see if it gets its Mental Evisceration back. It does not. 
LIAM: Still have a lot of crystals over here. 
LAURA: I know, there's a lot of crystals and all of them are still up. 
MARISHA: Well, they'll all stay up until-- 
LAURA: Until they're all down. 
MARISHA: Until they're all down. That's the only problem. 
MATT: This one's barely holding on. 
LAURA: That crystal? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: This one here is going to attempt to move over here. 
TALIESIN: Oh, clever. 
MATT: It's going to attempt to Gouge Ether once on each of you. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: Against you, Caduceus. 20? 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: 20 misses. Against you, Jester. 19? 
LAURA: Misses. 
MATT: No, both miss. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
LAURA: Oh, well, no. That's a lie. 19 is my armor class. I thought it was higher. 
MATT: It is your armor class. Okay, so that does hit you. So, with the Gouge Ether it's going to be-- 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: Is that really what my armor class is? 
TALIESIN: Do you have your armor on? 
LAURA: Do I have my armor on? 
MATT: It's 19 points of force damage against you. 
LAURA: Wait, is my armor not on? 
MATT: Because you have a shield as well, right? 
LAURA: I have a shield and my armor. 
LIAM: Is your shield equipped? 
LAURA: My shield is equipped, but-- 
LIAM: Is your armor equipped? 
LAURA: I don't know if I have any armor on my body right now. 
TALIESIN: I see a breast plate there. 
LAURA: But it's not equipped. Hold on, let's see if it brings my AC up. Oh, it does! My AC is 20! 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: She just finishes putting on her armor. 
LAURA: I didn't have my armor on! 
LIAM: (as Jester) Oh, I missed a buckle. (clips) 
LAURA: How funny, I don't know why I didn't have my armor on. 
MATT: There you go. 
LAURA: My AC is 20. 
MATT: Yeah, it misses. 
ASHLEY: Yay! 
MATT: All righty. That finishes its go. That guy is stunned on the ground and cannot do anything for his turn. 
MARISHA: Yeah, fuck you. 
MATT: He's going to try and save. That's a fail. He doesn't want to be stunned. He's going to use another Legendary Resistance to get rid of it. That's three Legendary Resistances. 
MARISHA: So that's all three of them? 
MATT: Seems that might be the case. It is no longer stunned, but it is still prone. 
MARISHA: That's good, that's good, that's good. It's still prone and its legend-- They're gone, they're gone now. 
MATT: All righty. Now, Veth, Yasha, then Caduceus. 
MARISHA: He used a Legendary Resistance to save against a stun. 
SAM: No one's in sneak attack. 
TRAVIS: Your stun? 
MARISHA: His stun. He stunned it. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, they fall from the sky. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: I can't get to a pillar. 
TRAVIS: So attacks are still at advantage. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: You could shoot a pillar. 
LIAM: Yeah, until it gets up, but it's going to be down-- 
SAM: Without sneak attack damage, it doesn't do shit. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I might go over there. 
ASHLEY: But it does something. 
LIAM: Whale on it. 
LAURA: This guy got hit a lot. 
SAM: Yeah, I might have to just go for him. 
MATT: You could also hold your action for somebody else to get up to it. 
MARISHA: Because that guy over there from here-- 
LAURA: But would it, even if something's standing next to, you wouldn't get a sneak attack on a pillar. 
SAM: No. 
MATT: On a pillar, no. But a target, though. If you want to hold an action to shoot something when a friend gets next to it, then you can do that and get sneak attack. 
SAM: But who's running next to these guys? They can bamf all over the place. 
LIAM: Beau's going to get over there. 
SAM: I can't even see her. 
MATT: She's right in front of you at the steps. Oh yeah, no, you can't see her. 
LAURA: She's invisible. 
MATT: You can sense her when she's close. (laughs) 
SAM: Yeah. I think I'll just-- 
LAURA: This guy is creating a lot of triangles. 
SAM: I'm going to try to kill him, her, it, them. I will somehow try to hide. 
LAURA: Maybe you can jump in this little hole here, ploop. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You want to hide in where the crystal was? 
SAM: Sure. Yeah, I'm going to go in the hole. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Where you belong! 
SAM: I'm going to be: Look over there! And then jump in the hole. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: And bonus action hide. 
MATT: Now, you can only take an action or a bonus action this turn. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: Am I still logy? Am I still sluggish? 
MATT: That was only, that happened before you got to this turn, right? 
SAM: That was two rounds ago. 
MATT: Was that two rounds ago? 
SAM: Yeah, but I don't-- You never told me to save for it. 
MATT: I'll trust you. 
SAM: Does it only last one round? 
MATT: It only lasts one round. For some reason, I thought that was-- 
SAM: That was two rounds ago. 
MATT: Okay, I'll allow you then, go for it. 
TALIESIN: He did the thing. 
MATT: I trust you. 
SAM: So I will hide with advantage. Garbage, disgusting, terrible. 
LIAM: Your hide doesn't have expertise? 
SAM: Oh, it does! (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: 27. 
MATT: Okay! (laughter) 
MATT: Absolute dog shit. My life is ruined. We're great. 
SAM: Then I will attack with my crossbow bolt. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: Disgusting, terrible. 12. However, if I miss, I'm going to activate one of the charges of the Aeorian Security Cannon-- 
MATT: Right. 
SAM: -- to re-shoot. Slightly better, 17? 
MATT: 17 does not hit. 
LAURA: (tongue waggling) 
SAM: And that's it. 
LAURA: That's it? 
SAM: I think I can only activate it once per turn. 
LAURA: You can only shoot one time? 
SAM: Well, my bonus action I can shoot again, but I bonus actioned to hide. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Which is pretty important. 
LAURA: Well, at least they can't get you. They're not going to attack you with anything. 
SAM: Yeah, because they sure didn't see me shooting at them twice. 
LAURA: You hid. (laughter) 
MATT: That's all good, it's worth a shot. All right, end of Veth's turn. Yasha, you're up, with Caduceus on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: Beau and Fjord coming up after. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so because I have exhaustions, 
ASHLEY: Okay, so because I have exhaustions, can I get to that guy over there? Since I have half movement? 
MATT: What's your movement? 
ASHLEY: Is he within 25 feet? 
MATT: He is within 25 feet. 
SAM: Oh, I was wrong! It's eight plus 13. That hits. 
MATT: Yeah, that does hit. 
LAURA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
MATT: All right, we'll come to that. 
SAM: 21? 
MATT: Yes, you are 20 feet, within 25 feet away from him. 
LAURA: Would the first would have hit? 
SAM: No, the first one I rolled a three. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: The second one was an eight. 
MATT: That does hit. 
SAM and LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So, a lot of stuff. Sorry, sorry. 
LIAM: Let's go, rogue. Let's go, rogue. 
SAM: Oh, these are all the good ones. 
LIAM: Look at all the sixes. 
SAM: Yeah, there are sixes. 18, 22, 28. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
SAM: 30, 35, 40. 43, 50 points of damage. 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
MATT: 50 points of damage on that one, okay. 
LAURA: Beep, beep, boop. 
MATT: As your blow strikes, (whooshes) (groans) it takes the hit. You sense in that moment the hit sinks deeply and the brunt of it, it almost falls to the ground and keeps itself lifted. The others aren't affected. Like it's too far from a functional crystal to be part of-- 
ALL: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Shit! 
LAURA: Kill it! 
TRAVIS: Oh, ET phone home! 
LAURA: He took all 50! He took all 50! 
ASHLEY: He got too far, he got too far. 
TRAVIS: Rail on this motherfucker! 
LAURA: You're trying too hard to make fucking triangles! 
MATT: That one's looking real rough. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
SAM: Put him in a body bag! 
TRAVIS: (screeches) 
ASHLEY: (screeches) 
TALIESIN: You still have your Aeorian thing, too, because you didn't use it. No, no, you did. Never mind. 
SAM: I did use it. 
LAURA: Now he's close enough to you! 
ASHLEY: Okay, all right, I'm going to take some attacks. 
MATT: Well, they do have one more legendary action at the end of your turn. 
SAM: One's almost dead. 
LAURA: He's-- Look! 
ASHLEY: Because he's outside the crystals. 
LAURA: He's too far! 
SAM: Triangle man! 
LAURA: Triangle man. 
MATT: Last legendary action, that one's going to Fold Space to try and teleport away. Hand him to me over there. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. Uh-oh, he's teleporting. 
TRAVIS: He ran. He ran. 
MATT: 60. 
LAURA: He just teleported. 
MATT: There, to try and get away. 
LAURA: Is he close enough to a crystal now? 
MATT: He would be now. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
MARISHA: Does that automatically distribute? 
MATT: We'll find out. 
LAURA: No. 
MARISHA: Or do the crystals have to activate? 
ASHLEY: I run after him and take some shots. 
MATT: So five, 10, 15, 25. To move 25 feet to him, you're going to have to leap over that wall to get there. Make an athletic check for me. 
LAURA: You can do it, Yasha! 
MATT: You have advantage on it. 
TALIESIN: No, you're straight. 
MATT: Oh right, because of your exhaustion. 
TALIESIN: It's a straight roll. 
ASHLEY: It's just a straight roll? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, advantage, you're disadvantaged. 
ASHLEY: What is it again? 
MATT: Athletics check. To leap over the wall to get-- To not lose movement to get to him because he's just 25 feet away from you through that wall. 
TRAVIS: Rage! 
ASHLEY: I'm raging, I'm raging. So that means I get to do it not again? 
SAM: The ragin' Cajun. 
ASHLEY: Strength checks and saving throws? 
MATT: Are advantage, but you have disadvantage because of your exhaustion. 
LIAM: So it's a straight roll. 
ASHLEY: So am I taking a-- 
LAURA: You're just taking whatever that was. 
MATT: Add your athletics. 
ASHLEY: Okay, a 16. 
MATT: 16 is enough. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So you run in, vault over the wall, and get right up to him. 
LAURA: Slice his face! 
ASHLEY: Hello. 
TRAVIS: (turkey gobbles) 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right. 
TRAVIS: What do them ♪ guts look like? ♪ 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. Um, all right. 
SAM: What if it's just cake? 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, it's the dice. 
LAURA: Have you seen that one that is the hippo? 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: The baby hippo? 
SAM: You mean the wet--? 
LAURA: The cutie baby hippo? 
ASHLEY: It hits. It's over 21. 
MATT: Go for it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: It looks like a baby hippo and then they slice it and it's cake. 
ASHLEY: Let's do these two. 
LIAM: (gentle shushing) 
SAM: What was that hippo's name? It's not Beppo. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so we've got-- 
LIAM: But it's close to that. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
ASHLEY: So we've got-- 
SAM: What is the hippo's name? 
ASHLEY: -- 21 points of slashing. 
LIAM: It was a little cutesy name. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: We've got five points of fire damage. 
MATT: 16. 
ASHLEY: We've got-- Let's do this one. Okay, we've got 14 points of radiant. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: This is not-- 
TALIESIN: That's all dead now. 
ASHLEY: That's for first hit. 
MATT: All right, so it's 30 points of damage on the first hit. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay, second hit. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. Roll to see if you hit him. 
MARISHA: There's always that lull when you're like, and then second hit-- 
SAM: Moo Deng! Moo Deng! 
TRAVIS: Trying to reach for-- 
SAM: It was Moo Deng. 
ASHLEY: Okay, uh... 26. 
MATT: 26 hits. 
TALIESIN: Mm-mm! We got to take those fucking pillars down, oh my god. 
LAURA: They're ruining the whole vibe in this place. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: You know what, I'm going to do Savage Attacker and see if I can get higher. 
MATT: Let's go. 
MARISHA: I like the blue lighting, not going to lie. 
ASHLEY: Exactly the same, okay. 
MATT: (laughs) It was worth a shot. 
SAM: 100 gold says Yasha takes him down in this round. 
MARISHA: I agree with you. 
ASHLEY: 20 points of damage. 
MARISHA: I agree with that. 
SAM: I'll go against it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: That's 10 points to-- 
TRAVIS: You know, the first step is admitting you need help. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: They are sharing hit points, it's highly unlikely to happen. 
MARISHA: Well, we don't know, because maybe it regenerates. 
LIAM: He ran to the crystal. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (exuberant cheering) 
ASHLEY: Okay, all right, all right, all right. 
TRAVIS: We finally knocked down one! 
MATT: All of them take the impact, so you do sense that they are reconnected in this psychic network that binds them. But this one took such a heavy hit outside of it that this was just enough to finish it. (gasps) 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: So they all took 10 damage from that divided, but it had less than 10 hit points at the end. 
LAURA: Do they all feel a group collective sorrow? 
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to-- 
MATT: So how do you want to do this? 
ASHLEY: -- try to reach out and grab a piece of-- 
LAURA: A fifth of their brain just disappeared. 
ASHLEY: -- something that's dangling from him, her, it and yank it back onto my blade. 
MATT: It's shifting away. 
TALIESIN: Oh, maybe. 
MATT: (gurgling groan) Onto it and it drapes over. As it gets close to your face, you look past the head armor and its sunken eyes and you see that glowing blue energy in it as it fades into darkness, its hands reaching for you, almost like it's trying to strangle you. You watch as its fingers immediately crumble into dust. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) Dusted. 
MATT: It immediately powders beneath the armor. (crumbling) 
TRAVIS: Ooh. 
MATT: The rest of its ornamental armor just-- (clanging) (tumbling clatter) 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: It immediately aged way past its years. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MARISHA: It was like 500 years old or something. 
LAURA: We can do this. 
LIAM: It was holding its cells. 
LAURA: We can do this! 
LIAM: It was holding its cells together with psychic force. 
TALIESIN: Was that one within 60 feet of me, out of curiosity? I feel like it was just on the edge of 60 feet. 
MATT: It would be-- 
LIAM: I want to do that. 
ASHLEY: Looked like it. 
MARISHA: Jeez, right? 
MATT: 60 feet. It was just on the edge, yeah. 
TALIESIN: So how many hit dice did it have? 
MATT: 15. 
TALIESIN: I will take that 15 HP. 
LIAM: Ooh, nice. 
TRAVIS: Yes, you will. 
LAURA: Nice! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
LAURA: Get it. 
MATT: All the other Weave Mind kind of, you watch as they all collectively inhale at the loss of one of their chosen brethren. Their connected brethren. A part of their union, their body of minds, is lost forever. 
LAURA: They all have-- 
SAM: Sex? 
LAURA: They've had centuries of sex. 
MATT: In all of your minds, you hear a unique blend of a mournful wail of an alien emotion-- 
LAURA: Aw, they do feel sorrow. 
MATT: -- you've never experienced or considered, and a nightmarish vengeance, both dissonantly merging and focusing. 
TRAVIS: What was the name of the one that fell? 
MARISHA: Yeah, who was Tinky Winky? 
TRAVIS: Ego-- 
MATT: (laughs) Who was Tinky Winky? 
ASHLEY: Tinky Winky! 
MATT: Tinky Winky was an ego hunter. 
TRAVIS: Ego hunter. 
LIAM: Scary Spice. 
MATT: Yeah. All righty, so. 
SAM: They had two tenors, they didn't need two tenors. 
ASHLEY: One down. 
TRAVIS: Oh, he tore it up! 
LAURA and LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: He tore it up! 
LIAM: No combos with that one. 
MATT: So finishing Yasha's go, Caduceus you're up, with Beau on deck. 
TALIESIN: Okay, where's my toys? 
SAM: Beau? Beau died early in this fight. We haven't seen her since. (laughter) 
LAURA: Beau's not doing anything. 
SAM: Beau? Beau! 
TALIESIN: Let's see. 
MARISHA: I'm right next to you. You're yelling in my face with your shit breath. (laughing) 
TRAVIS: Your poop breath? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: How hard would it be to climb up this, out of curiosity? 
SAM: I eat dried meats. 
MATT: You can make an athletics check. You'll lose five feet of movement, but you can get up there. 
TALIESIN: I'm at fucking-- I have disadvantage, anyway, don't I? 
SAM: I eat whatever my husband and kids don't finish on their plates. 
MATT: You can lose five feet of movement and do it easily-- 
SAM: It sucks. 
MATT: -- or you can try and make an athletics check. 
TALIESIN: You're fine. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. 
TRAVIS: Just teriyaki fried meats and sour cream and onion chips. 
TALIESIN: How are you doing right now? 
LIAM: I'm ouchie. 
TALIESIN: I'm ouchie? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Again? 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm a wizard! 
TRAVIS: Ja! 
SAM, LIAM, and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Your boy's ouchie. 
MATT: So you go five, 10, 15 to get on top. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You must always assume. 
LIAM: My mirrors have done fuck all today. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'll do that. My athletics check may go really poorly. I have no idea. What happened? 
MATT: Make a check. 
TALIESIN: All right, here we go. 
SAM: They're having the time of their life. 
TALIESIN: Why athletics? 
LIAM: Every time I get hit-- 
LAURA: Please, Caduceus. 
LIAM: -- they go: Oh! 
TALIESIN: No acrobatics? Nah. 
MATT: Not for this, no. 
TALIESIN: Nah, you're right. 
MATT: Because this is just a vault and climb. 
MARISHA: Burn! 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Nine? 
MATT: Nine's not great. So you do get up there, but your movement will end at the top of that hill, at the top of the wall there. Five, 10, 15 to get to the top. 
LAURA: Like that? 
TALIESIN: No more movement? 
MATT: That's about-- I'd say like, it'd be 15 feet of movement. What's your movement speed right now? 
TALIESIN: 30. 
MATT: 30. So I'd say you can get 20 feet of movement total. So about there, that's as far as you can get. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I wanted to get within-- Yeah, I just want to get within 30 feet of Caleb. 
MATT: Okay. You do whack your knee in the process of getting up there. 
LAURA: Oh, Caduceus! 
MATT: You take one point of bludgeoning damage as your kneecap clips the top of the stone. 
TRAVIS: (fighting game death noise) 
LAURA: Help, it's again. 
TALIESIN: Took it. 
MATT: 30 feet. Yeah, he's within 30 feet of you. 
TALIESIN: Okay, well, this is the second verse same as the first. We are doing a Mass Heal. 
SAM: Oh! 
LIAM: Ooh! 
MATT: Oh, because you got a level nine spell, too, right? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Woo, oof! 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Monster trucks. 
MATT: Hold on a second. 
TALIESIN: So I assume-- 
MATT: Hold on a second. 
LAURA: Wait, do you need it? Do we need Mass Heal right now? Because nobody else is down a lot except for you and Caleb. 
ASHLEY: Do you just have Heal? 
LIAM: Yeah, but if everybody else is-- 
TALIESIN: Also, they're going to cut it in half. 
LAURA: I don't know if anybody's close enough to cut it in half this time. Maybe they are. 
TALIESIN: They are. I mean, its 120 feet, if I recall? 
SAM: 60. 
MATT: 80 feet for their-- 
TALIESIN: 80 feet. 
LIAM: What if you healed yourself? 
TALIESIN: That's 80. 
LIAM: Just heal yourself, physician. 
TALIESIN: Oh, are you sure? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Physician ♪ 
LIAM: Yeah, heal thyself. 
TALIESIN: (uncertain groan) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Physician ♪ 
LAURA: It's just a lot not to be-- 
TALIESIN: That's fair. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Physician ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I thought everyone was way worse than they were. Why would I get up there? Okay. 
LAURA: I mean, we might be by the time it gets back around. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Shit, there's a-- All right, I'm trying to pick a thing. All right, if I wasn't going to do this I wouldn't have gone up there, but since I did get up there. Fuck a duck. Here we go. I'm sorry, where'd my-- 
SAM: Sorry, Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: No, no, no. 
SAM: This is the hill you're going to die on. 
TALIESIN: It really is, isn't it? Where we are. 
LIAM: It's called Olympus Mons. 
TALIESIN: Touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing. Yeah, it might actually. Does regenerate take away-- No. Um. Is it regenerate, or--? Hold on, sorry. I'm doing a thing. 
MATT: That's okay. Beau, you are on deck, just so you know. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I guess I can do-- 
LAURA: You could just do Heal. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll just do straight Heal. Yeah, I'll do straight Heal. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I don't know why I climbed up there for that. That was probably a bad idea. 
MATT: Dampen Divinity, so you heal half that amount. It would be 70 normally? 
TALIESIN: It's 120. 
MATT: Oh, for healing? 
LIAM: I thought you were just healing yourself. 
TALIESIN: I was, I actually was only going to. Well, let's see. I was only, but if you need it. 
LIAM: Just heal yourself. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we can split it, though. 
MATT: Well, you said it was just a Heal. A 6th-level Heal? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: That is 70 hit points. 
LIAM: It's a one-person sell, right? 
TALIESIN: No, this is a-- Heal is a-- Oh yeah, sorry. I thought I did something else. Yeah, it's Heal. 
MATT: That's okay. So you heal 35 hit points from the Dampen Divinity. 
TALIESIN: Oh, no, I'm healing myself. 
MATT: Oh, yourself? Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, sorry. Everything got turned around. 
MATT: That's okay. Let's see if you're in range of that guy. Yeah, you are. So you heal 35 hit points. 
LAURA: Ugh. I know, that's not enough. 
TALIESIN: I, honestly, I wouldn't have done-- Yeah, my whole plan got fucked. So that's okay. So it's done. 
ASHLEY: Naur, naur, naur. 
TALIESIN: I know, I got-- 
LAURA: Do you want to use the Mass Heal? 
TALIESIN: Honestly, yeah, now I'm fine. I'm calling this as a learning experience. 35. 
TRAVIS: I love those. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Eh. 
ASHLEY: It's something. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. Oh god, I did some dumb shit. Here we go. There we are. Is that right? Did that do anything? 
ASHLEY: It did. 
TALIESIN: Okay, good. 
MATT: So wait, Jester, you did your Mass Heal last time. So when the one that would've done that to you had already used its reaction and it hadn't come back to its turn. So you would do a full 70. 
LAURA: You got the full 70. 
TALIESIN: Oh, all right! I'll take it. 
LAURA: Instead of the 35. 
MATT: I just realized. The one that's getting you there already got you and it hasn't come back to its turn. So yeah. 
TALIESIN: Much better. 
ASHLEY: Great, great, great. 
MARISHA: This is still the same round.

MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Not like this. 
LAURA: Not like this. 
MARISHA: I don't have advantage or anything, right? No, he-- yeah. 
MATT: You do against him because he is still prone. 
MARISHA: Because he's down? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Okay, first hit, natural 19. 
LIAM: All right, all right, all right. 
MATT: Okay, that hits. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
MARISHA: And it's going to be 1d12 which is-- Goddamn it. Eight points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Stunning Strike. 
MATT: Strike. Uh-- 20? 
MARISHA: Yeah, 20 saves. Second hit.

MARISHA: Okay. Guy behind him. Flurry of Blows. 
MATT: That guy? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Let's go. Single attack on him for each. 
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows? 
MATT: Right, I'm saying, but he's not prone, so. 
MARISHA: Right. He's not prone. Start fresh. Okay. Yep, that's going to be 28 to hit. 
MATT: 28 to hit? 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: That definitely hits. 
MARISHA: Hang on. Let me make sure here. (growls) Stunning Strike.

LAURA: Whoo! 
TRAVIS: Which one, which one? 
ASHLEY: Great! 
MARISHA: This one. 
LAURA: That one's stunned, too? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: They're both stunned? 
MARISHA: No, he saved. 
MATT: This guy's prone. 
ASHLEY: Yes, baby. 
LAURA: Oh, he's just prone? 
MARISHA: He's prone. 
TRAVIS: So, they both have advantage on him. No? No. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: The prone one does. 
MARISHA: He's got advantage-- 
MATT: They also all share damage-- 
MARISHA: -- until he stands up. 
MATT: -- while they're in their range, so. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: But he's stunned. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: I'm going to-- 
MATT: You have one more attack. 
MARISHA: I have one more attack. Can I direct it back at this guy? 
MATT: Oh yeah. You can whack, whack, whack! 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
LAURA: That's awesome. 
MATT: Go for it. 
MARISHA: I want to stun this guy so bad, because then if they're both stunned, we fuck up their triangle. Okay, it was almost a natural 20, but it's not, but that's okay. This is 27 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah, that hits. 
MARISHA: Plus 13. 27. No, technically it'd be 26, because it's plus 12. 
LAURA: It still hits. 
MATT: Still hits. 
MARISHA: But it still hits. It doesn't matter. Then that's going to be another 12 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Stunning Strike! 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
MATT: All right. So because there's less of them sharing damage, they each take more of the division. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
MATT: Because that's the-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: -- war of attrition. Stunning Strike on him. That's going to be a 17. 
MARISHA: Yeah, stay down! Stay down, bitch! Let's go! 
ASHLEY: Yes! (laughter) 
LAURA: Fuck your triangle. 
MARISHA: Fuck your fucking trigonometry! 
TALIESIN: There's not enough of them to triangulate. 
MARISHA: No, there's not! 
ASHLEY: Yes, baby! 
MATT: At the moment, there isn't, no. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MARISHA: (grunts) 
SAM: There's three that are left. 
LAURA: Yeah, but they're stunned! 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Those two are stunned. 
MARISHA: These two are stunned. 
ASHLEY: This is good. This is good. 
LAURA: Those two are not a triangle. They're a line. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Meh! 
TALIESIN: They're not even a rhombus. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah, yes. 
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

TRAVIS: On this side. ♪ Da da da ♪ 
TALIESIN: Shut up, parallelogram. 
TRAVIS: 10 feet of movement. 
MATT: Yup. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to take two shots, Eldritch Blasts of the proned out. 
MATT: Okay now, prone gives him disadvantage. 
TRAVIS: Oh, got it. Okay. 
MATT: Because he's prone on the ground, and ranged attacks have disadvantage on that. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful. 
MATT: He's stunned, which would be advantage, so it's just a single roll, or you could attack the stunned guy beyond him for-- 
TRAVIS: I'll do those two, because they were great. So, a 29 for the first one. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: And the second one was 24. 
MATT: Both hit. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
TRAVIS: 10. Plus five. 
SAM: Oh great. Fjord's back. 
TRAVIS: 13. (laughter) 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. 28 points of force damage. 
MATT: 28 points of force damage, on the first hit or both? 
TRAVIS: Combined for the first two. 
MATT: Combined. Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'll take the third Eldritch Blast at him. Disadvantage, or regular, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Yep. Awesome. 24 to hit. 
MATT: Okay, hits. 
TRAVIS: And nine. 14 points of force damage for the third one. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: How's he looking? 
MATT: They're all looking pretty hurt now. 
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll send the-- (hums) That might have been more. 
SAM: We're going to have to fight our way out of here? 
LAURA: Potentially. 
TALIESIN: Could be. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to come up a little bit further. 15. 
ASHLEY: I guess we can't go back on the battlefield now. 
TALIESIN: Won't matter if we do well up here. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I guess. 
TRAVIS: Can I finish this last one here, or this fucking thing? 
TALIESIN: Break that fucking-- 
LAURA: We get to do-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not? We might as well get it started. I'll send the fourth one at the column here. 
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack. 
TRAVIS: But this is just a straight roll. 
MATT: Just a straight roll, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Natural 18 for 29. 
MATT: That hits. Roll damage. 
MARISHA: Roll high, roll high. 
TRAVIS: Five, da da da. 12 points of force damage. 
MATT: All right. Vulnerable, so it's doubled. (cracks) It cracks up the sides. It's looking pretty damaged already on just the one impact from that one blast of Eldritch Blast. 
TRAVIS: Awesome, and I'll use my Far Step to do 60 feet. (whooshes) Just in this last square. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: The other side. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Finishing Fjord's go, it's now the top of the 20. They regain a little bit of temporary hit points. All righty. With that, we're going to also move onto the next. There's going to be Drain Prowess on this. 
MARISHA: Drain Prowess? 
TRAVIS: Mm-mm. (I don't know) 
MATT: All righty. So, top, the next one to go is going to be this manipulator there, which is stunned, end of its turn, it makes it to save, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: No, he's stunned until my turn. 
MATT: Oh, until your next turn. That's right. 
LAURA: Awesome. 
MATT: So he is stunned. 
LAURA: That's right. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: He is stunned. 
MATT: Finishing his go, we now come to this gentleman over here. Who is-- 
SAM: This young gentleman. 
MATT: The fury on this with the loss of one of them, for the next round, all of their attack rolls are at advantage. 
LAURA and SAM: Oh. 
MATT: From losing a member of their brethren. 
MARISHA: Wait, what'd he say? 
SAM: He gets advantage. 
ASHLEY: They get advantage. 
LIAM: They're pissed. 
LAURA: They're pissed. 
MATT: Yeah, that one's going to see if he gets Divide Cognition back. Does not. 
ASHLEY: Divide Cognition? 
MATT: Okay, so it's going to Psychic Tempest. Okay. It's going to move 60 feet, flying up over on that side there, to right about there. And it's going to fire down its Psychic Tempest to that point there. 20-foot radius. Basically a Fireball radius. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LAURA: Oh man, that gets all of us. 
MATT: Which is going to be-- 
LIAM: Am I just outside of it? 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: It's just going to be, you, it's technically-- Actually, no, because it knows better. It's just going to get those three there since you both are immune to psychic and have noticed that you've taken little hits from that. It's going to ignore both of you. I'm going to need-- 
SAM: Is this a spell? 
MATT: This is an ability. 
TALIESIN: There are no spells. (laughter) 
LIAM: There's been no spells. 
MATT: So with that, I'm going to have, Jester, Caduceus, and Veth, all make an intelligence saving throw. 
TALIESIN: My favorite. 
SAM: Ooh, not good. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
SAM: My first not good one. 
MARISHA: Ugh. They all sighed. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: You healed. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. No. 
MATT: 43 points of psychic damage. 
TALIESIN: Very good thing I healed. 
MATT: You cannot take reactions until your next turn. 
TALIESIN: God damn it. 
LAURA: 13. 
MATT: 43 points of psychic damage. You cannot take reactions. 
SAM: 18. 
MATT: 43 points of psychic damage reduced to 21, because of your spell. Make a constitution saving throw to see if you maintain your spell. 
SAM: Oh, and I can't take reactions? 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: Can I take reactions now to evasion? 
MATT: Technically, you cannot take a re-- Huh, that's interesting, because it prevents you-- 
LIAM: All dex saves for evasion. 
MATT: No, I know. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: But it's his using his reaction to reduce the damage by half, but it is, I'll say Uncanny Dodge is you dodging before it impacts you, so I'll say yes, you can. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: So in this instance, because you're dodging before it gets you to reduce the damage, so before the damage would even affect you, you've already used your reaction, so you're fine. So, you take half that damage. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: Oh god. 
SAM: That's 21, right? 
MATT: Buddy. 
LAURA: Yeah. Buddy. 
MARISHA: Buddy. 
LAURA: So, 10 points? 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Nice. 
SAM: And then I have to make a concentration. I rolled a 18. 
MATT: You're fine. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, it's going to finish. 
MATT: That's an 18. 
LAURA: That's a 10, but it's a 9, but it's plus. 
MATT: Going to go ahead and-- 
SAM: Can't read this fucking thing. It was this one. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's a 10. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: But-- 
SAM: 10 plus-- 
LAURA: Whatever. Yeah, you succeed on that. 
SAM: Okay. 
SAM: So, what's the 18 look like? 
MATT: It's going to stay right there. 
SAM: Oh, there it is. 
MATT: Caleb, you're up. 
LIAM: Did Jester go? 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: No, sorry. Jester is next.

TALIESIN: You could use your action just to end the damn thing. 
LAURA: I can't-- 
ASHLEY: Did you use your Spiritual Weapon as a bonus action? 
LAURA: That is my bonus action. I can't attack with it again as an action. 
TALIESIN: But yeah, you can throw something at it. 
LAURA: Like what? 
TALIESIN: Doesn't need a lot. I don't know. A spell. 
LAURA: I could Guiding Bolt it, but that seems like a waste. When I could Guiding Bolt that guy, or one of those guys, because they're already stunned!

LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to step here. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I think Guiding Bolt is a really far distance, right? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: It's 120 feet, so I can hit him? 
MATT: Can you also make a constitution saving throw to see if you maintained your Blade Barrier, by the way? 
LAURA: Yeah.

LAURA: No. 
MATT: (impacts) It slams into them. (reverberating shock) All of them reverberate from the damage. That little bit of glow is almost seemed to be shared amongst them, but then it returns to the one you impacted. You see that divine spiral spinning around it. The ghostly gathered Artagan dicks that have been faintly faerie harrowing during this entire battle suddenly brighten up and stick to its body.

LAURA: Yeah, the next attack gives advantage on him and-- 
SAM: Yeah, that's great. That's huge! 
LAURA: But he already has advantage because he's stunned. 
SAM: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: So-- 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's okay. 
LAURA: It's a double advantage. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. So that finishes Jester's go. Caleb, you're up. 
MATT: So Caleb is going to knock back-- I have a healing potion in my inventory, so I'm going to take it. That is nine points, and as he's wiping his mouth-- 
LAURA: Wait, that's only 10. 
LIAM: -- he looks over at the, Jester hit the one that is standing? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Caleb drags a lodestone up his arm and fires a Ray of Disintegration-- 
LAURA: Yeah he does. 
LIAM: -- at the other one. It is stunned, it fails dex saves. 
MARISHA: (claps) That's right! 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: That's right, baby! 
MATT: Automatically. 
TALIESIN: Holy shit. 
TRAVIS: Did you just headshot somebody? 
TALIESIN: I mean. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: (quick, darting shot) 
MARISHA: (headshot blast) 
LIAM: (counting quietly) 
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh, this is-- 
TALIESIN: Headshot him with a cannonball. 
MARISHA: Matt has feelings. 
LIAM: 71 points of force damage. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Caleb Widogast, how do you want to do this to the Weave Mind? (shouted cheering) 
LAURA: They had less than 70 between all of them? 
TRAVIS: ♪ (vocalizes operatically) ♪ 
SAM: ♪ (vocalizes operatically) ♪ 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
SAM: ♪ This journey of life ♪ 
SAM and TRAVIS: ♪ I've found ♪ 
MATT: As they're all, the ones that were currently still trying to push through the physical binds of having their spiritual energy tangled by Beauregard's blows earlier, their minds are trying to push into the core of what makes you yourselves, to unravel the very center of the mystery of your humanity. And their vengeful hatred itself burns so strongly in your minds that you see, even though you've only really known them for a moment, the lengths of their tyranny, the unstoppable boundaries to their self-obsession, and their need to persist and conquer forever, and knowing that you are just stepping stones to that end, once they took Exandria for themselves. You narrow your spell. 
LIAM: Caleb takes that swig of the potion, looks around at the Mighty Nein and at these Weave Mind who are glowing and frozen on the ground, and looks at his friends and sees their good work. Says: Set 'em up und knock 'em down. The ray burns along the ground, up the center of the prone Weave Mind and the disintegration starts from the center out, and the remaining Weave Mind all mirror that, evaporating from their center up to their head and their feet. 
MATT: The tether that binds their vitality ends up binding them to their doom, as the crystals that still maintain a nexus of psychic power carries that bead of magical destruction that you housed into the spirit of one now spread to four as they all desperately try and gather again to the center, almost like they're reverting to the days of their childhood. In the moments they see the end of all that they wish to take fall from their grasp, you truly see how sad and withered these creatures are before they all (collapsing) fall into piles of crumbled stone and dust, their armor, their robes (impacts) scattering from 20, 30 feet up in the air, (clangs) echoing through the halls. That vibration, that static, that pressure that has grown stronger and stronger since you've been here is now still. 
LAURA: (clanging) 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: The wall of blades. (laughter) 
LAURA: I was like-- 
MATT: Someone still keeps the Cuisinart button on in the distance. 
LAURA: I just like: Stop, stop, stop. 
TRAVIS: (grinding) 
LAURA: I make it go away. 
MARISHA: I got this Margaritaville for half off on Labor Day. 
MATT: It is here in the stillness the tyranny of the Weave Mind comes to an end, and you, the Mighty Nein, are successful in what you were set to do, and you hope, in your heart of hearts, it was enough to help Bells Hells complete the hardest of tasks ahead of them. And that's where we're going to end tonight's episode. 
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (groan) 
TRAVIS: Also, there's nobody running a check on Predathos. 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: We lost Beau in the fight, but it was worth it! 
LAURA: Poor Beau! 
MARISHA: I've been talking to you out loud. 
ASHLEY: She's been here the whole time. 
SAM: It's like she's still with us! (laughter) 
MARISHA: I can hear her smart-ass. 
SAM: I can hear her! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You come out and put your glasses on. Oh, wow, what? 
TRAVIS: That map was outstanding. 
LAURA: That was sick. 
ASHLEY: That was so cool. 
TALIESIN: Outstanding. 
MARISHA: You can see them glowing. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can see them glowing. 
LIAM: Kind of mopped the floor with us for a little while. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: It was going very poorly. To be fair, it was one of those things. One of them was like, "Am I going to risk getting out of range of the crystals to maximize the triangle?" And they did. I don't think he expected you to hit them while they were just out of range that hard, which worked to their disadvantage, but nevertheless, we'll pick this up next week with Bells Hells-- 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: -- and the descent to the core of Ruidus. 
LIAM: Wow. 
MATT: The Hallowed Cage and the God Eater itself, where down there, Ludinus works to carve his path and currently seeks to siphon the essence of the Exaltant Liliana Temult We'll see where that goes. Thank you for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)

Cooldown[]
TRAVIS: Holy balls.
ASHLEY: That was so fun.
TRAVIS: We misplayed a lot of stuff at the beginning.
LAURA: Yeah, we misplayed a lot.
LIAM: Yes, yes.
SAM: We're not used to playing these characters.
TRAVIS: I didn't realize that the crystals were super-susceptible to force damage, so when you did your Divine Intervention... I could have thrown off four and been like (explosions).
SAM: Oh yeah.
TALIESIN: I was really hoping everyone was going to pick, because I did that like: This is the round to knock them all out.
MATT: That's how it goes, though.
TALIESIN: They were absorbing so much.
MARISHA: I mean, I don't think we knew--
TRAVIS: I didn't pick up on it at all.
LIAM: Fog of war.
MARISHA: Because she just said that slashing it was resistant to. So we were all like, "Well then, don't do slashing."
TRAVIS: Yeah, I heard attack and I was like, "Oh, it's just melee, you have to be up on it." Which makes sense, right?
MARISHA: Yeah. We just didn't know until... until we knew.
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: So wait, if we had taken out the crystals, would they have still been connected?
MATT: If you would have taken out the crystals-- With each crystal you broke, it reduced their regeneration of the temporary hit points. Every initiative count of 20, they all regenerated a series of--
LIAM: A new buffer every round?  
MATT: Yeah, they would regenerate temporary hit points, and then with each crystal that was destroyed, that would reduce by a certain amount, like four each time. Then once all the crystals on the battlefield were destroyed, that is gone, their tether between them is gone, so they no longer share damage, and they also lose the bonuses they get to all their saving throws. They all have a massive-- they get to add their intelligence modifier to all their saving throws while they're connected to the crystals.
LIAM: I learned that the hard way.
MATT: So when the crystals are destroyed-- So it's like you could go the tactic of just focusing on the crystals and then they become significantly weaker, but in the interim they are just unloading on you and you're not really doing anything to stop them. Or, you can just brute force it, and it'll take a while. It's one of those things where you'll probably kill them all at once.
LAURA: Which is what--
TALIESIN: Which is great.
MATT: But the hard thing is you're going to be fighting five things the entire time. So what you guys did was a mix of the two and it ended up working pretty well. That one fucked up its tactics, but it also got greedy, and it wanted to-- It was like all of you were right there in the middle. It was like: If we can take them all down, if we can do this shit-- I didn't know what your hit point total-- they didn't know what your hit point values were. That was pretty-- I'm pretty happy with that.
LAURA: If they had been even slightly lower, it would have taken out multiple people in that one.
MATT: That's kind of what they were hoping for. That's what I was hoping for.
LIAM: Caleb and his mirrors need to work on their choreography.
SAM: They didn't do anything!
LIAM: Not one time.
LAURA: Yeah, those mirrors did nothing.
MATT: Bro, I was like, "Come on!"
LIAM: I think I rolled a one, a two, and a four on those rolls. I was like, "I'm going to be fine."
ASHLEY: You were saying that there was something you were going to do with the arch.
SAM: Oh yeah. What was the arch?
TALIESIN: These three in a row have a vibe.
LAURA: I know, what was that going to be?
MATT: So that right there was a direct portal that they were essentially sending soldiers through to the battlefield.
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus fucking--
LAURA: So we could have gone straight down?
TRAVIS: Reilorans would have been coming back up.
MATT: They could have been coming back up if they called them back in, but also if you were lined up, which one of them wanted to do, it would try and force you through it, and then would have punched you back into Exandria above the battlefield and you would have had to try to find your way back to join the fight. It's essentially like a portal rail gun. You know those big trash can things you pull back and it does the air push? This whole setup here would rail gun you into the portal.
LAURA: But if we'd left it up and we killed them, we would have easy access to get back to the battle where Vox Machina is.
MATT: Correct.
SAM: We could just rebuild it. We can rebuild it. So we can go home.
TRAVIS: We could rebuild it.
MATT: Now mind you--
LAURA: But wait, that's a whole other Bloody Bridge. That was another opening, though. That was another gate to Exandria.
MATT: Yeah, but they only had access to it with the Bloody Bridge.
LAURA: Oh, and we-- we're ahead of Vox Machina still.
MATT: Correct. Or this is all happening around the same time.
LAURA: Same time.
ASHLEY: So that could have gone down at some point.
MATT: Yeah. In fact, there was a possibility, depending on the timing of this, if some of you had been punched through that portal--
LIAM: And the Bloody Bridge got taken out.
MATT: And the Bloody Bridge had gotten taken down, then your group would have been severed.
ASHLEY: What would have happened?
LAURA: We just would have been one down.
TALIESIN: Or we would be floating in space, dead.
MATT: The only way it could have worked-- and in my head, I was like, "If you had enough spell slots, depending on who was there--
LAURA: Plane Shift back.
MATT: --hopefully Caleb, to Plane Shift, or not even Plane Shift. Like Teleport to the portal, cross it, and then Teleport back in two rounds.
LIAM: Caleb did not prep to go back. He came to finish, so I have no Teleport left.
MATT: That would have been rough.
LAURA: I have the ability to Plane Shift us to get home.
TALIESIN: I'm nothing but healing.
MARISHA: You have the spell slot?
LAURA: I still have the spell slot for that. I kept the 7th-level up.
SAM: But we have a whole bunch of allies here, still on the moon, right?
LAURA: Yeah, but Bells Hells--
TALIESIN: I can heal us all pretty quick and we can be back in.
TRAVIS: Mighty Nein. We're seven.
LAURA: I mean, you good? You can Mass Heal all of us?
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Now that that--
LAURA: You still have that.
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I've still got some stuff to do.
LAURA: I don't have hardly any spells left, but--
SAM: Oh, yeah, because they were also eating spell slots.
ASHLEY: So next game will be Bells Hells? Are we going to finish up talking here or we're done with Mighty Nein?
MATT: For this moment, unless you guys have more you want to speak on right after this battle--
ASHLEY: Should we just keep playing for like 45 minutes and just like--
TRAVIS: Ashley Johnson!
ASHLEY: --and talk to each other?
TRAVIS: Ashley.
LAURA: We love each other.
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's just like can... okay.
MATT: There will be many opportunities for the Mighty Nein to continue to talk, interact and stuff, depending on the nature of what goes on with Bells Hells in the coming--
LAURA: Goodness. That's true, if Bells Hells fails, then Mighty Nein will just Plane Shift out. Hopefully.
ASHLEY: Yeah, because we don't know what the end-- Oh my god.
TALIESIN: (to Laura) Good Divine Interventions, by the way. I'm proud of you.
MATT: Yeah, I'm not going to say anything.
TRAVIS: Wait, what?
MARISHA: I was just going to say, I know, I saw that.
TRAVIS: What were you going to say? Your face. What'd you say? Spit it out. (Matt shrugs innocently.)
LAURA: What was he going to say, what was he going to say?
MARISHA: He was like, "Well..."
ASHLEY: You were going to say something?
MARISHA: You were like, "Oh, well, if Bells Hells fails, we'll just peace out."
LAURA: Go on a road trip, yeah.
MARISHA: And he was like, "Well, hmmm. I'm not going to say anything."
TALIESIN: We could become them. We become the--
LIAM: We'll get hoovered up immediately?
MATT: If Bells Hells fails, depending on where that failure goes, it doesn't mean other heroes can't try and follow up--
ASHLEY: Jump in.
MATT: In their space. However, if Bells Hells fails, whatever everyone else faces will likely be even more terrifying. So it's like--
TRAVIS: Let's throw the game! Sorry.
TALIESIN: Let's become the Vox Machina of the moon.
LAURA: Oh, fuck.
TALIESIN: Let's just stay up here and become the law.
TRAVIS: We destroyed the bridge.
MATT: That's viable. That's a tactic.
LIAM: (as Caleb) I can throw the tower up anywhere.
LAURA: Ooh! Stay here forever.
TRAVIS: Caleb can make a new latticework. Lock this one up.
LAURA: We can Plane Shift, Plane Shift, get Essek, Plane Shift, Plane Shift back.
ASHLEY: I mean, Veth is the only one with a kid.
SAM: We could just trade places. (as Veth) I mean, he's a teenager.
TALIESIN: He needs a break anyway.
LIAM: We know about that waterfall. 
TRAVIS: "He's a teenager."
LAURA: We know about the waterfall. That's right.
MARISHA: What's our final tally?
SAM: Oh, our final tally? Beau owes me-- Beau owes Veth 1100 gold. And Veth owes Beau 950 gold. 
TRAVIS: So, 200.
MARISHA: (as Beau) I owe you 150 gold. How about this? Luc can come and stay with us for the summer.
ASHLEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa--
TALIESIN: That's way more than 150.
MARISHA: Babe. Babe.
TRAVIS: The summer?
ASHLEY: The entire summer? No, no, no.
TRAVIS: The summer?
ASHLEY: Like a week, maybe two.
MARISHA: Like a week.
TRAVIS: Exandrian summer?
LIAM: Switch to platinum.
ASHLEY: He's an asshole right now.
MATT: It's true.
MARISHA: Don't want to deal with his raging hormones.
SAM: This is good practice for you two.
TALIESIN: I can take a week. I'll take a week.
MARISHA: I was going to say it'll be like fostering a kid for three months.
TALIESIN: I'll put him on Calliope.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I guess it's a good trial run.
MARISHA: We can see how we do as moms.
ASHLEY: Yeah, see how we do.
TALIESIN: Anything to keep you from having kids.
LIAM: We'll take him to Burning Man in Bassuras.
SAM: What was Horrid Puppet?
TALIESIN: Yeah, what was Horrid Puppet?
MATT: Oh, man, I know, it didn't get a chance to go off. So Horrid Puppet, if they fail their Wisdom saving throw, then their target would-- they could immediately force them to move their speed in whatever direction they wanted them to and make them take an attack action or a cantrip against the target of their choice in range. So I could force Beau to move 70 feet--
LIAM: Punch somebody.
MATT: And then punch somebody twice. Or force Fjord to move somewhere and then shoot four Eldritch Blasts at somebody. I was going to try to do it to you, but you vanished underneath the bridge. I was like, realistically, in this chaos, it wouldn't know where you are. You just disappeared and it doesn't-- in this chaos it wouldn't even be able to find out where you are. So I was like, "Nah, that's not going to happen. Because you would have been the one to do it to, because, one, not great wisdom, comparatively. And you're just a distant cannon. And I was like: "(groans) I can't."
TRAVIS: Just popping off.
MATT: So good on you for doing that. That was awesome.
LAURA: You were just a little sneaky (arcane firing noises) the whole fight.
MARISHA: That was sick.
TALIESIN: And really took out a bunch of the power. You were nasty to the power crystals. That was great.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was nasty on that rock.
ASHLEY: Was that crystal in the chains any different than the other ones? Did they have different...?
TRAVIS: Like the circle one?
SAM: What about the manhole? Yeah, does that go somewhere?
MATT: (non-committal "dunno" sound)
TRAVIS: Matthew Mercer, this is the time!
TALIESIN: Mighty Nein's going to open it anyway. We're in there, we're going to crack it open and look to see if it's chocolate.
ASHLEY: Well, we don't know, maybe there's...
LAURA: I know, you said warm air came out of it before Travis was like, "Never mind. I didn't do it."
ASHLEY: Oh, really?
LAURA: Yeah, he said warm air came out of the hole.
ASHLEY: It could go straight to Predathos.
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.
SAM: It could, yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: It's a little Mario chute, right?
LAURA: Yeah, he said it was something major and then you like, "Never mind, I didn't go with that."
MATT: These entities, the Weave Mind, specialized in the manipulation and alteration of the genetics of creatures and beings that it wanted to utilize to improve their power and influence. There are many other things within the Arx Creonum that they are developing, that they are cultivating. So that warm breath you felt coming up from below was a breath of something below.
MARISHA: Yeah, you did good. You chose good.
LIAM: It's a space dragon!
TRAVIS: Yeah, if I had jumped down there, I'd be fucking Luke down there with the fucking--
LIAM: With the Rancor.
TRAVIS: With the Rancor.
MATT: So the one that's up there was just the one that had the most hit points in comparison to some of the others. I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
TRAVIS: Yeah, it took--
MATT: They weren't situationally different. It's just that they had a bunch up in that area. So to break off the tether on this side, you had to destroy a bunch in a clustered space.
TRAVIS: That makes sense.
MATT: And if you're up in this area, then any of the effects of its lair actions that affect things that are nearby, you can't escape them on that side of the map.
SAM: Can you tell us, earlier, what happened in the map? Didn't someone say that they dropped it or something?
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, like a map fell?
MATT: No. So for this size of map I have to build it off-stage because the doorways in our studio aren't quite wide enough to get it through normally, and in the chaos of arriving and prepping and doing all the final stuff today, I accidentally built this map in my map room.
SAM: And so you couldn't physically get it into this room?
MATT: And went to go: "Uh oh." So I had Parker, who's so sweet, come over and help me try and get out of there. I'm like, "Okay, well, it has some grip to it. If I can get the right angle and take off all the things that'll tumble--"
LIAM: Try to get the diagonal a little?
MATT: I took a picture of it and I moved all the things that could fall over off of it and we're like, "Okay." And we just got it, and right as we started we were trying to move it through it, and we did that one slight little incline too far and a bunch of it went (sliding).
SAM: Oh no!
MATT: We caught some of it but a lot of it spilled off, and we were like: "Okay, I'll just rebuild it on the set." Which I did. It worked out fine.
LAURA: You're lucky you took a picture of it, because that would have been a bitch if you--
MATT: I take a picture of every map before I move it.
LAURA: That's so smart.
MATT: Just in case.
TALIESIN: I felt so cruel, because it's our job if it's coming through, we're like: We have to pretend nothing's going on.
LAURA: I know. Not to--
MATT: We shout, "Everyone, heads down, map coming through!"
ASHLEY: That's so hard.
MATT: I know, I know.
MARISHA: Blair Witch in the kitchen.
LIAM: I have wanted to replace the stargate with one of the doughnuts all night.
MATT: Do you want to do the honors?
ASHLEY: It's a good idea.
LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Which one are you going to?
TALIESIN: Choose your weapon.
SAM: It's got to be the sprinkles. Well, you might have to take a bite out of it.
LIAM: Nah, it'll smoosh.
(cheers, applause)
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast! (the donut falls over)
MARISHA: Okay, I got it.
MATT: All right, get that shit out of here. All right, guys.
TRAVIS: Good game, Mattie.
MATT: Love y'all. See you next time.
MARISHA: Bye, y'all.
