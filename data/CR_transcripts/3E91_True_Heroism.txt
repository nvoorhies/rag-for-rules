MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. (warbling) (laughter) 
MATT: Our sponsor for tonight is Ravensburger and their new game, "That's Not A Hat." And back to tell us all about it is, indeed, a cat. Cat? Cat? Kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on! (claps) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Kitty, kitty, kitty! 
SAM: (deeply) What? 
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. 
MATT: The ad copy, I need you to read it. For Ravensburger. 
SAM: No. 
MATT: But you-- you have to. 
SAM: I don't have to do anything. I'm a cat. 
MATT: What if I, uh-- What if I give you a treat? 
SAM: Oh! Oh, a treat? Oh! Oh! A treat? Bribery? What do you think I am, a dog? There's nothing I hate more than being condescended to. I'm a cat. 
MATT: Well, then I guess we could have the mouse read the ad. Hey, Mouse, what do you say? 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: Here, I got you a treat. 
TALIESIN: (high-pitched) Oh! (yelling) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Holy shit! 
TALIESIN: I love treats! 
TRAVIS: That's a free nat 20! 
TALIESIN: I'm a mouse and I love treats! And reading ads! I also love "That's Not A Hat," a party game that challenges you to memorize two simple things or lie tryin'. You reveal the cards once, then spend the rest of the game trying to remember which card is which, and bluffing about the ones you don't know. 
TRAVIS: Billboard, you should've called billboard. 
SAM: What the hell is this?! 
TALIESIN: Hee hee! You can learn to play in minutes! Making it a great game for the whole family! Each hilarious game of "That's Not A Hat" takes about 10 to 15 minutes. So you want to play again and again! 
SAM: (hisses) Are you really a mouse? 
TALIESIN: I might be! Or, like the game, I might be bluffing! Heh, heh, heh! 
SAM: I've found-- (laughter) 
SAM: I think I found something I hate worse than being condescended to. 
TALIESIN: "That's Not A Hat," from Ravensburger, which you can find at your local Target-- 
SAM: Or Target.com. 
TALIESIN: I'm a mouse! 
SAM: And I'm a cat. Matt, meow to you. 
TALIESIN: Mee-ouse to you. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Mee-ouse to you! 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. (laughter) 
MATT: I kind of love this new iteration of the dynamic. 
MARISHA: (laughing) Amazing! 
LIAM: You got to wear that suit all night. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Let that billboard off the forehead be played, the backboard moment of the night. 
ASHLEY: How did you catch that? 
MATT: I can't believe that shit. 
TRAVIS: Incredible. 
TALIESIN: I'm slowly suffocating in here! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Okay! 
ASHLEY: You're "Donnie Darko" mouse. The eyebrows. 
TALIESIN: What are you doing in that stupid human suit? (laughter) 
MATT: Marisha, you're up. Go! 
MARISHA: Oh no, I've got to follow that! In case you missed it, the VOD for our latest episode of 4-Sided Dive is available right now on Twitch and YouTube. (cheering) 
MARISHA: Yeah, it was witches night, and also Liam was there. (laughter) 
MARISHA: We discuss everything up to campaign three, up to episode 90 and play three different Ravensburger party games, including the aforementioned "That's Not A Hat," Piñata Blast, and Strike! Go check it out now. 
SAM: Isn't "That's Not A Hat" hard? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, they were really hard. 
LAURA: It's so fun. 
MARISHA: It is hard. 
SAM: Yeah, but fun. 
ASHLEY: "That's Not A Hat" was hard. 
MARISHA: We failed in like two rounds. 
LAURA: Liam failed. We all succeeded. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
MARISHA: Yes, well actually, I failed, but Liam took the brunt of the consequences. So. 
LAURA: Sorry, we should avoid spoilers. 
MATT: Spoilers. 
MARISHA: Spoilers, sorry. 
ASHLEY: Oh, well, whatever. 
MARISHA: Just go and you'll-- Watch, it's fine. It's a party game. Go get drunk and play it, I don't care. Also, a-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: A friendly reminder that if you ever feel behind on Critical Role, our Lorekeeper Dani Carr has you covered with written weekly recaps. 
MATT: Woo! 
SAM: Hard to say. 
MARISHA: On CritRole.com. Plus, there's now short little video recaps over on our Instagram and TikTok to get you all caught up. They're very fun. They've got graphics. Dani is super charming, it's great. Go watch them. Go follow us on TikTok because we're young! 
MATT: Show Dani some love. Liam, you're up next. 
LIAM: Dude, I have some comic book news. 
TRAVIS: Dude. 
LIAM: The Midst cosmos are arriving at-- 
SAM: Wait, what! 
MARISHA: A comic shop near you thanks to Third Person and our pals at Dark Horse Comics. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
LIAM: Yes, Midst, address unknown. 
MARISHA: You knew about this. 
SAM: I didn't know it was happening now. It's so fast! 
LIAM: Right now! 
SAM: It's so exciting! 
LIAM: It's the first in a series of three standalone, oversized comic issues. This one introduces totally new characters as well as a new story detailing the events after a ramshackle postal ship, we have a problem with the post here, crashes unto a mysterious new is-let, Midst. 
LAURA: Is-let? 
MATT: Eye-let? 
LIAM: It features writing by Colin Lorimer. I don't know. With internal art by Alejandro Aragon. Colors by Chris O'Halloran. Letters by Jim Campbell and cover art by old friend of the show, William Kirkby. 
MATT: William Kirkby! 
LIAM: We are so excited to take the cosmos of Midst to the world of comics. I love comics. It's expected to release in August and you can preorder now. Purorder. You can purrorder now. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Purr! 
LIAM: At your friendly lurcal, kermit shirp. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Is-let.

It's been wonderful seeing what you've all been creating, what you've been enjoying, what kind of things you're excited to see maybe shift and change. We are taking it all in.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off: Bells Hells here slowly crawling towards the center of the chaos here on Ruidus. You found the subterranean core of the Kreviris Imperium. Here in Vaterra Kreviris, this massive underground cavern. The space where the singular glass pillar, this massive central piece of strange Ruidian glass that marks the center of their culture here surrounded by this evocative and interwoven city. You've made friends with the Volition, the rebellious group that's been fighting against the Imperium and decided to embark on two of their multitude of simultaneous missions to both prove yourself an ally and to help the cause. You decided to be part of a bombing mission, which this side of the table helped out with alongside your good friend, Ira Wendagoth, the Nightmare King. While this side went to go and retrieve a very important ally and figure with information about what's going on between the Imperium, the Weave Mind, and the Ruby Vanguard. During these separate missions, it seemed the bombing mission was a success, through illusion and conversation. Though, the setting suggested to have been set at a much quicker time than was anticipated. Ira Wendagoth, not one to think about other people, their safety, other than his. Mostly managed to escape, though a little bit of wear and tear as the detonation caught up with you and blew two of you out the exit like a cannon. As the explosion rocked the interior of this cavern, shaking the space within. This team here had infiltrated an engineering bay within an area south of the Arx Creonum. Here, you found a number of creatures that were being experimented on, and being mutated and changed. Your target was indeed inside one of these liquid filled chambers. You essentially ambushed and managed to rapidly slaughter some of the dangerous guardians of this Engineering Bay laboratory. After battling with one of these partially incomplete, terrifying creatures that was released in the middle of the scuffle, you managed to break the glass and abscond with the half-conscious target of your interest here, Evoroa, a female Bormodo who has been working with the opposing side while also feeding information, bits and pieces, to the Volition. With her under your arm, Imogen cast Invisibility across that troop and you managed to just barely escape the now incredibly dangerous, intense, and Imperium filled interior of this structure. As you are now scattered into various places, here within the main city, trying to reconvene, you hear the chaos of shouts and screeches as the armed forces of the Imperium are beginning to gather in response to this massive explosion that rocked the interior of the subterranean community. You also hear the screech of Gloamglut as your supposed father, the Sorrowlord Zathuda who was also within the cavern when it detonated, by the way. His mount is seeking above and you all notice across the way, another explosion outside of the aforementioned music hall where your mother was to be assassinated. You see that streak of power go firing up into the air and then hear a voice scream into the minds of the two Ruidusborn present. "Did she know?" As we come back into this chaos, right now, in the midst of this response, seeing this, into the dark expanse, just barely lit, glow of the inside of this cavern, what are you four doing? 
LIAM: Okay, so we're invisible. We're at the base of the giant underground cavern with the big crystal rod up the center of it. 
MARISHA: We've got to get back to the headquarters. 
LIAM: Get out. 
MARISHA: To the safe house. 
LAURA: Who was, did I recognize the voice? 
MATT: (sighs) 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Yes, you did. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It was Liliana. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You now see that glowing purple light, now. (whooshing) It is pinging around the cavern rapidly. 
TRAVIS: So pissed, so pissed. 
MATT: Seeking. 
MARISHA: Is she looking for you? 
TRAVIS: Oh, super saiyan pissed. 
LAURA: We need to get to safety. 
MARISHA: We've got to go. 
LIAM: Yeah, let's get out of this open square. Can we retrace our steps to how we came down to the wider area outside of the--? 
MATT: In the midst of chaos, who wants to try and guide that path? 
TRAVIS: I can see y'all because I've got the monocle, but you guys can't see me. 
LAURA: But we can follow your directions. 
MARISHA: So maybe it should be you. 
LAURA: And who got us here? 
MARISHA: Because we can still (clicks tongue). 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we're mentally. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can put a hand on Orym and you can drive the-- 
LIAM: Do we see where we came from originally before we infiltrated? 
MATT: You see the general direction. You don't know this area well, and previously, when you were coming here, you had the pillar as your beacon to guide you to the structures. But then turning around and now having to ford the city, you've only walked through once carefully, it's a little vertigo inducing to see the strange Escher-like twisting mass of the city streets and pathways and buildings and have to try and find your way back to pinpoint where you entered the city. 
MARISHA: I'm going to tell Pâté to go invisible before he leaves my person. Then I'm going to fly him out 30, 40, 50 feet in front of me so he can be a scout ahead of us. 
MATT: "Don't worry, I'm part of the team!" 
LAURA: Shush, shush! Shut up. 
MARISHA: Shush, shush! 
MATT: "Sorry!" (laughter) 
MATT: Orym, what were you going to say? 
LIAM: I was going to say. 
TRAVIS: Very Jester. 
LIAM: Wolf, you hunt the way out. I'll keep my head on a swivel. So I'm making sure that we're not getting dive bombed by Gloamglut or Liliana. 
MATT: You got it. Okay, so you're helming this one. I need you to make a survival check to follow the path through the city. This is partially survival representing your memory of that experience and also trying to read the land from the opposite direction. 
TRAVIS: Okay. It says advantage, but I don't think that's in regards-- 
MATT: In this instance, no. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. 
LAURA: Did we already check on the other team to make sure that were alive? I can't remember. 
LIAM: I thought there was cross-chatter. 
MARISHA: I think I reached out to be like, are you all alive? 
TRAVIS: 14. 
MARISHA: I think that's all I got, though. 
MATT: 14, okay. 
SAM: We are not. 
MATT: You feel you've at least located a general direction where you traveled from and begin to guide the troop around you. Best you can, with you all being invisible, and the only person who can see them is you. You're having to play ranger on this one. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Hold onto my tail. 
MATT: A scout leader, keeping everyone together. 
TRAVIS: Tighter. (chuckling) 
LIAM: Are we charm bracelet? Yeah, charm bracelet. 
TRAVIS: Two hands. 
LIAM: With I guess, Evoroa between you and me in the middle? 
LAURA: Evoroa's between us. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. 
LIAM: Oh, that's just the tail. 
MATT: All right, now Evoroa is-- 
LAURA: Limping. 
MATT: -- limping, and is going to slow your progression to keep her with you. 
LAURA: Boot her to the curb! Let's keep going. 
MATT: (laughs) That's an option. 
TRAVIS: Terrible. 
MATT: But you know, you do catch her as she's having to lean on you on her thick, older Bormodo arms draped over two of your shoulders and dragging and limping with one foot. Like, "Where-- Where are we going?" 
LAURA: As we go, I'm going to take one of my healing potions out and pour it down her throat. Or give it to her. 
MATT: She's like, "Where are we-- (gagging)" 
LAURA: Take, take, take this. 
MATT: All right, so that puts her at-- 
LIAM: That's a-- 
LAURA: Why would you roll like that? 
LIAM: Because you aim down and then the dice go down and then the randomness of the universe. 
TRAVIS: But the numbahs, the numbahs. 
LAURA: Yeah, the numbahs ah. 
MATT: What's the numbahs? 
LIAM: It's four plus two, six. 
MATT: Six, plus one per die. Wouldn't it be four plus one? 
LIAM: No, it's four plus one per die. 
MATT: Oh, I see, I see. Gotcha, gotcha, I see. All right, so six healing. She picks up a little bit and tries to, you know, is now a little more recovered. A little less winded, and helps to keep your speed. Still, all of you traveling a bit slow because you're holding onto each other's hands and having to carefully follow where you're trying to pinpoint. But you are now just breaking past the outer edge-- 
LIAM: (fart sound) 
MATT: -- of where the-- 
LAURA: (offended scoff) 
MATT: -- main residential and industry region that rings the central pillar begins. You've now begun to reenter the extremely dense portion of Kreviris' base circle. 
LAURA: Is it just chaos right now? 
MATT: Right now, as you glance around immediately, it is starting to turn into a bit of intensity. People are rushing out of their houses and checking. People are screaming and telling them to run for help. People are shouting, "We're under attack!" People are like, "Get your weapons ready." They're like, "Oh god, what's happening?" It is a populace that is panicking because now there have been two massive explosions that rocked the interior. You get the sense that they're not used to attacks on the home outside of probably what the Volition has done as of late. So these explosions incite a sense of panic in the populace. But it's also the soldiers of the Imperium are rushing past. They're looking around. They're glancing and you can see they're shouting to people, like the members who are not psychically inclined, while others are looking around and glancing and making eye lines to other soldiers, you can see a couple of winged beasts fly down with Reiloran soldiers on their back. They're communicating from above as well. There is a network of soldiers all looking about for anybody that seems out of sorts here. So, it's getting progressively more intense. 
MARISHA: I remind Pâté: You tell me if we're about to walk into trouble. 
MATT: "I mean, we're walking into it now, I guess. It's real crazy here." 
TRAVIS: Do we see anyone being grabbed, apprehended, anything that looks like people trying to get a sense of general fuckery? 
SAM: General fuckery. 
TRAVIS: I know people are running around, but do you see, are Imperium members grabbing anyone? Do we see anybody being held onto or detained? 
MATT: You don't see anyone being detained, but you see people who are being pulled to the side and interrogated quietly. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, okay. 
MATT: There's that intensity, pulling someone forward, looking in their eyes, then throwing them aside for a second. 
TRAVIS: Got it. Oh shit. 
MATT: You do see there are Mystics beginning to emerge from the Arx Creonum. You can see figures that are gliding out of the edges, almost like bees being-- 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: -- unleashed from the side of a beehive. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
MATT: They're starting to spread around. 
TRAVIS: Fucking killer hornets coming out. Not good, not good, not good, not good! 
MARISHA: How many Mystics? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Dozens? Hundreds? 
MATT: You see about a half dozen right now-- 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: -- beginning to glide out. 
SAM: A murder of Mystics? 
MATT: A murder of Mystics, if you will. 
LIAM: I think we're going to the other side. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Shifting over to this team. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
SAM: We were separated from each other, right? 
MATT: You were separated, but you had just managed to reconvene. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Fearne managed to find you all after stumbling off the Wall of Force that was left behind in her protective nature, and you're all gathered together in the midst of this chaos on the opposite side of the explosion where you saw the beam of energy go skyrocketing into the dark atmosphere. 
SAM: Where's Ira? 
ASHLEY: I don't know, he just took off. 
SAM: How are you doing on health? 
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I'm okay. 
SAM: How about you? 
TALIESIN: I'm fine. Let's get out of here. We've got to go home. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: You look like you're looking rough. 
TALIESIN: I'll be fine. I'm going to be fine. This one's more fucked up than I am. 
SAM: I'm not doing great. 
ASHLEY: Are you not doing too great either? 
SAM: I'll pump a quick little Cure-- 
ASHLEY: Can you drink something? Do I need to do anything? 
SAM: I'm going to put a little 2nd-level Cure Wounds into myself. 
ASHLEY: All right, good idea. 
LIAM: (mechanical whirring) 
SAM: Okay, terrible. Six plus four. Okay. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Why did you roll like that? 
SAM: Because I'm bad at-- (laughter) 
SAM: Okay. We got to get out of here! So wait, where's the way out? (laughter) 
MATT: Where is it? 
SAM: (stressed groan) Did we see the way that we came from? 
TRAVIS: You got shot out of a cannon. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to get my bearings on where the-- 
TRAVIS: (cannon shots popping) 
TALIESIN: -- living fuck we are. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I don't know if I can-- 
MATT: You know the general direction of where you came from, but to a similar point, you don't know the city other than the one trek you made, and even then, Ira was leading the way. So for this, it's going to be a recollection of memory in the space around you. So if one of you wants to lead this with a survival-- 
ASHLEY: What stinker. 
MATT: -- roll for me. 
ASHLEY: What a stinker. He keeps leaving when we need him. Is Gloamglut anywhere? Can we see him? 
MATT: Roll a perception check. 
SAM: Ooh, ooh, ooh. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LIAM: Ira's such a yuckster. 
ASHLEY: Oh, what a dingleberry. 
TALIESIN: This, I expected. 
SAM: What a scamp. 
TRAVIS: Maybe he's like a childhood dog, and he'll just whisk you away. Gloamglut will be like your new bestie. 
TALIESIN: He's a cat. 
ASHLEY: Let's see! 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (like Cat-Sam) He's a cat. 
ASHLEY: That's not cocked. 
TALIESIN: I think that's fine. Well, now you just rolled it by moving the-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I don't know what it was, I'm so sorry. 
TALIESIN: That's still cocked. 
ASHLEY: I'm not going to roll that die! 
TRAVIS: What the-- 
ASHLEY: It's that one. 
LAURA: It's this dice that goes-- (waggles tongue) 
ASHLEY: It's just the way that it's made. 
TALIESIN: There you go. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Perception check. 
TRAVIS: Want to frustrate your table? 
LAURA: It really is the worst die. 
TRAVIS: Buy this dice! 
MATT: It is the worst dice. 
ASHLEY: It really is. It rolls well-- 
MATT: When it rolls. 
ASHLEY: -- 50% of the time. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: When it rolls! 
TRAVIS: The justification falls flat. 
TALIESIN: It rolls well 50% of the time, of the 20% of the time it lands. 
ASHLEY: You have to justify your pieces sometimes. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. 
ASHLEY: Okay, 23. 
MATT: 23. Indeed, you do see Gloamglut streaking above the exit of the now collapsed mine excavation that was digging down below. 
ASHLEY: Does he look alone? 
MATT: With a 23, no. 
ASHLEY: Someone's riding him? 
MATT: There is an armored figure riding Gloamglut at the period, and is doing a full sweep around. 
SAM: Papa! 
MATT: Around this time-- 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: -- the central pillar in the middle of Kreviris, you can see these Mystics that have emerged around it. As they form some sort of an even distance-- 
TRAVIS: They're making a perimeter. 
MATT: -- around the outside of it, they all turn to focus on it. You see that central pillar begin to glow-- 
LIAM: No. 
MATT: -- slightly brighter. 
LAURA: Wait. 
SAM: It's just glowing. 
MATT: And slightly brighter. 
TALIESIN: I don't like that. 
SAM: It's just glowing. 
TRAVIS: What do you mean? 
MATT: And slightly brighter. 
ASHLEY: Why is it doing that? Why is it doing that? 
MATT: It feels like some sort of power from the inside is beginning to centralize, and then (magical blast) a gossamer wave of gentle magical energy emanates from it-- 
SAM: What? 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: -- across the entire city. 
TALIESIN: Hold on. 
MATT: You've seen this sort of magic once before at the base of the Malleus Key. As it washes past the entirety of the central cavern-- 
MARISHA: Counterspell? 
MATT: -- the invisibility illusions (swoosh) fade. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MATT: You're all suddenly visible. 
MARISHA: Shit! 
MATT:  Your Seemings suddenly pass as a mass Dispel wave (blast of Dispel energy) spreads throughout the central city. 
TRAVIS: So the Mystics showed up, made a perimeter, and it seems like something activated that column to (Dispel blast) 
LIAM: To kill magic. 
MATT: They formed a matrix around other things that were present within the pillar. 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. Oh no. 
MATT: A defensive measure of the central city of Kreviris has been triggered, and all of you suddenly feel the cloaking illusion (fluttering) scatter off you. 
MARISHA: Is there-- 
LAURA: Against the wall! 
MARISHA: Yeah, an alley or dark corridor? Something shadowed, something dark? 
LAURA: We're still on them, we're still on them. Hold on. 
MATT: We're still on them. 
MARISHA: Fuck! 
SAM: We're on us right now! 
TRAVIS: Is it just illusion magic, or my werewolf form? 
MARISHA: Sorry! 
LIAM: The witches are like-- (flurry of chatter) 
MATT: No no no, your werewolf form is still there. 
ASHLEY: (panicked) What are we doing? 
MATT: Innate things seem to still be present. 
TRAVIS: But illusions-- 
MATT: Whatever seemingly still lingering spells of a certain point, of a certain level, were scattered. 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, oh shit. 
SAM: Is there any distinct feature near us, like a particular spire, broken tower, red flashing light? 
TALIESIN: Anything. 
SAM: Any marker of any sort. 
MATT: Yeah, there are a number of watchtowers that sit along the perimeter of the major residential area. You weren't towards the center of the core. After you were blown out, you were near the side, and you can gather and use that to ground yourself. But you're now starting to push into the city when the Seeming illusion that was on you is now-- (revealing) 
TALIESIN: We need to get out of fucking range and get somewhere inside right now. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
SAM: All right, if I can, I'm going to telepathically describe the location of that watchtower to my friends. 
MATT: What level was your telepathy? 
SAM: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Are we not in the bond anymore? 
MARISHA and LAURA: (gasp) 
TALIESIN: No, it's gone. 
LAURA: It's a 5th-level. 
LIAM: It's an auto-- 
LAURA: Bond is a 5th-level. 
TRAVIS: It's a 10th-level spell. 
SAM: It is a 5th-level spell. 
ASHLEY: It's a 10th-level spell. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (screams) Oh no! 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh shit! We didn't need it to be this hard! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We just want to get out of here! 
ASHLEY: I love when Travis gets to that level. 
MATT: You feel the magical connection-- 
TRAVIS: No! 
MATT: -- that settles between all of your friends telepathically, dissipate. 
TRAVIS: Oh, goddamn it! 
MARISHA: Shit. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Well, fuck. 
SAM: Let's just hide, then. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
TALIESIN: We're going to find somewhere to hide. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's find a hidey hole. 
SAM: I don't think I brought Sending. 
TALIESIN: It's all right. 
ASHLEY: Let me see if I did. 
TALIESIN: We don't even know if it's going to work yet. Let's find somewhere to hide before we do fucking anything. 
ASHLEY: I could try to maybe connect with Imogen at some point. I don't even know if that's going to work. But we can try, we can try. 
SAM: Oh, yeah yeah yeah! Okay. 
ASHLEY: We're going to find a place to hide. 
MATT: Okay, I need you three to make a stealth check for me. 
ASHLEY and SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Fuck me. 
TRAVIS: Oh, you son of a bitch. 
ASHLEY: Fuck! That's cocked. 
TALIESIN: That's cocked, goddammit. Oh! Oh yeah, no. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TALIESIN: 26. 
MATT: 26. 
ASHLEY: Four. 
MATT: Four. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: One. 
LIAM: (moans) 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: H'one. 
ASHLEY: Which is different than one. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: First, you see what looks to be a cluster of Reilorans and two Quanikka soldiers that look over in your direction, and you all three dart off into a tight alleyway and wait there quietly as they all rush past. 
ASHLEY: We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah. We're wearing costumes. They can't see us. 
TALIESIN: We're not. 
ASHLEY: No, you're not. Wait, no you're not! You look different. 
SAM: What? Oh no! I was just standing in the open! 
SAM and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I knock out FCG. 
MATT: As you all have this quiet moment, as the soldiers run past, exhale. (rumbling) You hear the cracking of stone as bits of dust and rock tumble above, and you glance up as the shadow, what little bit of light is coming in here from the local lanterns and pillars, darkens. You glance above to see the underbelly of a familiar fey dragon that's now clustered on the top that looks down, its head snaking down into it, going, "(screeches)" 
SAM: Oh god. 
LIAM: It's just a dragon. 
ASHLEY: Does he see? 
SAM: I think he sees us. 
LAURA: Does he see us? 
ASHLEY: But we see his belly. 
TRAVIS: Does he? Is he above them? 
ASHLEY: We see his belly, and we're in an alleyway. 
TALIESIN: He's making eye contact, is what I'm-- 
MATT: The thing about Gloamglut is, the pupils are an odd open white coloration. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: He doesn't see us. 
MATT: You get the sense that it's not attacking, but it definitely seems present and making itself known directly above you. 
ASHLEY: (smooching) Big boy! 
TRAVIS: No! No, no! 
TALIESIN: No! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: How close is he? 
MATT: About 25 feet up from you. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I have an idea. 
SAM: Okay! 
TALIESIN: Really? Really? 
MARISHA: (roughly) Okay. 
ASHLEY: What do you want to do? Do you want to run? 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: I'm waiting to see if he does anything. If he does anything, I'm going to fucking run. 
ASHLEY: Okay, if he does something-- 
TALIESIN: Do you have a plan? 
MATT: Are you doing anything, or are you still waiting? 
ASHLEY: I have an idea, but I think-- 
SAM: Do it! 
ASHLEY: -- it might be dumb. 
SAM: Do it! 
LIAM: Do it! 
ASHLEY: I'm scared! 
TRAVIS, LIAM, and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: Do it! 
TALIESIN: What's your idea? 
MARISHA: There are no dumb ideas in D&D. 
SAM: It's your dad! 
ASHLEY: I was thinking of maybe Charm Monster. 
LIAM: Or there are only dumb ideas in D&D. 
MATT: You can certainly try. 
SAM: That is exactly the place that you should do this. 
TRAVIS: That's great, yeah. Because if it goes wrong, then he knows exactly where you are and you're dead. 
ASHLEY: He already knows where we are. 
LAURA: Yeah, exactly. It couldn't go any worse. 
TALIESIN: Is there a door or anywhere for us to escape-- 
SAM: It's a monster. 
ASHLEY: Right? 
SAM: Yeah, this is what it's for. 
MATT: It's a wisdom save. 
SAM: This is what it's for. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: It's a wisdom save? 
ASHLEY: Yes, it is. 
MATT: All right, that is a 13. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: Is the DC? 
ASHLEY: It says it does so with advantage if you and your companions are fighting it. 
SAM and TRAVIS: We're not! 
ASHLEY: But we're not fighting him yet. 
SAM: No. 
MATT: No, but it is going to use Legendary Resistance. (screaming) 
ASHLEY: No! Dang it! 
TRAVIS: (unhinged) It's got Legendary!? 
MATT: As you release the spell and you wind the threads of your-- 
TRAVIS: (laugh) Shit. 
MATT: -- fey nature magic into its mind, it shakes its head for a second-- 
SAM: You did great. 
MATT: -- and then immediately, the head focuses on you. 
LIAM: That's one down. 
MATT: It goes (chittering). Gives this weird, guttural clack. As it does, its throat bubble-- (grotesque expansion) 
SAM: Oh, it's getting ready to blow. 
MATT: It's making this weird chittering, curling sound. 
SAM: We've got to run. 
ASHLEY: Run, run, run! 
LIAM: It's going to spit LSD on you. 
MATT: You hear a voice go-- 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: (Zathuda) "Is that true?" 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Is that true? Oh it just said something. 
TRAVIS: Daddy. 
LAURA: It's Daddy. It's your dad. 
SAM: It's your dad. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
MATT: (crashing) It begins to lower itself into the alleyway, climbing down from each side. 
ASHLEY: Do we run? Do we run? 
SAM: Can we talk to him? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to smash, I assume that we're next to a wall of a building. 
MATT: You are, yes. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to smash-- 
SAM: Talk do your dad! 
TALIESIN: -- a hole in the wall. 
MATT: Okay, roll an attack. 
SAM: Tell him you just need some money! 
TALIESIN: All right. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Let's see, hold on. 
ASHLEY: Daddy, give me your credit card. 
TALIESIN: All right. Rolling an attack against-- 
LAURA: Money, please! 
TALIESIN: -- a wall. I do not have advantage on this. I don't know why I would. 
MATT: No, it's just against the AC for the wall, which is not terribly high. 
TALIESIN: I can't take reckless against the wall? No, it's okay. 
MATT: You can if you want to, it just means everything else will get advantage against you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, fuck that. Okay. Sorry, just moving to my things. Also, my damage doesn't go up because my strength is higher, does it? No. 
MATT: You're not transformed. 
TALIESIN: I am transformed. 
MATT: Oh, you are still. That's right! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: So, yeah. You actually have siege on this as well. 
TALIESIN: I do, which is why I'm doing this. 
MATT: So you do double damage, yeah. So yeah, roll full damage. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: You do, you do. 
TALIESIN: That definitely hits. I don't know why I bothered. 
MATT: (laughs) The wall is right there. It's an AC 10, so yeah. 
TALIESIN: Let's see, so-- 
MATT: So roll your damage and double it against the wall. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm not raging at the moment. That's okay. Hey, never mind, I get to reroll those double ones. 
MATT: Oh that's right! 
TALIESIN: Better. 
ASHLEY: Much better. 
TALIESIN: That's 16 times two-- 
MATT: 32 points of bludgeoning damage. 
TALIESIN: -- points of damage. 
MATT: You slam your hammer into the wall and the wall explodes inward. There's a good solid six-foot hole now that's blown open, and the wall begins to crumble and collapse inward. 
TALIESIN: Run, now! I'm shoving everybody into the wall, and we're going through. 
SAM: Into the wall, okay. 
MATT: You all immediately get pushed into, as the wall collapses behind, and Gloamglut, who was using the wall to climb down, (shifting rubble) (awkward squawks) tumbles and impacts the bottom of the alley-- 
SAM: Amazing. 
MATT: -- as part of the wall collapses onto it. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: For the moment, it seems like it's scrambling to try and gather itself. 
ASHLEY: Run! Run run run run run! 
TALIESIN: Full fucking speed through this building. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, run, run, run. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Honestly, I'm tempted to hit the next wall and keep going. 
MATT: Okay, you can. 
LIAM: Are you Looney Tunes-ing it? 
TALIESIN: I'm Looney Tunes-ing it. 
MATT: As you go darting through the wall to the opposite side, you do see in the corner what looks to be a very well dressed pair of teenage Reilorans that are hiding in the corner. As soon as you dart past, one of them points outward, and the other one puts the hand away, and they both shrink. You come to the opposite side of the wall. It looks like there is a window there, a porthole that's a diamond shape. Not large enough for any of you to go through. 
ASHLEY: I can fit! I can fit! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to open it up. I'm opening it up. 
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll again. 
TALIESIN: Sorry! Yeah, that hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's nine, 18 times two, so I'm sure that-- 
MATT: (crashing) You blow out the opposite side of the wall. 
SAM: Amazing. 
MATT: Stones go flying, and you go skittering out of that structure and now into a partial roadway. 
ASHLEY: If I look back, where's he at? 
TALIESIN: Is there another building that's next to us, further down? 
MATT: There is, about 10 feet from you all. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over there real quick. See anything else that we can go and hide into? 
SAM: Any Gloamgluts? 
TALIESIN: Or anybody, or any other structures? 
MATT: There is another structure across the way from you. There's one immediately to the left of it. This is a densely populated area, so. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to punch the wall of a building we're not going into. 
ASHLEY: Oh, got it. 
SAM: Oh, smart, smart, smart. 
ASHLEY: Okay, good idea. Good idea. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So wherever we decide to go-- 
ASHLEY: You'll do that, and then we'll go that way. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. So, smacking another wall. 
TRAVIS: I like this. I like that. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Oh, yes! 
SAM: The entire building collapses. 
TALIESIN: This is actually going to be really bad. This is going to be real bad. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
LIAM: It's quadruple dice. 
TALIESIN: Yep, so-- 
ASHLEY: Oh wow. 
TALIESIN: 12. 
ASHLEY: That was your best, biggest roll. 
TRAVIS: I can see that. 
TALIESIN: 17, 18-- 
MATT: So double the dice, then add your modifier. 
TALIESIN: 18 times two. 
SAM: 36. 
TALIESIN: Plus nine. 
SAM: 45. 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
MATT: Okay, so that's 45 times two, because of Siege. 
TALIESIN: That's everything, because 18 was the dice. 
MATT: Right, but you double the dice for the crit. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Then add your modifier. 
TALIESIN: Then-- 
MATT: Then double it for Siege. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: Because you're hitting another building. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit, you're right! 
LIAM: Yeah, dude. 
SAM: 90 points. 
MATT: You strike this other building, and you hit it right on its load bearing central pillar, and the entire structure-- 
SAM: No, that's not what he wanted to do! 
ASHLEY: That's a bit much! A little bit much! 
MATT: Mind you, there's a part of your brain that's super impressed that your friend just single-handedly destroyed a building. 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
TALIESIN: Didn't mean to do that! 
MATT: But the whole building collapses down. (crashing) (laughter) 
MATT: The second level-- 
LAURA: The worst natural 20. 
MATT: Immediately, every other soldier shifts over into space, and you hear (screeching). 
TALIESIN: Through the hole that we were making. 
MATT: Up into the air. 
SAM: We're going to go back the way we came? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, full speed the way we came. 
ASHLEY: Okay, go back. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I throw it in reverse. (whirring) 
TRAVIS: That's how it goes. 
MATT: Back into the building, and on the opposite side, the hole you emerged from, Gloamglut lands on that, and peering through right as you all vanish back through into the alleyway you were. 
TALIESIN: I was hoping to get a couple and then, yeah, find a way out that is not putting a hole in the building. 
MATT: I mean, there is a door, there's a stairway upward to a partially ruined wall, and there's the entrance that you knocked into this building originally. where do you want to go? 
TALIESIN: I guess, entrance? 
SAM: Go back out the way we came. 
ASHLEY: Go back out the way we came? 
TALIESIN: The way we came, and take a left, yeah. Just get the fuck out and go a different direction. Full fucking speed. 
MATT: I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, Jesus. 
SAM: That was amazing. 
ASHLEY: That was great. 
MATT: I need you three, right now, to make dexterity saving throws for me. 
LAURA: Oh no! Why? 
SAM: How many? 
MATT: Just one each. 
SAM: Okay. Natural 20. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: As you're darting through the room to the opposite side, you watch as the interior of the room, the light behind you that is now splashing onto the walls around you is getting a brighter purple. 
LIAM: Oh, he's vomiting up. 
MATT: (powering up) 
MARISHA: Oh fuck! 
MATT: As Gloamglut's head has now pushed through the hole, and its eyes and mouth (snarls). So we've got 20. 
LIAM: Oh my god, it's going to vomit up rainbows! 
LAURA: Oh no, and you guys are still injured! 
TALIESIN: I have advantage on dexterity saves. 
LAURA: They're still injured! 
TALIESIN: Thank god. 
LIAM: Yeah? 
ASHLEY: Is this? 
LAURA: Heal yourself-- 
ASHLEY: -- a spell or a magical effect? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: I'll say it's magical-ish, but this is just to see if you can get out of the hole in time. This is about your speed. 
TALIESIN: Ew. 
MATT: What'd you get? 
ASHLEY: One. 
MATT: Gotcha. 
LIAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: I'll just try to-- 
TALIESIN: 11? 
ASHLEY: -- negotiate. 
TALIESIN: But I'm happy to try and, I would start stone merging if I had to. 
TRAVIS: For the 20 and a one and 11, it's on the north side of 10. 
MATT: So, you managed to make it into the alleyway and avoid it entirely. The two of you are targeted by its dark fire gaze. Now you actually are making a save against the gaze. So one of them was just to see if you can dart out of the way, the other is now trying to resist it. 
LAURA, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: Dark fire gaze. 
SAM: Save against the gaze. 
LAURA: So that's another. 
MATT: So now both of you-- 
ASHLEY: That's a magical? 
MATT: This is. So now both of you make a dexterity saving throw and you get advantage because it is a magical effect. 
LIAM: They are fire. 
TALIESIN: I fucking hate fire. 
MARISHA: They are fire! 
SAM: They are fire. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
TALIESIN: 19. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Dirty 20. 
LAURA: Nice, nice. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Those are good. 
MATT: Both of you take 16 points of fire damage. 
SAM: That's not bad. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to reduce that with my, I'm going to reduce that with my ring. 
MATT: There you go. 
ASHLEY: Can I shield? 
MATT: Shield wouldn't protect you against magic, unfortunately. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: But attacks, it adds to your AC. 
ASHLEY: I'm not going to use it yet. Got it, got it, got it. 
MATT: That's okay, that's okay. But you both barely got a (crackles) singe from behind, but then (boof) emerge from the hole and you catch yourself on the opposite side of the wall of the alleyway and turn around and you see where FCG is and you now have-- 
SAM: This way! 
MATT: -- the alley both ways. 
SAM: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: I already rolled those. That was 16? 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Hold on. 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, and 10, nine, eight, okay, down to eight points. 
MATT: So eight points fire damage. Okay, you're now darting through the alleyway and you hear this shrieking above now (shrieking cry) 
ASHLEY: Go, go, go! 
MATT: It's giving chase. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: Coming over to you guys. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
LIAM: We're still dressed as Ruby Vanguard. 
LAURA: Yes. We still have our-- 
MATT: You are still dressed as Ruby Vanguard. 
TRAVIS: I'm a giant wolf. 
LIAM: I know, I know. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, that's fine. I'm immediately going to cast. 
MATT: I'm aware. 
LAURA: I'm going to throw my hood up and I'm going to cast a 5th-level Invisibility. 
MARISHA: Damn, damn. 
LAURA: I can't get myself, but I can get everybody else. 
MATT: You got it. Okay, so. 
MARISHA: Oh, shit, okay. I'm going to grab Evoroa and be like, "You know this city, get us out of here." 
MATT: "Where do you want to go?" 
LIAM: Up. 
MATT: "Okay, we'll get through the Sprawl. Righto, we'll go the way of the Villums. Here, I'll-- I'll I can point it out." 
MARISHA: We're trying to get back to the Volition's hideout. Do you know where that is? 
MATT: "I don't, I've never been to it." 
MARISHA: (groans) 
LIAM: If you get us topside, we can probably find our way back to where we got in or make a decision once we get there. 
MATT: "Okay, okay, all right. I talk to you?" 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Okay. Continue down this main road and then you'll come to a central fountain made of a hammered bronze. Take a right and follow that main thoroughfare. It'll loop over twice in two big humps. It'll go through one big stone archway and then it'll lead to a spiral up cavern." 
LAURA: Just tell me as we go. 
MATT: "Okay, okay. I'll keep it going." (laughter) 
MATT: You all continue to follow this path. 
TRAVIS: Over two humps. 
MATT: People running past, chaos happening, war beasts. You can see vidulches and many other armed soldiers are now beginning to tear through the streets (quick foot stomps) skittering past keeping watches over it. 
MARISHA: I tell Pâté to go re-invisible by the way. He's still ahead. Yeah. 
MATT: "Don't worry." 
MARISHA: He's still ahead of us scanning. 
LAURA: We are trying to go as fast as possible just in case there's another one of those dispel waves. 
MATT: No worries. All right, continuing your trek onward, slowly following your path, I will have, I need you to make a deception check for me. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: It's not a high DC. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But this is just, they are looking specifically for anybody who is-- 
LAURA: Looks questionable. 
MATT: Looks questionable. 
LAURA: Okay. Deception, deception. 22. 
TRAVIS: I just realized, that outfit is sus. 
MATT: 22. (laughs) 22, okay. You continue onward through the path. The rest of you having to dodge and push out of the way. Occasionally, Laudna, you'll get shoulder checked by somebody and who'll turn around and see nothing there and they'll keep moving on. There's too much chaos around. But you manage to maneuver through the city and push through following behind Imogen, who is also help-- Evoroa is helping guide you with each little bit of a phrase and direction occasionally going, "Wait, I, I, I think it's-- No-- Yeah, I think it's to the right. I don't get out very often." 
LAURA: It's all right, it's all right. 
MATT: But you continue moving on, moving on. You hear the distant shrieks of different beasts screeching and the one familiar open- throated call growl screech of Gloamglut echoing throughout the hall. 
LIAM: How far off does that sound from us? 
MATT: It sounds maybe quarter mile. 
LIAM: Quarter mile, okay. 
LAURA: We can't see it. 
MATT: A little less than a quarter mile. I'd say maybe an eighth of a mile away. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Can I check the Treshi scry ball? 
MATT: Somewhere in, on the ground with the city. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. 
MATT: All right, coming back to you three. 
SAM: Oh, no! (clamoring) 
MATT: As we're in the midst of this chase. 
TRAVIS: Deep shit! 
TALIESIN: Have you got anything? 
SAM: I can do something-- 
ASHLEY: I tried! 
TALIESIN: We are running. 
ASHLEY: We keep going. 
MATT: Okay, the alley you're following, there are small thin alleys that crawl off to the side, but it looks like they're largely for either cytaas or myceit, that is maybe a foot wide. Your physical form won't move through there. You could probably burrow underneath it if you wanted to try to fit through there. 
TALIESIN: If they can fit through, then I will burrow. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I might have, hold on. Ah, sorry, sorry, where'd it go? Let me just look it up. 
SAM: Boop boop boop. 
ASHLEY: Boop boop beep boop. Okay, wait, can we do this? I can do two of those, I think, right? 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I have no idea what. 
SAM: Are we stalling or are we going? 
ASHLEY: We're going, I mean, can we fit in there? Should we try to fit in there? 
SAM: I can fit in there. Are we fitting in there? 
TALIESIN: If they can fit in there, I'll shove them in. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: See you on the other side. 
ASHLEY: Less than a foot? 
MATT: You both scoot into it and you have to get on your side to move through and it's having to, and you're not quite sure how far it goes. 
ASHLEY: I just pull up my boobs. 
MATT: Yep shelf it up. 
ASHLEY: Tuck in my butt. 
SAM: I roll up my tongue. (laughter) 
MATT: You have to, the wheel has to go to the side and you're like (screeching). (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I look down and I'm going to shark on occasion to see what's ahead and I'm going to-- 
MATT: Yep, cruising through. 
TALIESIN: Scout ahead. 
MATT: There is, as you're moving through, you're not quite sure how long this alley goes and it winds so-- 
ASHLEY: I'm getting a little claustrophobic. 
SAM: Think about what's-- 
ASHLEY: What if we get stuck in here forever? 
MATT: (screeching) 
SAM: Oh god! 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: You hear, you feel the impact nearby of all the structures shake as Gloamglut lands somewhere on one of the nearby rooftops. 
ASHLEY: I hate this day, I hate this day. 
MATT: You hear-- 
SAM: It's your dad, talk to him. 
MATT: You hear it walking across leaping from rooftop to rooftop. (crashing) Rocks pummel a little bit down, dust gets in your eyes, and you hear the voice go, "Fearne!" (gasping) 
LIAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: "That was you at the Sablecast Grounds, wasn't it? (laughs) How fitting my singular kin fights against me. Bucks the order and call. You are your mother's daughter. (laughs)" (screeching) 
LAURA: I like that. 
MATT: You see the shadow passed overhead. 
MARISHA: He sounds hot. 
MATT: You see the tail float by the area of the alleyway that you ducked into, seemingly searching the area, but not quite finding where you are. 
TALIESIN: Pass Without a Trace. 
MATT: All right, pass. The shadows get darker around you as the head starts glancing through. I want the three of you to make stealth checks. You both technically have disadvantage because you can't really move in this space, but you do get a plus 10 because the shadows grow darker thanks to your ability. 
ASHLEY: Disadvantage, oh. 
LAURA: No! 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
LAURA: Plus 10? Plus 10, plus 10, plus 10. 
SAM: 12? 
MATT: 12. 
TALIESIN: Is that plus 10? 
ASHLEY: Oof! 
MATT: You didn't roll a one, though. 
SAM: I rolled a two. 
MATT: Okay, that's good. 
TALIESIN: Okay, all right. 
ASHLEY: 27. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: 28. 
MATT: 28, great. All right, so as you actually get stuck for a second, you're (whimpering) in panic for a minute. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, are you stuck? 
SAM: (shushes) 
MATT: The shadows curl into the space. 
ASHLEY: Do we need to cut off your wheels? 
SAM: "127 Hours" (whirrs)! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: 127 seconds. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
MATT: However-- 
ASHLEY: When he cuts the nerve. 
MATT: A dull pale green-yellow light fills the opposite side like these two nightmarish headlights as Gloamglut's eyes light up the shadows of the space and is searching through all the alleys. As it passes past all of you, the magical essence that you emanate around you, Ashton, darkens the shadows and it doesn't seem to find you at the moment. The voice still echoing out from above on back. You can hear the armor scraping as Gloamglut shifts above. "The mix of pride and hate I hold for you, Fearne Zathuda, oh, it is delicious. A true chaos being of cold shadow and fiery whim." 
ASHLEY: Cold shadow and fiery whim. 
LAURA: She's a chaos being. 
SAM: You should talk to him. This might be your only time. 
ASHLEY: Should I talk to him, should I talk to him? He said he was proud of me. Is that what he said? 
TRAVIS: Villain arc. 
LIAM: He also said he hates you. 
MARISHA: He did, yeah, in the same sentence. 
ASHLEY: In the same sentence he said he hated me? I didn't fully hear the whole thing. 
TALIESIN: All right, I am paying, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Can you say it one more time? (laughter) 
MARISHA: It was really cool. It was something like pride and disdain or something like that. 
MATT: The mix of pride and hate I hold for you. 
LAURA: Pride and hate, that's cool. 
ASHLEY: What do we do? What do we do? 
SAM: We just keep going, we keep inching. 
TALIESIN: We sit here and wait. 
ASHLEY: Okay, all right, all right. I'm going to sit here and wait. I'm going to shut the fuck-- 
SAM: We have to leave at some point. 
TALIESIN: Yep, but not now. 
LIAM: Shut the fun up. 
ASHLEY: Shut the fun up. What if we, why is he rolling? What if we just-- We just keep trying to go this way. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to very-- 
ASHLEY: Keep doing the fucking-- 
SAM: I think he's right, keep moving. 
ASHLEY: Go to the right. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep it on them and I'm slowly going to start stealthing. 
ASHLEY: I'm tucking it in. 
TALIESIN: Paying the fuck attention. 
SAM: The fuck-tention. 
TALIESIN: The fuck-tention. 
MATT: As you shift through the alley, it arcs around a bend and then comes to a brief corner intersection. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to look ahead. 
MATT: You all squeeze past. 
TALIESIN: Is there a direction that seems to make better sense? 
MATT: Well, it turns right immediately. It's just a bend, and the T ends at the opposite side about maybe 10 feet or so. It looks like it's filled with some sort of mildew and a heavy cluster of fungus that's building up over here over time. It has a multicolored-- 
ASHLEY: Ew! 
MATT: -- purple and orange fungal group. Almost like the-- from "Annihilation," the skeleton being, but minus the skeleton. 
ASHLEY: Oh, cool! 
MATT: It's just grown up the side of the stone. 
SAM: Ew. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Keep going this way? 
SAM: Keep going. Just keep inching, keep inching. 
ASHLEY: We'll just keep inching. 
MATT: You inch to the end of this and you can see the alley comes to an end and there's a roadway about a 15-foot open way and you can see soldiers (marching). 
SAM: Then is there another alley on the other side or it's just--? 
MATT: Across the way, you can only see about this much ahead of you until you get out there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm trying very gently to take a peek and just-- 
MATT: Okay, you peek up and you can see some of the larger buildings settled around here, not unlike the-- 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: (heavy sigh) 
TRAVIS: Cat? 
SAM: It's Pussy in Bio. 
LIAM: Pussy in Bio. 
MATT: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. (laughter) 
LIAM: I like that one! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All right, we're still moving. 
MATT: You move past to the very edge. You glance and you can see some of the larger structures around here. The road goes both ways. There are alleys here. 
MARISHA: Fucking-- 
MATT: They're pretty-- Not as thin as the one you're in, but they all go off in different directions, deeper into the local residential neighborhood area. 
SAM: (sighs) 
ASHLEY: Are we making a run for it? What are we doing? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep my eyes out. 
SAM: Yes, we have to. 
TALIESIN: And see when the coast is clear. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: And, yeah, once the coast is clear, I'm going to go full speed. 
SAM: Let's just go. 
ASHLEY: Just make a-- 
SAM: Full speed. 
MATT: Okay. So y'all go for a full speed darting out into the open across the way. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: Once it's clear. 
MATT: Right, once it's clear. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Still in the open. Still in the open. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
TALIESIN: Then get back to the shadow, I mean, yeah, Pass Without a Trace is still up there, but. 
MATT: You all get across the street. It's an angle to get to the next alleyway so you can, it's more like a 20-foot run. 
TALIESIN: Or if there's a door to open, yeah. 
MATT: There is a door, if you want to go for it. 
SAM: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Let's go for the door. 
MATT: Okay, you go for the door. (shoving) It's locked. 
TALIESIN: Okay, keep going. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm not hitting any shit right now. 
LIAM: Ashton is in a mode right now. 
MATT: You glide into the alleyway while the two of you shift in. Who's going in the alley first? 
ASHLEY: All right. Technically, I can turn you into something else and I can turn into something else if we really want to get the fuck out of here. 
SAM: Like if something that can fly? 
ASHLEY: Or are we facing my father at the moment? 
SAM: I don't know. I can't do anything like you can do! 
TALIESIN: Chaos. Go for it. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, what does that mean? Which one? 
TALIESIN: Turn it into a thing, or we fucking-- Unless you've got a better idea. 
MATT: What do you got, Fearne, what are you doing? 
ASHLEY: Okay, turn into something. 
SAM: Sure! 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Polymorph you. I'm going to Wild Shape. 
MATT: Okay, Polymorphing you into? 
ASHLEY: (stammering) But I know that's-- Just to think, if you're going to, I'm going to turn you into a-- 
TRAVIS: (wheezing laugh) 
SAM: (imitates Ashley stammering) 
TRAVIS: Did you just cattle auction? 
ASHLEY: (imitate auctioneers) 
MARISHA: (pigeon coo) We're on the moon. 
LAURA: On the moon. 
TRAVIS: Five, 25, 25, 25, and 75. 
ASHLEY: Into-- 
LAURA: On the moon, on the moon, on the moon. 
MARISHA: You're in the moon. 
ASHLEY: You're in the moon. I'm going to Polymorph you into a moon thing, into a, what do you want to be? (laughter) 
SAM: We have experience with those dog things. 
ASHLEY: Eremads? 
LIAM: Those toothy things. 
SAM: Those dog things were, those are cool. 
ASHLEY: Were the eremads without those things? 
SAM: Do, yes, that. Whatever you just said. An eremad? 
LIAM: An eremad? That's the fey creature! 
ASHLEY: No, those were in the Fey Realm. No 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
MATT: What are you asking about? 
SAM: Quanikkas. 
LIAM: The little fang-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: Crumbles, slithers. 
LIAM: Not Quanikkas, those are Wookies. 
MATT: The tooth thing that you turned into is a slither, if that's what you're asking about. 
LAURA: Is that what you're thinking? 
ASHLEY: That's on here. 
LAURA: Or the dog? 
TRAVIS: That's what you did on the surface. 
ASHLEY: I think I was thinking the wild-- 
LIAM: That's from this. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
ASHLEY: So I'll turn you into a slither. 
LIAM: Celestial body. 
SAM: Oh, the worm thing? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: So you now (whooshing) you transform and you have all the weird teeth almost like scale across you. You are now-- 
SAM: I've got teeth! 
MATT: You aren't actually seeing, you're now experiencing via tremorsense. You can sense vibrations in space around you. You're having the Daredevil visual experience. 
SAM: I'm going to Wild Shape into that as well. 
MATT: You do as well? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm swimming. 
MATT: So now all three of you can burrow into-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, we go down. 
SAM: Hey, that's perfect. 
TRAVIS: Good, good, good. Good, good, good. There you go, Fearnie. Let's go, Fearnie! 
MARISHA: Let's go, let's go, let's go. 
TALIESIN: Will they be able to tremorsense where the underground city is? 
MATT: You mean? 
SAM: We are underground. 
TALIESIN: I mean, we are in the underground city, that's right. 
MATT: You are in the underground. 
TALIESIN: Where we're, yeah, where we are. 
MATT: Tremorsense means that you can sense everyone running everywhere. There is vibration everywhere. People are shifting and looking. There are people who are shaking in their household. People that are locking down. 
SAM: What direction are we going in? 
MATT: Yeah, you're now safely underground for as long as you can breathe. 
TALIESIN: What do you feel? Pop up every now and then, but, yeah. 
MATT: Where, what do you-- 
SAM: Where are we going? 
TALIESIN: Honestly, running anywhere other than here. 
SAM: What about our friends? 
TALIESIN: They are going to have to figure their shit out-- 
ASHLEY: (gasps for air) 
TALIESIN: -- and we're going to have to find them. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Should we clockwise around? 
TALIESIN: Clockwise where? 
SAM: Well, I don't-- 
ASHLEY: What are we doing? 
TALIESIN: Around what? 
SAM: I don't know! I can't even see anymore! 
ASHLEY: If I peek up-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: -- do we see anywhere where anything looks familiar where we were, or where-- 
MATT: I mean, kind of. Everything looks a little familiar. If you're trying to guide back to where you entered, back towards the hideout-- 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: Then whoever's helming that, make a survival roll for me. 
TALIESIN: That would not be me. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'll do it. 
SAM: Great. Please do. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TALIESIN and SAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: 28. 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
MATT: Woo! 
ASHLEY: I know where to go. I know where to go! 
TALIESIN: All right! 
MATT: You glance around. You begin to remember various landmarks that you had passed, how some of the roads converge in almost some unique patterns that you remember as you were exiting and moving past them. Even though Ira was bee-lining and being the guide you were taking a mental note and now that you bring up, you begin to pick up-- 
ASHLEY: Gray house. 
MATT: -- some of these patterns. 
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah, chaos lady! Let's do this shit full speed! 
ASHLEY: Yellow tree. 
MATT: You begin darting past. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You can hear the screeching of Gloamglut still flying and searching get slightly more and more distant as you begin to shift away-- 
SAM: We made it, we're fine. Everything's fine. 
MATT: -- from his sight. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I just don't know if we were going to talk to him or not. 
MATT: Back to you all. 
SAM: I wanted you to! You should have! 
ASHLEY: I kind of do, too. It's okay. 
SAM: What's wrong with you? 
TALIESIN: We did it! We fucking did it! 
MATT: Laudna. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn! 
MARISHA: Ah! 
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw for me. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MARISHA: What? What? Why? 
LAURA: What? Why? 
MARISHA: What? Why? 
TRAVIS: Just make one! 
MARISHA: (screams) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Roll with it, player. 
TALIESIN: It won't matter if you succeed. 
MARISHA: Why? Okay. 
MATT: Just make one. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
SAM: There's creatures around. 
LAURA: What is it? 
LIAM: (Gollum) What is it? 
MARISHA: It's not good! 
LIAM: (Gollum) What is it? 
TALIESIN: Really? For you, or in general? 
MARISHA: Shut up! 15. 
LAURA: That's not bad! 
LIAM: That's fine! 
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. 
TRAVIS: Not good enough! 
ASHLEY: That's really good. 
TRAVIS: You got a, "Gotcha"! 
LAURA and MARISHA: (frenzied screams) 
MATT: All right. What are you doing? 
TRAVIS: We're bobbing and weaving and-- 
ASHLEY: He's not even going to answer why?! 
TRAVIS: -- shit ain't happening! 
MARISHA: I don't know! 
LAURA: We're following Evoroa's instructions and trying to make our way ♪ to the surface ♪ 
TRAVIS: We're sand dancing. We're just doing fucking feet movement that don't mean anything. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. As you're moving past, Evoroa is stumbling for a second and is trying to catch her breath for a moment. "(pants) It's right around this way. It should be behind this building. We're not too far from where it gets us. We're getting there." 
LIAM: Are you okay? 
MATT: "(pants) I'm okay. (coughs)" She coughs up some of that dark, brackish fluid. 
LAURA: Aw, fuck. 
MATT: Still getting it all out of her lungs. 
LAURA: Once we find a place to hide, I can let them know that you're safe. 
MATT: "Okay. I appreciate that." 
MARISHA: How long-- We're still walking. How long were you in that tube? 
MATT: "I don't even know." 
LIAM: Did they do anything to you before we got there? 
MATT: "I mean, they went into my mind." 
MARISHA: You're not a sleeper agent, are you? You're not going to turn on us? They're not going to snap their fingers or say a secret code word and you're going to be like, (intimidating shout) are you? 
TRAVIS: An important question. It's an important question, though. 
MATT: "I hope not." 
LIAM: She would totally admit it, too. 
MARISHA: Was it you? 
LAURA: Insight. Is that why I had to make a wisdom saving throw? 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
TRAVIS: Did they give up the location? 
LAURA: 13. 
MATT: 13. 
TALIESIN: They're being scanned. 
MATT: Kind of hard to read, but she also seems-- 
LAURA: I mean, she's invisible. 
MATT: Yeah. Just from the tone of voice, she seems exhausted. 
TRAVIS: Kind of helps she's never been there, right? So she can't really give away where we think we're going. 
LIAM: Where we are, are we now in streets and alleys? Have we left behind more open ground? 
MATT: You've left behind the dense, more affluent core of the city near the pillar, and now you're starting to hit the Sprawlgrotto, which is where the standard populace as well as the poorer folk head out. This is where the streets become a little less well kept. This is where the-- 
TRAVIS: They have no names? 
MATT: Yeah. Where the common folk of Kreviris would live underneath the shadow of the Imperium. 
LAURA: Does any of it look familiar about where the Volition hideout had been? 
MATT: Parts of it do seem familiar. You're glancing around and you can see elements of it, but it's tough to find specific landmarks. You were the one who was guiding us on this one and you initially rolled decently, but it wasn't enough to find the right trek here. 
TRAVIS: 14. 
LIAM: (sighs) 
MATT: So you're a little tough to find the specifics because it is a very specific entrance and a massive city. 
LAURA: Right, right. 
MATT: So you're really not sure where the specific entrance is right now. You have no basis of recollection other than when you first emerged it was behind a building and there was a hidden slat that was a stone and dirt visual on the outside that was pushed aside and then put back into place. But that's the best you can-- 
LIAM: Have we at least been moving on an upward trajectory? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Because we came really low to get where we were going. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: The bottom of the cavern comes to the eventual base of the central pillar. So as you're climbing up, it's a slight upward angle as you meet the edge of the wall and then there are caverns that head up-- 
LAURA: Take you up and out? 
MATT: -- and through the rock that also emerge and weave across the city's open space. But a lot of it also heads upwards towards the top side of Kreviris. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: As you get closer and closer still, you come to one open pathway here where you see that bronze fountain that she was mentioning and goes, "Okay, okay. Okay, I know where we are. I know where we are. Okay. Take a right." (masonry crashing) The ground begins to shake around you and you watch as massive walls of stone (stone emerging) block off the path that you were taking. You look behind you-- 
TRAVIS: That's coincidental. 
MATT: -- and the path where you had just come from, (stone rising forcefully) these 30, 40-foot walls of stone jut around, locking you in a cage. 
LAURA: (stunned mutters) 
LIAM: How big is the cage around us? 
MATT: It's about 35, 40 feet or so. 
LIAM: How high-- 
MARISHA: Are they-- 
LIAM: Are the walls connecting to roof above? 
MATT: No, they're just loosely there. 
MARISHA: Does it look like they're doing it on all the streets? 
MATT: They've closed off-- Where the fountain is in the middle, it's closed off on the streets around it and then closes right behind you. It's basically caged you in with stone walls. 
LIAM: Can we tell, so someone didn't just do this to us specifically, they closed off a town square. 
MARISHA: This whole city. Yeah. Does it seem like it's because of us? 
LAURA: Or does it look like it's us? 
MATT: It's pretty localized to you. 
LIAM: Shit! 
LAURA: But I'm the only one that's visible? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Fuck! 
MATT: You feel a presence. As you glance up and see this sparkling aura of purple energy surrounding the windswept image of your mother-- 
SAM: Of Gilmore. (laughter) 
MATT: -- about 80 feet above you. 
MARISHA: Our savior! 
ASHLEY: Hello! 
MARISHA: I say in her head: Imogen, what are we doing? What do we do? What do we do? 
LIAM: I'm going to fall in right on her left, right behind her about a foot or two. 
TRAVIS: We can't do it in the head anymore, right? That's broken? Or is that just you two? 
LAURA: Yeah, you can't talk-- 
MARISHA: No, I can send a message, theoretically, right? 
MATT: You can still Message. That's a cantrip. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Okay, okay. 
LAURA: Oh, but that breaks your invisibility. 
MARISHA: Well, invisibility are attack spells, though, right? 
MATT: Casting a spell or an attack. 
LIAM: Casting a spell. 
MARISHA: All right, then I say it out loud. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: With your mouth. 
MARISHA: With my mouth! 
SAM: Your dirty mouth. 
MATT: Your mother speaks, and when she does, her voice seems to be propelled. It has multiple tones, like a deep bass-y undertone and a high pitched tinny overtone to it. It's almost like an off-set harmony to her voice as she speaks, the air itself crackling with energy. "Did you know?" 
LAURA: Know what, Mama? 
MATT: Are you lying to her? 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
MATT: Make a deception check. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: (squeals) 
TRAVIS: I don't know if that felt like a lie or just a fucking badass response. 
MATT: I know, that's why I'm asking are you deceiving or are you intimidating? 
TRAVIS: Did somebody take a shot at you, dog? 
MATT: That's my question. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: That's not as good. I should not intimidate. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm not going to roll this one. I always roll shit on that one. 
TRAVIS: You fucking warned her. 
LAURA: I did warn her! 
MARISHA: We fucking warned her! 
ASHLEY: We did! 
LAURA: 31. 
SAM: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Oh shit! 
TRAVIS: (exhales) 
MATT: (descending) She lowers down to about 20 feet above you. As she slowly lowers herself, her hair flowing in the air, you can see the streaks of blood down the side of her face. The bottom of her coat is jagged and torn. You can see she looks like she's endured a failed assassination attempt, and there is a fury in her eyes and a confusion and just an intensity as she looks down to you. 
MATT: "Then why are you here? What is it you want?" 
LAURA: I want to free you. 
MATT: "From what? We're too far down this hole now, Imogen!" 
LAURA: Are we, though? Are we? Your will is stronger than you give yourself credit for. I'm going to pull out the locket that my dad gave me. 
MATT: (descending) As she lowers herself down, still slightly above you, you can feel the ground (vibrating) some of the stones, pebbles lifting and being pushed back away. All of you, your vision seems to vibrate in the presence of her, just emanating the sense of her Ruidusborn Exaltant powers. It's almost hard to focus on her, your vision feeling pressure on your eyes as she gets close. She reaches out towards the locket. 
LAURA: You're so powerful! A better whole, Mama. 
MATT: "I don't want Ludinus to see how powerful you are. They'll make you the vessel instead." 
LAURA: Run away! Run away with me! 
MATT: "I can't." 
LAURA: Take it. 
MATT: "As long as I'm here, I can control what happens around him. If I'm not here, there are so many others, children." 
LAURA: Mama, you're hurt. People are going to be coming for you. I know it. Please? Please come with me! Please! 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
MARISHA: Come on, bish! 
LIAM: Come on, you motherfucker! 
MARISHA: This is it. This is it! 
LIAM: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Vessel? 
MARISHA: Come on. The vessel! 
LAURA: She's the vessel! 
TRAVIS: The plot fucking thickens! 
LIAM: Let's fucking go! 
TALIESIN: Some maple syrup fucking plot right there. 
LAURA: Persuasion? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you're good at this. You're good at this. 
LAURA: 31. 
SAM: Ooh! 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
MATT: 31. 
ASHLEY: Come on, Mama. 
TRAVIS: Two in a row? 
LIAM: She rolled 16 twice in a row. 
TRAVIS: That's big! 
MATT: She looks back at the city, her hair floating in the air, and you can see the central glass pillar starting to thrum and pulse with light. She goes, "The mind is looking. I have to think. I'll find you. I'll find you. Go. Go!" She wipes her hand and all the stone walls (stone tumbling) crumble in the path where you were going. 
LAURA: (jostling) 
MATT: She turns back at the thing and you watch her (rapid ascending) shoot up upward like a bullet puncture through the ceiling of the city and out of sight. 
TRAVIS: Take us with you! 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Fuck! 
LAURA: She's so fucking cool! She's so fucking cool! 
MARISHA: Your mom is the coolest! 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: But she's kind of a bitch. 
TRAVIS: Not done yet, not done yet. 
LAURA: We got to go. We got to get out, we got to get out. 
LIAM: Are you good to run? 
LAURA: Let's go! Let's go! 
LIAM: Let's run. 
MATT: You get about 30 or so feet before there's a slight shift in the air in front of you, and immediately you see-- (figures apparating) 
LAURA: Oh no. Oh no! 
MATT: Five Reiloran Mystics, themselves adorned in extremely-- 
LIAM: Five. The five. 
MATT: -- intricate armor-- 
SAM: Oh! Oh no! 
MATT: -- jewelry and chains. 
TRAVIS: The five minds! 
LIAM: The five. 
MATT: Gems, golds and platinums. 
MARISHA: Is it the five? 
MATT: Their head crests themselves are wide and adorned with intricately carved bones with designs and runes across them, multiple layers of them that frill out. They all stand before you, their outline impressive as their legs hang limply below, like scraggling roots without ground to hold. 
SAM: Gross! 
MARISHA: Once again, is this just for us or are they projecting themselves all over the place? 
MATT: They have appeared right around you. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: You hear in all of your minds, "There you are! Who are you?" 
TRAVIS: I liked it more when your mom was here. 
LAURA: I know. 
LIAM: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Does this look like a projection or are they here? Did they appear? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: While she's doing that-- 
SAM: Are you guys invisible? 
TRAVIS: -- do they look older, like most Reilorans we've seen? 
LIAM: To them it probably doesn't matter. 
TRAVIS: Are they ancient looking? 
MATT: It's hard to tell. The crests and the face, those mask pieces, they're all-- 
TRAVIS: Super adorned. 
MATT: Super adorned. 
TRAVIS: Decked out. 
MATT: Like on a different type of design, but similar scale as the Sunder King that you saw previously. There is a position you can only assume that this is the Weave Mind. 
LIAM: They're wearing a lot of bling? 
MATT: Tremendous amounts. 
TRAVIS: But they don't look crazy, like wrinkled or-- 
MATT: They're wearing masks. Sorry, I should have-- They have masks over the front of their face. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
MATT: All you can see is the elements of their fingers and their legs just barely through and they look fairly loose. 
SAM: Ew! 
MARISHA: 19. 
MATT: 19? 
ASHLEY: Baby horse right after they're born. 
MATT: There's facets of this that, being a person who has practiced with illusion and different types of magic, you get the sense that this could be an illusion. You don't have confirmation. But watch the minds all (whooshes) shift to you. 
LAURA: So they can see everybody? 
MATT: They do not care about your invisibility. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) They know an alpha when they see one. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh Jesus! 
MARISHA: We couldn't even get through it all. (laughter) 
MATT: "We've connected to your essence before." 
SAM: What? 
ASHLEY: What? Huh? 
MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw. 
TRAVIS: (wails) 
MARISHA: What? 
TRAVIS: (wails) 
SAM: What was that? 
MARISHA: Did it mean werewolf motion? 
LIAM: Yes! 
LAURA: Was that the wisdom save from earlier? 
MATT: No, that was your mother scrying on someone close to you to see where you were. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Seven. 
LIAM: Is this them touching him on Exandria? 
SAM: They have a spell DC of seven. (laughter) 
MATT: There was a moment-- 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: -- where the red moon seemed to look into you, and you couldn't describe it, and something changed, and you began to lose control of yourself. You worked with the Gorgynei. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: You worked with the spirit-- 
LIAM: Siccing him on us? 
MATT: -- to try and overcome this tether they held on you and break free of it. 
LAURA: Probably. 
MATT: Here, in proximity, you feel it begin to weave its way back into your heart. 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. Oh no. 
MATT: "Sweet feral child." 
MARISHA: No, no, no! 
MATT: "Instrument of our desire." 
LAURA: How do we break that again? Do we hit him? 
MATT: "Who else joins us?" 
LAURA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
MATT: They shift over to you. 
TRAVIS: They go after the strongest first. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: This is bad. This is bad! 
SAM: Quick, distract them with a toy! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm all out! (laughter) 
LAURA: I have the one you made me! 
MATT: "You will-- Ooh!" (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Cup and ball! Whoa! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Ooh, what's this? 
MATT: (slide whistle) 
LIAM: Whoever can get the crazy ball in the cup! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: A little-- 
MATT: Oh my god, that's too funny. 
TRAVIS: Give in to your wonder! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wow, this is fun. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "It's mine." "No, it's mine!" "No, it's mine!" "No, what the fuck?" (laughter) 
LIAM: It's called a Slinky. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Give them one of those slippery things. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Why can't I hold onto it? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Noodle arms playing with the noodle ball. 
LIAM: If we keep making these jokes for 30 minutes, we don't have to deal with the problem. 
MATT: That's true. 
ASHLEY: Okay. We're done. We're done, we're done, we're done. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I feel it. (lingering laughter) 
MATT: "Two spirits reside in one vessel." 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh goddamn! 
MARISHA: (sighs) Why? I don't know. 
LAURA: Roll so high. 
MATT: You see as they all shift, and you feel that (heavy beat) in your heart, "We can give you all that you desire." 
LAURA: Who are they talking to? 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
MATT: "You," and you get, with each of these bits of focus, you feel like your-- 
MARISHA: Who are they talking to? 
MATT: -- mental fortitude becomes paper, like you are being looked through like a screen door. They glide around, these illusory Reilorans, calm. The rest of the chaos and screams around you all becomes this distant, muffled-- (soft dissonance) 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
LIAM: They're turning focus toward me? 
SAM: Fight them. Fight them. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: The moment I feel anything creeping into the consciousness, I, under my breath, say: Nana Morri, I really need you right now. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: Anything you want to do? 
LIAM: We need to get out of here, all of us. Now. 
LAURA: Can she do that? 
MATT: The four of them look past you, and back to you. "You. You've come home. We're happy to have you." 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: "The rest may stay." 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: "No. They resist. They must go." 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: "Welcome home." 
MARISHA: No. Imogen. 
MATT: (disappearing) They all vanish, the illusions. 
SAM: Wait! 
TRAVIS: They resist, I think they said? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: What'd they say? They resist? 
TRAVIS: I think he was talking out loud to other mental, to the rest of them. 
LAURA: (groans) 
TRAVIS: They may stay? 
MARISHA: Are we about to have a chase on our hands? I turn around. 
TRAVIS: We should go. We should fucking run, if we can. 
LAURA: Go now. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we should run. I immediately turn around and see if there's any Thought Eaters or other Reilorans looking around. 
TRAVIS: We're still invisi-- 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Are we still invisible? 
MARISHA: We are still invisible. 
MATT: You're still invisible. 
ASHLEY: We're still in that-- 
MATT: Nothing was dispelled. 
ASHLEY: -- cage? 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: No. No, the cage got dropped. 
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. 
MARISHA: 23. 
MATT: 23. You do see a number of Mystics are currently gliding over the town. They're in search mode. You have all these different sentries that are gliding over the city. 
TRAVIS: Got to go, got to go, got to go! 
LAURA: Oh yeah, maybe they're taking over bodies. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're coming for us. Let's go. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: We're fucking hauling ass. 
MATT: Right. Using Evoroa's guidance, you begin to go back into the sprint that you can, darting through the winding streets, heading towards the edge of the wall into one of the various tunnels that will climb up towards the top of the city. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. In the interim, what are you all doing? 
LAURA: What is happening? What happened? 
SAM: I think Orym's wish made them go away or something. 
LAURA: You think? 
LIAM: Maybe, I don't know. 
SAM: We're surfacing every once in a while. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're dolphin-ing. 
SAM: Getting a lay of the land. 
TRAVIS: Now they know where we are. 
SAM: Did we see any-- 
TALIESIN: Did we see the purple light or any of that, or no? 
SAM: Or five mages gathered? 
TALIESIN: Because I know we would've only been open-- 
MATT: Well, no. You don't see any mages. You see the various Mystics that are searching throughout the city. 
TALIESIN: We didn't see them all, though? 
MATT: You've been watching that one flare spark that's been shooting around that you gather is likely, as it gets close in areas, you're like, that's Liliana, that's Imogen's mother. You watch at one point, it sits there for a number of minutes, still, and then immediately arcs over onto an area of the city maybe about four or five hundred feet away from where you're standing. 
ASHLEY: Well, they didn't kill her. 
TALIESIN: Or they did, and ran. 
SAM: Wait, she was sitting in one-- 
MATT: You see dust (rumbling). 
SAM: She was sitting at one spot for a while, and then she moved. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh boy. And landed? 
MATT: Moved out of sight down into the city. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Did that happen in the same direction as where we're heading? 
MATT: It's a little ways off. Landed about 400, 500 feet away from the direction that you're heading towards. 
ASHLEY: Is there any way we could try to reach everybody? 
TALIESIN: Let's head back to the safe house, and if they're not there, we know exactly where to turn-- 
SAM: No no no, what if they're-- 
ASHLEY: What if they're in trouble? 
SAM: -- in trouble with her right now? 
TALIESIN: Well, if they're in trouble with her right now, that's a problem, but I will also say, if they're back at the safe house, we're out exposed exactly where some shit just went down. 
SAM: But we're not, we can go under and under and under. So I feel like we should cruise by where she was hovering and cruise by where she has just gone-- 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: Do a cruise by? 
SAM: Just to see if we can see them. 
ASHLEY: Just to see, just to see. 
TALIESIN: Full fucking speed. Full fucking speed. 
ASHLEY: Full speed, let's go. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
MATT: You all move underneath the ground. You can hear the footsteps running by. You feel the (rumbling) of shifting of the stone and then the crumbling of stone, and then eventually, you shift under a space, and you hear conversation and feel this pressure of intensity. Then that intensity leaves, and then there's just silence, and then there's silence, and silence. 
TALIESIN: I don't like this. We've got to fucking move! I'm moving. 
MATT: Are you shifting up above? 
TALIESIN: No, I am-- 
ASHLEY: Well, I want to see why it's so quiet. 
SAM: I do, too. 
TALIESIN: I do not want to see why it's so quiet. 
SAM: I'm going to go upstairs and peek. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to fucking-- Oh, goddamn it. 
MATT: Okay, you peek. 
ASHLEY: We've got to take a breath, anyway. 
MATT: You see, as parts of this crumbled stone wall-- 
TALIESIN: Shit. God fucking damn it. 
MATT: These faint, flickering images of extremely heavily adorned Reiloran drift in the air, floating around Imogen. As they encircle Imogen, you see them all staring at each other intensely, and you immediately can gather this is likely the Weave Mind. It's just Imogen there in the center of them all. Then they all flicker out and vanish. Immediately, you see Imogen talking to the air and begin running in a direction. 
SAM: Oh, we can only see Imogen? 
MATT: You can only see Imogen. 
MARISHA: The rest of us are invisible. 
SAM: Got it. 
SAM: Well, if we see Imogen-- 
ASHLEY: We'll follow. 
SAM: -- we're going to follow. 
TALIESIN: Can they sense everybody, since they don't have eyes? 
MATT: Actually, as they start moving, you can feel multiple footfalls on the ground from the tremorsense. 
SAM: We're going to chase after them. Maybe spring up and scare them a little. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Sure, that'll be fun. That'll be fun. This is definitely the time for that. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: (jump scare) (laughter) 
SAM: Oogy-boogy-boogy! (laughter) 
LIAM: (sword slicing) 
TALIESIN: Let's hang back in case they need backup. They don't need to know about it. 
SAM: We're keeping-- 
ASHLEY: Yes, following. 
TALIESIN: They cannot be psychically interrogated about things they don't know. 
MATT: So the three of you are gliding through and following them. They are moving away from the path you were going. They are not going towards the safe house. They are heading towards a separate tunnel. 
SAM: Yeah, we're following. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Eventually, all the footfalls, and you hear low breath conversation, though since you're underground, you can't pick up any of the words. You're not audibly listening to quick asides and whispers, but you follow them as you go. Eventually, you come up to one of the main entry caverns that leads to a second and third floor above. They go to the right side of it into a smaller side tunnel that looks like it's a faster access for heading up multiple floors or regions of the city. So it's a rapid ascent, like a corkscrew that begins to shift further upward. You all are following these directions and heading up. Eventually, it begins to even out to an incline and continues to climb alongside the height of the city. 
MARISHA: Where is this going to spit us out? 
MATT: "If we continue following this along the way, it's going to take us to the top of Kreviris, and then we have the surface of Ruidus. I mean, anywhere in the city's not safe right now. They're going to be looking everywhere." 
LIAM: Are there any access-- Are there any passages that travel outside of the city without going completely topside? 
MATT: "Not that I'm aware of. I'm a scientist!" 
LAURA: God, I wish we had a way to burrow a tunnel outside of the city. 
TALIESIN: Did I hear that? 
SAM: (garbled squawking) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh, it's just the fucking slithers. Of course! Get it! 
ASHLEY: (aggressive screeching) (aggressive screeching) (laughter) 
LIAM: Action surge! (sword slicing) 
LAURA: Guys. (laughter winds down) 
MATT: Are you all keeping back, or are you following alongside? 
TALIESIN: Oh, we were following. 
LAURA: Did you hear us say that? 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: Because this is fun. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Seven. 
MATT: Seven. Nope, you did not. 
TALIESIN: No. Unless one of you two heard it. 
ASHLEY: Do we let them know, or should we just stay low prof? 
SAM: Am I allowed to leave this form? 
MATT: No, she has to drop it for you. 
SAM: Yeah, so I-- 
MATT: For the record, your conversation right now is-- (snarling) 
ASHLEY: But we can understand each other? 
SAM: Can we understand each other? 
MATT: Yeah, because you're speaking in the creature's tongue, I guess. 
ASHLEY: (intentional gurgles) 
SAM: Oh, you're just saying that? 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. (laughter) 
SAM: We should tell them we're here! Do something! 
LAURA: He turns into Nott. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to drop my Wild Shape. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Hi! 
LAURA and LIAM: (started screams) 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, sorry, sorry, sorry! I'm going to leave you. 
SAM: (hisses) 
LAURA: Ah! 
LIAM: Ah! 
TALIESIN: Oh god, all right. 
ASHLEY: Let's go! 
TALIESIN: We're doing this. I'm popping up. 
LAURA: Wait, okay. We have Evoroa with us. She's invisible. 
ASHLEY: Hi, wherever you are. 
LAURA: She's leading us up to the city, but this city's going to be just as dangerous, unless-- 
TALIESIN: Why weren't we going to the safe house? 
LAURA: We didn't know how to get back there. 
MARISHA: We were just trying to get out of Kreviris. 
LAURA: They were blocking the streets. 
TRAVIS: (frustrated sigh) 
ASHLEY: What do we do? What do we do? 
TRAVIS: Do you know the way? 
ASHLEY: You want to go to the safe house, or you want to go out? 
MARISHA: Are you beefy? Are you rock beefy? 
TALIESIN: I am beefy. I am full rock. 
LAURA: I can drop-- We're in the tunnels. There's nobody around us anymore? I'm assuming. 
MATT: You're outside of the city. 
LAURA: Okay. I could drop Invisibility so I can send a message to Rashinna that we have Evoroa. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you could. 
LAURA: Are we taking Evoroa with us? 
LIAM: No, we want to be in good standing with the Volition for if and when we have to come back. 
LAURA: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Right. 
LAURA: But should we take Evoroa with us? 
LIAM: Well, that's a good question for-- 
LAURA: Because she has a lot of information. 
TRAVIS: Now that we're higher on this spire, does any part of the city look more familiar from where we came from, since we've just been using Evoroa's directions? 
MATT: You no longer have a sight on the city. You are in a series of tunnels that are in sedimentary rock. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. Going up, okay. 
MATT: Occasionally, you see a side path will lead to an outer roadway. You can see a little light in that direction. You can hear the sounds of the city itself, this ever-shifting and blending din of the chaos that's happening in Kreviris right now, the weird screaming echoes and blending of screeches and calls and yells and shouts barely making your ears from that far distant tunnel, causing this weird shifting, buzzing sound. But you don't have a straight view, unless you want to head down those tunnels and get a look. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I might try and do that. 
LAURA: I can send-- Oh, you want to stay invisible, though? 
TRAVIS: No, go for it. Yeah. 
SAM: Do slithers have tongues? 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm going to lick some stuff, just to see what it's like. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Aw, you really want a tongue. 
MARISHA: Now that you have-- 
ASHLEY: Aw! 
TRAVIS: I'll try to walk out and give it a look, see if there's anything that I'm like: That's where we need to go to. 
LAURA: I'm going to let him be invisible before I drop-- Do that invisibly. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Fearne figured out how to get to the safe house, by the way, so if we want to head that way, we do have a fucking guide. 
TRAVIS: Oh, well then that's way better than me looking, yeah. 
LAURA: Are we trying to get back to the safe house, or are we trying to get out? 
TALIESIN: You did. You figured it out, right? 
ASHLEY: I did? 
TALIESIN: I mean, that's where you were taking us. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Is that where I was going? 
MATT: That's what you were trying to find. 
ASHLEY: Yes, that was. 
MATT: It's up to you. 
LIAM: Yeah, I think step one-- 
ASHLEY: I know where to go. 
TRAVIS: Safe house would be great. 
LIAM: -- call safe house. Call safe house. 
MARISHA: Yes, make sure they're not completely ransacked or under attack. 
LIAM: Yeah, they're not busted, right? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Touch base, and then, if you guys swear you know the way there? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: All right. 
TALIESIN: We're pretty fucking sure. 
LAURA: If it's too dangerous, we just make our way out of the city and try to get back to the tunnel. 
MARISHA: I think so. 
TALIESIN: I got a little while before this drops. 
MARISHA: Okay, so first things first, let Chet go do a quick scout while he's invisible. Then we call, and then we move. 
TRAVIS: Which will drop invisibility. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I like that. 
LAURA: Yeah, as soon as I call. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LAURA: So you go first. 
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll go take a look. 
MATT: Okay, and you're looking for--? 
TRAVIS: Looking for, now that we're a little bit higher up, any area that looked familiar as we were leaving the safe house going towards our infiltration mission. 
LAURA: What did the Weave Mind want? 
MATT: Okay, yeah, roll a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: You're a powerful battery. 
TRAVIS: 18. 
MATT: 18. From the perspective you have here, there are a number, especially along the edges of the city, where more of the rock column walls begin to reach the boundaries of the city, there's a lot of pillars of rock that block some of the view of what you have from your perspective. You can still see the core of the city out there, and you can see the pillar, you can see the numerous districts that surround it in concentric rings that head outward, and you can see where the massive cavern dips towards its center. You don't pick up anything, unfortunately, that improves your previous path of travel. Your best bet is still what Fearne was on earlier. 
TRAVIS: Okay, let's do it. 
LAURA: All right, in that case, I'm going to send a message to-- How many do I have of these? Yeah, I'm going to-- This is 3rd-level? Yeah. Sending to Rashinna. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: We have Evoroa. The city is unsafe. How's the safe house? If it's not safe, we'll take her with us elsewhere. 
MATT: She immediately responds. 
ASHLEY: (snaps fingers) 
MATT: "(winces) The safe house is, unfortunately, abandoned. Too hot for us to regather. Rest. Find the allies you promised. Take her with you. Anything of import, let us know." 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: That's all. 
TALIESIN: What's the plan? 
LAURA: We're heading out, heading out of the city. 
ASHLEY: We're heading out. We're heading out. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: We're on our own. 
LAURA: Can you make a path? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) Where do you want to go? 
LAURA: Well, ideally it would be great to get back to that underground. 
TRAVIS: Up, out of Kreviris. 
LIAM: Yeah, up and out. 
TALIESIN: I can do it for now. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, surface level, and then out. 
TALIESIN: I leveled a building. It's been a weird day. 
MARISHA: You leveled a building. 
MATT: Now, just to give you some perspective here. When you dug through the ground to get to the surface of Ruidus, you were about 100 or so feet below the surface when you did so. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You are a little under a quarter of a mile beneath the surface of Ruidus right now. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we got to get higher. 
MATT: So you'd have to do that from a much higher vantage point. 
LAURA: Do you have Polymorph? Any more Polymorphs available? 
ASHLEY: I don't have any more, unless we take a rest. 
MARISHA: How much-- 
LAURA: (gasps) Wait. What level spell is it? 
ASHLEY: Oh! Oh, four. 
LAURA: (excitedly) Ah! 
ASHLEY: Can I give it to you? 
LAURA: Give me your hands, give me your hands. 
ASHLEY: Oh, yes. 
LAURA: Oh, no, no. I'm going to-- 
ASHLEY: We're kissing? I mean, I'm just kidding. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: JK, JK, I was making sure everybody was listening. 
LAURA: My Ruidic energy, and a small beam of red light is going to come out, and I'm going to give you-- 
ASHLEY: (shudders) 
LAURA: -- my four sorcery points to give you a fucking spell! 
ASHLEY: (gasps) Okay. 
LAURA: So you get another 4th-level spell. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
LAURA: So you can Polymorph into something that can burrow, right? Big, something-- 
TRAVIS: Didn't your mom punch a hole in the roof? 
ASHLEY: Wait a minute! Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no. I don't need that to do another Polymorph again, I'm so sorry. Wild Shape I can't. 
LAURA: Just give it back. 
ASHLEY: So I have one 4th-level. 
LAURA: (re-absorbing spell slot) 
ASHLEY: Take it back, I don't want it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Pong. 
TALIESIN: Fucking softball game with the spells. 
LAURA: I'm so sorry. (laughter) 
LIAM: (pings) 
ASHLEY: I was freaking out. 
LAURA: So you could Polymorph into something that would be able to burrow, right? Polymorph lasts for an hour, right? I think. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, I can still go back into my slither. 
LAURA: But I don't think you should be a slither, I think you should be something big, like one of those worms. Did we see one of the worms? 
TALIESIN: We did see one of the worms. 
SAM: Can she be a worm? That's a big thing. 
MARISHA: It's big. 
MATT: You have not actually seen a bane worm. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LAURA: Have you seen any big worms on Exandria? 
ASHLEY: So many, so many. 
TALIESIN: Or any burrowing creature on Exandria? 
LAURA: A mole, a big giant mole? 
TALIESIN: A dire mole? 
LAURA: Isn't that what we used-- 
MARISHA: Wait, are you not able to make tunnels for us anymore, tunnel man? 
TALIESIN: I can make tunnels, but it's literally me breaking rock, anything could happen, and we're very far down right now. 
SAM: Aren't we on a spiral staircase? 
MATT: You're on a partial spiral that-- 
SAM: Can't we just go up? 
MATT: Well, it's leveled out, it's still going at an incline, but it's leveled out a bit. It's weaving as it continues on. 
LAURA: The fear is that we'll come out-- 
MARISHA: Into the city. 
LAURA: -- at an entrance that is already-- 
TRAVIS: Is there any way that all of us could fly, since Imogen's mom literally went straight through the roof and made a hole as she went? 
LAURA: Yeah, but it would make a hole straight to the city. It's not like-- 
TALIESIN: Once we're closer to the surface, then there's things we can do, but I think we need to get closer to the surface. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's keep going up while we talk. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Burrow and talk. 
TALIESIN: And at speed. 
LAURA: Evoroa, you want to see the blue-- big blue? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Sure, whatever makes sense. I just want to get out to here, please." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "(coughs)" Coughs up a little more of that fluid and keeps herself going. 
LAURA: FCG, do you have any healing? 
SAM: (grunts) 
LAURA: Oh yeah, okay. 
TALIESIN: I got a little healing. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out a pastry or something. 
SAM: (munches) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Taste it. 
SAM: Mm, mm, mm. 
MATT: You can see the various veins of glass and crystalline protrusions that occasionally break the darkened rock as you continue to head up the track. 
ASHLEY: Want me to take you out? 
MATT: You reach a point, at some points, it expands a bit and the ground becomes uneven. You can see this is definitely not one of the well smoothed and often-traveled paths. This is definitely a rapid-access-use side tunnel, but it's functional and it's getting you there. Sometimes the incline's lesser than others, and you're starting to get a little winded, but you're still keeping on, not enough to be exhausted. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to drop Polymorph. 
SAM: Ah! Someone needed some healing? Hey. 
LAURA: Evoroa is still struggling a bit. 
SAM: Evoroa is? All right, hi, I'm Fresh Cut Grass, Smiley day to you. 
MATT: "Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you. (coughs)" 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Why does Evoroa have an accent like that? 
SAM: I'll do a 1st-level Cure Wounds. (laughs) 
MATT: Sure. 
SAM: Got to save this. Oh, oh, it's 10 points. 10 points of healing. 
TALIESIN: ♪ ("Zelda" Find Item melody) ♪ 
MATT: "Much appreciated." 
SAM: How you doing now? Need more? 
MATT: "No, no. That'll get me on my feet." She stands up for a second, nods. As you're looking towards her and smiling, out of the shadows behind, a shape (flutters). 
MARISHA: What was that? Did we see that? What was that? 
LAURA: Oh no, what was it? 
MATT: Oh, you definitely see the figure as they step out of the shadows. 
LAURA: No. 
MARISHA: Is it your mom? 
TRAVIS: Treshi scry ball! 
MARISHA: I had this, I had the ball out, I had the ball out. 
MATT: Yeah, and it's been behind you this whole time. 
MARISHA: Ah, you, ah. 
TRAVIS: (hysterical laugh) 
MARISHA: Mm. I had this shit out; you did not say that! 
MATT: Are you doing this the entire time you're going up there? 
MARISHA: I mean, I can't-- (high-pitched objections) 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: I mean, aren't you invisible? 
LAURA: No, I sent a message. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MARISHA: But also even shit that's on you-- 
LAURA: I Sended. 
ASHLEY: Maybe it's Ira. 
TRAVIS: You had one job. 
LAURA: Maybe it's Ira. 
MARISHA: I had it-- 
SAM: If you had just said it. 
TRAVIS: We don't know who it is. 
LAURA: Maybe it's Ira! 
TRAVIS: Just something came out of the shadows. 
LIAM: Unfreeze time. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: If you want to keep it fair, it's been moving as you've been traveling through this tunnel. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: You've been keeping-- 
MARISHA: Behind us? 
MATT: Behind you. 
MARISHA: Coming towards us? 
MATT: It's moving. 
MARISHA: I would have seen that when I came-- 
MATT: Well, as you rotate up, it shifts. 
TRAVIS: Bead on us. 
MATT: Then, at times, it shifts and moves around, too. Like I said, it's not a perfect GPS, it shows the direction where they are and relative around you. 
MARISHA: But we do know when it gets closer, right? 
MATT: It's pretty dang close. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
MARISHA: All right, I would've said: I think she's pretty dang close. 
SAM: Let's run! 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we try to fucking-- 
LAURA: Then we see her right behind us. 
LIAM: All right. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you're right there? Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm stone surfing, so. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: (laughs) Stone surfing. 
MATT: So. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: No, you go, I can't even tell what's happening. 
MATT: Yeah. But you do, you do continue up this path as fast as you all can, as fast as the slowest member of your troop. 
MARISHA: Can you collapse this tunnel behind us? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Wait, but I thought we saw Otohan? 
MARISHA: I know, but we're still running. 
LIAM: How far was the shadow? 
MARISHA: We're still running. 
TALIESIN: Say yay? 
MARISHA: How far behind? 
MATT: You saw a shadow form, a (flutters) emerge. 
LIAM: Shadow clone. 
MATT: Then (flutters) vanish. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MARISHA: Collapse it. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to count to five to let them get ahead, and then I'm going to literally hop up, hit the hammer, and then drop back down, just to see what I can do to collapse the tunnel a bit. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Behind us. 
MATT: You swing the hammer up behind you. 
TALIESIN: Literally popping out of the ground like a fucking killer whale and swinging up, and then diving back in. 
MATT: Okay, make a roll for that. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
TRAVIS: There's a commotion still going on inside, right? 
TALIESIN: That's a-- 
MATT: Yeah, you pass other exit tunnels-- 
LIAM: Still audibly? 
MATT: -- that head into the city. Yeah, you can still hear it occasionally passing by. It's going through a deep tunnel, but every now and then, there's an offshoot path. 
TRAVIS: (rasps) 
MATT: You can hear it in the distance as it approaches and the din gets louder and louder, then you pass it for a moment, and it's pretty loud and echo-y through, and then it vanishes behind you. When you're far away from it, it all blends into this weird shifting noise. This low buzz. 
LAURA: I'm just Mage Armoring myself. 
MATT: Mage Armor, you got it. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll Mirror Image myself, too. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Are we getting ready for a fight? 
LAURA: Just in case. 
MARISHA: I mean, we might. 
ASHLEY: Look at his face. 
SAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Look at his face. 
SAM: I'm going to do a little bonding, a little Sympathetic Binding. 
TALIESIN: 36 points of damage. 
MATT: (bangs) You hit part of the tunnel and you watch as part of it collapses and slides down and obfuscates half of the pathway there. As I'm popping back down, I'm going to take another swing, since I technically get two an action. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to call it a quick one-two, that's 22 to hit. 
LIAM: ♪ One-two, one-two, keep it on ♪ 
TALIESIN: That's 19 times two, so that's-- 
TRAVIS: 38. 
TALIESIN: 38, and 38 points of other damage on the other side of it. 
MATT: Okay, with the second hit, (bangs) parts of the stone and elements of glass dislodge and begin to fall. I need you to roll a d20 for me. You are in a tunnel. 
TRAVIS: We're actually in a tunnel. 
MATT: Collapsing a tunnel that you're in, there is a chance, a chance, on a three or less, that it is not as centralized. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Oh, 10. 
MATT: Okay. (relieved groans) 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Don't need that pucker right now, not you. 
TALIESIN: I'm back down, and I'm swimming. 
MATT: Go charging through. (bangs) It collapses behind. You continue shifting onward. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to scoot ahead a little bit to see if anything's following for a few feet. 
MATT: You got it. 
TALIESIN: Every now and then. 
MATT: Laudna, as you're all continuing on, you see the shifting movement stalls, and then begins to-- 
MARISHA: Behind us? 
MATT: Yeah, when the tunnel collapsed, it stalls behind. 
MARISHA: It worked. 
MATT: Then it begins to flank. 
MARISHA: Oh shit. Shit, she's flanking us. 
LAURA: How? In another tunnel? 
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe they can-- move through the fucking walls or something. 
LAURA: (groans) 
SAM: Hold on, my proficiency-- 
LIAM: Maybe block off possible entry. 
TRAVIS: Didn't you say she has a bead on you? 
MARISHA: Yeah, she's coming, I think she's starting to come the other direction now. Does it seem she's circling around and flanking from the front? 
MATT: It could be, or she's just shifted back. 
TRAVIS: We just got to run, we just got to go. 
LIAM: We've got no choice, we don't even have a backward way to go anymore. 
MATT: What's everyone's speed? 
TRAVIS: 40. 
LIAM: 30. 
MATT: 40, 30. 
TALIESIN: 40. 
ASHLEY: 35. 
MATT: 40, 35. 
MARISHA: 30. 
SAM: 30, and I'm binded-- 
LAURA: 30. 
SAM: -- with everybody except you. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Evoroa, okay. 
MATT: Evoroa's speed is 25. (groaning) 
MARISHA: Shit. 
TRAVIS: Weren't we picking Evoroa up? 
LIAM: That was to help with shaky ground. 
MATT: Yeah, she was moving at half speed previously. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Gotcha. 
MATT: But nevertheless, you're-- 
SAM: Leave her behind, let's go. 
MARISHA: We can't. 
MATT: -- moving as fast as you can, continuing onward. Keeping tabs on it, the motion of the scry ball moves around to the front. 
MARISHA: Does it seem it's coming down from above or it is coming from the front? 
MATT: It looks at least it's moving to try and cut you off. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take some breaths and try and swoop back and forth to see if there's other tunnels on either side of us, if there's anything. I'm going to hold my breath, get not quite halfway, but deep enough that I can speed in one direction and speed back and get a breath-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: -- and just poke around for any other access. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, I mean, there are other offshoot tunnels. There are some that are unfinished. About every 100 or so feet, there is an access tunnel that shifts off and splinters towards the city where there's multiple other walkways that move along the edge or it descends down into other different varying levels along the outer wall of Kreviris proper. So yeah, there's a number of tunnels that lead into this. 
TALIESIN: So we don't have to be heading this direction. 
MARISHA: Seems like she's trying to come from the front. She knows we're in this core tunnel, so. 
TALIESIN: So let's go to another tunnel. 
MARISHA: All right, following you. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
LIAM: I'm going to actually take point 15 feet in front of the group. 
TALIESIN: Please. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I don't actually know where I'm going, I just know there's places to go. 
LIAM: I'm not calling the shots, I'm just soaking up problems. 
MARISHA: Go, go, go, go, go. 
LAURA: Go, go, go, go, go. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Another tunnel. 
LIAM: I'm listening, listening and walking. 
TALIESIN: Are we going? 
SAM: Oh my god, we're going to be lost in here for hours. 
TALIESIN: So I'm going to-- 
LAURA: Who is she locating? She's trained on somebody. 
TRAVIS: Fearne or you. 
MARISHA: Well, the Weave Mind knows we're here, and she's got to be connected to the Weave Mind. 
TRAVIS: Or me. I don't know. 
LAURA: You rolled a wisdom save, didn't you? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: And you failed it? 
TRAVIS: Fuck, for sure. 
LAURA: You're the only one that rolled and failed. 
MARISHA: They looked at all of us, I mean. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: I'm also 100% focused on trying to hear anything coming from ahead or behind. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Also where's the wind coming from? Do we have any feeling that there's actually? 
SAM: Does anyone need healing, by the way? 
MATT: No wind gets down here this far, unfortunately. 
LIAM: Let me check. 
LAURA: I mean, I'm not-- 
SAM: I do. 
ASHLEY: Yes, you. 
LAURA: Yeah, take some healing, heal yourself. If you go down, we're fucked. 
SAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: Split up, everybody takes a different tunnel. 
ASHLEY: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: Perception check, Orym. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you. 
LIAM: That's 25. 
MATT: 25. As you think ahead and listen, you don't hear anything coming from any direction. You glance out of the corner of your eye from one of those side tunnels and you see a shadow running, with no sound, just made of some dark, ethereal, gray power. As it runs in, (whooshes) it suddenly has color, and Otohan is here. 
SAM: (sighs) 
MATT: We're going to go to break. (yelling) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Holy shit. 
ASHLEY: Oh, ho ho ho! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Holy shit. No problem, no problem, no problem. 
MARISHA: You can't fight in a basement. 
TRAVIS: No problem, no problem, no problem. 
MATT: Changing places with echoes is a fun thing. We'll return here in a few minutes-- 
TALIESIN: Well, you can fight a monster in a basement. 
MATT: -- for another round. 
MARISHA: Maybe we fuck her up, you guys. 
MATT: Another round, it's been a bit-- 
MARISHA: Exactly. 
MATT: -- since she's gotten to flex her blades. (sighing) 
LIAM: Can't wait. 
SAM: We're Level 13 now. 
MARISHA: I want revenge. 
ASHLEY: I'm sure we'll be fine. 
MARISHA: Mama wants revenge. 
ASHLEY: Mama wants revenge. 
MATT: Let's fucking go, let's fucking go. We're back here in a few minutes. 

Break[]
Let's learn how to play "That's Not a Hat." Deal a gift card face up in front of each player and place the rest of the cards face up in a draw pile in the middle of the table to form a gift shop. Be sure to pay attention to which card is in front of each player. To start, the first player draws a new gift from the gift shop and shows that card to everyone. The card is then flipped over and is passed to the player indicated by the arrow on the back of the card. As the player passes the gift, they identify the card out loud saying, "I have a nice blank for you." In this case, it's an egg. The player receiving the gift now has two options. Accept the gift or refuse it. If the player receives the gift, they say thank you and places the card face down above their original gift card in front of them. And since it would be rude to re-gift a new gift, the next player gives away their original gift and leaves the new gift in front of them face down. When a player believes the gift is not correctly identified, they should refuse the gift and say, "That's not a blank." Then the player flips over the card and reveals the gift. Whichever player is wrong takes the card and places it face up in their personal discard pile as a penalty point. The player who receives the penalty point must draw a new gift from the gift shop. The game ends when one player receives three penalty points. Whoever has the lowest score wins the game. And that's how you play "That's Not a Hat."

LAURA: I can't wait to rub it in his face that we found the backdoor entrance like easy peasy, lemon squeezy, and he'd been trying for hundreds of years. 
MARISHA: Yeah, to suck the moon down. 
LIAM: I thought you meant Matt, I was like, "You know, Matt put that there for us." (laughing) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: "Matt's so dumb. We found this entrance." (laughing) 
LIAM: And maybe she reverse birthed them! (gasps) 
DANI: Ew! 
LAURA: Jester would fuck everything up! 
MARISHA: We got the results, everybody loves it! 
LAURA: I will die for Oppy. 
ASHLEY: Don't. 
MARISHA: That's a bigger reaction than when you won a BAFTA. (laughs) 
LIAM: This is the rest of the show. (whimsical music) 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Ooo so comfy cozy. Roll an investigation if you want, it's basically perfect. This is pretty badass. Could anything be more perfect? Style should never be a dump stat, Darling. Ooo look at this, look at the details, ooo! Look at this. Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here. You need this? You probably need this. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
(gentle music) 
The Midnight Queen is dead. As the bell tolls for Her Majesty, her succession looms in uncertainty, for with her dying breath, the queen invoked an ancient and deadly contest, compelling the Princesses of Twelvefold to meet in secret and battle one another, until the stroke of midnight reveals the victor, the new Midnight Queen. (fire roars) Erdene, the Gilded Champion; Dr. Lux, the Scholar Supreme; Rosaline, the Oneiromancer; Freya, Blood of the Tower; Hephesta, the Light Breaker; and then there's me, Boss No, the fairest of them all. Who will survive? (horse whinnies) Who will you choose? (dice rattling) Who will be Queen by Midnight? (gentle music) 
TALIESIN: Knowledge of the Flare is not exclusively held by Candela Obscura. There are many in the Fairelands who try to exploit the magickal bleed we work to quell. In the gilded halls of the Varnish, the wealthy gather to celebrate their collected avarice and gluttony, but beneath their revels, sinister plots cast shadows of the past onto the present. When Newfaire's most powerful find themselves in competition, it is those who work in their shadows that suffer the consequences.

NARRATOR 1: Weepe is getting ready to host again! NARRATOR 3: He's an excellent host. NARRATOR 2: That brunch was such a blast last time, and now he's really got the entertaining bug. Maybe it's a holdover from running a cabaret. Nothing quite like setting up a merry party for good company to enjoy. NARRATOR 3: What a social butterfly! NARRATOR 1: He is in the parlor now, of his new Tripotentiary mansion. Formerly Jonas Spahr's mansion, now Weepe's, and he's here in his parlor, setting up the perfect scene. NARRATOR 2: He's got an ornamental snack tray over here, some new blankets, tastefully draped off of one of the couches over there. Flowers - gotta have flowers in the Highest Light of course, flowers everywhere. NARRATOR 3: He's critically examining the aesthetic effect of this particular throw pillow on this particular chair. Everything must be perfect for his special guest. NARRATOR 2: He's been looking forward to this for a while. 
(epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music) 
MARISHA: Hey, Critters, it's me, Marisha Ray. I had exactly a minute and a half of free time today, so I thought I'd make a little unboxing video for y'all unpacking everything you get with a Twitch subscription to Critical Role. (bright music) (noises of struggle) Okay. (clicking) Safety third. (clicking) (ethereal voices laughing) 
MARISHA: What the fuck was that? (excited noises) So the first thing we've got here is our live and professionally moderated chat. Twitch is the only place that you can actually get this. You know, it's a little strange to hold because it's an amorphous concept, but honestly, you can't deny this craftsmanship. It's really well made, and-- Ah! Oh, you can post links in this, too! That's really cool, so yeah. Put that in your chat and click it. Oh yeah, this is cool. This is the ability to watch all of Critical Role's VODs immediately after the live broadcast ends and before they're uploaded to YouTube. Oh, it smells like... ranch? Oh wait. Oh, no, that's me. I had ranch on my salad earlier. Yeah, this smells like nothing. Oh, oh, here we have (grunts) gift subscriptions, which you can either give to a fellow Critter by name or at random using a fancy Twitch algorithm. You can give away a lot of subs with this, which I guess is why it's so heavy for something that's technically non-tangible with a value that's deeply subjective to the consumer. Oh, sick, yeah, I'm so excited to show y'all this part. With a Twitch subscription to Critical Role, you can use all of our incredible custom emotes in chat. We have so many emotes in here. Let's see, we have, oh, Art Dad, super cool. We got Ashley Hype, fun one. Oh, look at Trinket here, he's so-- Oh, oh god. (clattering and crashing) Oh god. (glass breaking) Uh, uh, ah! Broom, broom. Hang on, I can fix this. I can fix this. I'm fixing it! Jerry! Oh god, okay. I'm sorry, Trinket. (machine whirring) Yeah, that'll work. (gasping) I need more glue, this is not going to be enough. (tape stretching) Don't tell Rachel, okay? Okay, please nobody-- (crashing) (clattering) Schapiro, will you cut all this out? (electronic buzzing) 

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. All right, so as we left out: As you are going through the shifting tunnel expanses, the rocks and platforms and sections of it, still rough and very makeshift and function over aesthetics, of course, the various offshoots. You come across one as the shadow of Otohan Thull arrives and she translocates into its place as she pulls the blades from her side, glancing about. "Oh, you are irritatingly slippery." Let me pull a map out for you. 
ALL: (nervously excited exclaiming) 
SAM: This map is brought to you by WizKids Minis! Relive the Ring of Brass' final struggles to avert Calamity. Pre-order it today-- 
LAURA: Oh my god, this is huge. 
SAM: -- at wizkids.io/exucalamity. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
SAM: That's exucalamity. 
LAURA: Oh my god, Matt. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: (vocalizing) 
MATT: So. 
TALIESIN: This is a bigger room. 
MARISHA: The Ring of Brass endures! 
LAURA: This is so much bigger than I thought it was. 
MATT: You all had entered from this space. Some of this is upper area. It feels like offshoot tunnels to a certain degree. This is the area where Otohan had arrived. So whereabouts in this space would you see yourselves? 
LIAM: Well, I'm 15 feet ahead of everyone-- 
MATT: So you'd likely be about here? 
LIAM: -- for this very situation. 
MATT: Right. So you're moving probably this way as the shadow moves in here. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Because you didn't hear anything, you just turn to see it. 
LIAM: Right. 
MATT: Would you probably move in to try and-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So you'd be about there by the time the translocation hits. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: That means we'd all be right around here. 
MATT: Kind of around this area. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. So you're still a wolf form. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Where do you see yourself around here? 
TRAVIS: Closer to you. 
MATT: Up here? 
TRAVIS: Actually, could I get on the other side of all that and be over there? Yeah. 
MATT: Over here? 
MATT: Sure. Put you about there. All right. Laudna. 
MARISHA: I would be, I mean, I feel like Team Infiltration would be together, so I would be with Imogen and Chetney, I imagine. 
MATT: All righty, so Imogen, Chetney. You'd probably be over here then. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MARISHA: Where is she? 
MATT: We'll find out shortly. 
LAURA: She's over there. I was thinking I would be over here. I wasn't going to stand next to Chet, so. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm where Laudna is. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll be back. 
TRAVIS: I've been staying with Orym, so you guys can be back. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Let's keep us, can we be back even a little further? 
MATT: I mean, you guys are traveling as a group. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's where we were. 
MATT: This wasn't a plan. 
MARISHA: That's great. 
MATT: I'm just gathering where you think you would be moving through. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So to that point now, we have, I think the rest of the team here. FCG, where would you be? 
SAM: Anywhere, Matt. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Put me wherever you want. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: ♪ Teacher's pet ♪ 
MARISHA: You fucking-- (laughter) 
MATT: Well, here, where would you two be? 
TALIESIN: I would be in-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh, you go first. 
MATT: Actually, no, you would be-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you. 
MATT: -- this mini right there. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! Look at it! 
LAURA: Oh, sexy! Look at that big Ashton! 
TRAVIS: That's fucking gorgeous! Look at that. 
LAURA: I did not know he was that big. 
TALIESIN: I think I would be inside the-- I would be inside the wall, I think inside this mound right here. 
MATT: Right here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh actually no, because we were, I would be inside the mound probably, right over there. 
MATT: I'll put you here 
TALIESIN: But I'm interior. 
MATT: You're inside of that at the moment, okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Might be a ring for that. 
MARISHA: ♪ All I know ♪ ♪ You're just a ♪ 
MATT: All right. Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Okay. Let's go-- 
TALIESIN: Damn, that mini. 
ASHLEY: You know what, I'll go on the--

ASHLEY: Hang on, I'll be in front of Ashton, but in between that wall and then those rocks over there. 
MATT: Here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
MATT: Okay. 
MATT: And FCG. 
SAM: Anywhere, Matt. 
LAURA: No, you tell him. 
MATT: Tell me a person you're near. 
SAM: I'm in the middle in the open right there. 
MATT: Here? 
ASHLEY: Great idea. 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: What are you doing? 
TALIESIN: With your six hit points. 
SAM: Doesn't matter! 
ASHLEY: Yes it does. 
SAM: We're going to move in a second. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: She's going to move first, though. 
SAM: She can move anywhere she wants. She can bamf anywhere, it doesn't matter! 
ASHLEY: Oh, I can put my-- 
MATT: To that point, please everyone-- 
SAM: Ooh, that's a cool move. 
MATT: Roll initiative. 
TRAVIS: Roll initiative! Ah! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

MARISHA: Come on, come on, come on. Give me something nice. Give me something. Be kind. Be kind, rewind. Yeah. I just have to do that.

TALIESIN: 13. 
ASHLEY: I got a 10. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Okay, so wait. Ash, Fearne. 
MATT: All right, 10 to five. 
SAM: I got a nine. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
MATT: Imogen, what you got? 
SAM: Now I wish I would've been somewhere else. 
LAURA: I got four. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
SAM: What'd you get? 
LAURA: Four. 
SAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
LAURA: My rage took over my body and I just froze. 
TRAVIS: (frozen stuttering) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Otohan. 
ASHLEY: Otohan. 
TRAVIS: Or what looks like Otohan. 
MATT: Has translocated in from the echo into her right there at that point, blades out, as you moved in to engage at that point, being the first to notice her. The round begins. Orym, you are up first with Laudna on deck. 
LIAM: Running towards that shadow that becomes her, I sort of fake right and then dive and roll under her legs behind her. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's really cute. 
LIAM: So straight through her, right, her position and I am immediately going to start going to town on the backpack on her back. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Mm. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
LAURA: He just starts humping it. 
TRAVIS: Way to remember-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- from the last time. 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. 
LIAM: Sure do. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Like a little dachshund, just-- (yipping) 
LIAM: It's a natural 20. (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Oh! It's a little moon! 
MATT: Nice! 
TRAVIS: Little moon! 
LIAM: We'll make it a disarming attack. 
ASHLEY: Yes you will. 
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes! 
TRAVIS: Take your time, chef, take your time. 
LIAM: Hex is up, so as I'm running forward, I pull up Hex-- 
MATT: That's your bonus action. 
LIAM: -- and little dark blooms start sprouting out of her shoulders. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Underneath, so, and this is going to be-- 
LAURA: Where's he going? 
LIAM: -- a disarming attack. So first the damage. Oh, and this is with the Ruidus glass, so it's a crit. 
MATT: It is. 
LIAM: It's already a crit. 
TRAVIS: It was already a crit. 
LIAM: It's a natural 20. But I have to roll, when should I roll to see if it shatters? At the end? 
TRAVIS: At the end. 
MATT: After the end of the attack. 
LIAM: Okay, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool. 
TRAVIS: They have a tendency to, you know, shatter. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: In your hand. 
LIAM: So this is plus one-- 
TALIESIN: What? 
TRAVIS: How dare. 
LIAM: Seven, eight, plus the Hex damage. 10 plus-- 
LAURA: Oh! I'm sorry. You had a hair. 
LIAM: -- the superiority die. 
LAURA: (forceful yank) 
LIAM: 19. 38 points of damage. 
LAURA: Yes! 
MATT: 38 points of damage. 
LIAM: On the backpack. 
TRAVIS: Come on, come on. 
LIAM: Then it's a 20 to roll to see if it shatters and it's a one to-- One to six. 10, it's still in one piece. I will keep slashing at that backpack. That is a 29 to hit. 20 to hit. 
LAURA: 18 is a crit. 
LIAM: Is a crit. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, with that weapon it is. 
LIAM: It is a crit. 
MATT: Yeah, and you rolled to see, and it didn't shatter. 
LIAM: It didn't shatter. So this one is also a crit. 
ASHLEY: Yes, nice catch. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Okay. Oh, she has to make a strength save, oh does the back-- I wanted to make it a disarming attack on the backpack to see if I could-- 
MATT: Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. 
LIAM: It doesn't work. 
MATT: This is strapped to her body. 
LIAM: Just the damage goes through. 
MATT: Disarming is knocking something out of somebody's hand. 
LIAM: Understood, understood. So one and four plus the Hex. That's five, plus four is nine. 
ASHLEY: Just cut the straps. 
LIAM: So that's 18 points of damage on the second hit on the backpack. 14, that is 25. 
MATT: 25-- 
LIAM: To hit. 
MATT: Does hit. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Wait, that was, shouldn't that be the one to make sure it doesn't shatter? 
MATT: Oh sorry. 
LIAM: We'll say that it didn't shatter. 
MATT: There you go. 
LIAM: I'm scared of Otohan. That is a 23 to hit. 
MATT: 23 does hit. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
MATT: Is this against the backpack as well. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: What's the lowest number that's hit? 
MATT: 23 would miss, actually. 
LIAM: To miss the backpack? 
MATT: Correct. 
SAM: He's been in the 20s. 
LIAM: 22, 23, but it's a plus one from the sword that gets me to 24. Does that hit? 
MATT: 25 is the AC for the backpack. 
LIAM: Then it misses. 
MATT: Because you're focusing on one particular area. 
LIAM: Then that misses. 
MATT: Now mind you, the backpack has been slightly reinforced since the last time you were there. Since the last time you fought, you went for the backpack heavily. But it's taken a few hits. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay, so then I did bonus to Hex, disadvantage on strength checks from Hex. 
MATT: Got it. Okay. 
LIAM: Then I will swing back-- You know what, I will flank, get into flanking position opposite Chet. So I'll trail around her backside to set the wolf up. 
MATT: Over this way? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: And that's it. Now I'm done. Thank you, next. 
MATT: All righty, no worries. All right, finishing your go, Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: ♪ Thank you ♪ 
MARISHA and SAM: ♪ Next ♪ 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I am-- So you Hexed her with strength? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Actually, at the end of your turn, she's going to use a legendary action-- 
LAURA: (groans) 
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: -- to go ahead-- 
TRAVIS: And kill everyone. 
LAURA: Goodbye. 
MATT: She's going to use two actions, two legendary actions to use Telekinetic Control. I need you to make a strength saving throw for me. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: No problem. 
TRAVIS: Telekinetic Control. 
LIAM: That's a one, which I'll reroll. 
LAURA: Oh my god. Thank god. 
LIAM: That's a one, which I'll reroll. 
MATT: Can you reroll once? 
LIAM: I will use Indomitable. Indominat-able. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Sure I said that wrong. That is now-- 
TRAVIS: Two ones. 
LIAM: Also crap. That is 17. 
MATT: 17. That does not make it. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: As you shift behind her, she looks over her shoulder and raises her hand with the blade in it. As she does, you feel your body, (unwilling rise), lift off the ground and she throws you 30 feet this way. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Actually, she's going to throw you 30 feet this way. 
LAURA: No! 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: She, (forceful whoosh), throws you down the hallway. You going to tumble and land on your feet. 
LIAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: But it knocks you out of position. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: She used two legendary actions. 
MATT: That's two actions. Laudna, now it's your turn. 
SAM: That's not that bad. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: You can move 30 feet. 
TALIESIN: It's smart is what it is. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's so fucking smart. 
MARISHA: The rage from this bitch, this bitch! You see my sternum start to split open and I skitter backwards as the force of a hell hound leaps from my chest, knocking me backwards as the rage-- 
TRAVIS: Awesome. 
MARISHA: -- fucking explodes. He goes right towards her. 
MATT: (snarling) 
MARISHA: Get me where, get him on the side to flank her. 
TRAVIS: Get him, get him. 
MARISHA: Get him, get him. 
LIAM: ♪ Who let the Lauds out ♪ 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: ♪ Who, who, who, who, who ♪ 
SAM: Does he have a name? 
TALIESIN: (snarls) 
MARISHA: Would you like to name him? 
SAM: Caviar. 
MARISHA: Caviar! Perfect. 
ASHLEY: Carpaccio. 
MARISHA: Carpaccio. 
SAM: Carpaccio's good. 
LAURA: Carpaccio is, too. 
MARISHA: That is good, too. Carpaccio Caviar. That is his first and second name. Does he go first? Does he go now? He rolls his own initiative? I can't fucking remember. 
MATT: It should be on the ability. 
MARISHA: Okay, well. 
MATT: No, I don't know. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: I don't have all your rules memorized. I'm so sorry, that wasn't meant to be shade. I literally just, I don't recall. 
MARISHA: "At the start of the turn--" okay. 
TALIESIN: That's cold. 
MARISHA: "Summoning her is a bonus action, you spend the resource--" (mumbling ability description) "The hound uses dire wolf stats for the following." Fuck. "The hound--" "Roll initiative for the hound." 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: So he will go... (popping lips) 
ASHLEY: (popping lips) 
MARISHA: Yucky. What do I add? I add his dex, right? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: Seven. So he's-- 
MATT: Okay, so he's after FCG. 
SAM: Second to last. 
MARISHA: After FCG, okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Caviar. But that's fine. 
MATT: That's your action. 
MARISHA: That's my action, and then I am going to-- No, that's a bonus action to do my hell hound. 
MATT: Oh, got you. Then yeah, you start your action. 
MARISHA: Then as an action, I am going to Bane her. 
TRAVIS: Cheeseburger. 
LIAM: Jealous. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Are there any other of her shadow bitches? 
SAM: ♪ She Banes, she Banes ♪ 
MATT: You don't see any in the room. 
SAM: ♪ Oh baby ♪ 
SAM: ♪ She moves, she moves ♪ 
MARISHA: But she's most important anyway. I'm going to Bane her. She has disadvantage on this check because she is base to base with my hound. 
MATT: That's true. So with that, it's going to be a wisdom save, you said? Or no, it's-- 
MARISHA: It's a charisma. 
MATT: Charisma save. Okay. 
LIAM: I'm just staring at Ashton's-- 
MARISHA: With disadvantage. 
LIAM: -- literally rock hard abs. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: For Bane, that is going to be a 10. 
MARISHA: She is Baned. 
MATT: She is Baned. 
LIAM: Oh jeez! 
MATT: Just stacking these on over here. 
ASHLEY: It almost made it. 
MARISHA: So, she's Baned. Minus a d4 to all of her shit. 
MATT: All of her attack rolls and saving throws. (laughter) 
LAURA: There we go. 
MATT: Oh my goodness. 
LIAM: It bounced off his head and over. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I'm going to skitter back my movement as far as I can, maybe even get back to back with the wall so that I can't be flanked. 
TRAVIS: She was Baned? Okay. 
LIAM: Let's go team. Let's go. 
MARISHA: She was Baned. Can I be this way a little bit more? I mean, I'm going to-- 
MATT: Up here? 
MARISHA: Yeah. Just so I can continue to see her. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: I think that's my turn. 
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn. 
LIAM: Teamwork makes the dream work, let's fucking go! 
MATT: At the end of your turn, she's going to use her last legendary action to make an attack. 
ASHLEY: I knew you were-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: No, actually she's going to dash. Last legendary action to dash. She's going to move. Her speed-- 
SAM: I know. 
MARISHA: My boy gets-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Attack of opportunity at disadvantage. 
MARISHA: Why? 
MATT: Because of her dash ability as her legendary action, attacks of opportunity have disadvantage on her. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: Great, great, great, great. 
TRAVIS: This chick. 
MARISHA: That's bullshit. This is probably not going to hit, but-- 
TALIESIN: Eh. 
MARISHA: Sorry. Let me see. That's fine. Disadvantage? Yeah, that, no. No it doesn't. 
ASHLEY: Damn it. 
MARISHA: Let's not even talk about it. Eight. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (mockingly) Ow. 
MATT: She will, standing there as the attack's (parrying slice) deflected off to the side, as her head spins towards the wolf and goes, "Ah, let's see what you're made of." 
TRAVIS: Mm! 
MATT: Takes the dash to move in behind you there. 
SAM: Oh, is that where he is? 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: Wait, he's over there? 
MATT: Yep. Chet's over there. 
LAURA: Chet's over there, yeah. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Now it starts Otohan's turn. Legendary actions come back. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
TALIESIN: There we go. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MARISHA: So wait, that was after me. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: She's going to start with four melee attacks with Ishta, the Summit Blade, on you. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LIAM: Ishta the Summit Blade. 
MATT: Minus a d4 on each of these. 
LAURA: So cool. 
MATT: Because of Bane. Yep. 
SAM: Anytime a sword has a name-- 
LAURA: You're fucked. 
MATT: Okay, so that's going to be-- 
ASHLEY: Ishta. 
LAURA: ♪ Give it to you now ♪ 
MATT: 33 minus four, 29 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
SAM: Wait, minus four, though. What's that about? 
TRAVIS: 29 to hit? 
MATT: She Baned her. 
SAM: Oh, she Baned, she Baned. 
ASHLEY: ♪ She Baned, she Baned ♪ 
LAURA and MARISHA: She Baned. (laughing) 
SAM: ♪ She moved, she moved ♪ 
TRAVIS: That's a small cue that we should maybe run. I don't know. 
LAURA: 29. 
MARISHA: 29 with Bane? 
MATT: 29 to hit. 
LAURA: It was that, we were fucked before. 
MATT: She's going to spend a psi dice to add damage. 
SAM: A what? A psi dice? 
MARISHA: Psi dice? 
MATT: Yep. So with that-- 
LAURA: She's stronger. She's stronger because we're here. 
SAM: No, Psy, like the Korean rapper. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: What a throwback. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Wow. 
MATT: So-- 
LIAM: It's like the pandemic didn't even happen. 
SAM: ♪ Oppan Gangnam style ♪ 
MATT: That's a-- 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: Okay. 27 points of slashing damage on the first hit, halved because of your werewolf form. Wait, is yours against all damage or magical damage as well? 
TRAVIS: Let me check. 
MATT: Is it nonmagical? 
TRAVIS: It is-- 
MARISHA: Dealing with Ludinus. 
TRAVIS: Resilient, I have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silver weapons. 
MATT: You take the full damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: So that's going to be, yeah 20, (counting) 27 points of slashing damage to you. 
TRAVIS: On the second one? 
MATT: On the first strike. 
TRAVIS: On the first one, yeah. 
MATT: (slashing), into you that way. Her second attack against you, that's going to be 27 minus two, 25 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Definitely hits. 
MATT: Oh, also, I need you to make a strength saving throw, sorry. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: From the Psionic strike to see if you get knocked prone. 
TRAVIS: That's a 15. 
MATT: 15 fails, you get knocked prone to the ground. 
LIAM: Shite. 
TRAVIS: (whimpers) 
MATT: Which means the second attack is going to be at advantage. Rolling again. That's higher, but it still hits you. Okay. 
MARISHA: Minus d4. Minus d4 on all these. 
MATT: Yeah, still with the d4. 
LIAM: Yeah, she's got like plus 15 to hit or something. 
MATT: I rolled 16, 19. I've rolled pretty high the first couple hits. 
TRAVIS: I love it. 
TALIESIN: Let's see what I can do, let's see what-- 
MATT: She's not going to spend another psi die on this one because you're knocked prone. This one is going to be-- 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: Oh, another eight on a d8, 16 points of slashing damage to you. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Plus, seven points of force damage because you are prone, as the blade now just, (whooshing) it vibroblades through part of your shoulder. 
LAURA: Jesus Christ. 
TALIESIN: This arm is going to be a-- 
MATT: The third attack against you is going to be-- Oh, I rolled the wrong die. It's 17, so minus two, it's 16, 29 to hit. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm not even answering that. 
MATT: Okay. That's going to be, okay. 13 points of slashing damage, and nine points of force damage. 
TRAVIS: 13 and nine. 
MATT: (whooshing) 
TRAVIS: Holy god. 
MATT: And then the fourth attack on you. 
TRAVIS: Fourth! 
SAM: Ooh! 
LIAM: Yes, I remember this too well. 
MATT and LIAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: That's not as good a roll. That's going to be 23 minus two, 21. Does 21 hit? 
TRAVIS: 21 does hit. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
SAM: Damn it. 
MATT: So you take-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's going to be real rough. 
ASHLEY: We got to get out of here. 
MATT: Okay, that's going to be 13 points of slashing damage and 10 points of force damage. 
TRAVIS: You said 13 and 10? 
MATT: Yeah, so 23 total. 
MARISHA: They're checks, right? 
TRAVIS: (sighs) Oh my god, Matt. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Wow. 
ASHLEY: What are you at? 
LIAM: Just barely hanging on. 
ASHLEY: What?! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Deuces. (laughs) 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: Bonus action offhand strike. 
ASHLEY: What? 
MATT: With Scream Needle. 
TRAVIS: I'm sure there's-- 
LIAM, LAURA, SAM, and ASHLEY: Scream Needle?! 
MATT: That's the offhand weapon she has. 
TRAVIS: It's going to miss. It's going to miss. 
LIAM: Come on! 
TRAVIS: It's going to miss. 
MATT: Ishta the Summit Blade, Scream Needle. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: That's a bad roll! Okay. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: Does she yell out the name every time she uses a weapon? 
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Scream Needle! 
LIAM: Scream Needle! 
MATT: It's going to be 15 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Oh! It misses! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It misses. Holy shit! 
SAM: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: I almost got soloed in one round. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Bane! 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
MATT: Action surge. 
ALL: (uproar) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wait, what? 
LIAM: (screams) 
TRAVIS: Unhinged! 
TALIESIN: This is why we have to-- 
TRAVIS: You did tee off. 
TALIESIN: -- drop every fucking thing we have on this. 
TRAVIS: You did tee off. 
MATT: She's designed for this. 
LIAM: Woo! 
SAM: To kill. 
ASHLEY: I know, but still! 
MARISHA: She does assassin shit. Assassin shit. 
MATT: She took down Keyleth pretty much in one round using everything she had. 
ASHLEY: I know! 
LIAM: Woo! 
ASHLEY: What are we going to do? What are we going to do? 
MARISHA: Wait, action surge-- 
ASHLEY: We need to leave. 
MARISHA: Action surge she gets a whole full round? 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Does she have another three more fights. 
LIAM: It's a whole-- 
MATT: Four more attacks. 
LIAM: -- four more attacks. 
SAM: Maybe she won't spend-- 
MATT: That's going to be 20 minus one. 19 to hit? 
SAM: -- them on Chetney. 
LIAM: She's about to kill this motherfucker. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: That'll do it. 
LIAM: She's going to kill him. 
TRAVIS: But she can keep going, if she wanted to. 
LAURA: Double, full kill kill? 
ASHLEY: He's going to be unconscious. 
LIAM: She's going to put him under and then she's going to-- 
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! 
TRAVIS: We'll see, we'll see, we'll see. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs! 
MATT: Silvery Barbs. Okay, rerolling. 
TRAVIS: Is that only for a natural 20s? 
SAM: That's desperate. 
MATT: It was a higher roll. 
MARISHA: Oh, fucking tits! 
MATT: So it still hits. That's okay. So mark your spell slot. 
TALIESIN: It was worth it. 
MARISHA: Damn it! 
TALIESIN: It was worth it. 
LIAM: This is not as enjoyable as that. 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. Worth it, worth it. 
MATT: So with that, that is going to be, plus eight, 14 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: Who's got a lot of points? 
TRAVIS: I'm out. 
MATT: And seven-- 
TALIESIN: Does the d4 count-- 
TRAVIS: I'm out. 
TALIESIN: -- to a Silvery Barbs roll? 
MATT: You slam unconscious-- 
TALIESIN: Never mind. 
MATT: -- to the ground. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Second attack, she's coming after you. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Since you're right there. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
MATT: With advantage. 
LIAM: Jeez! 
MATT: Auto-crit. 
TRAVIS: Is that three death saves? 
MATT: Two death saves on you. 
TRAVIS: Two death saves. 
LIAM: (gasps) 
SAM: Ooh lord. 
MATT: That's two attacks. 
TRAVIS: Boom, boom! 
SAM: Oh wait, do I-- I don't-- 
MATT: Third strike on you. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: Bullshit. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what? 
LAURA: (muffled scream) 
ASHLEY: What? 
TALIESIN: Anybody got anything? 
MARISHA: I mean-- 
LAURA: No! 
MARISHA: I don't know, I just did. 
LAURA: We can't do anything! We don't have any-- 
TRAVIS: You can't do anything. 
ASHLEY: Can I put a Shield on him? 
LIAM: No, unfortunately not. 
LAURA: We don't have-- 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
MATT: So Chetney-- 
TALIESIN: Anybody have, well-- 
ASHLEY: Wait! 
MARISHA: You got to be shitting me. 
LIAM: What happened? What happened? 
MATT: Chetney-- 
ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: As she darts up and like a whirling blender of blades and fury and frustration, yet still a grin of avarice-- 
SAM: (whispered) It doesn't work! 
LAURA: (whispered) It does-- 
MATT: -- and delight on her murderous smile, she just cuts you from end to end 'til you're almost spinning in place. The pain rocks you. You fall to the ground. She's just carving into you. You all hear the instinctual yelping of the wolf of Chetney-- 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- as she carves through you twice and looks over at Imogen once more. 
MARISHA: Why? 
MATT: "Familiar?" And drives the blade into your chest. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
MATT: What are your last words? 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
SAM: Oh, wait, what? 
TRAVIS: The wolf form drops, so little Chetney's there looking at this blade in his chest, and he'll say: For 400 years (grunts) I looked up at the moon. Not a bad place to go. 
LAURA, MARISHA, and LIAM: (sobs) 
MATT: You revert back to small Chetney. 
SAM: Wha-- Wha-- 
LIAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: I got soloed in one round! (laughs) 
SAM: We haven't gone yet! 
MATT: She's going to move. 
MARISHA: We can't get out. 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20. 
MARISHA: We can't run. 
MATT: 25, 30, 35, 40. 
ASHLEY: We got to take her out. We can't keep doing this. 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
TRAVIS: You've all got to get the fuck-- 
MARISHA: We can't run. She-- 
MATT: And is going to go after you, Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: She's going to chase us up the-- 
MARISHA: Wait, she's still going? 
MATT: With her last attack. 
TRAVIS: I know. I don't know. Can you collapse it on her? 
MATT: That's going to be, (mumbled math) 30 minus three, 27 to hit. She's going to use another Psionic-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: -- power die on this one. That's going to deal, okay, six plus-- That's going to be 14 points of slashing damage to you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: As well as eight points of force damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So that's 24 damage to you total. (massive slash) Just darts around the corner, (graceful run) full on Naruto run, and then carves into you there. 
MARISHA: She went through two legendary actions. 
MATT: I need you to make a strength saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: You're rolling d4s against-- 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
MARISHA: Not that it fucking matters. 
MATT: I am. She's rolled pretty well, and she's rolled pretty shitty a couple times, but barely got on the cusp of it. 
TRAVIS: I picked the wrong place to put myself on the map. 
MATT: You really did. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, she is gnarly! 
ASHLEY: 10. 
MATT: 10. You fall prone to the ground. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: As she sweeps the leg out from under you and the blade carves up the back of your calf and you feel the burning pain as you hit the ground. She stands above you-- 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MATT: -- blades at the ready, and is now looking back at Imogen and Laudna and is eyeing everyone. You see that on the back of her backpack, (vibrating energy) beginning to power up a bit. That finishes her turn. 
MARISHA: Bitch, you better go Super Saiyan. 
MATT: Chetney, you're off the-- 
MARISHA: Fucking Super Saiyan. 
ASHLEY: It's happening. 
MATT: Ashton, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
TALIESIN: (exhales sharply) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) I'm going to-- 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Wait, you still have one? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to head down and come up right the fuck-- 
LAURA: No, he's dead. 
TALIESIN: -- in front of that fucking bitch. 
TRAVIS: I tried to roll them just to see. 
LAURA: He is gone. 
MARISHA: All three death saving throws. 
TALIESIN: Technically speaking, I was going to say, technically speaking that-- 
LAURA: He's dead. We don't have Revivify. 
TALIESIN: -- doesn't count as flanking because she's down on the ground, right? 
SAM: I might be able to. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: No, just right in front of her. 
SAM: Does it work? 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Well, right between her and Fearne. 
MARISHA: She can run! 
MATT: Okay, right there? 
MARISHA: She can go 150 feet! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can't fit where I'm coming up from, but that's okay because I'm going to fucking hit her and she's going to go flying. 
SAM: I never chose a new spell. 
MATT: (laughs) Go for it. 
TALIESIN: First I'm going to roll my rage. 
MATT: As you emerge from the wall, and as you do, you see her look genuinely surprised. She did not think you were in the wall and is like, "Huh?" and pulls back for a second seeing this massive boulder of a man (bursts) out of the stone towards her. 
TRAVIS: That mini is ridiculous, by the way. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: I'm so happy how it turned out. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to come up-- 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Come up and take a swing. 
MARISHA: I know. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Let's see where we go. I'm sorry, got off my-- 
ASHLEY: Don't fucking leave the table right now. 
MARISHA: Oh, oh, it's the worst! 
ASHLEY: Don't you dare. 
LAURA: Don't you do it! 
ASHLEY: Don't. Don't! 
MARISHA: It's the worst! You might be back. You might be back. 
TRAVIS: I had a wedgie. 
SAM: He just wants to eat his burger. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'm glad I got the burger. 
MARISHA: He wants to eat his burger. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: 29 to hit. 
LIAM: Oh my god, I'm so sad. I'm so-- (munching) 
ASHLEY: Let's go. 
SAM: Wait, did you do something? 
TALIESIN: I'm fighting! 
ASHLEY: He hit her. He hit her. He's fighting. 
TALIESIN: 29 to hit. I'm going to look right. Gosh, you've got a punchable fucking face. That's going to be a-- 
ASHLEY: Nice, nice. 
TALIESIN: That's going to be nine, because my strength is up, that's 14, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 23 points of damage. 
MATT: 23 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: And I'm knocking her one square back. 
MATT: (crash) She gets slammed and skids on the ground, her feet digging into the dirt. 
LAURA: Or by a creature. It's just an ability check. It's not like-- 
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to also trigger Density Well with this so make a strength saving throw. 
MATT: Okay. Minus a d4. 
TALIESIN: Minus a d4. 
MATT: That is going to be-- 
MARISHA: Her dope sword. 
MATT: She rolled a natural 18. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: So that's going to be a 27 minus one, 26. 
TALIESIN: Oh well. Fuck it. It was worth a shot. 
MATT: It was worth a shot. She's rolling really good. 
TALIESIN: Now, I'm going to roll to the-- So is that just a platform there? 
MATT: This up here is a bit of rock platform, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to roll to one side of it. I don't even really have to move around it, and I'm going to slam it and knock it onto that fucker. 
SAM: I don't know. 
MATT: You're going to slam the platform onto her? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to take the whole thing down in that direction. 
MATT: Okay, go for it. Go ahead and roll for an attack on the platform. 
MARISHA: Maybe that. Maybe try it. Maybe try it. 
LAURA: Try for it? 
TALIESIN: 28. 
MARISHA: I don't know. I don't know. 
MATT: 28 hits. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: On a platform, definitely. 
TALIESIN: So that's-- Rerolling that one. 
TRAVIS: No reactions, right? 
TALIESIN: Better. That's 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 40 points of damage. 
MATT: 40 points of damage to the wall. (pounding) You slam into it and it tumbles off. She's going to try and make a dex saving throw. Natural 20, so she manages to take half damage from it. The platform does crumble onto her, which doesn't knock her prone, but it definitely-- Let's see, because she did succeed. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: That's cool. 
MATT: I'll say this pushes her out of the way. 
MARISHA: Do you have disarming attacks? 
MATT: I'll say it knocks her prone, but she takes only half the damage of the crumble. 
SAM: If you're prone, can you do opportunity attacks? 
TALIESIN: If you're prone, that means you have advantage on-- 
MATT: People have advantage against hitting you. 
SAM: I know, but if I moved out of her range, can she take an opportunity attack if she's prone? 
TALIESIN: That's a good question. 
MATT: I think prone you still can. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: But her attacks are at disadvantage. 
LIAM: I don't have an Action Surge. 
LAURA: So she wouldn't be able to do it again either? 
MATT: She's moved out over this way. 
LIAM: Who knows? She's got-- 
MATT: I mean, I would say she moved out of the way. 
SAM: No, that's fine. 
MATT: She'd probably be five feet away from you still. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, you don't have your action. 
LIAM: No. 
TALIESIN: Oh, interesting. 
LIAM: Got it out in time. 
TALIESIN: I don't think I even have to see her to make this work. 
MATT: Correct, so at disadvantage on attack rolls. Attacks against her. She can still take opportunity attacks, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Then, because I barely moved, I'm going to try and get into that wall. I'm going to run straight into that. 
MATT: Just going to move this out of the way. This is now just a boulder. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Chetney's dead. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a breath. I'm going to move into the wall behind her, so then she's within a 15-foot radius of me because the other thing that happens is for some reason, I am black and white. Oh, no, all the way across. 
SAM: Does Revivifying even work? 
TALIESIN: Behind her. 
MATT: Right. Over here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I wish I had a-- Next to the dog. 
SAM: It hasn't in months. 
MATT: Okay, so-- 
TALIESIN: So that's, I still have-- Am I within 15 feet of her? 
LAURA: It might work here. 
MARISHA: We're on the moon. 
MATT: Of who? 
TALIESIN: Of Otohan. 
MATT: Otohan? You would be, here you would be about 15 feet. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going to be just underneath it. I'm going to be just far enough in where it's going to be very hard to hit me. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. 
TALIESIN: But I'm still in that silver tone. The rocks are shaking and gravel is moving towards me. 
MATT: Okay, end of your turn, she's going to use a legendary action to dash. 
TALIESIN: Does gravity work-- 
TRAVIS: Good lord. 
TALIESIN: -- on the legendary action and only starting her turn? 
MATT: Start of her turn it happens. 
TALIESIN: So she can get out of my Gravity Well. 
LIAM: If you do this, it's going to be a very sad-- 
MATT: She probably can, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: It's the start of her turn is when it triggers. 
TALIESIN: Oh fuck. 
MATT: She makes a dash, which is half her movement to get up, which puts her here. 
TALIESIN: Shit. Oh well, it was a good plan. 
MARISHA: It was awesome. 
TRAVIS: It was a great plan. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
MARISHA: It's half her movement, which is still something. 
MATT: She's going to get up. Half her movement as she "(grunts)" pulls away from the rocks there. Looks over towards you, Imogen, and says-- 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: "I gather we've had enough powerful Ruidusborn to accomplish our task. The loss of one candidate will not leave Ludinus too crestfallen." She's going to dash towards you. 
MARISHA: Call your mom! Call Mom! Mom, come pick me up. Mom, I'm too drunk. 
MATT: 20 feet gets her right into melee with you. 
ASHLEY: Mom, I drank by accident. 
MATT: And that's it there. 
MARISHA: Mom, this party's not fun anymore. 
MATT: Fearne, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
TRAVIS: Candidate? 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
LAURA: She used a legendary action to move? 
MATT: She has a dash ability, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: So on the ground-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: -- I see Chet, and as I let out just a primal scream, as I scream a little bit of fire comes out and I turn into a complete fire creature. (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Activate the Spark of Rau'shan! 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
LIAM: Let's fucking go! 
ASHLEY: Look at that bitch! Okay. 
TRAVIS: Whoa, yeah! Here we go! 
LIAM: You. The bitch is you. You are that bitch. 
ASHLEY: I am that bitch! 
MATT: (flames roaring) 
MARISHA: 100%. 
ASHLEY: I am that bitch! 
MARISHA: That bitch. 
ASHLEY: All right, so. I am going to-- 
MATT: So double checking what the activation on that is. Is it a bonus action or an action? 
ASHLEY: No, it's an action, so-- 
MATT: Okay, yeah. So you still have your bonus action, though. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, so-- 
TALIESIN: You have a move. 
ASHLEY: Say again? 
TALIESIN: You have a move. 
ASHLEY: Yes, and I have a move, so-- 
TALIESIN: I don't think you had to get up because you're flying. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, mm-hmm. 
MATT: That's true, you have a-- That gives you a hover. 
MARISHA: She bamfs out like five more-- 
MATT: In that form, what's it say? 
ASHLEY: Well, difficult terrain doesn't slow your movement. 
LIAM: 20, 25, 30. 
ASHLEY: Hang on. 
MATT: Let me see here. 
MARISHA: Do we resist it? 
MATT: Look it up here. 
ASHLEY: I don't think I do, but-- 
MATT: No, you do not, so-- 
TALIESIN: Oh well, no. Sorry. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah, so yeah. 
ASHLEY: No, it's fine-- 
MATT: So it still takes half her movement to get up off of prone. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: But you-- (flames roaring) 
LIAM: I'm dexy. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: Feeling the power of the fire Titans coursing through your body. 
ASHLEY: Yes, and I would like to-- 
MARISHA: Like dexy. 
LIAM: She could beat them. 
ASHLEY: Stalk behind her, and get right behind her. 
MATT: All right. What's your movement speed? 
ASHLEY: So that we're flanking her, Imo and, Imogen and I. 
LAURA: (laughs) Imo. 
MATT: What's your movement speed? It's 35, right? 
ASHLEY: 35, sorry. 
SAM: If her strength is-- 
MATT: Five, 10, 15. Yeah, I'll let you get up there with 20, it's about half. 15 to 20's half. I'll let you do that. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So as you (flame roars) flame on and then approach from behind. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay. Then-- 
MARISHA: She's already got Bane. 
ASHLEY: God, I think that's all I can do! 
TALIESIN: You have any bonus action shit? 
ASHLEY: I just, I mean, I have-- I have Cunning Action with dash. It doesn't use your action. I can't really do anything. 
TALIESIN: Some Wildfire Spirit. 
ASHLEY: Those are all out. 
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah. Shit. 
ASHLEY: Okay. That's it. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: So yeah, I want us to flank so we're both-- 
MATT: You got it. FCG, it's your turn. 
LIAM: Can I interrupt with a quick question? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: With all the amount of time that I've watched this bitch carve me up and kill my friends does Otohan seem like more of a-- Is she buff or is she more lithe to my eye with Know Your Enemy? 
MATT: She is lithe. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: As she moves, there is a preternatural quickness. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: There are bursts of Psionic flashes not unlike what you've seen Imogen exhibit in moments of transformation, but channeled not magically, martially. 
LIAM: Martially, but I'm not reading size, right? 
MATT: No, she's lithe and quick, but she is definitively a very, very powerful Exaltant warrior. 
LIAM: Okay, thank you. 
MARISHA: He said "preternatural," which is monk shit. I wonder if she's a monk. 
LAURA: Oh shit, monk? 
MATT: Preternatural is a term that means better than natural. 
MARISHA: I know, but also was a monk ability that I played for three years. Shut up! 
MATT: That's true. No, fair enough. That's valid. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Let me read into this incorrectly! 
MATT: No, you're right. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: She's reading. 
MATT: You're all good. You're all good. 
MARISHA: Maybe she's not a monk. 
SAM: Matthew. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: In full transparency, I have not prepared Revivify. However, we did level up and I never chose a 7th-level spell slot. Would you allow me to choose Revivify as my 7th-level spell? For my extra spell. 
MATT: Did you intentionally prepare your spells for this mission? 
SAM: For the mission, yes. 
MATT: Yeah. It's not so much you're learning a new spell. It's setting a spell slot at the beginning. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
MATT: I'll allow it. 
SAM: You'll allow it? After that? 
MATT: I'll allow it. 
MARISHA: ♪ Teacher's pet ♪ 
MATT: I'll allow it in the sense that you do not have a 7th-level slot for this fight. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: If you want to make that sacrifice. 
SAM: I will gladly make that sacrifice. Okay. 
LAURA: What's the-- Are there any better 7th-level spells? 
SAM: There's tons, but Chetney's dead. 
LAURA: No, I mean like bring them back, bring back a person 7th-level spells. 
SAM: There's Resurrection, but it takes an hour, and I don't know if we're going to-- 
LIAM: What level is that? 
SAM: Seven. 
LIAM: Seven. 
SAM: Well, it will hardly matter if we all go down anyway. 
TRAVIS: (off-screen) Oh, my son. 
LIAM: Follow your heart. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LAURA: Follow your heart. 
ASHLEY: Oh, my son. 
SAM: We have to win and carry him out of here. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Do you have any more french fries? 
MATT: Up to you. 
SAM: I also don't know if Revivify even works. 
LAURA: I don't either. 
SAM: But fuck it, let's go try it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: So I will move over to him. 
MARISHA: They get sucked in the wall? 
LAURA: (gasps) Did it get in there? 
SAM: It got somewhere. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
SAM: It's on the floor. We'll eat it still. We're disgusting people. 
LIAM: We're garbage people. 
TALIESIN: I will wreck-- 
SAM: I will move over to Chetney. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Keep away. 
MARISHA: Backpack. Wall. 
SAM: I have no idea if this is going to work, but we got to take a shot. Let me make sure I've got what I need. Spells, spells, spells-- 
ASHLEY: Fuck! 
SAM: Spells. Where is it? (sighs) Spells, spells. 
MARISHA: I just went pee and I have to pee again. I know I don't have to pee. I know it's just-- 
TRAVIS: That's the poop talking. 
MARISHA: I'm tingly, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, it's just-- Then you go sit and it's like-- 
SAM: Yes, I do have the diamonds. Okay. I will go over to Chetney. 
LIAM: Letters, Imogen. 
SAM: And touch him. 
MARISHA: I don't-- I know I can go and be like-- 
SAM: And say-- 
MARISHA: Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. 
SAM: Chetney, you haven't become a legend yet. We need you one more. We need you to make more toys. (chortles) 
SAM: Chetney Claus lives. 
MARISHA: The world needs Chetney Claus. 
LIAM: Think of the children. 
SAM: I will touch him with Revivify. Maybe it'll work. Maybe it won't. 
MATT: Okay. Standing over the small, elder form of Chetney on the ground, pool of blood seeping into the nearby rock, a gentle peace over his face, you think of all the children that would be sad at this moment and beseech the Changebringer, if she can reach any of her power beyond this bridge to put it into this moment to save your friend. Go ahead and roll a d10 and add your spell modifier to it. 
LIAM: Come on, baby! 
SAM: d10. 
LIAM: Come on. 
MATT: Sorry. No, sorry. d20. d20 and add your spell modifier, my bad. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Trying to hit a DC on this Revivify check. 
SAM: Oh, that was a d8. 18 plus spell modifier is four. 22 
MATT: The DC was 10. 
LAURA: Oh! Oh! 
MATT: As (gasps) air comes into your lungs. The DC is now 11 for any future resurrection. Each time you die, it goes up. 
LIAM: Right. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
LAURA: Oh my god! It worked, though! 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
MARISHA: It worked! It works on the moon! 
LAURA: It worked on the moon! 
MARISHA: It worked on the moon! 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: That's the only one we got, so no one else can get bodied! 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
SAM: I'm out of diamonds. 
LAURA: Oh god, it takes a diamond. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: All right. Stay up. 
MARISHA: It's a 5th-level spell slot. 
TALIESIN: It's not a cheap spell. 
TRAVIS: (joyless laugh) 
LIAM: Hopefully, we-- 
TRAVIS: Is it one hit point? 
LIAM: -- spent her one action surge. 
MARISHA: Yeah, how many? 
SAM: One hit point. 
MARISHA: One hit point. 
LIAM: Hopefully. 
MATT: One hit point. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LIAM: Hopefully she does not have another action surge. 
SAM: Who's up next after me? 
LAURA: Me. 
MARISHA: Bish, you better pretend to be dead! 
MATT: That was your action. That was your movement. 
MARISHA: Just keep playing dead. 
MATT: You still have 15 feet of movement, if you wanted. 
SAM: I will-- 
LIAM: One hit point? Cool. 
SAM: Move back into the open a little bit more. 
MATT: Okay. About there? 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Bonus action. Jesus Christ! Bonus action. (groans) Jesus! She's going to attack you. She's going to hit every time, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Giving you an extra two on your AC isn't going to do shit. 
LIAM: She's going to hit nine out of 10 times. 
LAURA: It'll get me to 18. That's better than nothing, but. (sighs) 
LIAM: She'll hit any one of us nine out of 10 times. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. You don't roll-- Shit! Shit! 
TALIESIN: Sorry I fucking vanished. I'll be back. 
SAM: What would help here? Nothing. 
MARISHA: Can you lock her down? Can you just fucking-- 
SAM: As a bonus action? 
MARISHA: Oh, it's a bonus action? 
SAM: I will give you a Shield of Help! You get a plus two to your AC. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: That's all I got. 
MARISHA: That's good! That's good! 
MATT: Is that a-- 
SAM: Oh, it's a spell. 
MATT: Spell. Yeah. 
SAM: I can't do it. Okay, then I'll give you a Bonded Blessing. You get a d6 to use when you want it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. That finishes FCG's go. 
ASHLEY: (sneezes) 
TALIESIN: Bless you. 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
MATT: It's now your beast's turn. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: Oh my god! Caviar! 
LAURA: Beast boy! 
MARISHA: Carpacci. 
LAURA: Carpaccio! 
MARISHA: Carpaccio! 
TRAVIS: One hit point in this fucking cave. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Carpaccio! 
TRAVIS: One hit point? 
MARISHA: Okay. Well, he automatically, in a straight line, moves towards her, ignoring. 
MATT: How far does he move? 
MARISHA: He has a speed of 50, baby! 
MATT: (whooshes) Without issue catches up to her. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Like a minefield of wonder. 
MARISHA: So he is base to base. He attacks her. He does a little bitey bite. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay. 19? 
MATT: 19 misses. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: He goes and bites towards her and she looks over her shoulder and flexes her shoulders, and you watches a psionic shield (whooshes) seems to deflect it. 
MARISHA: So she's for sure 20 plus. Okay. 
LAURA: Cool. 
MARISHA: Yeah. That's-- Yeah. 
MATT: That finishes his turn? 
MARISHA: The wolf does have pack tactics, so he counts. 
MATT: So he does get advantage on his attack rolls when-- 
MARISHA: Which he is, with Imogen. 
LAURA: He is! 
MATT: Yeah. So he would get another attack. Yeah. Or another roll towards it. 
MARISHA: 14 up. 14 up. No. 
LAURA: No. 
MARISHA: Negative. 
MATT: But good to know for future stuff. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: All right. That finishes your go. All right, Imogen. Actually, at the end of his turn, she's going to use another-- 
LAURA: Fuck! 
MATT: -- legendary action to use an attack. Right as you are focusing on that, she (whooshes) darts up to you, deflects the sword, and is going to take the blade and take a heavy swing towards your chest and neck. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: Fuck, fuck fuck! 
MARISHA: I don't have any reactions. I don't have a reaction. 
MATT: That's going to be 24 minus three. 21 to hit? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. She's going to spend-- 
MARISHA: Minus four. 
MATT: I took it away. I'm rolling the d4 each time. I'm going to add a Psionic die to this. That's going to be-- 
LAURA: I'm resistant to psychic damage. 
MATT: Right. That's good to know. So with this, it's going to be two plus, so it's 10 points of slashing damage to you and 14 points of force damage. 
LIAM: Halved to seven. 
LAURA: No, force damage. 
LIAM: Oh, force. 
LAURA: That's not psychic damage. 
MATT: (whooshes) I need you to make a strength saving throw for me. 
LAURA: Strength saving. 
LIAM: Ugh! 
LAURA: Oh, a natural two! 
MATT: Actually, she's going to not knock you prone, she's going to push you 10 feet. No, actually, it's top of your turn. She's going to knock you prone. 
MARISHA and SAM: (groan) 
MATT: All right. (whooshes) Sweeps the ground up from under you. As you fall to the ground and she turns the blade around in her hand, like she's ready to come down upon you next time. 
LIAM: Fuck a duck! 
MATT: Now, it's your turn. (sighing) 
LAURA: From the ground. (shouts) 
LIAM: Get up, girl! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: (sighs) (groans) My eyes are going to flash white. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
LAURA: I'm going to use Telekinesis and I'm going to try to grab her backpack and pull it up and away. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: It's an item that's worn by her. Now, I have a thought here. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I'm going to try to pull it away from her, but if I can't get it away from her, it's attached to her, I want to pull the whole thing. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: The goal is to yank it off of her, though. 
MATT: Okay. We'll start with a-- 
LAURA: It's a strength check for an item worn or carried. 
MATT: Correct, which she has disadvantage on because of your Hex. 
LAURA: Exactly. 
MARISHA: And minus four. 
MATT: And minus four for the Bane. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Okay. So it's worn. I guess, here's my question. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Because you have to choose. Are you going to pull her away with it or are you going to try and pull it from her? Because it's one or the other in this. One's either you're trying to pull a wedge between her and it or you're trying to pull her with it. 
LAURA: What's broke? 
TRAVIS: The backpack. 
MARISHA: Pull it off. 
LAURA: Pull it off of her? 
LIAM: Get it off. Yeah, get it off. 
LAURA: Try and pull it off of her. 
TRAVIS: You roll at disadvantage. 
MATT: I do. 
LIAM: Throw it into the wall. 
TRAVIS: Because she committed fratricide. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Very sweet girl. 
MATT: (laughs) First roll was a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit! 
MATT: The second one is going to be-- 
LAURA: Minus four! 
MATT: I know. I rolled a two on a d4. It's not a saving throw, so that's going to be a 14. 
LAURA: 19. (cheering) 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! 
MATT: So-- 
TRAVIS: Uncharted territory. 
MATT: As you focus, are you standing up or are you staying on the ground? 
LAURA: I will stand up in a minute after I do that. 
MATT: Okay. 
MATT: As you focus angrily, your eyes flashing, the horrible memory of the last true throw down, the murderous glee in her eyes, you concentrate, and as you try and pull between her and this pack, you hear (cracking) and you see that look on her face go, and she looks down and focuses on you angrily as the backpack (whooshes) goes flying off and-- 
LAURA: I'm going to slam it into the ceiling. 
MATT: (thumping) It hits the ceiling and falls the ground. You see her. "(growls)" 
LAURA: And push it towards Ashton. 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
MATT: Okay. So it (crashing) hits the ground over there. 
LAURA: Yeah. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Nice, nice, nice, nice! 
MATT: You got it. "Oh, you bitch!" 
SAM: Oh god! 
MATT: You want to stay on the ground? 
LAURA: For my bonus action-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Get wrecked. 
LAURA: I am going to Quicken a spell-- 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
LAURA: I'm going to-- Hmm. I'm going to stand up. I'm going to get up on my knees first, and I'm going to grab her hand and cast Shocking Grasp. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
MATT: As you go casting the spell, as the backpack is torn off of her, you see these shadow echoes trying to apparate, beginning to appear. And as the bag gets pulled from her back, they all (slurps) vanish. 
LAURA: Oh. What's the matter? 
MATT: "(growls)" 
LAURA: Feeling a little weak? 
MATT: Is it a saving throw for Shocking Grasp? 
LAURA: No, it's an attack. 
MATT: All right, go ahead. 
LAURA: Do I get advantage because I'm flanking? Is that how that works? 
MATT: You have to stand up to flank. 
LAURA: Okay, well I'm standing up. 
MATT: There's disadvantage-- Okay, so you stand up, meeting her gaze as you're charging up your Shocking Grasp. Because you are flanking with Fearne, you have an advantage on the attack roll. 
ASHLEY: That's right. That's right! 
MARISHA: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
LAURA: 29. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: 29 hits. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Get her! Get her! 
SAM: (buzzes) 
ASHLEY: Get her, bitch! Get her! 
MATT: Can't use any of her Echo or Incarnation abilities now. 
LAURA: Ha-ha, ha-ha ha, ha! 
LIAM: That's a shame. 
ASHLEY: How high a ridge, I could not tell. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: 14! 
MATT: 14 points of damage? All righty. (whooshes) "(groans)" Is that all you got? 
LAURA: (laughs) Kind of. 
SAM: Yes. (laughter) 
MARISHA: For now. 
LAURA: I can't back away. She'll get a hit on me, but it might be smart. She's going to catch me anyway. I'm going to go down on this next turn, y'all. Okay. That's it. That's all I got. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Maybe not. 
MATT: That finishes your turn. 
SAM: Maybe she'll go for her backpack. Maybe she won't go for you. 
MARISHA: Yeah, she might want her backpack. 
MATT: Okay, she's going to hold onto the legendary action. Orym, you're up. 
LIAM: So Orym runs forward as far as he can with his movement, right? Sees Chetney? 
MATT: 30. 
LIAM: 30s. 
LAURA: You see the backpack's on the ground. 
LIAM: Yeah. Stops in his tracks. Pops. Blooms start to grow out on his shoulders and he vanishes from view. Misty Step. Can I make it to here? 
LAURA: I should've-- 
MATT: Misty Step is 30 feet? 
LAURA: No, I can't do it. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: I can't do it. It's a double spell. 
MATT: No, that's 30 right there. 
LIAM: Can I make it under Otohan's feet? 
MATT: You can make it here, is the closest you can get to Otohan. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Which is in melee. 
LIAM: Cool. Soon as I'm there, Bait and Switch. I move Imogen to where I am and move me to her spot. She gets an additional-- Shield's up. You get an additional five to your AC. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LIAM: I start swinging away. And I'm in flanking with Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Yes, you are! 
LIAM: Natural 20. (shouting) 
ASHLEY: Yes! Get it! 
TRAVIS: My god! It is! 
MATT: Damn! 
TRAVIS: Look at that little fucking move! 
LIAM: With the blade-- 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: With the blade-- 
SAM: All sorts of damage. 
ASHLEY: Get it, get it, get it, get it! 
LIAM: Okay, and it's still hexing. So three plus five is eight plus three is 11. So 22, 23 points of damage. 
MATT: 23 points of damage. 
LIAM: On the first. I have to see if it shatters. Natural 20 on the roll to see if it shatters. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Save that. Here comes the-- 
MATT: Enough 20s, bro. 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
LIAM: That is a 27, 28 to hit. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You're rolling them with advantage-- 
LIAM: Because I'm flanking. 
MATT: Oh yeah! With her. Yeah, you are. Yeah. 
MARISHA: And my dog. (laughter) 
LIAM: 14 points of damage. 
LAURA: And there's a dog. 
MARISHA: Also, there's a dog. 
MATT: 14 points of damage. 
LIAM: That's a crit. I rolled a 18 and a 19. That's a crit. 
MATT: Ooh! 
LIAM: So that's-- 
MATT: This crit machine over here! 
LIAM: Eight. 
SAM: It's Critmas. 
LIAM: Is 14, 28 points of damage. 
MATT: 28 points damage. 
MATT: Going to use Protective-- 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: Going to use the Psi power to reduce the damage by-- 
SAM: (muttered) Gangnam Style. 
MATT: 12. 
LIAM: 12. So 28 minus 12. 
MATT: Yeah, it becomes 16. 
LIAM: 16. 
MATT: So as the hit comes in (whooshes) like a Psionic Shield, deflects part of the blow, but it still cuts through and gets her on the shoulder. 
LIAM: Because it's the Ruidus blade, it should be one point higher. So she takes one more point of damage. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: It did not shatter again. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Awesome. 
LIAM: Done. Hold my ground. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. Yes! 
TRAVIS: What an absolute monster! 
MATT: Got it. 
SAM: Beast. Beast mode. 
ASHLEY: Beast mode! 
MATT: All right. That finishes your go. Laudna, you're up. 
MARISHA: Okay. I'm so stressed! I've thought of 80 things to do in this time. 
LAURA: It's better. 
LIAM: It's better. It's better. 
MARISHA: Fuck! Okay. 
LIAM: I was really hoping for a 10. 
MARISHA: Shit! I-- Fuck! I'm going to go for damage right now. I'm going to go for damage. Fuck! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Literally, too many things. (indistinct whispers) Okay. 
SAM: ♪ Ba ba ba ba ♪ 
MARISHA: I'm going to drop a 5th-level Blight into her. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Yes, queen! 
MARISHA: Once again, while my puppers is there, she has disadvantage on the saving throw. It's a constitution 18 save. 
MATT: You got it. All right, with minus d4. That's with disadvantage. 
LIAM: Otohan is in the Goodfellas circle. 
MATT: That's going to be a failure. She's going to spend a Legendary Resistance to resist it. 
SAM: Oh wait, that's one of her resistances. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: It is one of her resistances. 
LAURA: What is one of her resistances? That's her second Legendary. 
MATT: First one she's used. 
TALIESIN: First one. Okay. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Oh, first one. 
ASHLEY: I thought she used her Legendary at one point. No? 
MATT: She used Legendary Actions, not Legendary Resistances. 
ASHLEY: That's something else. I understand. 
TALIESIN: I thought there was one left. No, it's okay. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's start here. 
LAURA: No, it was Gloomglot glottle (babbles) 
LIAM: Gloomgloat. That's what it was. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: ♪ ("Mmmbop") Gloamglut ♪ 
LIAM: Glimglom. 
MARISHA: ♪ Oom glot ♪ 
ASHLEY: ♪ Oom glot bap oh bap ♪ 
MATT: (laughs) Glubble glottal? That one? Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: ♪ Glimma glob glob gloom glot ♪ 
LIAM: Gurble got. 
MARISHA: 16. 
ASHLEY: Hemoglobin. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I'm like, Oh yeah! ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ Mm-Bop mm-glottle goop ♪ 
LIAM: Oh my gosh! 
MARISHA: 27. 
TRAVIS: Because you're a fucking animal right now. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah! 27. 
ASHLEY: Big money. Big money. 
MARISHA: 31. 35. 
LIAM: Not great. 
LAURA: Not great. What do you have? 
MARISHA: 35. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Plus eight is 43, plus another eight-- 
LIAM: Yeah. Second one. 
MARISHA: -- is 51 damage. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MATT: Damage! 
MARISHA: I rolled really high. 
SAM: Good god! 
MATT: That's awesome! 
LIAM: Yes, bitch! 
MATT: Reduced by half because she's resisting. 
MARISHA: Reduced by fucking half. 
LAURA: Why? 
MARISHA: Because she used a Legendary Resistance. 
MATT: She used a Legendary Resistance on that one. 
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Just like "(growls)." 
SAM: She's got to be almost dead? Right? 
TALIESIN: No. 
LIAM: Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! 
SAM: I mean, she's taken a lot of damage. 
MATT: That's your action. 
LAURA: He's not even saying she's looking rough. 
MARISHA: No, it's not. Quicken Spell. I'm going to dump an Eldritch Blast! Into her! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: There you go! Go for it. 
MARISHA: Three attacks. 
MATT: Three attacks. 
MARISHA: I don't get advantage for any reason, right? 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: I don't think I marked my 5th when I did Telekinesis. 
MARISHA: Okay, let's start with the good shit first. 
ASHLEY: The Good Shit Lollipop? 
MARISHA: ♪ It's the good shit lollipop ♪ Okay. Plus 12. So 30? 
MATT: That hits. 
SAM: Good god! 
MARISHA: Then-- 
SAM: 25. 
MARISHA: Plus eight, plus 12? 
SAM: Right? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 25? 
MATT: Hits. 
MARISHA: Then 23. 
MATT: Hits. All three hit. 
SAM: Wow! 
ASHLEY: Yes! Yes! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: That's like the first time for an Eldritch Blast. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: It kind of is. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I am shooketh! Okay, okay, okay. 
TALIESIN: Remember, you still have that d6, Laura. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Just, yeah. 
ASHLEY: That is that good shit. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep saying that shit. 
ASHLEY: It's that good shit, Laudna! 
LAURA: I know I moved my iPad and I was like (grunts). 
MARISHA: Got that good shit. Plus five for each of these. So let's do these one at a time. Okay. 13. 
MATT: 13 damage? 
MARISHA: Wait. 12! 12! 
MATT: 12 damage. All right. 
MARISHA: 12 damage. Yes, baby! 15. 
MATT: 15. 
SAM: Oh! 
MARISHA: 15! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
MATT: Nice! 
MARISHA: So that's 42 on an Eldritch Blast! 
ASHLEY: Damn! You just did so much damage! 
MARISHA: Fuck you! I'm coming for you, you cunt! (imitates blasts) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: "You're next." 
SAM: Yeah, that's-- 
MATT: She holds the blade out, the one that previously pierced your torso and sent you into the shadow realm and faced Delilah. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: I immediately retract my shit-talking. 
TALIESIN: You going to move? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I'm going to move away because she can get me. She can get me wherever I fucking go! 
SAM: She used a Resistance as a reaction, didn't she? 
MARISHA: Put me in the corner. 
MATT: Put Baby in the corner? 
MARISHA: Never put Baby in the corner! 
LAURA: Yeah, can't she just use a Legendary Action, though, whenever she wants? 
SAM: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: No, there's only a few of them. 
MATT: That finishes your turn. At the end of your turn, she's going to use her last Legendary Action. 
TALIESIN: Last one. 
LAURA: For the turn. 
MATT: And do an attack against you. 
MARISHA: Oh, is it for a round? 
LAURA: Oh, but I switched places with Orym. 
TALIESIN: It's three per round. 
MATT: You're still in melee with her. 
LAURA: Didn't he push me behind him? 
MATT: No, you switched places, which means you're still in melee, but you have a higher AC. 
LAURA: I see. 
MATT: So the attack against you, that's going to be a 23 minus four, 17 to hit. 
LAURA: Ha ha! No. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Because of Orym. 
TALIESIN: She missed! 
LIAM: (metallic ping) 
MATT: She missed. Hell, yeah. 
LAURA: Ha ha ha! 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: Ha ha ha ha. 
MATT: Now it's her turn. She gets to get her legendary actions back. 
SAM: (groans) 
LAURA: Oh, shit. Fuck! 
TALIESIN: Oh wait, did Chet go? 
LAURA: She got them back. 
TRAVIS: She's in front of me. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
LAURA: Yeah, then it'll be Chet's turn. 
TALIESIN: No, it was your turn before-- 
MATT: No, she goes and then Chetney goes. 
TRAVIS: That's why I got soloed. 
TALIESIN: Okay, my numbers are off. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Sorry, my numbers are so off. 
ASHLEY: Oh, she's after Laudna? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I had it written down wrong. 
MATT: Angrily, she's going to, like after the first strike misses, deflected, after you shielding her in the process, looking at the missing backpack as it sparks and little bits of leftover mechanics are just unusable at this point, "(furious roar)" and just unleashes on you. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
LIAM: (groan) 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: That's going to be a 23 to hit. 
ASHLEY: Didn't you Bait and S-- 
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm still in front of her. 
ASHLEY: You're still in front of her. 
MATT: She's going to use another-- 
MARISHA: These are all still minus d4, I just have to remind. I have to remind, I'm sorry. 
TALIESIN: He's got it on the hands. 
MATT: Yeah, I'm rolling it with each one. 
LAURA: Not enough to last us. 
MATT: That's going to be 15 points of slashing damage and 12 points of force damage. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: I need you to make a strength saving throw. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: 12. 
SAM: How many left? 
MATT: 12? 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
MATT: You get knocked prone once more. 
LAURA: So now she's at advantage. 
MATT: Now she's going to attack you again. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. 
SAM: How many left? 
MATT: This is going to be-- 
LAURA: I don't have-- 
MATT: 19 to hit? 
LIAM: No. 
MATT: 19 misses. 
SAM: With advantage? Wow. 
LIAM: Shield out over her. 
SAM: Awesome. 
MATT: (sword clinking) 
MATT: Third attack on you. 
SAM: Amazing. 
MATT: Natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs. I've got it back, I've got it back. It's been a round. 
MATT: What's the range on it? It's-- 
MARISHA: 60 feet. 
MATT: 60 feet. 
SAM: Is it? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Amazing. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: 60 feet. 
SAM: Fucking gross spell. 
MATT: I know. (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's all my 1st-level spells, though. 
MATT: All right, well, she still has advantage. I hadn't rolled the second one. 
LIAM: Oh shit. I thought you rolled both at the same time. 
MATT: So that would be, oh yeah, so that's still 28 to hit. 
LIAM: 28. 
MARISHA: But it's not a crit. 
TALIESIN: It's not a crit. 
MATT: It's not a crit. You take another 15 points of slashing damage and six points of force damage. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Whoa. 
LAURA: Oh fuck! 
MATT: Fourth attack. 
LAURA: I'm dead. 
MATT: You know what, is going to bonus action. She's going to try and shiv you. Are you making concentration checks, by the way, for your Telekinesis? 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: You got to do three of them, I think, or two of them. 
MATT: Well, here, we'll see if it matters. No. (laughter) 
MATT: Sorry, that's going to be a 29 to hit. 
LIAM: Woo. 
MATT: Eugh. That's going to be 16 points of slashing damage and 11 force damage. 
LIAM: It's big Otohan energy. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so with that-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, it's okay, okay. 
MATT: Imogen goes unconscious. As you begin to fade, you hear, "I should have finished the job when we last met." She's going to turn to you because you're right there. No, no she's not. She's going to bonus action Psi-Powered Leap. 
LIAM: Didn't she use her bonus action to do that last slash? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Oh, no-- 
MARISHA: You said bonus action slash. 
MATT: You're right, I did, so that was just the blade on the side. 
TALIESIN: Nothing but an attack left. 
MATT: Yeah, so she's run out of attacks. So no, she's going to move. Yeah, she'll take it. Attack of opportunity from-- 
LIAM: Hit that bitch, yes. 
MARISHA: She's coming for me, isn't she. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: God. Fuck. 
SAM: Do you get-- You get an attack, too. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I do. Well, how do I attack her? Just with a-- 
SAM: A stick. 
MATT: Just your staff. 
ASHLEY: Just my-- 
MATT: Your roll, your basic attack with your staff. 
TALIESIN: Unless you have a-- 
LIAM: 22 for me to hit. 
MATT: 22 just hits. 
LIAM: Just hits. 
MARISHA: My dog also goes. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: (dog barking, whining) 
MARISHA: He barks incredibly loud. 
TALIESIN: Say it, say it. 
ASHLEY: Natural 20. 
ALL: Hey! 
MATT: Yay, there you go. 
ASHLEY: Well, that's only-- 
TALIESIN: No, hold on. 
ASHLEY: That's only-- 
TALIESIN: This one. 
ASHLEY: When I cast a spell-- 
TALIESIN: Or hit with an attack that deals damage. 
ASHLEY: You can choose to deal-- Choose? Yes, I fucking choose to. 
MATT: Well, in case you're not trying to lethally kill somebody. 
ASHLEY: I'm just saying like in this moment, this is what I choose. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Of course I do. Okay, where did they just go? Where's my d4s? All right. Five points of damage. 
MATT: Five points of damage. 
ASHLEY: Doubled because-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, does this have with it? Yeah, some of the fire. 
ASHLEY: Doubles is the-- 
MATT: Crit, so it's 10 points of damage. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, and then that was three points of fire damage. 
MATT: Which also doubles as part of the crit. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
MATT: So 16 damage on a hit out there, not bad. 
LIAM: I also got a natural 20 off the advantage. 
MARISHA: No fucking way. 
MATT: Dude! 
LIAM: Right here. (laughter) 
LIAM: So 22 total. 
TRAVIS: That's the fifth one tonight? 
MATT: That's crazy, so how much was it total? 
LIAM: 22 total. 
MATT: 22 damage. 
LIAM: Now I got to roll to see if the blade shatters. It does not. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Woo, okay. 
MATT: She's starting to show a little wear and tear. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: She is? 
MATT: She is. 
LAURA: That's nice. 
MATT: Finishing her turn, she's going to take her last attack on you, Laudna. 
MARISHA: -- and my lotions-- 
TRAVIS: She's attacking you, Laudna! 
MATT: That's going to be a 28 to hit. 
MARISHA: Yep, let's see if she-- I have Mirror Image up. 
MATT: All right, she's going to go, so roll for that. 
MARISHA: Yep, she hits my first mirror. 
MATT: You got it. (whooshes) That one's gone. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: Second action surge. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: With that, is going to-- 
LIAM: No repeats. 
MATT: Oof, that's going to be a 30. 
MARISHA: Second Mirror Image. 
MATT: Actually, 27 with that last one. 
MARISHA: 19, second Mirror Image is gone. 
MATT: Second of four attacks. That's going to be 21. 
LIAM: Come on. 
MARISHA: Yeah, Mirror Image. 
LIAM: Let's go, Laudy. Come on, Laudy. 
MARISHA: Third Mirror Image, your mirror image is gone. 
TALIESIN: (clapping) 
LIAM: Eat it. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Now is going to go ahead. Natural 20. 
LIAM: Oh. 
ASHLEY: No! 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: No! 
TRAVIS: Matt! 
MATT: I'm balancing it. 
LIAM: You fended off the first three. 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
MATT: There was three attacks on you that did nothing. 
TRAVIS: This is unreal. 
LIAM: You knocked away, you-- 
MARISHA: But I'm okay, I'm okay. 
LIAM: -- shot down three attacks in a row. 
ASHLEY: You did, you did. 
LIAM: It's going to let you survive. 
MATT: You can use Psionic power die on this one. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
ASHLEY: You can't Silvery Barbs, right? 
MARISHA and LIAM: No. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
TRAVIS: There are some fucking rolls tonight. 
MATT: Six plus eight, it's going to be 14 points of slashing damage to you, plus 12 points of force damage. 
LAURA: Is that doubled? 
MATT: That is with the double. She didn't roll great for damage. 
LAURA: Oh, made it. 
MARISHA: So 14 first damage and then 12, okay. 
MATT: I need you should make a strength saving throw. 
MARISHA: Can I Hellish Rebuke her? 
MATT: No, you've used your reaction to Silvery Barbs. 
MARISHA: That's right, I did. Strength saving throw. Okay, well, it's a minus two, so 13. 
MATT: 13. (sword swooshing) Knocks you onto the ground. Prone. 
MARISHA: (grunting) 
SAM: You still awake? You still alive? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: I hadn't taken any damage. 
MATT: That is going to finish up her go. Ashton, you're up. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Double checking. 
ASHLEY: Wait, Chet, anything Chet? 
MATT: No, sorry, Chet, you're up next. Your-- That's right, you're conscious. Sorry, I crossed him out on the initiative order, that's on me. 
TRAVIS: Never count out this old bag of testicles. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I'll get to my (grunting) feet. 
LAURA: Oh, sorry. 
MARISHA: You're good. 
TRAVIS: Can I walk towards that side of the map? But as I get to that little crease in between the pieces of rock. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Can I see where Imogen is? 
MATT: You can, you can see her on the ground this way. 
TRAVIS: I will take out a health potion and pop the cork, but seeing Imogen down, I'm going to use my bonus action to (grunting) Misty Step and appear right by Imogen. I will use my action to pour a health potion in her mouth. 
SAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: Chet. 
LIAM: What a good boy. 
TALIESIN: Good call. Good, good, good, fucking great. 
LIAM: Do you put your finger on the side of your nose with a twinkle? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Eight plus four, right? With these guys, eight plus four, so 12, 12 points of healing. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Chetters. 
LIAM: Yes, hero. 
MARISHA: Chetters. 
TRAVIS: I'll say-- 
MARISHA: Have you ever said that before? 
TRAVIS: Finish the fight. I'll use the rest of my speed to go back towards where I bamfed from and just like slowly-- 
MATT: Get you right about there as you climb up on the rock. (grunting) 
LIAM: That old dog-- 
TRAVIS: This is good. 
MARISHA: Awesome, awesome. 
MATT: All righty, that finishes Chetney's go. Ashton, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
TALIESIN: How far away am I from this-- 
LIAM: Let's go, Titans. 
MARISHA: Bag. 
LAURA: Kill the bag. Kill the bag. 
TALIESIN: I think the bag's fucking dead. 
LAURA: No, it's not dead. 
MARISHA: What do you mean? What do you mean it's dead? 
SAM: It was sparking on her bag. 
LAURA: Slam it. 
LIAM: Throw it in the bag. 
SAM: It might not have been working. 
MARISHA: Throw it in the fucking wall. I don't know. 
LIAM: Keep it. 
TALIESIN: I don't think I can throw it in the wall, I'm pretty sure. 
TALIESIN: I feel like-- 
MATT: Throw what in the wall? 
TALIESIN: The backpack. 
TRAVIS: Like make it disappear inside the wall and have it-- 
LAURA: Just kill it. 
MATT: I mean, no, if you pull yourself in there, it'll like be resistant there. It's like you and your equipment can go through. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I haven't, I like, so it's not like I can't get it into the wall. 
LAURA: So just destroy it. 
LIAM: Devil's advocate, use it later. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. 
LIAM: She's running the opposite direction. 
LAURA: Yeah, don't listen to us. Do whatever you want. 
MARISHA: Do whatever you want. 
TRAVIS: Is she running? Is she running? 
LIAM: Break if you want. 
TRAVIS: Who is she chasing? 
LAURA: She's got Laudna cornered. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know. 
TALIESIN: It's right next to me? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. How how far away am I from this motherfucker? 
MATT: You are-- 
TALIESIN: As the crow flies more or less because I can run through that fucking shit. 
LIAM: 50 to 60. 
MATT: About, yeah. 
LIAM: 45. 
MATT: 40 to 50 feet, eyeballing it. 
TALIESIN: Shit. Just because, yeah, there's no time for this shit. I would, but I'm going to try and bee line straight to see if I can get into fucking melee. 
MATT: Okay. 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. What's your movement speed? 
TALIESIN: 40. 
MATT: 40, it gets you right there. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm not in-- 
MATT: You're not in melee. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: Would that change? 
LIAM: You got me. 
LAURA: But the portal. Oh wait, that's a rage thing. 
TALIESIN: That's a rage thing and this is-- 
LIAM: That's a question mark. You can't choose it, he has to roll the dice. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I guess I'm going to hold my action until she's in range. 
MATT: Okay, great. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm going to hold my action until she's in range. 
MATT: She went that way to get away from you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: So she probably won't get into your range. 
LAURA: Maybe she will. 
TALIESIN: Well, here, I want to make sure, like as much as I can, is this direct or is there a way to just get a little more irritating? 
MATT: This is the closest you can get. 
TALIESIN: I want to see if I can get in a way where it's really hard for her to get around me. 
MATT: I mean, there is the best you can do. 
TALIESIN: No, I couldn't get in like, you know. 
MATT: No, because-- 
TALIESIN: Then I'll just go up there. 
MATT: Up there would be the closest you could get. It's just a little bit of an odd-- 
TALIESIN: For the figure, but yeah. 
MATT: There, we'll put you there. 
TALIESIN: Thank you, because I know I can just be halfway through everything. 
MATT: Okay. All right, that finishes your turn. You're holding your action in case she comes into range. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: You got it. Fearne, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
ASHLEY: All right. I am going to make my way to her. 
MATT: Actually, at the end of your turn, she's going to use a Legendary Action-- 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: To do an attack on Laudna, who's not-- 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: Who's not present. 
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. 
SAM: That's okay. We can cry for her. 
LAURA: That's okay, I'll go get her. 
TALIESIN: She's within 15 feet of me right now. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: So would she have disadvantage on hitting anyone but me? 
MATT: At the top of the turn, she has to make a save. Yeah, this is an out-of-round. She didn't start there. 
TALIESIN: That's right. Fuck my mind. 
MATT: That's okay, so-- 
SAM: I'll go get Liam. 
TRAVIS: Everybody's missing. 
LAURA: No, stop. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Just one at a time just fire drill out of here. 
LAURA: We just run away. 
MATT: Well, here, I'll roll for this with advantage because she's on the ground. Minus four gets that. That's going to be 29 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Good lord. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what if she gets a reaction or something? 
TRAVIS: Does she have glass blades, by the way? 
MARISHA: Why? What happened? 
LAURA: Because she's attacking you. 
MATT: No, that's just her thing. 
LIAM: On the ground. 
MATT: She'd be critting a lot more if she was, but her blades have their own abilities. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: There's nothing she can do, anyway. 
MARISHA: I can't do shit. 
LIAM: But she can be here to be dismayed. 
MARISHA: I've already used my reaction. 
MATT: Okay, she's going to use another Psionic power. 
MARISHA: Wait, where is she? 
LAURA: She's right-- 
SAM: She's on you. 
MATT: She gets a Legendary Action on you. 
MARISHA: She's using Legendary Action, okay. 
LIAM: Over here in the corner. 
MATT: All right, so this-- 
TALIESIN: Couldn't go there, I'm so sorry. 
LAURA: Not your fault. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
MARISHA: Did I do-- 
MATT: 10 points of slashing damage to you. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: 10 points of force, No, 10, 18 points of force damage to you. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
SAM: 28 total. Damn. 
MARISHA: Fuck this bitch up. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: That's it. 
MATT: That brings us, now it is Fearne's go, with FCG on deck, sorry. 
ASHLEY: All right, so I am going to stalk over to her over here. Bonus action or cunning action, dash, get all the way up to her. 
MATT: Up to her? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Awesome. 
ASHLEY: I am going to cast Blight at 6th-level. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay, now Blight you can do at a range, just so you know. You don't have to be up there, but-- 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MATT: Okay, good. I just want to make sure you know. 
ASHLEY: I want to touch her. 
MATT: I respect that, okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay, so-- 
MATT: It's constitution save? 
ASHLEY: It is. 
MATT: With a minus four because of, actually, roll. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I want to touch somebody ♪ 
MATT: Roll two concentration checks for Bane, if you could for me. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I want to feel the heat with somebody ♪ 
MARISHA: What do I need to roll over? Was my-- 
MATT: The most recent one was-- 
MARISHA: My spellcasting modifier, right? 
MATT: 29, so it'd be 14, I'd say. 
MARISHA: It's gone. 
MATT: Okay, Bane has faded. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. Shit, okay, so she needs to make a con save of 19. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
MATT: 19? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. That is going to be a 23. She rolled a natural 15. 
ASHLEY: What a bitch. 
MATT: I'm sorry. Still takes half damage. 
ASHLEY: That's all right. That's all right. 
MARISHA: I should've done something there! 
ASHLEY: Okay, so help me count these, guys. So we got, we have 10d8. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so let's start with five of these. What bullshit! 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Fucking three ones! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: And a two. 
ASHLEY: Goddamn it! Okay, six, seven, eight. 
MATT: Oh, Ashley. 
ASHLEY: Nine, 10, fucking 11. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: What a piece of shit. 
TRAVIS: That was just five, right? You have more, you said. 10d8. 
SAM: They're all going to be 10s. 
ASHLEY: That's a little better. What did I? 15 was the last one? 
LAURA and TALIESIN: 11. 
ASHLEY: 11, shit, okay, so 11 plus eight, so 19. 
MATT: 19. 
LIAM: Boy, they go hard at NASA. 
ASHLEY: Plus seven. 
MATT: 25. 
ASHLEY: Plus six. 
MATT: 26. 
TALIESIN: 26. 
TRAVIS: 31. 
ASHLEY: Plus three. 
TRAVIS: 34. 
ASHLEY: Plus one. 
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MATT: 35. 
MATT: Okay, so-- 
ASHLEY: Plus a d8 for fire. 
MATT: Right, that's true, yeah. 
TRAVIS: 60. 
ASHLEY: Plus an additional four fire damage. 
MATT: So 39, so it's going to be 18 points of damage, which is not bad for a con saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Ugh! For 6th-level. 
LAURA: Looking rough? 
ASHLEY: God dang it! 
SAM: I think she's looking rough. 
MARISHA: Well, he said she's-- 
TRAVIS: Worse for wear, I think. 
MATT: She's starting to show some wear. 
LAURA: Starting to show some wear. 
TRAVIS: In the Matt Mercer school of "How cooked is your steak?" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's not very good. 
MARISHA: So it's medium well. 
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh, please. 
TRAVIS: There's still some pink. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Ashley? 
ASHLEY: I mean! 
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool. 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (wheezing laugh) 
ASHLEY: I know, I want to do this, but-- 
TALIESIN: Not yet, no, no, no, but like other things are here. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, I can get away, but I don't want to, I'm going to stay. 
MATT: Okay, end of your turn, she's going to use another Legendary Action to strike Laudna. 
LIAM: Fuck you. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
LAURA: How many Legendary Resistances has she used? 
MATT: Just one. 
LIAM: She has seven to go. 
MATT: That's going to be 23 to hit. 
LIAM: (grunting) 
MARISHA: It hasn't reset my round. I have like Shield, I've got shit I can't do. 
MATT: She's going to use another psionic die on this one. That's going to be-- 
ASHLEY: (growling) 
MATT: 15 points of slashing damage and-- 
ASHLEY: She's so powerful. 
MATT: -- 15 points of force damage. 
LIAM: Juice her up, Letters. 
MATT: All right, that finishes the Legendary Action. FCG, you're up. 
SAM: Hurt or heal? 
TALIESIN: Heal. 
SAM: Hurt or heal? 
LAURA: Heal. 
SAM: Heal? Okay. 
MARISHA: If we start going down-- 
SAM: I'll step forward towards the Orym area. 
MATT: How far? 
SAM: The Orym area. 
MATT: Like here? 
SAM: Yeah, like up there, pretty close so I can get everybody in range and I'll do Mass Cure Wounds. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Mm! 
TALIESIN: Awesome possum. 
SAM: I'll give everybody, let's see here, oh, plus this. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
SAM: 16, 17, 18, 19, 23 points of healing. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: That's amazing. 
MATT: Everyone heals 23 points. 
TRAVIS: Everybody? 
MATT: Everybody does. 
TALIESIN: Everybody. 
SAM: Including me? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: How many targets can you? 
SAM: Oh, let me look. Mass Cure Wounds. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
SAM: Choose up to six creatures, so everybody but me. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: You sure? 
SAM: Everyone's hurt, right? 
TALIESIN: How fucked are we all? 
LIAM: I bet you're worse than me. So I'm going to take that away from myself. Give it to yourself. 
SAM: Okay. You're a melee guy. 
TALIESIN: If the healer goes down, we're all fucked. 
LIAM: I don't look bad. I look okay. 
TRAVIS: Evoroa isn't in this initiative, right? 
SAM: What did I say, 23 or 24? 
MARISHA: 23. 
TALIESIN: Healer goes down, we're fucked. 
MATT: Evoroa is currently hiding behind, actually put back at this point, Evoroa has been behind you all. I did forget to put her on the board, but also, you're all the major threats here. I'd say as soon as things went bad, Evoroa went back here. 
TRAVIS: Didn't know if she had a Holy Hand Grenade or something and had just been sleeping. 
MATT: No, sorry. Not much of a combatant, her. 
LIAM: I have a clipboard. 
TALIESIN: I'm hear to soak. 
SAM: I'll bonus action, give Ashton a d6. 
TALIESIN: Awesome. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. Does that finish your turn? 
SAM: That's it, yeah. 
MATT: Okay, end of your turn-- 
LIAM: Unleash hell, Imogen. 
LAURA: That's a dex save. 
MATT: Is going to stay put for the time. The hound can go. (laughter) 
SAM: "The hound can go." 
ASHLEY: "The hound can go." 
MARISHA: Good boy, my good boy! 
ASHLEY: Good boy, let's go, Caviar. 
MARISHA: He barks angrily, he's so mad. 
MATT: He does have advantage on his attacks because he's next to people, remember. 
MARISHA: Ooh, because he's a little pack tactics boy. 
MATT: Fearne is still there. 
MARISHA: Oh, this is so, 18? 
MATT: 18 misses. 
MARISHA: Ooh. (furious barking) (laughter) 
LAURA: He's like Trinket was, he just gives other people advantage. 
MARISHA: I mean, it helps. 
MATT: It's helpful. 
LIAM: Yes, it is. 
MARISHA: He also, yeah, gives me-- 
MATT: All righty, finishes his go. Imogen, you're up, with Orym on deck. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Okay, so-- 
LIAM: Kill. 
ASHLEY: I'm so mad. 
LAURA: I know she's going to use her resistance is the thing. 
ASHLEY: That was so not satisfying. 
TALIESIN: Good, let's get that shit out of her. 
ASHLEY: (grunt) 
LIAM: All right. (groan) All right. (sigh) I'm running out of my higher levels. All I got, okay, I will stand up again. Gosh darn it. 
SAM: How does the hound want to do this? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Bite and pee. 
LAURA: I'll say: Otohan! I will shoot my hand out and from my mind through my hand straight through my friends, she's going to get Psychic Lanced. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
LAURA: That's an intelligence saving throw. 
MATT: Intelligence saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Got these saves. 
MATT: Natural 20. 
LIAM: Mm. 
LAURA: Well, fuck. 
TRAVIS: Unbelievable, Matthew. 
LAURA: Lots of nat 20s. 
TRAVIS: I think you should stop rolling as well as Liam. 
TALIESIN: I can't look back there, but I trust you. 
TRAVIS: Please. 
MATT: (laughs) (sighs) 
LAURA: Three, four, five, six. I guess I can just use some of them. 
TRAVIS: You are hard to hurt, much less kill. 
MATT: It's her against seven of you; she has to be. 
TRAVIS: I mean, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: That's why she's the Legend of the Peaks, man. 
TRAVIS: Dude. 
LAURA: Three. 
MATT: You did knock out some of her toolkit, which makes me sad. 
LAURA: Shit. 30 points, halved. 
MATT: Halved, all right, 15. 
LAURA: Pathetic. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
LAURA: And, for my bonus action, is Fearne completely blocking her in or can she move at all? 
MATT: Fearne's behind her. Laudna's on the ground in front of her. Ashton's off to the corner, but not quite in melee, and the dog is on this side. 
LAURA: Yeah, but Fearne is completely blocking her path of retreat? 
MATT: It seems that way. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: She could probably get out, but there'd be so many opportunity attacks. 
MATT: There'd be a lot of opportunity attacks. 
TALIESIN: Including I'm holding my attack. 
LAURA: I know you're holding your attack, I wanted to bring her to you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, brilliant. 
LAURA: But I don't think I can if Fearne's standing there. 
ASHLEY: I feel like there's an opening. 
MATT: There's an opening here. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Then I will try my Telekinetic Pull and pull her five feet towards Ashton. 
MATT: All righty. It's a strength saving throw? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Which is at disadvantage still because of Orym. 
MATT: Well, it's strength checks are at disadvantage. Not saving throws. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: That's going to be a natural 16 plus nine. 
TALIESIN: It was a nice try anyway. 
ASHLEY: It was a good idea. 
MATT: It was a good idea, though. 
LAURA: Nothing works on this woman. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
MATT: That finishes your go. Orym, you're up, with Laudna on deck. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: I am going to move. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, where do you want to move? 
LAURA: Away. 
MATT: Whereabouts? 
SAM: ♪ Away, away ♪ 
TALIESIN: Towards the-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: 25, 30. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Towards the backpack, anywhere you want go. 
LAURA: Yeah. As long as I can still see what's happening. 
MATT: More or less, you can-- 
LAURA: Peek. 
MATT: -- move over here and keep an eye out. 
SAM: Oh look, there's a backpack on the floor. 
TALIESIN: Cover. 
LAURA: Hey, look at that. 
SAM: Is the backpack just lying on the floor over there-- 
LIAM: Here's what I'd like to do, you tell me if I can. 
SAM: -- or did you take it? 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: It's really crowded around her. 
TALIESIN: But it's not operational. 
LIAM: If I get a running jump, if I go five, 10 to this little nub and leap with the boots of striding and springing, can I attack, as I am here in space above her with Laudna on the ground diagonally between her and I, can I come down and go (blade slicing)? 
LAURA: Do you have a lot of spells left? 
MATT: What is your end goal of this leap? 
LIAM: To attack her-- 
LAURA: Do you have a lot of spells? 
LIAM: -- in air. 
MATT: And land where? 
LIAM: I'll land in her space. 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, wait. 
MATT: There has to be an empty space. There is empty space there where you can scoot in there if you want to. 
LIAM: So what I'd like to do is run, jump, attack her as I'm falling towards her. I'm hoping to use flanking with Laudna, but that's up to you, and then kick off her and land on that one little rock to end my move. 
MATT: I will say you cannot flank-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: -- with Laudna because in order to do that, you'd have to be in Fearne's position. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: The only way you can land in an empty space is here. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: There is no way of getting flanking on that unfortunately. 
LIAM: Right, that's fine. That's fine. 
MATT: It's very crowded over there. 
LIAM: I'm still going to do it. I'm going to run here, jump, and be attacking on the way down. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Then I will land at the end of it. So first attack is a 25 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
LIAM: Not a crit. 
LAURA: Destroy her, destroy her, destroy her. 
LIAM: Nine points of damage. 
MATT: That's not cocked. 
LIAM: Yeah. Okay, so that's a crit, that's 18. 
MATT: 18, okay. 
LIAM: (sighs) That's eight. 
LAURA: I could have just pushed Ashton towards her. 
LIAM: 21 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Now I see if the blade shatters. It does not. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Why didn't I? 
LIAM: 19 to hit? 
MATT: 19 misses. 
LIAM: Doesn't hit. 
LAURA: And you're so big. 
LIAM: Okay, so then I land. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I will use a bonus action to get my wind back. I'll use Second Wind and gain some hit points back. That's the end of my turn. 
MATT: You got it. Okay, cool. 
TALIESIN: Do I have room to get in when it's time or no? 
LIAM: (sighs) You need to get in there? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to do horrible things to this person. 
LIAM: I mean, I do have movement left because that's-- 
TALIESIN: No, I'm okay. 
LIAM: It was five, 10. 
MATT: You were here. Five, 10. 
LIAM: My jump's-- Five, 10. My jump lets me cover the rest of my distance, so that's another 10. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: So I could scuttle back. 
TRAVIS: Slide out. 
MATT: If you want to. 
LAURA: Could you switch places with Ashton? 
LIAM: I can't do that. 
TALIESIN: No, no. 
LIAM: Because I have spent all my superiority die. 
TALIESIN: I don't need that. 
TRAVIS: Take the hit, take the hit. 
LIAM: I'll take the hit. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Yeah, I dash back. 
TALIESIN: Are you okay? 
LIAM: I'm fine. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Okay, so you dash back here? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm ending with the Second Wind. 
MATT: Attack of opportunity on you as you swing out of the way. 
LIAM: Yeah, for sure. 
TALIESIN: Which gets rid of her reaction. 
MATT: That's going to be a 35 to hit. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
MATT: Sorry, 25, 25. 
TALIESIN: Oh thank god, okay. 
LIAM: 25 does in fact hit. 
MATT: She's going to spend a psi power on that. 
TRAVIS: She hits you so hard, she hits Keyleth. 
MATT: Ooh, okay. It's going to be 16 points of slashing damage against you. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: And 10 points of force damage and I need you to make a strength saving throw for me. 
LIAM: Okay, so hold on. 16. 
SAM: 26. 
LIAM: And 10. 
MATT: Yep. 
LIAM: Okay, I make a strength save. That is-- 
TRAVIS: 18. 
LIAM: I know, I'm trying to decide if I want to reroll it or not. 
TRAVIS: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. 
LIAM: I will. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I won't. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: 18. 
MATT: The DC's 19. 
SAM: (sighs) 
LIAM: So whatever happens happens. 
MATT: You get knocked prone. 
LIAM: Okay, cool. 
TRAVIS: He wanted to see what happens. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: No, I'm not going to do that. 
TALIESIN: Shit, shit, shit. Sorry for suggesting that. 
LIAM: That's fine. I will use my-- 
SAM: A lot of characters over there. 
LAURA: It is a crowded little corner right there. 
MATT: It really is. 
SAM: (aggressive barking) 
LIAM: With my jump, I probably have five, but I need half my movement to get up. 
MATT: You need half your movement to get off the ground. 
LIAM: Okay, so I gained some hit points back. 
TALIESIN: You can also scoot, though. 
SAM: Who brought their fucking dog to Ruidus? (laughter) 
LAURA: Maybe you can roll. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LIAM: I'm fine. 
MARISHA: Always me. 
MATT: You can scoot five more feet because you have 10 more feet of movement. 
MARISHA: Obviously. 
LAURA: Do you want to scoot? 
LIAM: Sure, I'll scoot. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, don't be prone in front of her. That's a bad idea. 
TRAVIS: Bear crawl. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It's metal. 
LIAM: I'm still good, guys. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Don't worry about me. 
TALIESIN: She would drop two more hits into you, though. 
LIAM: Finish her off. You got her. 
MATT: All right. That finishes your go. At the end of your turn, she's going to use the last legendary action-- 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: -- to attack-- 
MARISHA: Okay 
MATT: -- you again. 
SAM: Laudna. 
MARISHA: Hang on. 
LAURA: She's single-minded in her focus. 
MARISHA: She is. 
TALIESIN: Smart. 
TRAVIS: Attack who again? 
SAM: Laudna. 
MARISHA: Last legendary action. All right. 
MATT: So that's going to be a 23 to hit? 
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, yeah. 
MATT: All right, she's going to spend another Psionic power on that. 
MARISHA: Is it the top of the round? It doesn't matter, keep going. 
MATT: Yes, but not until your next turn. 
MARISHA: It's my turn? 
MATT: Yes. That's going to be, okay, 13 points of slashing damage and 11 points of force damage. 
LIAM: I just thought of something better I could've done. 
LAURA: Yeah, after the turn, right? 
LIAM: Fuck. 
LAURA: It's always like: Fuck! 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: All right. Laudna, it's your turn. 
LIAM: Fuck. 
LAURA: You've got this, Laudna. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Fuck. 
LAURA: Destroy her. 
SAM: I think you're going to win. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It would be so cool. I want revenge so bad. 
LIAM: Do it, get it. 
MARISHA: It would be thematically awesome. 
LIAM: Get it. 
TRAVIS: Be the teeth, not the rainbow. 
MARISHA: I know, it's do I want to do damage here? 
LAURA: Be the teeth. 
ASHLEY: Be the teeth. 
LAURA: Be the teeth. 
MARISHA: Do I want to do damage here or do I want transform? 
LIAM: Can you leave the spot? 
TALIESIN: She doesn't have a reaction. 
MARISHA: At least, well, I could do. 
SAM: What do I want to do? 
MARISHA: She doesn't have a reaction. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Well, actually she doesn't have a reaction, which means that you can do whatever the fuck you want and you can book. 
MARISHA: She doesn't have a reaction. 
TRAVIS: Like "Flashdance." 
MARISHA: Do I do Form of Dread? Maybe I don't. Maybe I don't. Maybe I don't get extra hit points. Fuck it! Okay. 
LIAM: That's true, she's pinned in. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I need a hero ♪ 
MARISHA: I'm feeling it. 
LIAM: Hurt her and get out of there. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. No reaction. 
MARISHA: I feel it. 
SAM: This is it. 
LAURA: Uh-oh, uh-oh. No, no, no, no, no. 
SAM: Oh yes, yes, yes! 
MARISHA: I'm going to crawl as my neck cracks and I dislodge my shoulder out of its socket and then immediately pop it back in as I pull myself to her, and I'm going to reach and do Hunger of the Shadow Shard. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, are you standing up first? 
LAURA: So you can get advantage. 
MATT: Otherwise-- Well yeah, so you'd have advantage on the attack roll. 
MARISHA: I'd get advantage, right? 
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Crawl up her. 
MARISHA: Crawl up and then-- 
ASHLEY: (disjointed crawling) 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
LAURA: Creepy as fuck. 
MARISHA: Then my nails, Laudna's long nails slip right under her chin as I do Hunger of the Shadow Shard. 
MATT: (Delilah) "Feed us, darling." 
LIAM: Come on, Marisha. 
ASHLEY: (nervous remark) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MARISHA: 20, 20? 
MATT: 20? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, 19? 
MATT: Misses. 
ASHLEY: No, no. No, fuck. 
MARISHA: Can I Quicken and do it again? 
MATT: Quicken a spell, it's not necessarily Quicken an action, unfortunately. 
LIAM: You spent the action. 
MATT: But you can try it again next round. 
MARISHA: Is this right because it's not-- 
MATT: You can keep using it until it functions. 
MARISHA: -- plus 10, but that's not-- 
LAURA: Or you can get out of there. 
MARISHA: -- my spell attack. Because it's a spell attack. 
LAURA: Right, you can Quicken and do another spell. 
ASHLEY: Guidance? 
LAURA: But you can't Quicken and do that again. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: My melee attack. 
SAM: Oh yeah, I Guidanced her. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Shit. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MATT: You go and reach, as you do, she (shifts) dodges out of the way. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
MATT: Looks at your arm, this dangerous energy that's gathering in your fingertips. You see a flash of fear in her eyes, not fully understanding what she's looking at and what's coming in from within you. 
LIAM: Get out of there. 
MARISHA: That was a melee attack. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: It's considered a melee attack. 
MATT: It's an ability you use to attack. It's not a spell. 
MARISHA: So I can Quicken-- 
MATT: And cast a spell. 
MARISHA: -- a high level spell? 
LAURA: Yes, you can. 
MATT: Yes, you can. 
LAURA: Yes you can. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So I will, because that's important to know. I'm going to Quicken my last 5th-level spell. 
SAM: Speak with Plants. 
MARISHA: Blight. 
SAM: Oh, okay, that's better. 
MARISHA: Pretty much the same thing, but reverse. 
TALIESIN: It's Yell at Plants. 
MARISHA: Yell at Plants. (laughter) 
LAURA: Become dead plants. 
MARISHA: This is my last 5th-level spell and she has disadvantage on the save. 
MATT: Indeed. 
MARISHA: Because of my doggo. 
MATT: Because your dog's there, yeah. 
MARISHA: Because of my doggo. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: That's a 10. 
MARISHA: She's going to take full damage. 
MATT: Takes full damage on this. 
MARISHA: She takes full damage, which is 9d8. 
SAM: Is she out of legendary-- 
LAURA: Is she out of resistances? 
MATT: She has one more legendary resistance. 
SAM: Is the going to use it? 
MARISHA: Don't tell him that. 
LAURA: Sorry, sorry! 
ASHLEY: No, they're all gone, they're all gone. 
MATT: No, she's going to take it. 
ASHLEY: I counted it all. 
MATT: She's doing okay. 
TRAVIS: She's doing okay?! 
MARISHA: She's doing okay? 
ASHLEY: She's doing okay?! 
MATT: Continue. Continue. 
TRAVIS: Fried okra, this is bad. 
SAM: Do your damage, do your damage. 
SAM: You got to do what you got to do. 
MARISHA: Can I borrow d8s because I might want to-- 
LAURA: Yeah, take some. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) Yeah, take them! 
TALIESIN: You good? You good? 
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, this is it because I might-- Ah, that doesn't count. That doesn't count. 
ASHLEY: Ooh, wow! 
SAM: Lots of good. 
LIAM: Oh! 
LAURA: Okay! 
MARISHA: That's really good actually, really good! Only one one in there. Okay, let's start with the big ones. 16, 20, seven, 
SAM: 27. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
MARISHA: 27. 34. 
SAM: I can't see what you're holding. 
LIAM: That's right, that's right. 
MARISHA: Seven, 34. 39. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: 39 plus eight-- 
LAURA: 47. 
MARISHA: -- is 47. 48 damage. 
MATT: 48 damage. 
SAM: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LIAM: That's a mighty hit. 
MATT: Nice! (slam) "(snarls)" 
MARISHA: Do I have anything else I can do? 
SAM: She's still up. 
LIAM: Get out of there. 
TRAVIS: I love Matt. This is the best. 
TALIESIN: Get the living fuck out of there. 
TRAVIS: We're all searching his soul for even the slightest crack of a saying. 
TALIESIN: You can get the living fuck out of there. 
TRAVIS: He's just tiptoeing at the edge, I love it. 
MARISHA: I don't have anything like that. 
TRAVIS: Dancing between shadow beings, baby. 
MARISHA: I opted to not heal. 
SAM: It's okay, you're fine. You did your thing. 
LIAM: Yes. 
TALIESIN: You should stay there and then get final death. 
MARISHA: I did not heal, but she's going to hit me. 
LIAM: Get out of there. Use your fucking, you still have 15 more feet of movement, don't you? 
LAURA: But she's trapped. 
MARISHA: She's got reactions. 
LIAM: No, she doesn't! 
ASHLEY: No, she doesn't have a reaction. 
MATT: She used her reaction. 
LIAM: She hit me. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: She used her reaction. 
LIAM: On me, get the fuck out of there. 
MARISHA: All right, I back up. I back up, if I can. 
SAM: She uses her reaction. Ha ha ha, he tricked you. 
LIAM: Legendary Reaction. 
TRAVIS: (garbles) Back up. 
MATT: Technically, you can get about there because the rough terrain gets you over there. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Wake up (garbled) ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ You wanted to ♪ 
MATT: Yeah. You got 10 feet out of there. 
LIAM: Somebody block that passage. 
TALIESIN: Or you can try and pass me where she will not go. 
LAURA: It's Otohan's turn next. 
MATT: It is now Otohan's turn. 
ASHLEY: Fuck-uh! 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, never mind, you should've just-- fuck. Oh, Otohan has to make a-- 
MARISHA: But I have my reactions back. 
MATT: You do. 
TALIESIN: Otohan has to make a-- 
MATT: A strength save? 
TALIESIN: A strength save. 
MATT: You got it. 
MARISHA: I want to suck her essence so bad. 
MATT: 22. 
TALIESIN: That probably is fine. 
LAURA: God, let's take her essence. 
LIAM: Your mouth was made to-- 
TALIESIN: Wait, hold on, no, no, she doesn't. "Creatures that start their turn within 15," yeah, are pulled 10 feet towards me and have disadvantage. Oh, is pulled 10 feet towards me. 
MATT: Right. No save, it just happens? 
TALIESIN: No, it just happens. 
SAM: Doesn't she have to be alive? 
TALIESIN: They have disadvantage when targeting creatures that are not me. 
SAM: To suck her essence? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Unless I'm missing because I only have the tiny bit I wrote down. 
MATT: I'll double check real fast for you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, creatures, that's, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you mean like? 
MATT: One second, there we go. 
TALIESIN: It's deep in there. 
MATT: I know, pardon the patience on this. 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: No. 
MATT: It's been a minute since I looked up the specifics. 
TRAVIS: No, it's only our dying moments. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Wait, what is Otohan's AC? 
SAM: 22, I think. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's Density Well where there's a DC 15. 
MATT: Correct, yes. 
MARISHA: I was so close. 
MATT: Yeah, Density Well. 
TALIESIN: Which is mean. 
LAURA: You were so close, so close. 
SAM: Did she heal? 
MATT: So Density Well. 
LAURA: Did she? 
SAM: I don't know, can she? 
LAURA: I don't think she can. 
LIAM: I don't think so. 
LAURA: At least we don't have five other hers attacking us right now. 
SAM: I know! 
MARISHA: That was so fucked, it worked. 
MATT: Well no, Orbit Decay is what you're thinking of. 
TALIESIN: No, I'm just saying it's straight gravity. 
MATT: No, I know, but Orbit Decay is, yeah, "All creatures that start their turn within 15 feet of you are pulled 10 feet towards you." Yeah, so she gets pulled 10 feet into you, which you were holding your action. 
TALIESIN: Yes, I was. 
MATT: You immediately get to go into-- Well, now before this happens, because it's the start of turn, the last hit of your thing, it wounds her, and you see this well of fury and pain build within her. She pulls in she goes (screeches) and screams, and you see that spark of Exaltant power burst within her. 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: In the moments that you've seen Imogen flare, the moments you've seen Liliana flare, you see Otohan, the energy begin to emanate from her. Her hair lifting up slightly still. The rocks pulling up off the ground. So she is now Exaltant Fury. 
SAM: (gasps) 
LIAM: Final form, final form. 
LAURA: Full DBZ. Did she just fucking go Super Saiyan? 
MATT: You've done it. It's an Exaltant thing. 
LIAM: Now I will show you true power. 
MATT: Gets pulled in 10 feet, you get to make your attacks on her. 
TRAVIS: She's Super Saiyan 2. 
TALIESIN: Just deciding if I'm going to do this. I don't get to choose if I do it reckless, I just have to-- 
TRAVIS: Just turn into a monkey. 
SAM: Do you pull everybody towards you or just-- I think just anyone I want. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (quiet yelling) 
MATT: "All creatures that start their turn within 15 feet get pulled towards you." 
TRAVIS: That's my favorite. 
TALIESIN: 24 to hit. 
MATT: 24? 
LIAM: Bruise that tomato. 
MATT: Just misses. 
LAURA: Oh-- 
LIAM: Oh, her exalted form AC 24 misses? 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
LIAM: Oh-kay. 
LAURA: Holy shit. 
TALIESIN: Do I get my second attack since I was holding my action? 
MATT: Oh sure, I'll allow it, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: Try to make Bane work. 
TALIESIN: That's better. 27 to hit. 
MATT: That'll hit. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: God. 
LIAM: Let's go, bruiser, let's go. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to put in a d6 of fire, too, just to make things interesting. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: I don't like those ones. That's better. Five, seven, eight, nine. 
LAURA: I've got so many level twos and level one spell slots. 
TALIESIN: It's 23 points plus two points of fire damage. So 25 points of damage. 
MATT: 25 points of damage, hell yeah, okay. So that finishes your impact. She gets hit, turns back to you. Her eyes are these burning white coals in the middle of her face. Energy emanating from her and similar (rumbling) hum in the room begins to fill the space around her. You're almost having a hard time focusing on her. She's right there and she's going to unload on you, actually. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, surprise. 
SAM: Oh, that's new. 
MATT: So since you pulled her in there. 
TALIESIN: Does anybody get an advantage or no? Attack of opportunity or no? 
MATT: No, because pulled movement doesn't get an attack of opportunity. So attacking you, that's going to be 24 to hit. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
MATT: All right, it's going to burn psychic power. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MATT: You take 12 points of slashing damage. 
TALIESIN: Reduced to six. 
MATT: Reduced to six. And 12 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: Reduced to, oh, no. So that's 12, 18 points of damage. 
MATT: Make a strength save for me, you have advantage. 
TALIESIN: All right, hold on. 18 points of damage and strength save with advantage. 16, 27. 
MATT: 27, yeah, you hold your ground. going to do another attack on you. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: That's going to be a 23. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it hits. 
MATT: This one's going to be 13 points of slashing damage and nine points of force. 
TALIESIN: So that's-- 
MATT: So six-- 
SAM: 15. 
MATT: 15 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage, okay. 
MATT: Third attack on you, that's going to be 30. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it hits. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay, that's going to be 16 points of slashing damage reduced to eight, and then nine points of force damage. So it's going to be 17 points of damage. 
TALIESIN: 17 points of damage, all right. 
SAM: This is fine, he's doing okay, he's okay. 
MATT: Oh, that was cocked there. 
SAM: He's okay. 
MATT: That's going to be a 31 to hit. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits. Hold on. 
SAM: He's okay, he's going to be fine. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to be weird here, let's use an Erratic Defense. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's fun. This is the fourth attack? 
MATT: It's the fourth attack. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, Erratic Defense. 
SAM: Eradicator! 
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens. 
LAURA: (comedic laughing) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: The attack damage is halved and I have resistance to its attack. In addition, I get to push Otohan 30 feet away from me in a big shove. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. Okay, then that's the fourth attack, that will be seven, seven-- 
TALIESIN: I should have waited because you can drop everything into it first, but-- 
MATT: Right, did I say the damage on this already? 
TALIESIN: No, sorry. 
MATT: That's okay, it's 15 points of slashing damage. Reduced to half, reduced to a quarter because of the attacks. That would be 15 to seven to three points of slashing damage and seven points of force damage, which is reduced to four, three, sorry. So it's six points of damage you take, and you're pushing her back. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, straight back and as far through-- Into the wall. 
SAM: Ska-doosh. 
LAURA: Slam damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Slamage. 
MATT: She's going to spend a psychic power to do a Psi-Powered Leap to take a flying speed of 80 feet until the end of the turn. 
SAM: Oh shit! 
LIAM: How high is the roof in here? She smashes her head. 
MARISHA: She's trying to get away, she's trying to get away, trying to get away. 
LIAM: Nope. 
MARISHA: Bitch is running. 
MATT: So that's going to be 40-- Five, 10, 15, 20. 
LIAM: Goddamn it. 
MATT: 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 to get there. 
LIAM: Mother. Fucker. 
MATT: Going to bonus action (whooshes) to you, Imogen. 
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. 
LAURA: How fucking dare. 
MATT: That's going to be a 22 to hit. 
LAURA: (laughs) It hits. 
MATT: Yeah, okay. 
MATT: This is going to be 14 points of slashing damage and 11 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it. 
MATT: I need you to make a strength save. 
LIAM: She's in a bad spot. 
LAURA: No, six. 
MATT: Get knocked prone. 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: Action Surge. 
TALIESIN: You have another Action Surge? 
MATT: She regained it when she does her-- 
MARISHA: She's down, she's down, there's no way. 
LAURA: I'm dead, in an instant. 
LIAM: Fuck her. 
LAURA: She's going to kill me-kill me. 
TRAVIS: Guard your health potions. 
MATT: With advantage, that's going to be 20-- 
LAURA: I'm out. 
SAM: No, this is just to hit. 
MATT: It's to hit. 
LAURA: You hit. 
MATT: 29 to hit. 
LIAM: Yeah, but her HP is so low. 
LAURA: One hit and I'm out. I've got 10 points. 
MATT: Okay, yeah, you're out. 
SAM: Well, how many points is it? 
MATT: So that would be 10 points of slashing damage and five points of force damage. 
SAM: I'm going to take half of that. 
MATT: You're going to take half of it? 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: But one more hit. 
LIAM: Well wait, no, no, it's close, it's close. So what was the total damage? 
TRAVIS: Let Sammy do it. 
MATT: So that's 10 plus five, so 15 points of damage. 
LIAM: Yeah, that keeps her up. 
MATT: You take seven. 
LIAM: That could make the difference. 
LAURA: So I take how many? 
MATT: You take eight points of damage. 
LAURA: Eight points of damage. 
LIAM: That could make the difference between unconscious and dead. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Correct. 
MATT: Second attack. 
SAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm just excited, thank you. 
MARISHA: No, it's true, it's true, it's true. 
LAURA: It's true, she might miss me. 
MATT: That's going to be a 27 to hit. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: It wasn't a double death save. 
MATT: That's going to be 15 points of damage. Or 15 slashing, yeah, you're unconscious. 
LIAM: Unconscious. 
MARISHA: Unconscious. 
MATT: You're unconscious. 
MATT: It was 50 feet of movement, she still has 30. She's going to move to-- 
SAM: Oh, she's done. 
MATT: Three. 
LAURA: Oh, she's going to try to knock-- Oh no, Chet. 
MATT: Is going to attack you, Chetney. 
LIAM: That's nasty. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's so nasty. 
MATT: It's going to be 21 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Chet. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
MARISHA: Fucking bullshit. 
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage and 11 points of force damage. 
SAM: It's 25. 
LIAM: Yeah, that gets you. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: No, Chet! 
TRAVIS: Deanna. 
LAURA: (laughs) "Deanna." 
MATT: Chetney falls unconscious. 
TALIESIN: Oh wait, shit! Wait, no. 
TRAVIS: I had such a good plan. 
TALIESIN: Wait, no, wait, wait. I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot, goddamn it. 
LAURA: Too late. 
TALIESIN: She should have had disadvantage on all these attacks. 
TRAVIS: Why? 
MATT: If she's within 15 feet of you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, if she's within 15 feet, never mind. 
MARISHA: She might've been on that last one? 
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No. [clattering] 
SAM: Oh god. 
TRAVIS: Everything's falling! 
LAURA: It's going to burn down! Candles! 
TALIESIN: You're right, you're right, you're right. 
LIAM: Stay focused. 
ASHLEY: Well, he's dead now, so it's your turn. 
TRAVIS: Unconscious. 
MARISHA: That last one? 
MATT: Actually going to land here and she's going to stay there. 
LAURA: Oh no, FCG. 
MATT: Attack on you, FCG. 
SAM: Bring it. 
MATT: That's going to be 25 to hit? 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: 15 points of slashing damage and two points of force damage. 
SAM: Not bad. 
MATT: So it's one, two, three, four, that's the end of her turn. 
TRAVIS: It was just before my turn. 
MATT: Chetney, make a death saving throw for me, please. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 10 or higher, right? 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Am I doing damage or am I picking someone up? 
TRAVIS: It's a seven. 
MATT: Seven, okay, so you fail your first death save. 
LAURA: Kill her, we got to get her. 
MATT: End of your turn, she's going to take a legendary action. 
MARISHA: I don't want her to get away. 
MATT: She's going to attack you, FCG. 
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought you were going to come after me. (laughter) 
MATT: No, this motherfucker is making her angry. She's going to-- That's another-- 20-- Oh, no. 27 to hit. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Right. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
MATT: That's going to be eight points of slashing damage and 10 points of force damage. 
SAM: Okay, that's fine, that's fine, it's fine, I'm fine, I'm beefy. 
MATT: All righty, finishing that, Ashton, you're up, with the Fearne on deck. 
MARISHA: Kill her, kill her. 
LAURA: Kill her! 
ASHLEY: Kill her. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LAURA: (high-pitched) Save us. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Bonus action, am I going to deal with a bonus action? 
SAM: Huh? 
LAURA: Do you have any more Mass Cure Wounds? 
SAM: I do. 
TALIESIN: Sorry, just making a plan. It's a stupid plan. I'm going to-- 
LAURA: Oh d'oh. 
TALIESIN: -- hit rage up again, I'm going to spend my bonus action pushing rage through. 
MARISHA: I'm fucking pulling my hair out. 
LAURA: You're pulling your hair out. 
MARISHA: Yes, I'm pulling my hair out, it's bad. 
TALIESIN: So last run. 
LAURA: You were pulling your hair out. 
TALIESIN: All right, cool, cool, cool. So the crystals start to get oddly translucent in this big fucking fiery thing and now the arm, my fucked up charcoal arm now has little bits where you can see through it, except everything's gotten very weird. I'm going to run straight to get advantage on this motherfucker right here. 
MATT: Okay, run straight here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want advantage, if I can get advantage with FCG or-- 
MATT: You can shift into the rock, technically, to get advantage with FCG, if you want to. 
TALIESIN: If you're okay with that. 
MATT: That's a rough terrain thing. I'll allow it, because of your power, I'll allow it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, also, terrain, I ignore terrain. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right, taking my first shot. Natural 20. (cheering) 
MATT: Great! 
MARISHA: Come on, come one! 
TRAVIS: Take your time, get your brutal criticals. 
ASHLEY: Get all the things. 
TRAVIS: Take your time. 
LIAM: Don't forget any of the bells and whistles. 
TRAVIS: Come on, charcoal arm. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop a chaos burst into this. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: For a random, let's find out what we get. Let's throw a-- Let's put some cold. Let's put a 1d8 worth of cold damage into this, too. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Is everything? One, two, three, four, yep. Nope, that one's cocked, and this one I can reroll. That's the same. So to do the math here. 14 is the base, so that's 12, 18, 20, 25, doubled. 
TRAVIS: 50. 
TALIESIN: That's 50, 64 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: Halved. 
LAURA: Why? 
MATT: Because she's resistant to damage in this form. 
TALIESIN: 32 points of damage. 
SAM: Resistant to damage. 
MATT: 32 points of damage. (loud thudding) "(grunts)" 
TALIESIN: (cackles) 
TRAVIS: Just because it's hot, all damage or specific types of damage or we don't know? 
MATT: You don't know. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
TALIESIN: The cold damage was halved, so-- 
MATT: So you gather that a lot of damage. 
TRAVIS: This form is bonkers. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Look at that face! What did you make?! She didn't even have her backpack on! 
ASHLEY: She doesn't even need her dang backpack. 
MATT: The backpack would've made this a really interesting maneuverability fight. 
LIAM: It's already interesting! 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I'm interested. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Do, do, do ♪ 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another hit on this motherfucker. 
LIAM: I don't know why you cry. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Do, do, do ♪ 
TALIESIN: How's she looking? 
MATT: I mean, she looks like she's taken some hits. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
SAM: What does that mean? 
MARISHA: We're committing, we're not getting out of it. 
ASHLEY: No, we can't. 
LIAM: No, no, no. 
SAM: We got two people down. 
LIAM: Get them up! Get them up! 
TALIESIN: It's your job to get them up. 
TRAVIS: There's a priority on those get ups. 
ASHLEY: (sighing) 
TRAVIS: Age before beauty. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: 17, 30 to hit. 
MATT: 30 to hit, that hits. I'm running out of shit by the way, guys. 
LAURA: We all are. 
MARISHA: What do you mean? 
TALIESIN: Yep, I know. 
LIAM: I ran out of shit. 
TALIESIN: Seven-- 
LIAM: I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel. 
TALIESIN: Sorry, seven, 21 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I want to shift her. 
TRAVIS: How did he get over there? 
TALIESIN: I want to shift her one space to the right towards me. Back to the right to get her away from FCG. 
MATT: So over here, this way? You can move her-- 
TALIESIN: I can move her in any direction when I hit her. 
MATT: You can, but any direction you move her, you occupy a lot of space. So the best you could probably push her is this way or towards the other people, up to you. 
TALIESIN: I'll actually push her towards everybody else. So everybody has a shot of getting in. 
MATT: Okay, there we go. 
TALIESIN: There. Then I'm going to occupy a bunch of that runaway space and I'm going to try and crowd in. 
MATT: Whereabouts? 
TALIESIN: Come in back into-- 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20. There? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, into melee. 
MATT: Okay, there you go. 
TALIESIN: I used my bonus action. 
LIAM: Got two flank spots. 
TALIESIN: Shit, that's okay. 
MATT: You got it, okay, that finishes your turn. at the end of your turn. 
TALIESIN: Legendary action. 
MATT: She's going to legendary action against FCG again. 
TALIESIN: Shit, sorry, I tried. 
MATT: That's going to be a 29 to hit. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: That's going to be 15 points of slashing damage and 11 points of force damage. 
SAM: 26. 
MATT: 26. 
LAURA: Are you still alive? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: But not doing great. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs is fucking useless. 
MATT: Fearne, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
TRAVIS: I can feel my heart through my shirt. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Fuck this shit up! 
ASHLEY: All right, I am going to do Flaming Marisha Rays at 5th-level. Okay. 
MATT: All right, so that's going to be three, four, five, six rays? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: All right, so six. Roll six attacks against her. 
LIAM: Come on, Fearnie. 
ASHLEY: 22? 
MATT: Misses. 
TRAVIS: 24 is the threshold in this? 
LAURA: 25. 
LIAM: 25, I think, yeah. 
ASHLEY: 27. 
MATT: That hits. 
ASHLEY: 27. 
MATT: Hits. 
SAM: Damn. 
ASHLEY: 13. 
MATT: Two more. 
ASHLEY: 24. 
MATT: Just misses. 
LIAM: Just misses, it's 25. 
LAURA: 25 is the threshold. 
ASHLEY: Bitch! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
MATT: It's okay. 
TALIESIN: Cocked. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
TRAVIS: Pool Hall Ashley. 
TALIESIN: I know! 
MATT: I know, it's cocked. 
ASHLEY: It's almost a 20. 
MARISHA: Otohan brings out the worst in us. 
TALIESIN: Cocked. 
LAURA: Is that the dice? 
MATT: It's the fucking dice. 
ASHLEY: Yes, it is, leave me alone. 
MATT: It's okay, it's okay, Ashley, whatever you want to do. 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
MATT: It's okay! 
ASHLEY: Okay, 26. 
MATT: Hits. 
ASHLEY: Sweet! 
MATT: So three hits, so 6d6 fire damage. 
ASHLEY: "Leave me alone." 
LAURA: "Bitch!" 
SAM: "I like rolling my dice that only rolls correct once every eight times." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That "bitch" had so much passion in it. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: "Bitch!" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I was so mad, okay, wait. Then I get a d8 for every-- 
TRAVIS: Fucking had a shockwave. 
ASHLEY: Because it's-- (stammering) 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched laugh) 
ASHLEY: -- an additional d8 because fire damage. 
MATT: Indeed you do. 
MARISHA: Dugga dugga dugga. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: Okay, first hit. How cool: Three points. Where'd he go? Oh, there he is. 
LAURA: You killed him. 
MARISHA: What if that was it, though? That'd be so cool. 
LAURA: Three points. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, three points. 
MATT: Three points. 
ASHLEY: To start, not to brag. 
SAM: It's me and then she goes? 
ASHLEY: Four points, not to fucking brag for the second hit. 
LAURA: But she might get another attack after Fearne. She might get another attack after her. 
ASHLEY: Eight points. 
MATT: Okay, so 15 plus the d8. 
ASHLEY: Plus the d8. 
LAURA: Will she take you down with one more hit? 
ASHLEY: Plus an additional five. 
MATT: Okay. They impact and they burn and scar, but you see they're not quite burning as heavily as you expect. She seems to be resistant to fire damage. 
ASHLEY: How cool, so I'm fucking useless. Have fun. 
MATT: No, it's still damage, that's still damage. 
LAURA: No, no! 
ASHLEY: (frustrated groan-yell) I'm so mad, guys, I'm so mad. 
LAURA: Do you have a bonus you can do? Do you have healing? Can you heal FCG? 
MARISHA: Healing Word, bonus action. 
MATT: Already cast a spell. 
LAURA: Just kidding. 
ASHLEY: I can't, I can't. I just-- 
MARISHA: Never mind. Never mind. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to move a little closer to her, maybe behind the little crystal bits. 
MATT: Right here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Into melee with her? 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
MATT: Okay, there you go. All right. At the end of your turn, she's going to use her last legendary action. She's going to attack FCG. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: You again? 
MATT: That's going to be 32 to hit? 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
SAM: Just misses. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs is useless. 
MATT: You take-- 
MARISHA: Because she's still going to roll really high. 
SAM: This is going to kill me. 
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage and eight points of force damage. 
LAURA: Are you out? 
SAM: I'm out. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
LIAM: Fuck. 
LAURA: That was our shot. 
MATT: Carves FCG to the ground-- (slashing) 
LAURA: You guys take her out. 
MATT: -- and is going to push you 10 feet as part of that. 
MARISHA: So down, and down. 
MATT: She can do that, you're already prone. 
LAURA: We've got some big heavy hitters. 
MATT: Is going to blast that as part of the psionic strike that she gets on every attack now in this form. 
ASHLEY: She's too powerful! 
LAURA: No, you guys can take her out. 
LIAM: Fuck. 
MATT: FCG, it's your turn. Roll a death save for me, please. 
LIAM: So if I put a potion-- 
ASHLEY: I can't, this is so-- 
SAM: Now technically, Matt. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: -- Wail. 
LAURA: It's so far-- 
SAM: Somebody had a natural 20, and so I get advantage on my next d20 roll. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Is it Changebringer stuff? 
LIAM: Death save, death save-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm an idiot, there's no-- 
SAM: Thank god. 19. 
MATT: Okay, so that's one successful save. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: No, I'm up next. 
MATT: It's now the hound's turn. 
LAURA: You have a death save. 
SAM: Oh, thank god. 
TRAVIS: I keep forgetting about the fucking hound. 
MARISHA: So he runs. He runs to her. 
LAURA: If you pour a potion in FCG's mouth-- 
ASHLEY: Let's go, Caviar. 
LAURA: -- it's going to go through one-- 
MARISHA: Bark, bark, bark. 
TRAVIS: I would say on the other-- Well. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he can technically move through things, so whatever makes sense positioning-wise? 
LAURA: So she can take him down again. 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Before he can do anything. 
SAM: Someone's got to heal me so I can heal others. 
MARISHA: He's here to give advantage. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: He has advantage, right? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: -- get him up-- 
SAM: I wasn't in the middle. 
MATT: Yes, pack tactics. 
MARISHA: Her AC is 25? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: So he has to roll a natural 20-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: -- in order to hit. Which he could, he could. He does not. 
SAM and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: Okay, yeah. It was worth a shot, it was worth a shot. 
MARISHA: He does not. 
MATT: The saving throws are helpful. 
SAM: ♪ (vocalizing) ♪ 
MARISHA: But he is there. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: He is there. 
TRAVIS: Growl? 
MARISHA: Yeah, he's an emotional support dog. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LAURA: ♪ Gloamglut ♪ 
MATT: Imogen, you're up. 
LAURA: ♪ Glot, glot ♪ 
MATT: Orym on deck. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: ♪ Gloamglut ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ Duba dop ba ♪ 
TRAVIS: He's snapping, but whiffing on the snaps. 
MARISHA: (frantic snaps) 
LAURA: Death save. Natural 20! 
LIAM: Pop up with one? 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: You have one hit point. 
MARISHA: You pop up. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: You pop back up. You pop back up. 
SAM: That's massive! 
MARISHA: That's huge! 
SAM: But that's your turn, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. That's it. 
ASHLEY: Just play dead. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: But that's great! That's massive! 
MARISHA: But that's fucking huge! 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: So I'm alive? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: You're up one hit point. 
MATT: You got one hit point on a natural 20. 
MARISHA: You're alive. 
LIAM: It's a big deal. 
LAURA: But that's my whole action? 
MATT: It's the end of your turn is when it happens, yeah. 
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to pretend like I'm still dead. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: For this moment in time. 
MARISHA: This is-- Oh my god. 
LAURA: Does she know? Does she know if I go-- (gasp of breath) 
MATT: Let me check something. 
SAM: Is it one hit point or is it stable? Either way, it's great. 
MATT: No, no, no, it's one hit point. 
LAURA: I'm alive. 
SAM: Great. 
LAURA: That's amazing. 
TRAVIS: He's checking if-- 
MATT: I'm checking to make sure if it happens at the beginning or the end of the turn. I think it's usually at the end of the turn. 
TRAVIS: If he hates your character-- 
TALIESIN: I've done a bunch of things really wrong. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It happens. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. 
ASHLEY: It happens. 
TALIESIN: I keep doing things and I'm like, oh for fuck sakes. 
ASHLEY: Why didn't I do this? 
TALIESIN: What is wrong with me? 
SAM: Why did he do this? 
ASHLEY: Why did I do do do this? 
MARISHA: I mean, I don't-- I'm looking at all my shit. 
ASHLEY: Why did I take a doodie on this? 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: I've done this so many times. Why is it so hard to find these rules? 
TRAVIS: At least you all have at least done a point of damage. 
LAURA: I know! Chet, you haven't been able to do anything! 
ASHLEY: I know, Chetters. 
LAURA: But you brought me back for a moment in time. 
TRAVIS: I am fucking USAA over here, just-- 
ASHLEY: Do you need more french fries? 
TALIESIN: Do you have any blood-- Well, you can't do any Blood Maledicts because you'll just fucking go down. 
TRAVIS: Old insurance agency. 
SAM: Oh. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: All of your Blood Maledicts will fucking kill you. 
MATT: Impossible to find. It's usually at the end of the turn, so we'll just go with that. 
SAM: Great, great. 
MATT: So you're at one hit point. You're conscious, but you're pretending you're dead. 
LAURA: Yeah, so she doesn't come and attack me again. 
MARISHA: Putting Bane on her is useless, right? 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Kind of. 
MATT: That brings us to Orym, with Laudna on deck. 
LIAM: Okay, so Orym's-- 
TALIESIN: Can you Bless? No you can't play. 
LIAM: Orym's on the ground. I use half my movement to pull myself up as I pull out Seedling, thrust the blade out, and send a Grasping Vine onto Otohan's back and whip myself toward her, and stab-- 
MATT: What's the distance on the vine? 
MARISHA: Makes her pretend-- 
LIAM: 30 feet. 
MATT: 30 feet? Okay. 
MARISHA: -- she sees something. 
MATT: Does she get a dex save? 
LIAM: I'm pulling myself to her. 
MATT: Correct, but the target is a person that's moving. 
LIAM: Okay, let me look it up for you. Let me look it up for you. 
SAM: It's an intelligence save. 
MARISHA: It is. 
LAURA: You could always pull yourself to Ashton and be within-- 
LIAM: That's true. I thought that was an auto-win, so if I know it's not an auto-win, I'll pull myself to Ashton and bounce off his chest and land across from the dog. 
MARISHA: I'm trying to think of hail marys-- 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: -- and I don't think there is one. I think we're in for some shit here. 
LIAM: So you feel Spider-Man thwip, pull myself in-- 
SAM: Should we just leave? 
LIAM: -- and start going to town. I'm in flanking with the dog. That is-- That misses, that's a 22. 
MATT: Misses. 
LIAM: That is a 26, which hits. 
MATT: That does hit. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm, hard to hit. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: I'm so cold. 
LIAM: 12 points of damage for that. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Fuck me. 
SAM: It's because I have no body fat. 
LIAM: That's 27 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
SAM: I'm so lean and athletic. 
LIAM: (groans) Eight points of damage. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
MATT: Reduced to four. 
TALIESIN: Anytime I crit-- 
LIAM: That's it. I'm done and I'm out. 
MATT: The energy around her that's this pressure that fills the air is absorbing the blows as they come through. All right, that finishes your turn. 
LIAM: I'm done. 
TALIESIN: Anytime I crit-- 
MATT: Laudna, you're up. 
TALIESIN: -- everyone gets advantage on their attacks for the full round. So I think crat, I critted last time. 
SAM: You cratted? 
TALIESIN: I cratted. 
MATT: Well, everyone has advantage anyway, because they completely flanked her. 
TALIESIN: But if anyone does a distance attack has advantage. 
MATT: Yeah, that's good to keep that in mind. Yeah. All right. 
LAURA: Failing it? 
MARISHA: And dies. 
MATT: Laudna. 
MARISHA: That's fucking lame! 
LIAM: Laudna, finish it. Let's go. 
MARISHA: (frustrated groan) 
TALIESIN: You have advantage on whatever you do. 
LAURA: You could get FCG up. 
MARISHA: Do I? (groans) Okay, well, okay. How far away is she? Where is she? 
TRAVIS: It's a tough choice. 
LIAM: She's in the middle of all of us. 
TRAVIS: Tough choice. 
ASHLEY: She's right here. 
MATT: She is locked in between all of them. 
LIAM: Right in front of Ashton. 
LAURA: You can get him back? 
MARISHA: (sighs) I think, well, if, can you roll hit die when you're down? Can you roll hit die? 
LIAM: That's a short rest thing. 
LAURA: No, but it's-- 
MARISHA: I have Wither and Bloom. 
LIAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: Which allows, I can pick somebody-- 
LAURA: To get to roll a hit die. 
MARISHA: -- to get up. 
MATT: Let me see. 
MARISHA: (mumbling spell description) 
MATT: Yeah, they can do that. 
LIAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: I'm sorry. 
MARISHA: Okay. No, no. It's-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's fucking, that's clutch. 
MARISHA: Okay. "In addition, one creature of your choice in that area--" 
MATT: Can spend a hit dice. 
MARISHA: "-- can spend a hit die and regain the number of hit points you roll plus my spellcasting ability modifier." Okay. 
LIAM: Oh, that's great. 
TALIESIN: That's amazing. 
MARISHA: So I will-- 
LAURA: If you-- Well, yeah yeah yeah. 
MARISHA: I'll do it at 3rd-level. I'll do it at third level. Wither and Bloom. Hang on, wait. Let me see. Let me make sure here. (mumbling spell description) 
TRAVIS: Love how I was fucking dead over on the steps and she just came over and reshanked me. 
MARISHA: "-- the number of hit dice that can be spent and added to--" 
LIAM: I don't like you. 
MARISHA: "-- increased by one--" 
TRAVIS: The most productive-- (laughs) 
MARISHA: "-- for each slot above second." 
TRAVIS: Killed me outright. 
TALIESIN: You're not in this scene. 
TRAVIS: Crawled over a little bit. 
MARISHA: Increases by one-- 
TRAVIS: (stabs) Jump somewhere, jumps around, stab. 
TALIESIN: This is a very smart opponent. 
TRAVIS: She's fucking rough! 
TALIESIN: Irritatingly smart. 
LAURA: She really hates dogs and wolves. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Could be. 
MARISHA: So I'll do a Wither and Bloom. 
LIAM: Sign her up to Vox Machina. 
MATT: Constitution save? 
MARISHA: At 2nd, or sorry, at 3rd-level. Constitution save. Disadvantage because my puppers. 
MATT: That's true. Disadvantage brings it to 13. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Fail. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: So I will allow FCG, you get to roll two hit dice and add my spellcasting modifier, which is plus five. 
SAM: 11 plus five. 
LAURA: Nice! 
ASHLEY: Okay! 
MARISHA: To get you up. Then that's 3d6. So not a ton of damage here. 
SAM: Not bad! 
LAURA: But not terrible. 
MARISHA: But I get FCG up. 
LIAM: Yeah. Damage and get someone up? 
SAM: I'll take it! 
LIAM: That's huge. 
MARISHA: That is a sucky roll. I am going to spend a sorcery point to Empower this spell. 
MATT: Yeah. Because you can do that now. 
MARISHA: Because I can do that even though I'm not, it's a-- Just fucking why is this fucking program? 
TRAVIS: I keep seeing drips of water and thinking we're being infiltrated. 
MARISHA: I'm going to reroll these two, come on. 
MATT: Go for it. 
LIAM: Come on, Laudy. 
MARISHA: Yeah, better. Six, seven, eight, 12 necrotic damage. 
MATT: 12 necrotic damage, all righty. That's reduced to six, but withers, takes the hit. She seems to be in this mode where every hit, she's focused right now in the process of feeling that fury. 
SAM: Is she going to die? 
ASHLEY: Wait, is she taking any-- 
LIAM: Yes, she is. 
TALIESIN: She's taking damage. 
MATT: She's taking damage. 
MARISHA: How far away is she? 
TRAVIS: She's in fury, so she's like-- 
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: She's berserked. 
MARISHA: How far away is she? She's 30ish feet away from me? 
MATT: She is 35ish. 
TRAVIS: Like Grog berserker rage. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Comparable. 
MARISHA: 35ish. 35ish? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Or 30? 
MATT: I'm just eyeballing it from here. I'd say she is 35 feet from you. Yeah, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yeah, it's just out. 
TALIESIN: You can move. 
MATT: Yeah, you haven't moved yet. 
MARISHA: I haven't, but I want to suck her soul out, and I've got 30 feet. I don't think I can get her. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Oh, you need to walk up to her. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Right? I don't-- 
LAURA: You have to be touching. 
MARISHA: Five, 10, 15-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, she's 35. It's 30 feet. 
TRAVIS: Can you jump? No. 
TALIESIN: Because if she's 35 feet away, that means that-- 
MATT: Well, that is also rough terrain, which means to move across that is an additional five feet. So if you're physically moving, then it's going to take you a little more. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Come fly with me ♪ 
MARISHA: Okay. I know, right? 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Let me scooch around this way. 
MATT: This way? 
MARISHA: Yeah, hug this wall, but-- 
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. You can get there. 
MARISHA: That's good, that's good. Then I will Quicken a spell, and I'm going to dump another round of Eldritch Blasts into her. Eldritch Blasts. These are all still at advantage, right? 
TALIESIN: Yep. All attacks against her-- 
MATT: Yeah, all attacks against her are at advantage. 
TALIESIN: -- are at advantage. 
MARISHA: So we got 25 to hit, so I need to roll 13 ups on these. Hit. Natural 19. 
LIAM: She's coming up, right? 
MARISHA: Hit with a natural 15. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. She's up after this. 
MARISHA: Miss with a one and a five. So that's 2d10 plus five each, so 2d10, plus-- Jesus, that sucks. Eight and eight, 16 damage. 
MATT: Okay. Reduced to eight. All right. Does that finish your turn? 
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah, I guess it does. 
MATT: Okay. Top of Otohan's turn as the energy around her is heating the space almost, just the energy (static buzzing) arcing across. Her feet are barely off the ground now as her blades are out, and she's now partially floating as she begins to try and swing. She is going to go ahead and-- 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
MATT: -- first unleash on you, Orym. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to be 25 to hit? 
LIAM: Yeah, hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: She's quite powerful. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
SAM: I don't know that we win. 
MATT: -- 13 points of slashing damage and seven force. 
MARISHA: You're up, though, you're up. 
SAM: I know. 
MATT: Next attack on you. 
TALIESIN: Got to heal, you got to heal. 
MATT: Natural 20. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Everybody. 
TRAVIS: Matt! 
MARISHA: I do, I do. 
TRAVIS: Unbelievable! 
MATT: I roll a lot of attacks. I haven't got as many 20s as I would think for it. 
LIAM: She's got three attacks left. 
TALIESIN: Everybody out of unconscious. 
LAURA: She just got a crit. 
LIAM: This one's a crit. 
SAM: There's only one person-- 
MATT: This is going to be-- 
SAM: You're unconscious, right? 
ASHLEY: What are you at? 
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage-- 
TALIESIN: Everyone's going to be unconscious. 
MATT: -- and 18 points of force damage. 
LIAM: Okay, I take it. What was the force? 
MATT: 18 as well. 
LIAM: 18 as well. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: There might be another one that's more clutch. I don't know. It's so hard to gauge. Fuck. 
MATT: Next attack is going to be on you. 
LIAM: Yeah, of course. 
MATT: That's going to be a 26 to hit? 
LIAM: That hits. It's going to be close here. 
MATT: Not a great damage roll. That's going to be 12 points of slashing damage and five force. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LIAM: Five force, okay. 
LAURA: That was a big hit. 
MATT: Then fourth attack on you. 
LIAM: Crit was huge. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: That's going to be 24 to hit. 
LIAM: Hits. 
MATT: Okay. That's going to be-- 
LIAM: It's going to be close. 
MATT: -- 14 points of slashing damage and 10 force. 
LIAM: Just barely up. 
MATT: Bonus action. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: She pulls out of the side of her satchel, this vial. 
LAURA: No! 
MATT: Drinks a supreme healing potion. 
TRAVIS: What?! 
LIAM: That's not that much, that's an additional hit. 
MARISHA: But she's drinking a healing potion. 
ASHLEY: She's drinking a healing potion. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: That's 12. 
LAURA: We shouldn't have given-- 
MATT: 13, 14, 15. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Y'all. 
DANI: (faintly) Fuck you! 
MATT: 31. (laughter) 
LAURA: What did she say? (laughter) 
SAM: Dani just yelled: Fuck you! (laughter) 
LIAM: 15-second delay. 
MATT: 46 plus 20. 
MATT: 66 she heals. 
LAURA and SAM: 66?! 
LIAM: 66. I take back my statement. 
MARISHA: What do you mean 66? 
LAURA: 66 points? 
MATT: Supreme healing potion. Yeah, it's plus 20 to what you rolled here. 
ASHLEY: What? Have we been doing it? 
LIAM: It's done. Keep going, it's close. 
ASHLEY: Whatever, that's fine. 
LAURA: We've never gotten a supreme. 
SAM: Those are worth-- 
TRAVIS: It's very rare. Very, very rare. 
SAM: -- 5,000 gold. 
ASHLEY: Supreme, supreme. 
LAURA: At least. 
MATT: You're not the only ones who can heal. 
LAURA: Supreme! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: 66. 
LAURA: 66?! 
TRAVIS: Hey, Matt? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right, y'all. Buckle up, we're in for the long haul. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: I don't know, man. 
MARISHA: We're going to be here 'til 1:00am. 
SAM: I don't know, man. 
ASHLEY: N, no, no. 
TRAVIS: I got this. I got this. 
LIAM: Press it. 
MARISHA: We got this. We got this. 
LIAM: Press it. Press it. 
ASHLEY: I got an idea. 
MARISHA: Press! 
TRAVIS: As long as I don't roll-- 
MARISHA: Bitches be pressed. 
TRAVIS: -- a natural one, we're fine. (laughs) 
LIAM: It was almost a one. It was almost a one! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 13! 
LIAM: It was a one for 0.3 seconds. 
ASHLEY: I don't like that. 
TRAVIS: It really flashed one and then rolled over! 
SAM: How many death saves do you have? One? 
MATT: It was one failed and one successful. 
TRAVIS: (whines) 
SAM: Oh, god. 
MATT: All right. End of your turn? 
TRAVIS: Well, I let out a small fart. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: End of your turn. 
ASHLEY: I smell it. (laughs) 
MATT: Spend a legendary action to attack Orym again. 
LAURA: He's not dead yet! 
ASHLEY: It's a Chet fart. 
MATT: That's going to be 26 to hit. 
LIAM: Hits. I'm going to go down. I'm down. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: See? I told you. 
MATT: 13 points of slashing damage and four force. 
LIAM: Down. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're down. Okay. Four down, we are four down. 
LIAM: Press. 
MARISHA: Well no, no, no. 
SAM: What does that mean, four down? 
MARISHA: FCG's back. FCG's back. 
ASHLEY: Wait, who's this back here? 
SAM: We're two down. 
TRAVIS: Three down. 
MARISHA: Two down. 
LAURA: That's Laudna. 
TRAVIS: One, two, three. 
SAM: She's up. 
TRAVIS: Imogen's up? 
MARISHA: She's up. 
MATT: That is-- 
LAURA: Evoroa. 
TRAVIS: I can't count. 
MATT: -- Evoroa. She's hiding the fuck away from this. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: Now it's just two down. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Two down, two up. 
MATT: That's going to-- 
TRAVIS: I'm going to get another cheeseburger. 
LAURA: That's Ashton. 
MATT: Finish Chetney's go. Ashton, you're up, with Fearne on deck. 
TALIESIN: Bonus action. I'm literally going to bottoms up. That's three, six. 
SAM: On yourself? 
TALIESIN: Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: He's very close 
LIAM: It's a bonus action. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, because I'm not going to be able to get anybody up. 
TRAVIS: But in her state, isn't that 120-- 
LAURA: Yeah, because we won't be able to-- That's 120 points. 
TRAVIS: She's still super cranked, right? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yep. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's 120 points of damage we'll have to do to her. Or 100 and-- 
LIAM: Yep. 
MARISHA: Because it's halved? 
LAURA: Because everything's halved. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: We got to run. 
TALIESIN: I had advantage, so I'm fucking going for it. 
ASHLEY: We can't run. 
MARISHA: We can't. 
LIAM: There's nowhere to go. We'll never get out of here. She'll run us down. 
MARISHA: She has like 150 feet of movement. 
TALIESIN: Because you're next. 
MARISHA: We tried that last time. 
TALIESIN: Oh, here we go. Round number one. 
ASHLEY: Fucking piece of shit. 
TALIESIN: Natural 20. 
LIAM: Yo! 
ASHLEY: Yes, baby! 
LIAM: Fucking pulverized. 
TALIESIN: So one, two, three. One, two, three, four. I'm going to take that extra d6 that you gave me. Thank you, thank you, FCG. I'm going to put that into this, too. That's not bad. 
SAM: Can you heal somebody? 
LIAM: Orym's probably the priority right now, because he'll get murdered. Other bodies down are at distance. 
TALIESIN: 16, 16 times two is-- 
MARISHA: I still have Wither and Blooms I could do. 
TALIESIN: Is-- 16 times two is 26, 32. Plus 14, six. 
LAURA: You're still down, FCG? 
TALIESIN: 46 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay, so 23. 
SAM: I'm just on the floor. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: (whooshes) "(panting)" 
LAURA: How many did you just do? 
MATT: It's energy and mist-- 
TALIESIN: 46, run down to 23. 
MATT: -- is pouring out of the sides of her mouth. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: You can see the lightning bolts now creeping up underneath the armor, the neck high armor, it's like (crackles). 
TALIESIN: Rolling again. 
LIAM: Go. Pulp. 
TALIESIN: Fuck me, 24. 
MATT: 24 misses. 
ASHLEY: Goddamn it! 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 
MATT: Or it hits, but the invisible psychic shield just flashes it off, deflection. She breaths heavy. Does that finish your turn? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I guess that finishes my turn. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. You got anything? 
MATT: End of your turn, Ashton? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: She's going to spend another attack to retort against you. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: That's going to be 21 to hit? 
TALIESIN: That just hits, yeah. 
MATT: Okay, that's going to be 16 points of slashing damage reduced to eight. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: And 10 points of force damage. That-- 
TALIESIN: 18 points. 
MATT: Okay. Fearne, you're up. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: With FCG on deck. 
ASHLEY: I am going to cast Aura of Life. In a 30-foot radius, if you're by me, you gain a hit point if you go down to zero. Correct? I think. 
SAM: If you're at zero or if you-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, wait. Wait. 
LAURA: If you drop to zero, you get an extra hit point? 
ASHLEY: You drop-- Yeah. So, technically, you just stay up. 
TRAVIS: What if you're already-- 
LIAM: It doesn't help people who are down. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but that was my question was what if people are down. Is it helpful? 
LIAM: Right. 
ASHLEY: Because if it's not, I have another idea. 
MATT: No. When it starts its turn within the aura, with zero hit points, it gains a hit point. But it has to start its turn within the aura. 
LIAM: It's preventative, right? 
LAURA: Anybody that starts their-- 
TRAVIS: 30 feet of you. 
LAURA: That's great. 
MATT: Yeah, within 30 feet of you. 
ASHLEY: It's something. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: So even if they're down-- 
ASHLEY: They come up. 
LIAM: At the start of your turn? 
LAURA: That would be Chet and Orym. 
ASHLEY: So at least-- 
LAURA: Okay, that's great. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's good. 
ASHLEY: At least you're going to come up. 
TALIESIN: That's good. 
LIAM: That's good. 
ASHLEY: That's what I got. 
TALIESIN: How long does that aura, instantaneous, or does it hold up for a while? 
MATT: I mean, it's 10 minutes concentration. 
ASHLEY: 10 minutes. 
TALIESIN: Okay, 10 minutes. All right. What else you got? 
ASHLEY: All right. So that-- 
TALIESIN: That's good, though. 
ASHLEY: I'll get that up and running. That's out there. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
LAURA: She did a aura. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Then-- 
LAURA: If you go down to zero points within 30 feet of her-- 
ASHLEY: That's what I got. 
LAURA: -- you get a hit point. 
ASHLEY: Bonus action. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's cool. Oh, that's cool. That's good. That's good. 
TALIESIN: Anything. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, I can't do anything else. I can-- 
TALIESIN: Do you have anything in bonus action? 
ASHLEY: Nope. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
ASHLEY: That finishes my turn. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, guys. 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: You did great. 
MATT: End of your turn, legendary action, last legendary action to attack you. She's going to attack you with Scream Needle, the offhand blade. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That'll be 25 to hit. That hit? 
ASHLEY: Yes, that hits. I'm sorry. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I don't think that would be considered a-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. Oh, no. But it's the other one. Oh, hold on. Down further. 
ASHLEY: No, this is for-- 
TALIESIN: There's something. I think. 
MATT: 10 points of piercing damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Seven points of force damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So that's 17. Scream Needle, when you make concentration check, the DC is doubled. 
TALIESIN: Ouch. 
MATT: Roll a constitution saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Also, you do 1d8 fire damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: So 1d8 fire damage because I did the Armor of Agathys. 
MATT: Correct. So roll that damage. 
ASHLEY: Let me do that. So one of these guys. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Five. 
MATT: Okay. So five points damage reduced to two. 
ASHLEY: Then, I am rolling a concentration. 
MATT: Yes, constitution saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Constitution. Saving throw. Oh shit. Oh that's a 10. 
MATT: Your Aura of Life fades. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Oh! Fuck! 
MATT: Spell concentration broken. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) I mean, this is a legendary back and forth. 
MATT: She is a Legend of the Peaks, man. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Maybe we should try and run, collapse the tunnel behind us. I don't know. It ain't looking good. 
MATT: That finishes Fearne's turn. FCG, it's your turn. 
SAM: Is she going to do anything in the betweens? 
MATT: I mean, she did. She knocked her spell out. 
SAM: Oh, she did that. 
LAURA: Yeah, so. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: At the start of my turn, it's not an action or anything, I believe, I'm going to flip my coin. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Of the divine? 
SAM: And ask the Changebringer run or fight. Oh, wait, no. Run? It's a yes, no question. What do I get? 
MATT: (sighs) I feel challenge prescripting a yes or no on this because I don't know what other dice might go for it. I'll say it lands on its side. It's one of those things where I-- 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: I cannot, and thus the gods cannot make that decision for you. 
SAM: Well then, shit. Okay. Okay. 
TRAVIS: If there's any way to get out, I think with the 66 points of healing being 120 points of damage, if you can get out or start to move, you might want to try. I don't know if we stay here if we make it. 
MARISHA: She moves so fast, though. 
TRAVIS: Or she'll take revenge. 
SAM: I know. That's the thing. Two of us are down. They can't even move. I guess they could be carried out. 
LAURA: Can't you Mass Heal them? 
SAM: I can, but then I can't do anything else. 
TALIESIN: That's literally what you do, though, is heal everybody. 
SAM: I know. I know. 
TALIESIN: Mm. Welcome to Caduceus Land. 
SAM: Okay. That's what I have to do. 
TRAVIS: Banishment tricks or anything like that? 
MARISHA: Getting people up is better than not. 
SAM: Of course. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, because that's damage. 
LAURA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's the damage of the healers, that they keep everyone up so they can keep playing. 
LAURA: It only makes sense to do the damage in this moment if what you're going to do is going to knock her out, but it won't. It's multiple turns after that. 
TRAVIS: Furious. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. It might. All right. I will Mass Cure Wounds. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: That's my 6th-level spell. So, this is a good amount of healing. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Okay, 12, 15. Terrible rolls. 20. I have this other feature that gets me another d4. 23 points. 
TRAVIS: Everybody. 
MATT: 23 points to everyone within 30 feet. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: Well, one person doesn't get it, right? It's six people max. 
MATT: Right. So who doesn't get it? 
TRAVIS: Somebody else take it. 
ASHLEY: I don't need it. 
SAM: Okay. Fearne doesn't get it. 
ASHLEY: I mean. 
LAURA: How many points? 
ASHLEY: It's okay. 
SAM: What'd I just say? 
TALIESIN: 23. 
LAURA: 23. 
ASHLEY: You guys need it way more than I do. 
LAURA: Plus anything or just 23? 
LIAM: Just 23. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That helps. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Shit. I wouldn't have had this if I didn't fucking-- 
TRAVIS: Dude, I don't fucking know, man. 
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's okay. That was great. 
SAM: Was it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. Am I on my ass? I'll stand up. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: 10 feet. 
LAURA: It's not going to happen. 
MATT: Still have 15 feet of movement. 
SAM: Yeah. I'll start running. 
MARISHA: Because you can do, like, a circle. 
MATT: Want to go? 
SAM: Which way is out? 
MATT: You guys were heading this direction. 
SAM: Huh? 
MATT: You guys were heading this direction. 
SAM: I'll go that way. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I am so slow. By the time I get over there, the fight's over. 
TALIESIN: Well, and-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, where's the backpack? 
SAM: It's over where someone else is lying. 
MATT: It's over here. 
LAURA: I'm right next to it. 
SAM: Imogen's lying there right now anyway. 
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 
MATT: Does that finish your turn? 
SAM: No, I have a bonus action. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Put on the backpack. 
SAM: I will-- Who's next? 
LIAM: Imogen. 
LAURA: I'm next. 
MARISHA: Caviar. 
LIAM: Oh, Caviar? Sorry. 
TALIESIN: Caviar, then Imogen. 
LIAM: Caviar's not on Laura's list. 
LAURA: (laughs) Sorry. 
MARISHA: Caviar runs up-- 
TALIESIN: If you want to give Imogen something-- 
MARISHA: Wait, is it my turn? Oh, wait. It's still your turn. 
LIAM: He was thinking of bonus. 
MATT: Yeah no, it's Caviar's turn. Go for it. 
LIAM: Did you have a bonus action? 
SAM: Did you ever use my d6? 
LAURA: Not yet. 
SAM: Okay. I'll give somebody else a d6. Everybody needs something. 
MATT: How are you on stress? 
SAM: This will do it. I'm at 18 and this is 19, so. Who's after me? 
TALIESIN: Imogen. 
SAM: I'll give Chetney a d6. 
TRAVIS: I don't know if I'll be alive. You sure? 
ASHLEY: Orym? 
TALIESIN: Orym. 
MARISHA: Orym or Laudna. 
SAM: What do you mean you'll be alive? You're alive. 
TALIESIN: Not for long. 
TRAVIS: I know, but Otohan's turn is before mine, and it's happened twice. 
MARISHA: Give it to Orym. 
LIAM: One of the people who can land-- 
TRAVIS: You might waste it. 
LIAM: -- an attack on Otohan. 
SAM: Okay, I'll give it to Orym. My glass orb in the center of my chest turns red. 
LIAM: Oh, great. 
TRAVIS: Oh, and we're going to come running towards you and you're going to cut us down. (laughs) 
MATT: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Where are you? 
SAM: I'm on my way out. 
LAURA: Okay. You're that way? 
ASHLEY: What if this is a TPK? 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: It could be. 
LIAM: It could be. 
TRAVIS: I mean, it happens. 
LIAM: It happens. 
TRAVIS: It happens. 
MARISHA: I mean, we're so-- I mean-- 
ASHLEY: It's okay. We'll cross that bridge if we get there. 
MARISHA: We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. 
ASHLEY: We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. We're going to be fine. 
MARISHA: We've had Hail Marys before. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we have. We have. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. 
MARISHA: It's my dog. 
MATT: It's your dog. 
MARISHA: Is my dog still base to base? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: I mainly care about my dog being base to base. 
SAM: Fuck your dog. 
TRAVIS: Come on Caviar, let's go! 
MARISHA: My dog has given me advantage on spell check. 
SAM: I know. I know. 
ASHLEY: Let's go, Caviar. 
TRAVIS: No whiffs. 
MARISHA: Oh, man. 
SAM: He barks. 
MARISHA: It's so close. 23? 
SAM: He barks. 
LIAM: Nope. 
TRAVIS: Nope. 
MARISHA: 23 misses, right? 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: 25 is a motherfucker. 
MATT: 23 misses, yeah. 
MARISHA: But he's there, he's base to base. He's giving advantage. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: Imogen. 
SAM: (burps) 
MATT: Imogen, you're up. 
SAM: Oh my god, I'm nervous burping. 
TALIESIN: You have advantage. (laughter) 
LAURA: On what? 
TALIESIN: Everything, anything that has a d20 roll is at advantage because I hit a crit. 
ASHLEY: Say again? 
LAURA: Balls. 
TALIESIN: I hit a crit, which means anything with a d20 roll until my turn is at advantage. 
LAURA: That's great. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: For everybody? 
TALIESIN: Yup. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: There's so many things that-- 
MARISHA: I know. I know. I know. Come on. 
LAURA: I'm going to Hail Mary this. 
MATT: Yeah. 
SAM: You're going to Polymorph her into a frog. (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
LAURA: To my mother, I'm going to say: Otohan has us in the tunnels. It's about to be over. Help. 
MATT: She responds, "I don't-- I'll try to find you. I don't know how fast I can get there. I'll try to find you." 
LAURA: I take off my circlet. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: To help her. 
LIAM: Wow. 
LAURA: I don't know if that'll work. 
LIAM: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
LIAM: (sighs heavily) 
LAURA: I'm going to reach back. As my movement, can I put on that backpack? Is that a free action to put on the backpack? 
MATT: No. 
LAURA: No? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: That's okay. 
MATT: But you can go over and crawl to it if you want to, or you can get up. Your call. 
LAURA: I kind of want to just keep pretending that I'm dead. 
MATT: Okay. You can stay there, if you want. 
LAURA: That's so shitty. 
TALIESIN: Unless you got something. 
ASHLEY: It's not shitty. 
TALIESIN: If you don't got something-- 
MARISHA: It's not shitty at all. 
TALIESIN: -- it keeps you alive for another round. 
ASHLEY: Stay alive. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
LAURA: I mean, I can try to do some damage to her. 
TALIESIN: Anything worthwhile or any effect? I don't know. 
SAM: Have her burn her last resistance, at least? 
LAURA: It's not a resis-- It's like a cantrip. 
SAM: Just do anything that she needs to resist against. Oh, you can only do cantrips? 
LAURA: No, it's a cantrip. 
SAM: Oh, because Sending's a spell. Yeah, got you. 
LAURA: Yeah, so. 
TALIESIN: You may want to hold all that. 
TRAVIS: I mean, we're covered in blood. Unless she goes around staking everybody, which she might, just to check. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Playing dead could actually be a-- Oh, I can't believe I'm saying that. Could be an option? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: What? What? 
LAURA: I'm going to stay down there. This is dumb! I feel like I should hit her. 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: It was a good Hail Mary. 
LAURA: We should try to do as much damage as we can, right? 
TRAVIS: A hundred points. 
TALIESIN: She's smarter than us. I say, I don't know, unless you got something that actually does anything of-- Because it'll bring attention to you. 
LAURA: Okay. She'd probably resist it is the thing. It's an intelligence saving throw. She would resist it, probably. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Then she would know I'm alive. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to not do it. 
MARISHA: How many resistances is she on-- 
LAURA: But she wouldn't even have to resist that. She would just-- Do you know what I mean? She wouldn't waste a resistance on 3d6. 
TALIESIN: No. That's five points. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Finish your turn? Okay. Orym, you're up. Laudna on deck. 
LIAM: Orym, a complete bloody mess, pushes himself up. Hex is gone. He can barely move. He's exhausted. But his father wouldn't stop protecting his friends, and neither would his husband. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LIAM: 26. 
MATT: Hits. 
LIAM: 10 points of damage. 
MATT: Reduced to five. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. Okay. 
LIAM: 22 misses. 
MARISHA: Fucking piece of shit. 
LIAM: 23 misses. 
ASHLEY: Goddamn it. 
TALIESIN: Is that all with advantage? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: He's too weak. His sword hangs at his side and he just sways in front of her. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
MATT: You going to stay put? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Laudna, you're up. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Ooh. 
MARISHA: He's got this face. 
LAURA: Yeah, he's got this face-- 
MARISHA: He's got this face like he knows. 
LAURA: -- like I'm about to kill you all. 
MARISHA: He knows we're about to all die. 
TRAVIS: We're going into uncharted territory, kids. Nine years! 
LAURA: I really thought we could take her this time. 
MARISHA: This is going to be a terrible idea. This is a terrible idea. 
LAURA: I really thought we could take her this time. 
TALIESIN: As opposed to all the other ideas we have. 
TRAVIS: What does she want? What does she want? She just wants to exterminate us, right? She doesn't want Imogen. 
ASHLEY: Maybe we should ask her. 
SAM: Well yeah, maybe she just wants to talk. 
MARISHA: Being connected to Imogen, I hear her little prayer to her mother. At least I'm going to say that. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: I'll allow it. I'll allow it. 
LIAM: Bonus action potion, right? I can do that on a bonus action to drink it? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. I'll do that. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Maybe I should do that, too. 
MARISHA: Goddamn it. She's going to-- 
LAURA: Obviously I'd be alive, though, if I drank a potion. 
ASHLEY: You're just like-- 
MATT: I mean. Even casting the spell would be its own-- 
TRAVIS: Get the Zima? Get the Zima on the ground. 
LAURA: Oh, really? 
MATT: Well, it's like laying on your side. I'm allowing it, but that's getting-- 
LAURA: Look at all the shit around her. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, she's busy. 
MATT: That's true, that's true. That's true. 
TRAVIS: Get a little Zima sip. 
MARISHA: Hearing-- This is stupid. Whatever, I don't know. I'm not going to project. Maybe it's not. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
MARISHA: Hearing Imogen call out for her mom, I'm going to cast Phantasmal Force on Otohan, and what she is going to see through the side tunnel is Lilian Temult floating in, and she is going to call out, and she's going to go, "Otohan. Are you going to kill an exalted Ruidusborn?" And basically force choke her and say, "Stand down!" 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: What's the saving throw? 
MARISHA: She's got disadvantage because my doggo. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Intellect. 
MATT: That's a natural 16. And a natural 20. 
MARISHA: Disadvantage. 
MATT: I know. but that's a natural 16 plus five. That's going to put her at 21. 
MARISHA: No. 
TRAVIS: That was such a fucking great idea. 
MATT: That was a really, really good idea. 
ASHLEY: That was a really cool idea. 
MATT: Oh, I'm rolling really good. 
LAURA: She's rolling so well. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, she's rolling well. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: I can still Quicken a spell. 
TRAVIS: You got it. You got it. You got it. 
MARISHA: This is fucking stupid. 
TRAVIS: You got it. You got it. 
MATT: I know. I know. 
MARISHA: Well, I can't do that again, right? That's dunzos. That's done. 
TRAVIS: That's how it goes. 
MARISHA: Three Eldritch Blasts. 
TALIESIN: All at advantage. 
LAURA: That's great. 
ASHLEY: All at advantage. 
LAURA: All at advantage. How do you want to do this? 
MATT: Because of your last round? 
MARISHA: So, what is this? What am I working with here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, advantage 'til the end of my turn. 
MARISHA: So I need to roll plus 12. So I need to roll 13 ups on these? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Both natural 18s. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
MARISHA: Negative, eight and seven. Yeah. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
MATT: All righty. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: So a hit and a crit. 
MARISHA: A hit and a crit. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: So for-- I'm going to cry. So for the hit, just the straight hit. That's not great. That's seven damage. For the crit, come on, daddy. Big money. I'm going to Empower the spell because that was a one. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: That's not much better. That's a three. So that is six plus five for 11. 
MATT: 11. Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm burning through my Sorcerer Points. 
MATT: All right. That finishes your go? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Oh, here she comes ♪ 
LAURA: Should she get another Action Surge, or did she already use her last Action Surge? 
MATT: When this happens, she refills both her action surges. 
LIAM: Both. 
SAM: Both. 
TRAVIS: Hold me. (mock wails) 
MARISHA: What do you mean, "When this happens"? 
LAURA: When she exalted Super Saiyan. 
MATT: When she went into her other form. 
SAM: She's a formidable opponent. 
TALIESIN: This maybe-- We may be fucked here. 
TRAVIS: We might have misjudged this one-- 
LAURA: We might? 
MATT: (sighs) Okay. 
TRAVIS: -- a tiddy bit. 
MARISHA: We could've rolled better on some things. 
MATT: It's a lot of good rolls. I've been rolling pretty good on a lot of this stuff too. 
TRAVIS: This is without a backpack. 
MARISHA: She's been rolling so fucking good. 
ASHLEY: This is without a backpack. 
TRAVIS: Without a shadow crew. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
LAURA: I think we forgot how much she whooped our ass that first time, how quickly. 
TRAVIS: It had been a minute. 
TALIESIN: I thought this was a smaller room. 
LAURA: I also thought it was because we ran. 
SAM: (shushing) 
MATT: First attack's going to be on Orym, since you're right there. 
LIAM: (chuckles) Everybody's right there. 
MATT: Yep, that's going to be a 33 to hit. 
MARISHA: (chuckles) 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Can you go nuclear again? 
LAURA: She's going to one-by-one, get all of you. 
TALIESIN: She's missed like two hits. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
LAURA: Can I just exalt myself? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Can you do that? 
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage and seven points of force damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Second attack on you. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: Actually, make a strength save for me. 
LIAM: Okay. That's a 21. 
MATT: Okay, yeah. You stay up, that's going to be a 26 to hit. 
LIAM: That hits. I'm down, you don't need to roll for that one. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I'm down. 
MATT: Orym falls unconscious once more. Going to turn and take the next hit on you, Fearne. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Is going to go ahead and attack you. That's going to be 19 to hit? 
ASHLEY: Shield? 
MATT: What's your AC? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: 17. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: 17, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Did I do it right? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: You Shielded! 
MARISHA: Okay! 
MARISHA: You Shielded! 
LIAM: And that-- 
SAM: You just won. 
TRAVIS: Nice! 
LIAM: -- up for the rest of-- 
ASHLEY: That's up for the rest? Okay, okay, okay. 
LIAM: That's up for the rest. 
MARISHA: Holy fuck, holy fuck. 
TRAVIS: Nice, Fearne! 
ASHLEY: (panicked moan) Let me find it, how do you spell? I before E. 
LIAM: Just remember. 
TRAVIS: The little wins. 
ASHLEY: (thinking noises) Where did it go? Hang on, hang on. 
LAURA: "Oh, I don't have Shield." (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I do have it, but I just don't know where it is. Where are my other spells? Why am I doing this wrong? 
TALIESIN: Try E before I if it's being a dick. 
MARISHA: I know, right? Unless your mom walks in the room like fucking Marlon Brando. 
ASHLEY: Whatever, I'll just leave it over here because I have it. So sorry. 
MARISHA: Come in and see your body. 
LAURA: At least she'll be pissed. 
MARISHA: She'll be fucking mad. 
LAURA: Oh wait, maybe-- 
MARISHA: Maybe she'll kill Otohan for us when we're already dead. 
TALIESIN: No, you had it. 
ASHLEY: I did have it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we talked about it. 
ASHLEY: Where the fuck did it go? I'm so sorry, hold on. 
LAURA: If she comes in, she's coming after-- 
ASHLEY: Why is this happening? 
LAURA: -- an assassination. 
LIAM: She won't be able to. 
ASHLEY: Did I not? 
TALIESIN: I think you did, it's being really-- Oh, you're stuck on cantrips right now. Hit "All." 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh. 
TALIESIN: There we are. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's also running really slow. 
ASHLEY: Oh, there it is. 
TALIESIN: There you are. 
ASHLEY: Okay, Shield. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was running really slowly, too. 
MATT: So you use your Shield. So your AC was 17 normally? 
ASHLEY: 17. 
MATT: So it's 22 until the end-- 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: -- of your next round. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: As the deflection hits, she's going to frustratingly turn and spin onto Ashton. 
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) 
MATT: That's going to be a 24 to hit. 
TALIESIN: That hits. 
LAURA: So you get three attacks as a fighter and then Action Surge gets you three more attacks? 
MATT: She's going to spend the Psionic power on that one to add extra knockdown, that's going to be 12 points of slashing damage, reduced to six. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: And 12 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: Oh god, really? 
MATT: Which goes straight through. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: That was one, two, three, four. Now final Action Surge. 
TALIESIN: 18 damage? Okay, that's a lot, damn. 
MARISHA: Final Action Surge. 
TALIESIN: Because I don't get to half that, do I? 
MATT: Not the force, no. 
TALIESIN: Okay, boo. 
MATT: Attacking you again. 20? 
TALIESIN: That hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. Just barely. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: (heavy exhale) 
MATT: Roll a strength save for me, with advantage. 
SAM: Who just went? 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
SAM: Whose turn is it next? 
ASHLEY: It is Chet. (chuckles) 
SAM: Chet. 
LAURA: Good job, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Oh man. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm fine. 
MATT: You're fine, okay. 
ASHLEY: It's Chet and then Ash. 
MATT: That is going to be 14 points of slashing damage, reduced to seven, and another 10 points of force damage. 
TALIESIN: Ow. 
LIAM: (nervous sigh) 
MATT: Second attack on you there. Natural 19. 
TALIESIN: Oh, 19's my AC. 
MATT: Natural 19, sorry. 
MARISHA: No, natural 19. 
TALIESIN: Oh, natural 19, never mind. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Make another strength save for me, by the way. 
TRAVIS: No bonus. 
LAURA: Don't you get to choose to detonate? 
TALIESIN: 24. 
MATT: 24, you're fine. 
LAURA: Or something, right? 
TALIESIN: I'm not, though. 
LAURA: Don't you get to choose-- 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
LAURA: -- to detonate? 
MATT: 15 points. No, wait, sorry, 16 points of slashing damage reduced to eight. 
TALIESIN: I'm down. 
TRAVIS: (heavy breath) 
TRAVIS: One. Two. 
LIAM: Wow. 
SAM: Oh wait, is he down? 
TALIESIN: I'm down. Oh wait, no, I'm not, I have two things. I have the barbarian thing first because I'm raging. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh? 
TALIESIN: Where I get to roll. 
MARISHA: Roll. Roll, bitch. 
TALIESIN: Before I go unconscious. 
MATT: That's true. 
MARISHA: Once again, remember your shit. 
TALIESIN: It's Features and Traits. I am remembering my things really poorly. 
TRAVIS: I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne. 
TALIESIN: That's called-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Let my armies be the-- I'm unconscious. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Relentless. 
MARISHA: The birds and the rocks. 
TALIESIN: You can make a DC 10 constitution saving throw. 
TRAVIS: This bitch is strong. 
MARISHA: Fuck this shit. Kill me now. 
TALIESIN: Is my constitution rolls advantaged right now or no? 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: No, so just a D-- 
MATT: DC 10. So go ahead and roll. 
SAM: It would kill everyone. 
TALIESIN: Yep, I'm fine. 
MATT: Okay, so you stay at one hit point. 
TALIESIN: Yep, I'm at one hit point. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: Bonus, is going to save the last attack, bonus action shiv you on the side. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LIAM: Fuck a duck. 
MATT: Natural 20. 
SAM, ASHLEY, and LAURA: Oh my god! 
SAM and TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Stop it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) (claps) 
MATT: It's fucking-- 
TRAVIS: I believe you. I don't even have to look, I believe you. 
MARISHA: Silvery Barbs is useless, right? Because even if she rolls bad, they need more hit points. 
LAURA: He's dead. 
MARISHA: You're dead. 
MATT: Don't need to roll damage. Go ahead and roll another constitution save with a DC 15. 
MARISHA: Come on, come on, come on. 
ASHLEY: She's taken no damage. 
TALIESIN: No, that's 12. 
LAURA: Oh, at least. 
MATT: Ashton falls unconscious. 
TALIESIN: I'm down. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MATT: Reverts to his normal form. 
MARISHA: Shit. 
TALIESIN: Do I lose the shard? 
MATT: When you fall unconscious on this, I'll say in this instance, yes. Actually, no, no, no, no, no. 
LAURA: You lose the shard? 
MARISHA: What do you mean? 
TALIESIN: I lose my-- 
SAM: (large belch) 
TALIESIN: I lose my-- I lose my rage. 
MATT: Yeah. You lose your Rage. 
MARISHA: You're just going to barf? 
MATT: You stay in that form. 
TRAVIS: (mock retches) 
MATT: But you are unconscious. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
LIAM: (heavy exhale) 
MARISHA: So wait, who's all down? 
LAURA: Everybody. 
MATT: Is going to-- 
MARISHA: Are you down? 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: Chet, Orym, Ashton. 
MATT: Dart over here. 
TALIESIN: You get a-- 
MATT: You get an attack of opportunity. 
LAURA: Chet. 
TALIESIN: Both you and the dog. 
MATT: Yep, it's going to use-- 
MARISHA: The dog gets an attack? 
TRAVIS: No, Chet's up. 
MATT: Psi power. 
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I'm a liar. 
MATT: To (swoosh) dart over, flying 80 feet of movement this round. So you get an attack of opportunity. 
LIAM: Wow. 
SAM: Wait, that's not, this is the last attack? We don't know, we don't know. 
TALIESIN: This is, unless something amazing happens-- 
SAM: We don't know. 
TALIESIN: I'm fucked. 
ASHLEY: Nine points of damage. 
MATT: Nine points of damage. 
MARISHA: Wait, where is she going? She's going to Imogen? 
TRAVIS: Towards the-- 
SAM: She's just going to be stabbing people. 
LIAM: Right at Imogen. 
TRAVIS: Or towards the back. 
MATT: She's going to attack-- 
SAM: She's making the rounds. 
MATT: Attack you on the ground. 
MARISHA: But you're alive? You're alive? 
MATT: That's going to be a 24 to hit. 
SAM: Hits! 
LIAM: Of course it hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: She's doing the death check. 
LAURA: She's doing the walk around now? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yep. 
TRAVIS: She's doing the "300" stake-checker. 
MATT: That's a three, sorry, five plus eight, it's 13 points of slashing damage. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. 
MATT: And 10 points of force damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: But she doesn't make a noise when she gets hit because she's already dead. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Right? 
MATT: Is going to (swoosh) leap over. 
LAURA: Deception check. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, she moved on. 
MATT: Actually, you know what? Make a Deception check for me. 
TRAVIS: Oh! Why'd you say it? 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: You know what? Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LAURA: Why? Why did I say it? 
LIAM: He only responded to you! 
MATT: It's true. No, it makes sense, it makes sense. She just stabbed down. 
TRAVIS: True, I did start that. 
LIAM: You goosed that into existence. 
MATT: You've been a focus of iron elements. 
TRAVIS: I did. 
LAURA: So I got a plus-- What is that? 
MARISHA: You're okay. You're okay at deception, right? 
SAM: You've got a plus six. 
MARISHA: You're good, you're good. 
LAURA: I know, I know. I've got a-- 
SAM: You've got plus six. 
MARISHA: You got a plus six, you got plus six! 
LAURA: I think this is-- Wait. 
MARISHA: Oh, and also you're good! You're good at this. 
LAURA: My deception is-- 
MARISHA: But roll it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: This is it. 
LAURA: Oh. (blows raspberry) 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LAURA: 18. 
SAM: Well, hey. 
MATT: 18's good enough. 
TRAVIS: (relieved sigh) 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Off the hook. 
MATT: She's going to dart over here. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: Towards the target of all the healing. Blades out, furious. 
TRAVIS: But look at him. 
LAURA: Destroy her! 
TRAVIS: Look at him. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Red gem. Otohan, red gem, red. Same team. 
SAM: Fuck you. 
TRAVIS: Red. 
MARISHA: Yeah, come on, come on. 
SAM: Fuck your face. 
LAURA: Detonate, detonate! 
MATT: That's going to end her turn. Chetney. 
LAURA: Can you detonate? 
MARISHA: Chetney. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: I got to pee again! 
LAURA: Chetney! 
MARISHA: (frustrated groan) 
ASHLEY: Come on, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Where am I? I'm just dead over there on the rocks. 
MATT: You're over here. 
TALIESIN: You're in the crevice. 
ASHLEY: Come on, Chet. 
SAM: Can you heal one person over there? Do you have any potions? 
TRAVIS: I got nothing. 
SAM: Do they have a potion? 
LAURA: Just attack. 
SAM: You can go get his potion and pour it into-- 
LIAM: I got a potion. 
SAM: Get his potion into him. 
TRAVIS: I don't know any of that shit. I wouldn't even-- Can I get up and I'll walk up towards the top of the rock towards FCG and Otohan? I'll keep coming up towards-- 
MATT: Five, 10. 
TRAVIS: -- Pride Rock? 
MATT: That's about as far as you can get right there. That's your full movement. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Gosh, how far is Otohan now? 
MATT: Otohan is 35, 40 feet from you. 
TRAVIS: That takes it out of the range (laughs) of the bonus action stuff I could do. Okay, no Blood Curses for me. 
TALIESIN: You have nothing you can do to pull anybody up and out? 
TRAVIS: No. Not this blood hunter. 
TALIESIN: Stabilize? Shit. 
TRAVIS: I'll take Turmoil, my scythe, and I will cast Shatter, 60 feet, I'll put it behind-- 
MATT: Yeah, you can easily do that. 
TRAVIS: -- Otohan and attempt-- 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw? 
TRAVIS: It is a constitution saving throw. Constitution of 15. 
MATT: 13. 
LAURA: (surprised gasp) 
MATT: She's going to let it go because she wants to save that last save. 
SAM: (exhales) 
TRAVIS: Oh, well how nice of her, fucking bitch. Okay, great. 
SAM: Yeah, she is. 
LAURA: Are you-- You're dead? 
SAM: Yeah, she is. 
LIAM: I'm unconscious. 
LAURA: That's what I mean. 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm down. 
SAM: G-g-gig. A g-g-gig. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: I don't know, fucking do it. 
TRAVIS: 19 points of thunder damage. 
SAM: We got this. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Fuck, man. Motherfucking-- 
MATT: Nine points there. 
MARISHA: I look crazy. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I hate saving throws so much. 
SAM: You can find me. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: What's wrong with you? The hair? 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm down. 
SAM: I mean, you know? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Do I have any kind of bonus actions? I mean, this is my first turn of the fight. 
SAM: It's Laudna. 
TRAVIS: I'm thrilled, happy to be here. (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: 30 feet, 30 feet. I'm just double checking, y'all. 
LIAM: Woo. 
TRAVIS: That's my turn, Matthew. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That's all I got. 
MATT: Finishing Chetney's go. Ashton, I need you to make a death saving throw for me, please. 
TALIESIN: Yep, yep. 
ASHLEY: I can't watch. 
TALIESIN: 13. 
MATT: Okay. That's one success. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right, I have to-- Hold on. 
SAM: Your mom might be coming? 
LAURA: Yeah, in 20 seconds. 
SAM: I think it's more like six. 
LAURA: She'll be here in-- 
MARISHA: I could try. 
LAURA: 15 minutes it's going to take her to find us. 
TALIESIN: There was traffic. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I could try my-- 
LAURA: Or it could be Dani. 
TALIESIN: I don't go to the valley. 
MARISHA: -- Phantasmal Force bullshit again, but would she really fucking believe that a second time? 
LAURA: Is that how it works? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
LAURA: Or does it break their brain? 
TRAVIS: I should've done that awhile back. 
MARISHA: I don't know actually. 
MATT: All right. So the save is fair. End of your turn, going to use a legendary action to attack FCG. 
SAM: (panicked yelp) 
LIAM: (sighs) 
SAM: (panicked yelp) 
MATT: That's a natural 19. 
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow. 
LAURA: Have you rolled lower than-- 
TRAVIS: This is historic. 
MATT: I've rolled pretty low, but she has a huge bonus to her attacks. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: That's her thing. 
TRAVIS: Have you rolled any ones tonight? I'm sure you have. 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: No actually, no ones. 
TRAVIS: I didn't think so. 
MATT: No fucking ones. 
LAURA: And a lot of 20s. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: The odds are in your favor. 
MATT: He's rolled more 20s than I have. 
TRAVIS: The ghost of Gygax-- 
LIAM: Look how I'm doing. 
TRAVIS: -- is walking around. 
MATT: Yeah, well. That's going to be 16 points of slashing damage to you, FCG and six points of force damage. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes Ashton's go. Fearne, you're up, with FCG on deck. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: So wait, who's down? 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: You're down? 
LAURA: Orym and Ashton. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to get out. 
LAURA: Orym and Ashton have one hit point. 
LIAM: Fuck her up. 
ASHLEY: Move a little bit by these rocks. 
LIAM: Fuck her up! 
MATT: Over here? 
ASHLEY: Over there, yeah. 
LIAM: Fuck her up. 
ASHLEY: But more there. So sorry. 
MATT: Here? 
ASHLEY: Right here. 
MATT: Oh, I see, right here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Blight at 5th-level. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Slick. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
SAM: What does that do, just points, is that hit points? 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's just points. 
ASHLEY: If it does anything. It's just points. Okay. 
LAURA: That sucks-- 
ASHLEY: It's a constitution saving throw of 19. 
MATT: (heavy sigh) [nervous shirt rubbing] 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: It's at least worth a try, you know what I mean? 
MATT: Natural 18. Half damage, sorry. 
SAM: Goddamn it. 
MATT: I'm rolling-- 
TRAVIS: So good, so good, Matt. 
MATT: Fucking so good. 
TRAVIS: I'm so proud of you. Your dice are crushing. 
SAM: So it's half damage, half damage, so it's a quarter damage? 
ASHLEY: Cool, starting off with a one. 
LIAM: Saur good. 
TRAVIS: You're crushing it. You're crushing it. 
MATT: (sighs) 
TALIESIN: You still get to add the d8. 
TRAVIS: See it through. 
MATT: We've been doing this for nine years. We got to go in. 
TRAVIS: See it through. They're not ghouls, it's Otohan Thull. 
MATT: Hey, man. To me, it's the end of a story. 
ASHLEY: Fucking piece of shit. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: It just means opportunities. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. He's talking like we're going to die. 
LAURA: He's already talking about a TPK, we're at that. 
ASHLEY: Six, seven, okay, two more. Nine. Oh, okay, good, and then I roll an additional d8 for fire damage. Okay, which is four. Okay, so, let me calculate it. 
MATT: Yeah, go for it. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, math. I'm just going to get the calculator. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's how I do it. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
LIAM: My bladder's going to burst. I'm terrified to leave. 
ASHLEY: I know, me too. 
LAURA: Go, go. 
ASHLEY: I'm wiggling. 
LIAM: I'm tie-- I'm terrified to leave. 
TRAVIS: If you leave, we will all die. 
LAURA: (chuckles) 
LIAM: I know. 
LAURA: If you're not here when we all die. 
TALIESIN: Oof. Fuck. 
ASHLEY: 48 points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Halved. 
MATT: 24. 
LIAM: 12. 
MATT: Halved to 12, okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: It's getting through, bit-by-bit. (impact) "(snarls)" 
SAM: Jesus. 
MARISHA: Do we have anything? Do we have a bomb? Do we have a fucking-- 
ASHLEY: Bonus action, I want to get closer to her. 
MATT: You want to get closer to her? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I do. 
LAURA: Why? 
TRAVIS: Because she's hot. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: But. 
LIAM: She'll stab the shit out of you. 
ASHLEY: I know, but, well. 
MARISHA: What is-- She can get to us regardless. 
ASHLEY: She can get to us regardless, but-- 
LAURA: Yeah, don't. 
TALIESIN: She's going to finish him off, anyway. Yeah, FCG's, they're not going to care. 
ASHLEY: Wait, let me just see. 
TALIESIN: She's not going to care. 
MARISHA: Where is she right now? 
TALIESIN: Next to FCG. 
MATT: Over there. 
ASHLEY: I'll stay. 
MATT: You'll stay? 
LIAM: Her turn's going to come up and she will shank the shit out of you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll stay. 
MATT: End of your turn, uses the second legendary action to attack FCG. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. (nervous sighs) 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LIAM: You couldn't have stopped that. 
SAM: This is going to be close. 
MATT: That's going to be 19 to hit? 
SAM: It hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Unless I have some sort of Shield. 
MARISHA: Do you have Shield? 
SAM: I don't. (laughs) Do I? 
LAURA: Do you? 
MATT: That is going to be-- 
LAURA: Clerics don't have Shield. 
MATT: 11 points of slashing damage and two points of force damage. 
SAM: I'm alive. 
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
SAM: I've got five points. 
MATT: (heavy exhale) All right, FCG, it's your turn. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: She's too far away. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, oh my god. 
SAM: In my berserk anger-- 
ASHLEY: Come on, kill her. 
SAM: Fueled by stress, I will take out my Changebringer coin, I will hold it out in front of me and I will-- 
MARISHA: Come on. 
SAM: I will cast, at my highest level left, Guiding Bolt at level four on myself, straight through the orb portal glass thing, and I will aim it at my heart, and I will trigger a nuclear reaction, if at all possible. I get to roll with advantage. 
TRAVIS: Wait, what? You're going to what? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: He wants to blow up his core. 
MARISHA: Is he Blaze of Glorying? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Are you Blaze of Glorying? 
SAM: I'm Blaze of Glorying. That's a 14 plus 11 to hit. 
ASHLEY: No. 
SAM: So that hits. 
MATT: Yeah... 
LAURA: That just hits. 
SAM: Yeah, it hits me. 
SAM: Oh, it hits you, it hits you. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
SAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY: No! 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm so mad at you right now. 
ASHLEY: No, no. 
MATT: Two things. 
MARISHA: I'm so mad at you. 
MATT: Two things. 
TRAVIS: I'm so proud at you. 
MATT: Two things. One, do you want to reposition yourself? Because there is a blast radius. 
SAM: I wouldn't know what the blast radius is, so I would, with all of my movement, I would just charge into her and push as hard as I can-- 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: -- as I power up. 
MATT: Push past this way. 
MARISHA: Sam Riegel. 
MATT: Just so you are aware-- 
SAM: Uh-huh. What's the saving throw that I have to make on this to survive, right? It's a DC 12, 13? 
MATT and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Are we able to get him up? Are we able to get him up after he does this? 
TRAVIS: Marisha. 
SAM: We'll see. 
LIAM: You just-- Yeah. 
MATT: You understand what this means, just so we're clear. 
ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: And that's okay. 
SAM: No, the rage that I feel, the stress being so high, the fuel pumping through my core, it has reached a level it's never reached before, and it is so intense that for the first time, I realize that I am made of metal and wires, but I am alive. I'm alive for the first time, and I am alive not because I was made by D or Dancer or even the Changebringer. I'm alive because they made me alive, and it's the connections that I made with all of them. It's a feeling of joy, and I'm happy to do this, because they saved my life, and I'll save theirs. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. You know what? Go ahead and roll some damage for me. Go ahead and-- 
TRAVIS: Do you have this? Do you know what-- 
MATT: No. 
SAM: I don't know what this does. 
MATT: We're going for this on the spot. Go ahead and roll 20d8 for me, please. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: (resigned sigh) 
SAM: This will take a while. 
MATT: I'll lend you-- 
LAURA: Here. 
MATT: Everybody, lend some dice in this. Because what's more poetic than that? 
SAM: Really? Oh god. I'm going to need help just counting these. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
SAM: That's more than 20, I feel. 
TALIESIN: That's my good shit. 
SAM: Okay. Here's five. Here's 10. What did you count out? 
ASHLEY: Pick what you want. 
SAM: Okay. Five and another five. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I hate this. But I love it, but I hate it. 
SAM: Oh, there's more. Not that one. 
TRAVIS: What a fucking wild-- 
SAM: 20. Okay. 30. 40. 50. 60. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
SAM: 72, 73. 79. 
MATT: 79 damage. So, FCG, how do you want to do this? 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
SAM: I think the last things I see are Bertrand and Dorian and FRIDA. And I just feel connected to everybody. Some connections are made with wires, and some are made with blood, and some are made with bone, and some are made with wood, but they all matter. And they, even in this dark, dark cave, they make every day a smiley day. And so, I just sign off and go. 
MATT: (deep breath) The red that's burning in FCG's eyes fades to a white, and a head turn to a smile towards all of you as you see the energy in the core begin (electricity snapping and sparking). Otohan, you see, notices this awkwardly and goes to pull, and you grab her and hold her there. Before she even gets a chance to dart-- (booming explosion). There is a ball of crackling energy that fills the space, (electricity crackling) holding aloft and burning. Rocks around it are being pulled into it and incinerated, and there's a bit of a gravity tug in its direction. You all catch yourself in this moment of disbelief before it (dissipating) stops, leaving a crater in the ground. The sound of hundreds of small pieces of metal begin to sprinkle across the room. And the charred, lifeless body of Otohan Thull is left there. 
TRAVIS: (sighs) 
MATT: The thing about a heroic sacrifice is it doesn't just give meaning to the person in the moment, but it's an inspiration we have to carry with us. As this moment of tragedy washes over you in ways that maybe some of you already knew or are realizing right now, but the stakes are realer now than ever. And this loss can't be in vain. As the silence and numbness begins to subside, you can hear the distant sounds of shouting and soldiers and people coming, and without even consciously thinking about it, you know you have to keep going. Anyone have any last moments here in this chamber before we move on? 
LIAM: Are the other fucked-up people brought to consciousness? 
MATT: I imagine those of you that were down would be helped by your friends rather rapidly. 
TRAVIS: I would find Orym and put a health potion, and then go to Evoroa. 
LAURA: I want to go give a health potion to Ashton. 
MATT: Evoroa is just clutching her hands going, "I'm so sorry." 
ASHLEY: I'm going to, since I was fairly close watching, I'm going to go over and grab what is left of FCG's body. 
LAURA: 15. 
SAM: It's just the tongue. 
LAURA: Is anything left? 
TALIESIN: I want to go find the coin. I want to go find the coin. 
MARISHA: Find the coin? 
LAURA: Oh gosh, yeah. 
MARISHA: Any shards. 
TRAVIS: You need to find that. 
MATT: The coin, it's not hard to find, because it seems to shine on its own, and then the light catches it. It's partially embedded in the stone in the direction of your exit, almost like a beacon guiding you to where you need to go. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
TALIESIN: I don't use the hammer. I just crack it out. 
MATT: Easy enough to pull free. You look over amongst the wreckage, what bits remain, and there is still part of, part of the head and the smile there. 
ASHLEY: I just grab it. 
MATT: The lens is cracked, jaw partially unhinged, but it's something. 
MARISHA: Is there anything like his core? 
LAURA: That's what exploded. 
MARISHA: It detonated, yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab whatever I can. 
MATT: There is very little left of the torso, and the core deeply sundered what was there. But that's what it took. 
MARISHA: What about-- 
SAM: A couple of little wooden feet hanging on the rock. (laughter) 
MATT: You motherfucker. 
TRAVIS: We have to make this count, and I will grab the backpack. 
LAURA: Oh, I was going to, yeah, put that on. 
TRAVIS: Put them in the-- yeah. 
MARISHA: What of Otohan is left? 
LIAM: Orym would have-- 
TALIESIN: All of it. 
TRAVIS: We'll turn that against them. 
MATT: The blades. 
LIAM: -- helped you, Fearne, and I'm going to save any part of the-- 
TALIESIN: We don't want any sign of her left. 
LIAM: I'm really sad. A piece of the chassis with the three blades of grass or the claw marks or whatever they are. I'm going to save that piece. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I think we should save anything that's left of Otohan as well. 
TALIESIN: Everything, every last bit. 
LAURA: Just throw it in the hole. 
MARISHA: Yeah, her charred corpse into the hole. 
TALIESIN: Throw in everything. 
MARISHA: We might be able to make her talk later. 
ASHLEY: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: We have to go. 
LAURA: I'm going to kiss my fingers and put them on the ground. Thank you, Letters. 
TALIESIN: On the way out, I'm going to cover our exit, and I'm going to beat with my fists. I'm going to beat the exit way out. 
MATT: Numb and distracted, but pushing ever onward because that's what this is about, you eventually all clamber, breaking through to the red light surface, the feeling of the wind and dust on your face, terrifying but also welcoming, as it's quiet up here. You see the lavender spark of Liliana begin to descend. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Take your hand, and already knowing from your faces, she says, "I'm sorry." 
LAURA: Me too. 
MATT: Here, as the dust gingerly rolls by, the clouds cleared on the distant horizon, the vision of Exandria up above, the stakes are clear. That's where we'll end tonight's episode. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
MATT: You motherfucker. 
TRAVIS: No way. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
SAM: Balanced combat. 
TRAVIS: No way. What an absolutely-- 
MATT: She was low a few times there. 
TRAVIS: -- crazy move. 
ASHLEY: You dummy! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: It's fucking beautiful, though. 
TRAVIS: Absolutely stunning. 
ASHLEY: I know. No. 
TALIESIN: I like being on the other end of this. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: (laughs weakly) 
MARISHA: It's nice. 
TALIESIN: I know where you are right now. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Being on the other end of this is way better. Fuck. 
MATT: (exhales) 
TRAVIS: Sam Riegel. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
LAURA: Sam Riege. 
ASHLEY and MATT: Sam Riege. 
SAM: (laughs) (laughter) 
SAM: I don't know what that's from anymore. 
TRAVIS: I do. 
LIAM: That's just him riffing. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: So funny. 
LIAM: It was a misspelling. 
LAURA: It was a misspelling of his name in a bio. 
TRAVIS: Sam Riege. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Letter left out. 
LAURA: Sam Riege. 
SAM: Sam Riege. 
TALIESIN: That's right. Oh god. 
ASHLEY: That was so tad (sad). 
TALIESIN: I'm, well-- 
MATT: Well. 
TALIESIN: Wrecked. 
MATT: Otohan's fucking gone. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Shit. 
ASHLEY: Fuck. 
SAM: I think I blew up the Staff of Dark Odyssey. 
LAURA: Oh fuck! 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Oh, the teleportation staff? 
LAURA: Shit, I have to take Teleport. 
MARISHA: You got to take Teleport. 
LAURA: It's a magical item. 
MATT: It's a powerful magical item. It probably got scattered somewhere in the chamber from the explosion. 
LAURA: Would we have looked for it? 
MATT: I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. Roll a d20 for me, Sam. 
LAURA: Oh, lord in heaven. 
SAM: Okay. 
LIAM: FCG's last roll. 
SAM: Two. 
MATT: Okay. It wasn't a one. (laughter) 
MATT: A one would've destroyed it, but a powerful magic item on that degree, we'll say you managed to scavenge it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We cleaned house before we left. 
SAM: It doesn't have enough charges for you to use it. 
LAURA: I know, we'd have to sleep here, but. 
MATT: We'll pick up here on the surface of Ruidus, and what is likely a rapid return to Exandria next time. (sighs) Fucking Sam Riegel. Well, thank you all for joining us. I love all you guys. 
LIAM: That's one for the books. 
MATT: Love you, Sam. 
TRAVIS: Drink some water. 
SAM: Thanks, Matty. 
TALIESIN: Everyone, everyone, hydrate. 
SAM: See you for Campaign Four. 
LAURA: Shut up. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Stop it! 
LAURA: Shut up. 
SAM: I'll see you there. 
MATT: We love you all very much-- 
SAM: I'll be waiting. 
MATT: -- and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

Cooldown[]
ASHLEY: I hate you.
TRAVIS: Oh, god.
ASHLEY: J/K, I love you.
LIAM: Okay, so now I have to just cry through the extra.
SAM: Oh, yeah, we got 10 minutes of this.
TALIESIN: That was clutch. That was nuts.
MARISHA: We could've had her.
LAURA: I don't know.
TALIESIN: No.
LIAM: I don't know.
ASHLEY: Were we even close at any point?
LAURA: He said we were a couple times.
MATT: So she had a threshold, when she gets to a certain low number of hit points, that's when she goes into her--
TRAVIS: Fury.
MATT: Her fury mode, which then gives everything else resistance, and then she has the healing potion to increase that buffer when she hits that point, because it then gives her a second lease. But you guys are really powerful and it's seven players versus one character. It was intentionally tricked out to be a very, very hard fight. Opportunities for escape, opportunities for locking her down, whatever the case may be. I don't know what you had, but it was--
LAURA: She just rolled so high.
MATT: She rolled really fucking good.
SAM: She did. Every roll you were saying was like natural 18, natural 19.
ASHLEY: So many nat 20s.
MATT: She has a +14 to hit.
TALIESIN: She missed like once.
MATT: She missed a couple times, I think.
TALIESIN: Twice, maybe.
ASHLEY: The rolls were not in our favor.
LAURA: But everything she resisted against, but without even using legendary resistances.
TRAVIS: You and Liam were back and forth like Ollie and Forman.
LAURA: God, you had so many 20s.
MATT: That was crazy, that was crazy.
TALIESIN: I think I critted more times--
SAM: Like Tyson and Paul.
TALIESIN: --this fight than I have the entire campaign.
TRAVIS: I can't wait for it.
ASHLEY: Oh, I can't wait.
MATT: Both of you guys critted a shit ton. That was awesome.
LAURA: Lucky 13.
MATT: Oh, my god, Sam.
SAM: Tell me this. Her backpack, what things did it let her do, or we can't know that yet?
MATT: I can tell you. She's dead now. But you can figure out, like--
TRAVIS: I mean, we're going to try and--
TALIESIN: We're going to bring it to Imahara Joe.
MATT: You can certainly try.
SAM: Are the echoes from the backpack or from her?
MATT: The echoes are from the backpack.
MARISHA: She never busted them out. 
LIAM: We didn't give her a chance.
SAM: We only gave her a round and a half of the backpack.
ASHLEY: Would you imagine if we couldn't get that thing-- if you didn't get that off of her?
TALIESIN: We would've been slaughtered.
ASHLEY: We would've been done.
LAURA: We would have been fighting five of her, and she could have bamfed between them.
TRAVIS: It's just been long enough and we've leveled up enough times--
TALIESIN: I thought we could do it.
TRAVIS: That we could do one and us and we would get her in a race.
TALIESIN: I also thought it was going to be a smaller room, so I thought it would be easier to bounce around.
TRAVIS: It takes forever to get to that point past the halfway mark where you're like, "Oh, we're fucked," and we can't even get out of here. We could have tried, but...
TALIESIN: Yeah, I forgot how she plays, so it's like, "Oh, everyone's going to stand up so I can just be damage." I'm like, "No, I've got to be a fucking sponge." Fuck, fuck, fuck.
SAM: But any of the encounters tonight could have been equally bad. Like the dragon and the rider.
TRAVIS: Liliana. Two 31s in a row.
SAM: The Five. The Hive Mind.
MATT: Literally have-- the minis are all back here.
LAURA: Ready for fighting those ones, too?
MATT: Got it all situated.
SAM: Oh, wow.
TRAVIS: Hold up Gloamglut!
MATT: This is a jabberwock mini.
LAURA: Okay, but here's my question, Matt.
TALIESIN: Yes, because you do a d8 damage to anyone who touches you.
LAURA: If we would have hit those encounters, if we would have had to fight Gloamglut and Liliana,  would you still have made us fight Otohan here in the tunnels, or would you have been like, "All right, they already destroyed themselves."
MATT: From a narrative standpoint, depending on how the different encounters went, like either battle- or conversation-wise?
LAURA: We might not have even been able to leave.
MATT: Well, might not have been able to leave, might not even have-- Otohan might not have even found you guys.
LIAM: We might have been hoovered up by the Hive Mind.
MATT: Yeah, there could have been an opportunity. A lot of different directions it could have gone.
TRAVIS: Did you say the hive mind, the five of them, there was a conversation where they were having that we couldn't hear and it sounded like they said they're resisting--
LAURA: Yeah, what was that? What did they say? Because he rolled a wisdom check.
SAM: That was an Orym thing, right?
MATT: There would have been a-- What do I say? Well, you kind of understand they were essentially putting hooks into each of you. They focused on you first, and they already had a previous tether and that's where the saving throw came from. They weren't even talking to you, they were talking to Delilah.
LAURA: Yeah, I knew it.
MATT: They were going to try and put a hook in you, but you called on your fey pact and you put up resistance they weren't expecting. That set them off the path of, "What the fuck was that?" Some magic they never encountered before. These are-- aside from the Sorrowlord, they don't have a lot of experience or knowledge of fey folk, fey magic.
TRAVIS: Right, because they've just been here.
MATT: Very much like, "Mmm, I don't like this." It's interesting. It made them think, it made them momentarily curious and cautious. But nevertheless. Fuck me.
LIAM: That was heartbreaking and inspired.
ASHLEY: Yes. I hate it and I love it.
MATT: I know.
ASHLEY: But I hate it.
TRAVIS: The two blue ones are mine on the end.
MATT: I had some red ones that were mine there.
TALIESIN: My new die critted.
MATT: Those might have been mine, then. Four of those are mine.
TALIESIN: Actually, both of my new dice critted.
LAURA: That's a pretty blue one, bubba.
MARISHA: Three things that I immediately thought about. One, we just lost our only religious person. Two, we lost our only person connected to Aeor tech. Three, what is FRIDA going to think?
ASHLEY: I was--
TALIESIN: We also lost our healer.
SAM: And the healer.
LAURA: We also lost our healer.
MARISHA: Oh, and four, fucking healer.
ASHLEY: Oh, my god.
TALIESIN: Bonus, on the bright side--
TRAVIS: Is that something you'd even thought of before?
TALIESIN: --we lost Sam Riegel.
SAM: I've been thinking about that for, ever since--
LAURA: You found out you could do it?
SAM: Found out I could do it.
LAURA: But you do have to be at that stress level in order for it to happen, or...?
SAM: I don't know.
MATT: There wasn't any mechanics for it. It was just a narrative thing. It was just-- we were talking about the cores and understanding how he functions when he went to these different people to talk about it and how different powers work and how Aeorian technology works.
LIAM: I mean, that bold a narrative risk can only be rewarded. I mean, so inspiring.
MATT: No, of course, of course.
TALIESIN: Nope, that's a Blaze of Glory.
SAM: I got a little-- a window, just last episode I could use to feel like a target.
MATT: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: I was having a hard time processing what you were saying. I thought it was like a feint or something. It was so good. It was so good.
TALIESIN: It is the most FCG shit you could have pulled.
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: It was like if his body was still there, we have that other Aeor core.
LAURA: I know, but his body-- it's gonesies.
MATT: It wasn't even like a core, it was just a section of technology that had similar markings.
TALIESIN: I kept thinking of like Astro Boy.
TRAVIS: I cast Guiding Bolt on myself.
TALIESIN: Because Astro Boy's got the core that can actually blow.
MATT: I see what you mean, yeah.
LAURA: 4th level.
SAM: I would have gone higher if I had it.
ASHLEY: Do we still have his head?
SAM: Memory banks? Can we reconstruct him?
TRAVIS: We have a part of--
LAURA: We have a part of his head.
SAM: With 6 million gold. Can I be the Six Million Gold Man?
LIAM: Maybe we have the CPU.
TRAVIS: We have the technology to rebuild him-- with wood.
TALIESIN: We're going full Pinocchio?
MARISHA: Yes, yes.
ASHLEY: I'm a real boy!
TALIESIN: Finally, that wooden tongue will be useful.
TRAVIS: The Fatestitcher laughs somewhere.
SAM: Your greatest creation! Your most famous toy!
LAURA: You're a real boy!
TALIESIN: You're just going to make a marionette and do the voice. It's not even--
TRAVIS: I'll be the puppet master.
TALIESIN: Smiley day to you.
LAURA: That's ultimate Laudna right there.
LIAM: Maybe we can make you a meat body and a meat wheel.
LAURA: Ewww!
MATT: I-- will not allow that.
TALIESIN: Fresh Cut Steak, I guess, at that point.
ASHLEY: But on the face mask, when that came out, that's where we saw that it said Faithful Care Giver, right?
LAURA and MATT: Mm-huh.
SAM: On the inside of it.
ASHLEY: On the inside of it, yeah.
MATT: I think it was on the inside of the chassis, actually, it was written, yeah. It was the inside of FRIDA's mask that it was-- FRIDA's name.
MARISHA: FRIDA's going to freak out.
ASHLEY: FRIDA's going to lose her shit. Christian's going to lose his shit.
TRAVIS: Matt, you did an incredible job. I know how taxing-- I can only imagine how taxing it was.
MATT: Here's the thing: It's seven of you. You've all been playing for a long time, you all have some pretty fucking powerful characters, and this is a character that's meant to be a scary singular encounter. From a previous history and the build-up, I wanted to make sure this was something that was going to be impactful and dangerous. I succeeded. And I fucking rolled really good. I don't think I got a single natural one that entire time. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's shocking.
MATT: I got some--
TRAVIS: I didn't see one.
LAURA: That was a lot of rolls, too.
MATT: Yeah, she got four attacks every round and a bonus action shiv if she didn't want to use her bonus action for something else.
TALIESIN: Bane should have been--
MATT: Yeah, two action surges and then recovers both action surges when she enters her fury.
MARISHA: Bane didn't do shit.
LAURA: She was just rolling so high. It was like the combination of Hex and Bane was something.
TALIESIN: Bane pushes it past the line, but if you're way over the line--
MARISHA: I wanted to suck just a tiny piece of her soul out so bad. I didn't even want to take--
MATT: I know.
MARISHA: Suck a little piece of her soul out, because that would have been so rewarding.
MATT: It would have been real good.
TALIESIN: God, if I rolled that fucking three on it--
ASHLEY: Maybe we can wake her up.
LIAM: Letters, the situation saved you from your darker self.
TRAVIS: You literally saved the entire group. We were all dead if you didn't do that. There was nothing else to do.
LAURA: We would have all died. You did 70-- what--?
SAM: 79.
LAURA: Points of damage in one hit.
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah, unless she was here for one or two people, like we were all-- and she was checking bodies.
LAURA: Maybe she wasn't resistant to nuclear damage, either.
MARISHA: I know, was she not resistant to that?
MATT: I didn't give her resistance against that. I'm like, that's a personal sacrifice, like that? I'm like, Nah. That's Aeorian Arcanum destructive magic, she's not resistant to that shit.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: I'm going to give you full damage on that.
MARISHA: How many hit points did she have left? Do you mind if I ask?
MATT: She had, I think it was like 40.
LAURA: Oh, that's it?
MATT: Like 40 more hit points.
LIAM: She could have taken us down.
MATT: Half damage to all hits.
TALIESIN: We couldn't have done 80 points.
SAM: Also, I should tell you guys, you've all been exposed to incredible amounts of radiation. You're all going to die in a couple years. Slowly and painfully.
TALIESIN: I was hoping I would get like another weird leg so then I can have every limb is fucked up in a different way.
MARISHA: Campaign Three is just the Chernobyl story the whole time.
TRAVIS: That's a lot of responsibility. Now I am the oldest character.
SAM: And you died.
LAURA: You died, he brought you back and then died.
MARISHA: And then died.
TRAVIS: I got rocked fast.
SAM: Yes, one round.
MATT: Yeah, it was one of those things. She was like, "I can kill one, and then kill the next, and kill the next" focus down, but then realized you guys had the ability to heal each other quickly and get up. And was like, "All right, I got to try and knock out multiples in a row to scatter the attention and then just whittle you down in a death spiral," was essentially her technique.
LAURA: That's what it was, yes. Death spiral.
TRAVIS: It's wild having that regret after the turn. You're like, "Oh, I could have done something better." When you used Revivify I was like, "We should have saved that. I don't know if we should have used that on me."
SAM: Well, of course we got to use it on you.
TRAVIS: Of course, but I mean in the moment you're like, "We're all going to start tipping over."
TALIESIN: I forgot so many things I have.
LAURA: Just so many choices.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. I know the one that we're--
LAURA: I pretended I was dead while FCG actually sacrificed himself.
TALIESIN: If you hadn't-- but we know for a fact--
TRAVIS: You came over here, and she jumped over to you. Like, if she hadn't come after you--
LIAM: You were hoping that the gopher game would have kept going.
TRAVIS: It would have smoked all of us.
MARISHA: I stopped using my Silvery Barbs because it didn't really seem to make a difference. She was hitting anyway.
LIAM: Her modifiers were too big.
MARISHA: I kept thinking, in case she bamfs, I've got Counterspell, I have Hellish Rebuke and I just kept waiting.
TALIESIN: She ain't bamfing.
ASHLEY: I want to wake her up and just keep killing her. I want us all to get a fucking turn.
TALIESIN: She's pocket bacon at this point though, right? Like, she's nuked.
ASHLEY: Ugh, I hate her.
LAURA: She's charredy charred charred.
MATT: She's a charred skeleton. Her blades are still good, though.
MARISHA: Matt, we're also like, "Do you want to reposition?" Did anyone else take damage in that or did he reposition?
MATT: He repositioned. I was going to pull out-- It's a Fireball radius here.
LAURA: Oh, so he would have hit Fearne and--
MATT: If he was over there, it could have hit Fearne.
TRAVIS: Yeah, if she didn't come to you, man, that's not even something-- Oh! That's why when you tried to run up, Matt said, "You going to go up?"
LAURA: I know, like I could see something in your eyes like you're going to do an area of effect. I was, "Don't go over there."
SAM: Don't do that.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was going to go over there because I was going to--
MATT: Holy shit.
TRAVIS: Oh, man.
MATT: As soon as you said that, I was like that was--
TALIESIN: That was like, don't even bother.
MATT: There's going to be a blast radius on it. Fireball seems fair; it's very concentrated damage. Do you want to reposition?
TRAVIS: A little Akira moment, right?
MATT: Yeah, like (explosion).
TRAVIS: Hell yeah.
MATT: Yeah, that kind of vibe.
LIAM: I'm sad.
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Me too.
MATT: What a fucking story.
SAM: What an exhausting night.
MARISHA: I still had like one 4th-level spell so I think we could have done it without it.
LAURA: I did too. I had another 4th-level spell.
MATT: Basically, you fucked up.
SAM: Well.
MARISHA: No, no.
TRAVIS: What were FCG's last pastries?
LIAM: No, she had Legendary Actions.
SAM: Last pastries? Very, very burnt.
TRAVIS: Croissant.
SAM: Croissant. Chocolate. Pan au chocolate.
TALIESIN: You had just invented the fig newton.
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: All my stuff is like Dex saves. She has like crazy high dex.
ASHLEY: You got your first taste of food as a slither.
SAM: I did, I got my first taste! I had to taste something with the tongue.
MATT: Her Dex was 22.
TRAVIS: Oh, wait, wait. (raising a glass) To FCG.
ALL: To FCG!
LIAM: Fresh Cut Grass.
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Letters!
MATT: To Letters.
ASHLEY: To Letters.
MATT: I want to get--
TRAVIS: Matt, to a heavy game.
MATT: Ya'll lean in here.
LAURA: To Matt, great game.
TRAVIS: Love you guys.
MARISHA: Good job, Matt.
LIAM: To pulling no punches.
MATT: Good job, ya'll.
ASHLEY: A hero for the ages.
TRAVIS: To setting the stakes.
TALIESIN: Fuck.
SAM: All right.
MATT: All right. Love you guys.
ASHLEY: Huzzah.
TRAVIS: All right.
MATT: Let's have a good night. Let's rest. Because I'm emotionally fucking spent.
TALIESIN: Fucking broken.
MATT: Fuck.
LAURA: Love you, Sam.
ASHLEY and MATT: Love you, Sam.
