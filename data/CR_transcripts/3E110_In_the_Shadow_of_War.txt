MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: (garbled) We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
MATT: Just like that, yeah. Before we get into our session tonight, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with our sponsor for tonight, Thorum. It looks like there's a cat here to talk about it. Cat. 
ROBBIE: Aw. 
LIAM: A kitty. 
SAM: I'm a cat, so I despise most everything. But even cats can appreciate Thorum's handcrafted, unique wedding bands made out of everything from dinosaur bone to whiskey barrel. (groans) I may hate all humans, but I love Thorum's minimalist watches and pendant necklaces. (groans) Featuring Hawaiian Koa wood and meteorite. (groans) 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: Cat. 
SAM: (groans) 
ASHLEY: Are you feeling okay? 
SAM: Of course not. (groans) I'm a cat. 
MARISHA: Have you heard a cat? 
ASHLEY: Oh no, I think this cat is in heat. 
SAM: (groans) 
ASHLEY: Kitty, how can we make him feel better? 
SAM: (groans) Hold on a second. I think I know how. 
LAURA: No, no. 
TALIESIN: No. 
SAM: Hold on. 
LAURA: What are you doing? 
SAM: (screams) (laughter) 
SAM: There, I'm all better. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What did you do? 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh-- 
ASHLEY: What did you-- 
SAM: You know. 
LAURA: No. (meowing) 
SAM: I had a litter. (meowing) 
LAURA: Don't-- 
SAM: Just a little litter. (meowing) 
LAURA: No! 
ASHLEY: Wait, but I don't understand. How did this happen? Oh my god! (laughter) How did this happen so quickly? 
SAM: Oh, you think that was quick? 
LAURA: Stop it, stop it, cat. 
ASHLEY: Kitty. 
SAM: Do you think that was quick? Thorum ships every ring within one business day for free. Now, that's quick. (laughter) (meows) 
MATT: (gasps) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Your kittens are getting all over our stuff! 
SAM: Well, don't worry because each Thorum ring. Oh-- 
ASHLEY: No kitty, shoo! 
SAM: Each Thorum ring comes with a lifetime warranty, so messing stuff up is no big deal. 
ASHLEY: Why are you doing this? 
SAM: I think you know the answer: Because I'm a cat. 
ASHLEY: No! 
SAM: Whether you need a wedding ring, anniversary ring, or you just want a ring that looks awesome, head to thorum.com and use code Catical Role. Nope, it's code Critical Role. Matt, cat to you. (laughter) 
LIAM: Big "The Shining" vibes. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: Yeah, get him off stage. Thanks, Max. 
MARISHA: Scooted them off with a broom! 
TALIESIN: Make it stop. 
MATT: Oh wow. (laughter) 
LAURA: Was Max on camera or was he just doing that for shits? He was getting a broom to get everybody out. 
MATT: I saw that. (laughter) 
MATT: Thank you, Max. We know we can count on you. (groaning and sighing) 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Oh, god. 
SAM: Thanks, kittens. 
MATT: Well done, Sam. 
LAURA: How are you doing, baby? Are you having allergy attacks? Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: Well, to that point, Marisha. 
LIAM: Just sleep paralysis. 
MATT: You got something to talk about. 
MARISHA: I want to thank and apologize to our crew-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: For the things they do for us. But also on that note, you can go listen to the first episode of "UNEND" right now! (cheering) 
MARISHA: This is our new audio drama from Midst creators Xen, Matt Roen, Sarah Wile, all of Third Person. While a supernatural ship and a remarkable crew set forth on an expedition to explore the furthest reaches of the Cosmos, the known Cosmos. 
MATT: (laughs) Saved it! 
MARISHA: Beacon members get the first two, the first three. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: Three. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Got a lot on my mind, episodes, and stay two weeks ahead. (laughter) 
MARISHA: What was happening? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Of the free feeds. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Otherwise, you can find the first episode right now wherever you get podcasts. (cheering) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: I did it, I did it. 
MATT: You don't smell burnt toast or almonds, do you? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Just need more of this coffee and I'll be fine. 
MATT: There you go. Liam. 
LIAM: Oh, welcome to my book corner. The latest Critical Role novel from our friends at Penguin Random House is right here. "What Doesn't Break" explores (German accent) Laudna's backstory. 
ASHLEY: Laudna! 
LAURA: Laudna. 
LIAM: Early years before Bells Hells, written by bestselling author Cassandra Khaw. 
MATT: Cassandra! 
ALL: Woo! 
LIAM: Cover designed by Matt Hubble and an audiobook version narrated by Robbie Daymond. 
ALL: Robbie! (cheering) 
LIAM: With Marsha Roy, Laura Bailey, and Grey DeLisle! 
ALL: Ooh! 
LIAM: That can't be right. She's not on the book, is she?

Part I[]
MATT: Welcome back. So last we left off, Bells Hells, after returning from their trek to the Fey Realm and thwarting this meeting between the Vanguard and the Unseelie to possibly put them in an advantageous position to defend themselves against the powers of Exandria. You succeeded in speaking with the Arch Heart within his abandoned temple, as well as bringing the unfortunately slain body of Zathuda back to Nana Morri's where he was turned into a piece of furniture. 
ASHLEY: Beautiful hanging. 
MATT: But after having some time to think of the recent events, you returned, with Morri's help, back to Exandria. Here within Vasselheim, one of the core locations where the war effort for the coming assault on Ruidus, the Vanguard, and what lies beyond has been building and mounting. You stopped into the Duskmeadow, the region of Vasselheim where the Matron of Ravens holds dominion. You went into the Raven's Crest, the great citadel of the Matron, met with some of the high priestesses of this Raven's Crest. All of you delved into the pool of blood to have communion with the Matron of Ravens. There, she was short, threatening, and eager to lead you on an unkind trial where you were forced to face a figure of dark Exandrian history long passed and two very familiar ones still entwined in your current fates. After which you learned quite a bit of her history, perhaps long hidden, and her opinion of the goings on in this wild, tangled gods' experience that seems to be mounting towards the red moon in the sky. After this conflict and conversation, you all were sent back to Exandria proper, where you all clambered out of the blood pool and onto the darkened polished floors of the interior of the Raven's Crest. Here, as you cough up the remnants of the red viscous liquid from your lungs and look up to this trio of veiled priestess figures around, what would you like to do? 
LAURA: (coughs) 
SAM: (groans) 
LAURA: (gags) 
SAM: Ugh. 
LAURA: Prestidigitation. 
LIAM: Just you, or-- 
LAURA: Anybody else want to be-- 
TALIESIN: Yes, please. 
LAURA: (spell fingers) 
SAM: Wait, wait. Before you do it to me, how do I look? 
TALIESIN: Black and white and red all over. 
SAM: No, no, no-- (laughter) 
SAM: But with the red on me, do I look like a devil a little bit? 
ASHLEY: It's kind of a cool look. 
LAURA: A little, a little bit. 
TALIESIN: Ketchup devil. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Is that something you're aspiring to? 
SAM: No, I just wanted to know. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
SAM: Does it look cool? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's fetching. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: All right. 
LAURA: I kind of like-- I kind of like this better. 
SAM: The red? 
LAURA: No. 
SAM: Oh. This. Huh. 
LAURA: You. Normal, yeah. 
MARISHA: I think I'll actually keep mine a little bit longer because it's fun. 
LAURA: It suits. 
MARISHA: It looks good. 
ASHLEY: I think it works. Yeah, it is cool. 
LAURA: Plus you're straight up naked right now, Laudna. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Actually-- Oh, wow. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Batting them around. 
TALIESIN: I'm walking over to my shit and getting dressed. 
MATT: Okay. Lieve'tel steps forward a bit. "I do hope that you managed to find what you were seeking." 
LAURA: She loves us so much. 
MARISHA: Have you talked to her lately? Or at all, I don't know. 
MATT: "We've had a few conversations in my time, yes." 
LAURA: Yeah, we found some good information. 
SAM: Does she ever make you battle specters of your past? 
MATT: "Isn't that what most communion is about?" 
SAM: Oh. Yeah, that makes sense. 
ASHLEY: That's a fair point. 
MARISHA: I don't know. I haven't done many communions. 
TALIESIN: This is really only my second. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Well, welcome to the stranger worlds beyond our own. Nevertheless, the day is yours and I do believe you have quite a bit to prepare for in the days to come." 
LAURA: Yeah. She did say-- 
MARISHA: Why is she looking like that? Insight check. 
TRAVIS: She's an old-ass bitch. 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
TRAVIS: Put your clothes on first. 
TALIESIN: No! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Girls out in the wind. 
LAURA: Maybe that's why she's looking like that. 
TALIESIN: I think you get advantage until you put your clothes back on. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
LIAM: Flap, flap, flap. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: It's not great. 11. 
MATT: 11. I mean, she is one of the highest priestesses of the Matron of Ravens living in a gothic cathedral. You are all covered in blood after pulling out of a pool of it. She just has that energy about her. That's about as much as you can gather. But she also was present with the plot when it was laid out in the Platinum Sanctuary and is aware of what is to come. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: She gives a nod. "Do not worry. We do not stand idly by. All of us have a part to play in what is to greet us soon enough." 
LIAM: Is there any movement here in the city? 
MATT: "Quite a bit. This is but one of a number of locales where the forces are being gathered. Many various practitioners of spellcraft and the arcane are preparing for a rapid transition to the fields of the Hellcatch when the signal is given." 
LAURA: We came straight here. Do we know where Keyleth was expecting us? 
SAM: The Birthheart, maybe? 
LAURA: Probably. 
LIAM: I don't remember. 
TALIESIN: It actually occurs to me, yeah, a question for her 
LAURA: Do we remember where we were supposed to go? Probably just the Birthheart. We can call her, though. 
MATT: There wasn't necessarily a return locale given. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: If I recall. But you can ask around or seek counsel wherever you feel you are most welcome. 
LIAM: We can just reach out. But before we do that, I mean, it feels like we're on the verge of getting on the struggle bus, right? Do we want to square anything away amongst just us? Do we need anything? Do we want to-- 
LAURA: You want a shopping episode? 
LIAM: Do we want to destroy another priceless magical artifact? 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Always. 
LAURA: What else do we have on the list? 
MARISHA: Well, he sucked one in. 
LAURA: Already today. That was today. 
SAM: The suck list includes-- 
TALIESIN: That was today, so we wait a day. 
ASHLEY: That was today? 
ROBBIE: Is that today already? 
SAM: Or did we rest? 
TALIESIN: It was hard to tell. There was so much-- 
LAURA: No, it was. It was this morning before we left. 
MATT: Correct, because you utilized it in the conflict in the Matron's realm. 
LAURA: So we've got to wait until tomorrow morning to do it again. 
SAM: But items on the suck list include the Summit Blade, Dusk Hunger, the pearl of power, my battering shield, a tree pipe? 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Your tree pipe at the moment. 
TALIESIN: Anything else anyone wants to offer? 
MARISHA: The tree pipe was given to us by an ancient tree. 
TALIESIN: I don't want to get rid of the tree. 
LAURA: We shouldn't suck that up. 
TALIESIN: I don't want to get rid of the pipe. Actually, no, the pipe was used by a tree. It wasn't given to us by a tree. 
LIAM: That's right, you introduced it to the tree. 
TALIESIN: I found it while robbing an Italian restaurant. It was a whole thing. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. 
TALIESIN: Or a pasta shop. Sorry. I found it while robbing a mob restaurant. 
MATT: Italiano, it's one of the many islands in the Broken Teeth. 
TALIESIN: There was a bakery. 
MATT: Shattered Teeth. 
TALIESIN: It was a bakery. Actually, I guess it was a bakery. 
ASHLEY: Italiano. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I also have a Feywild Shard? 
LIAM: Maybe Olive Garden. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Ye Olde Olive Garden. 
SAM: Shard. 
TALIESIN: Garden of Olives. 
SAM: What is it a shard of? 
MARISHA: Feywild. 
LAURA: Hey, Laudna. Since everything happened with ♪ Delilah ♪ Since everything happened with ♪ Delilah ♪ do you still feel that pull of powerful items? 
MARISHA: No, not like I used to. 
LAURA: Oh, that's wonderful. 
MARISHA: No. It's nice. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: It's good. That's what I was saying, if you wanted to use, you know, Otohan's blade. 
LIAM: I think that moment has passed. 
MARISHA: All right. 
LAURA: We suck it up. 
LIAM: Are we still covered in gore? 
LAURA: No, I Prestidigitated. 
MATT: You've been cleaned off, and you are welcome to leave the Raven's Crest, if you'd like. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Except for me. 
LAURA: Yeah. You've just got your clothes on now, stuck to the blood. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: Do we want to just wander the street? 
LAURA: She's into it. She likes it. 
TALIESIN: How was the GWAR concert? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: So good. Front row seats. 
MATT: Hell yeah. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: So yeah, let's leave. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MATT: "Of course. Thank you for what you all are doing, whatever it might be." 
SAM: Do we leave a tithe or anything? 
MATT: "Should you feel compelled." 
SAM: Oh. Here's a gold piece? 
MATT: She takes it. "How gracious." (laughter) 
SAM: I apologize. When I rolled my character, we didn't establish me having any money, so I don't know how much I have. 
LAURA: (laughs) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: She's like: I don't know what you're talking about. 
MATT: Looks back over at Imogen, and is like-- 
TALIESIN: He just talks that way. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LAURA: I don't even need to speak in your head. 
MATT: "Mm-hmm." 
LAURA: Fully understood that. 
MATT: The priestesses step aside and you step back through the spiral staircase down into the chambers of ivory before exiting back out the front of this massive dark cathedral where the open air, the chilled wind hits you and the gentle fall of midday snow still slowly drifts from the clouded skies above. Breathing deep and taking in the cold feeling of air in your lungs. From this higher perspective here in the Duskmeadow, you're looking across the city, you can see now the energy is bustling more further into the day as it goes. One, you can see to the skyport, a cluster of skyships. Three that appear to be passenger-bearing and four more chained to various points along its spire that look to be war-adorned. You also can see two other skyships that are moored just beyond the walls of the city. 
LIAM: Is my memory right that this ship is not really built or set up for a massive port for skyships, right? 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: So it's ad hoc. 
MATT: Yeah, it's very clustered together. This looks like they're doing the best they can with a structure that was not designed to keep that many vehicles moored to it. 
TALIESIN: Huh. I don't know. 
LAURA: Does it seem like-- Does anybody seem-- I know they already seem frantic because of everything they're preparing for, but I'm trying to figure out if the satellite went out and that message, the vision of the gods went out to everyone already. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: I feel like we'd know. I feel like there would be some pandemonium. 
LAURA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: This feels-- 
LAURA: I just don't know if it went out while we were with Nana Morri or anything. 
TALIESIN: Is there graffiti? The city's just scared? 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
TALIESIN: All right. I actually can do that. 
MATT: To generally gain a vibe of what folks around you in the neighborhood are-- 
LIAM: A vibe check. 
LAURA: Ooh. 25. 
TALIESIN: Ooh, seven. (laughter) 
MATT: From what you can gather as you begin to descend the steps of the Raven's Crest into the surrounding Duskmeadow neighborhood, most people around here range from Vasselheim citizens that are just existing amongst the building tension of what the city is currently housing: the slow call to war and the arriving of masses of soldiers from all over Exandria. Implements of war, siege engines, all manner of beings bringing the air all manner of beings bringing the air that is the harbinger of conflict to come. Nothing that in a realm or a city exemplifying religious worship leads you to believe that there is religious panic throughout the streets at the moment. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: If I were Ludinus, I'll say, I would wait for the last possible second, cause the most chaos. No time to rally people. That seems like it would be the smart move. 
LAURA: Well, maybe we can hit them before they release it then. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: For the hell of it, go ahead and roll a d20 for me. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
ROBBIE: Uh-oh. 
TRAVIS: For the hell of it. 
LAURA: For what? (dramatic sobs) 
ASHLEY: For the hell of it? 
LAURA: 13? 
MATT: Okay. Okay. What would you like to do? 
SAM: What would we like to do? Should we reach out to Keyleth or just-- 
LAURA: Find out where she is right now? 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
TALIESIN: I would-- 
LAURA: Okay, I'll send a message to Keyleth. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: We're back in Vasselheim. Where should we meet you? 
MATT: She responds, "I'm not there at the moment. I'm currently gathering my compatriots, one of which has been challenging to locate. However, Lady Allura Vysoren should be near the Platinum Sanctuary." 
LAURA: All right. She was saying we could meet Allura at the Platinum Sanctuary, thereabouts. 
TALIESIN: If you have one more spell I have a question I'd like to ask her. 
LAURA: Keyleth? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I mean, we've talked to gods. Is there a way to commune with elementals, Is there a way to commune with elementals, with Ka'Mort and Rau'shan since we seem to, I don't know, the Arch Heart seemed to feel that was important. 
LAURA: Oh, that is true. 
TALIESIN: I don't know, it just occurred to me. 
LAURA: All right. Yeah, I'll send her another message. 
TALIESIN: She might know who to talk to in this town. I don't know. 
LAURA: Help me. Ashton's wondering, is there a way to commune with Primordial Titans like the gods? 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LAURA: The Arch Heart felt it important. 
MATT: "The Primordials have been long dead, but your journey is a unique one. You'd need to likely stand where the element is strongest. Perhaps even Pyrah or Terrah, I'm not sure." 
LAURA: Well, she said nope. (laughter) 
LAURA: No, I tell him all that. 
TALIESIN: High five. High five. Solid. Solid. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: 10 points. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: It's an answer. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We have some Plane Shift, don't we? 
LAURA: With her. 
MARISHA: Do you intend to go to Pyrah? 
TALIESIN: Well maybe with Allura. 
MARISHA: Where are you wanting to go? 
TALIESIN: Well, Pyrah would be for you. I mean, since you seem to be collecting allegiances. 
MARISHA: There is also a very dead Titan right over yonder. 
LAURA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: I mean-- 
ASHLEY: Go kick it or something? 
TRAVIS: But they're dead, right? 
TALIESIN: Don't know. 
TALIESIN: The Titans are dead. 
TALIESIN: Not the one in-- I don't feel dead. 
MARISHA: I don't know if you could glean anything. 
LAURA: Maybe they put everything in those shards. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe they're just in the-- 
SAM: Think the Speak with Dead spell would work on that one? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: With the Titan? 
SAM: Uh-huh. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Maybe we could try. 
LAURA: That would be amazing. 
TALIESIN: I've heard dumber things, I think. 
LAURA: Nobody here in Vasselheim has ever tried that. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Wait a minute. (laughter) 
LAURA: Animate Dead. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that might be a thing to try. I don't know. Or-- 
ASHLEY: Something to think about. 
ROBBIE: Are you looking for more answers? Because I'm still confused at the ones we were supposed to take from what just happened. Have we not talked about what just happened? 
LAURA: We haven't really, no. 
ASHLEY: No, no we haven't. 
ROBBIE: I am a little confused and blown away. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too. Me too. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: What did you think about this god? You didn't like the other one. 
ROBBIE: I liked this one better. 
MARISHA: You liked this one? I liked her, too. 
ROBBIE: I liked the theatricality. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ROBBIE: I'm a sucker for a mask. Commedia. (laughter) 
LAURA: With all of it, though, she was a bit more straightforward, wasn't she? 
ROBBIE: It was clearly a test from the beginning, but very scary still. 
ASHLEY: I didn't like the test. 
ROBBIE: Oh no. 
LAURA: No. 
MARISHA: What was interesting is she talked about looking at fate as just about recognizing patterns. There was a lot of questions, so didn't really get to ask what patterns she sees for us. 
LAURA: I don't know if she would've told us anyway. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ROBBIE: I don't think she could see them in a future that didn't involve her. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I suppose that was kind of the point. 
MARISHA: Mm. 
TALIESIN: I feel... I feel good about where we seem to be heading for the first time. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Who has that mask? Do you still have it, Braius? 
SAM: Well, I was going to ask if I could have it back because-- just temporarily, just long enough to pray on it, if that's all right with you. When she gave it to me, she mentioned that I might be able to be given guidance on what path to take, and so I was going to possibly use it to pray, if that's all right with you. 
MARISHA: Yes. Of course! 
SAM: But then you can have it back. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: It is our communal mask. 
SAM: Of course. Yes. 
MARISHA: We can all share it, and wear it for 25 minutes at a time and then rotate. 
SAM: You've gotten blood all over it. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
SAM: I will clean it. 
LAURA: Prestidigitation. 
SAM: Thank you. 
MARISHA: I pulled it out of the bloody pool, there was already blood on it. 
SAM: Sure, sure. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know. She was the only god I ever really respected. She was the only one who kept the promise that you were going to meet her one day. 
LIAM: I'm kind of scared to pull the thread, I'm going to be honest. It feels like once we take the next step, there's no turning around. 
LAURA: I don't think there's turning around anyway, Orym. 
ROBBIE: I think the threads are being pulled regardless. The world's moving in this direction. 
MARISHA: We either participate in our fate, or it goes along without us. 
MATT: As you're saying these words, you can't help but focus on the gray horizon and your eyes take in the bits of color of the various leylines that still remain tangled and visible, woven between the gray clouded sky. You can see where they converge and knot in the sky a number of miles off to the southeast where one of the current nexuses appears to be brimming with unnaturally tangled magical force. You can almost feel a vibration in the air, even at this distance. 
LAURA: That's how far away? 
MATT: 100 miles, 200 miles. 
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to my mom. I don't know where you are, or how it's going. But I love you and I trust you. 
MATT: It takes a moment for her to respond, but she does. "Imogen, I'm glad you're okay. I love you too. I've kept him at bay so far, and I think he believes me. I think." That's all. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
LAURA: (sighs) 
MARISHA: She doesn't have anyone counting for her. (laughter) 
LAURA: She's like: Is that enough? 
ASHLEY: She's probably got a couple more words. I could still hear her talking to somebody randomly. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Mom? Mom. 
LAURA: She left it on. Mom. (laughter) 
LAURA: You have to hang up. 
ASHLEY: It's still on. (laughter) 
MATT: "How do I do this?" 
TALIESIN: The camera's backwards. Just-- 
LAURA: (laughs) I think she's trying to keep Ludinus from doing it. She's succeeded so far, I don't know how long he'll believe her. 
ROBBIE: The ship sailed on us stopping him, right? We've lost that opportunity. 
SAM: Stopping him from? 
ROBBIE: From-- 
LAURA: Sending out the message? 
ROBBIE: -- sending out the message. 
LAURA: No. I mean, if she succeeds then it would stop him for a while. He might try to find somebody else to do it, but. 
SAM: If she's genuinely trying to stop him. 
LAURA: Not everyone's a liar, Braius. 
SAM: I think they are sometimes. 
TALIESIN: Including you? 
SAM: I'll hold up the mask. We'll see. 
TALIESIN: No judgment. 
LAURA: Should we make our way to the Platinum Sanctuary? 
MATT and SAM: ♪ Makin' our way ♪ 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. Stepping down from this high hill here in the Duskmeadow and curling through the town streets in the direction of the Heaven's Stair Mountain that looms large over the city paired up against the still standing, still long-dead earth titan. You pass by droves of armored soldiers sharpening their weapons, polishing their armor, putting out fires, gathering their supplies. Each corner seems to carry hundreds, if not more, carrying colors and banners of distant lands you've only dreamed of visiting, some that are familiar. But no matter how stoic the gaze, no matter how intense a tightened jaw might be, there's that unmistakable look of not knowing what the next day is going to hold. That tension blankets over each city street. You see war priests that are walking by and anointing soldiers from cross cultures, walking and and muttering prayer beneath their breath as they draw a holy design across their forehead or across their armor. This meeting of different cultures from across the world and different means of worship here in this very holy city that seems to hold at bay that anxiety in places, but doesn't dispel it entirely. You see archers that are fletching enough arrows to try and keep them alive in the struggles to come. You see medics that are gathering their supplies and preparing for the sights they will have to see on the battlefield. You see families gathering up to say goodbye to their fathers or mothers or brothers or sisters and whatever brethren is looking to be part of the front or back lines of the struggles to come. For all your odd intermingled moments that brought you together, for most of you, this is really truly the first time you've been in the thick of the brink of war. And it is an emotional space. You see mounted warriors with clusters of griffons feeding them whatever meats they could gather here in this very strained period of resources. You can see them pruning their feathers and preparing their barding and locking it onto them, their wings stretching out before they glance back and track you as you walk past, returning to their threadbare meals. You see horses being prepared for the cavalry charges, presumably in the Hellcatch days to come. As you get closer to the base of the Platinum Sanctuary, you can see very foreign war beasts, siege beasts being prepped with their own armored barding, elephants that have been brought here that seemed to be equal parts tense in their known experience in times of conflict, some that may have seen the days of the Apex War and are returning to a familiar time of conflict. Younger ones that seem to be unaware, instead batting their tiny dark eyes and long eyelashes to the first time they've encountered snowfall. Large jungle cats, themselves trained for warfare and their elvish patrons brushing them, grooming them for the struggle. Another skyship slowly darkens your walkway as it drifts above one of the nearby sentry towers. You watch as it sets down and about 12 or so elite soldiers that begin to divide amongst the surrounding battlements to keep watch before it cruises away quietly. That tension still hangs in the air. That sense of even the very magic of this world is about to snap. As you're heading towards the base of the mountain, conversation, occasional shouting by commanders or mid-level soldiers causing a bit of a din and an energy to the air, but one voice cuts through. "Guys!" 
SAM: Oh god. What's that? 
MATT: "No way!" You turn and you see a familiar bald tiefling, thick coat running, "My goodness, I did not think I'd ever see any of you again, you crazy sons of bitches!" As Captain Xandis rushes up-- 
LAURA: You're alive! 
MATT: -- and grabs the closest one to them, likely Orym, with his eyes peeled and picks him up. "You of all the peoples, my goodness!" 
LIAM: Oh my gosh! 
ASHLEY: Xandis! 
MATT: "It is so good to see you!" 
LAURA: You're alive! 
LIAM: When did you blow into town? 
MATT: "Oh, I've only been here about two or three days maybe. I am so sorry. You are a vision and a new one, and my luck. What is your name, my friend?" 
ROBBIE: Dorian Storm. A pleasure to meet you. 
MATT: "Sorry. Xandis. Well, actually--" 
ASHLEY: Is one of those up there yours? 
LAURA: He's new as well. 
ASHLEY: Oh yes. 
SAM: It's okay. It's fine, it's fine. He seems very-- 
MATT: "Oh, he's with you as well." 
SAM: Hi. 
MATT: "Big handsome fellow. Nice to meet you." 
SAM: Hi. Nice to meet you, too. 
MATT: "What is your name, I guess?" 
SAM: Braius, Braius. But yeah, he's much more attractive. No, it's fine. That's fair. 
ROBBIE: I feel like we both are equally handsome in different ways. 
MATT: "Is he your page?" 
SAM: Well-- 
ROBBIE: All right. 
SAM: Hmm? 
MATT: "Is he your page?" 
ROBBIE: (uncertain squeak) 
MARISHA: Say yes. 
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah, that's exactly who he is. Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Sure? 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
SAM: I am page to no one. 
TALIESIN and SAM: Except him. 
MATT: "Dorian Storm, no one." (laughter) 
MATT: "Understood, understood." 
ROBBIE: I thought you would want to lie about this, like a game. Oh, okay. 
SAM: Yes, yes. 
MATT: "My name is Captain Xandis, Keybane. (laughs) I got a title. (laughs)" 
LAURA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Wow. 
SAM: Keybane. 
LAURA: Yeah, you did! 
MARISHA: Wait, who gave you your title? 
MATT: "Well, this very, nice lady with the colored leaves and the big antlers." 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: She's just handing them out. 
MARISHA: She's handing them out like candy. 
MATT: "It was crazy." 
SAM: Makes our not as-- 
MATT: "I was wandering the Hellcatch for days, just trying to get around. I met the big scary fellow who helped get me away from the crash and the boom." 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ira. 
MATT: "Right?" 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes. 
MATT: "Just got me off to the side of the rocks and then went away, and I was like-- 
LAURA: He saved you, though. 
MATT: "-- I don't know what to do. Yeah, he did. It was a nice gesture, but out in the open, you know." 
ASHLEY: That's very good to know. 
MATT: "So I just wandered the Hellcatch for a few days, trying to get back to some semblance of, well, safety really. Kind of had to masquerade as one of them Vanguard folk there for a little bit, and then finally ran into some of the outer forces. They actually thought I might be a Vanguard spy because of it. It was a whole deal. But I was presented before the council, I pleaded my case, and then they acknowledged my loss. They gave me a new ship, gave me a title." 
LAURA: That is just wonderful. I feel so bad about your ship. 
TRAVIS: Though we talked to the council. 
LAURA: Is the ship even better? 
MATT: "Parts of it are, but, you know, you build up a customized sort of vibe. I'm working on it. It's strangely been hard to get supplies around this time. But yeah, the ship, I call it the Key Breaker, you know?" 
ALL: Oh! 
MATT: "Kind of as a memory of this great--" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "So, sorry. Don't know. I rode with all of these crazy folks here and we crashed my old ship right into this key, this big tower thing, and it was incredible." 
ROBBIE: Is it a key like K-E-Y, or is it a Q-U-A-Y? 
LAURA: No, like the Malleus Key. The place where the Bloody Bridge is. 
ROBBIE: Oh, okay, okay. 
LAURA: That. 
SAM: Attacked and destroyed. 
LAURA: Yeah, we crashed his ship into the bridge, hoping it would destroy it. 
TRAVIS: The Malleus Key. 
SAM: Will you be going back for the upcoming battle? 
MATT: "Oh, I'm going to be leading part of the skyship assault." 
SAM: Oh, because you've been there. 
MATT: "I've been there. I know how to get there, I know what we're expecting, so they have entrusted me with being at the front line with my new ship, which, you know, called the Key Breaker. Maybe I have to crash a second one, you know?" 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: "Hard to know what's going to happen. 'Captain Xandis. Oh, he's so kooky!' you know?" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Did they give you a promotion as well? I mean, it shouldn't just be Captain Xandis. It should be-- 
MARISHA: Admiral. 
TRAVIS: Admiral, yeah. 
MATT: "I'm good with captain. That's way too much responsibility for me. Let me tell you, I'm just happy to be doing my thing. How are you? My goodness, I've been asking around and people were saying there was a group like the folks I was talking about doing some crazy shit, and I was like, 'That's probably them,' but they were like, 'Nah, 'you wouldn't know people that cool,' but apparently, you're here, so is that true?" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Oh, so much, Xandis. So much. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: We came in. We told the council about our deal. We were emphatic that they replace your skyship, which it sounds like they made good on. 
MATT: "They did." 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yes. 
MATT: "Oh my goodness, see, I wondered if that was the case. Thank you so much." 
TRAVIS: No problem. 
MATT: "The good word goes a long way." 
TRAVIS: Yep. Yeah, we wouldn't have just crashed the man's ship without making sure-- 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no. 
TRAVIS: -- a replacement was in waiting. 
MATT: "Responsible." 
ROBBIE: Yes, yes. 
MATT: "And I appreciate that." 
SAM: Yes, he's very responsible, that one. Yes. 
ROBBIE: I like him. 
LIAM: Been to the moon. 
ROBBIE: He's so animated. 
MARISHA: I know. He's the best. 
MATT: "What?" 
LIAM: We've been to the moon! 
MATT: "The red one?" 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It sounds like a euphemism. It isn't. Yeah, we actually went to the moon. 
MATT: "How was it?" 
LIAM: (grunts) 
ASHLEY: It was cool. 
TALIESIN: Moony. 
ASHLEY: It was really cool. 
TRAVIS: Different. 
ASHLEY: It was different. 
MATT: "Okay." 
TRAVIS: There's creatures you've never seen before, there's a bunch of blue rock at the core of the moon, and yeah, we're trying to keep bad people from unleashing what's ever at the center of it. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah, we have a mission, too. 
SAM: To go there. 
MATT: "You're going back to the moon?" 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: "Must be pretty cool if you're going back a second time." 
TALIESIN: It's pretty cool. 
LIAM: Well... 
TRAVIS: I think it's a multi-pronged attack, and it sounds like yours is going to be one of the ones that kicks the whole thing off. 
MATT: "Really?" 
TRAVIS: I think so. You know, we left high word at the council that Xandis was the man! 
MATT: "Oh my great gracious, I am excited! Oh my gosh." 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: I wonder if Xandis-- 
MARISHA: Xandis the Mandis. 
LIAM: -- is delivering the adventuring payload. 
TRAVIS: Could be. Could be. I think they even mentioned renaming the skyport here after Xandis if it all goes off without a hitch. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: "Really?" 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MARISHA: There's so many promises. 
TRAVIS: Xandis Port. 
ASHLEY: Have you been given your orders yet? 
TALIESIN: Port Xandis. 
ASHLEY: Or are you just waiting? 
MATT: "We're waiting for the go-ahead. Everything's been very hush-hush so far. I just know that I'm going be helping guide a lot of the skyships through the weather at the locale, being one of the various people who's traveled through the Hellcatch many times, let alone to the actual Tishtan site." 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: "So, yeah." 
ASHLEY: Tishtan. 
MATT: "Wow. It's so good to see you all." 
TRAVIS: So good to see you, too. 
ASHLEY: Really good to see you. 
ROBBIE: This ship of yours, is it fast, or does it really-- 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, how would you describe it? Is it a beefy thing? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Go on. There were clearly some other adjectives there and I'm really excited to know what they were. 
TRAVIS: Describe your fucking ship! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Is it the one that looks like it's suited up for war? 
TRAVIS: Veiny. 
MATT: "I mean, they're all sort of suited up at the moment. I kind of miss the old one. That one was made for speed, you know? The one they got me, it's a little more hearty. Can carry more things, which is great for, you know, a payload, and--" 
LIAM: How many folks can it hold? 
MATT: "I mean, if it's just folks, probably put a hundred maybe." 
LAURA: Whoa. 
ROBBIE: Oh, okay. 
MATT: "You know?" 
MARISHA: Look at all these crazy animals. Are they going to load it up, you know? 
MATT: "I think a few of them are. I think we're supposed to bring some of the various siege creatures. We got the payload of a bunch of front-line soldiers and we're supposed to be delivering to the core-- 
LIAM: Drop ships. 
MATT: "-- of the site. Right, right. This is not a warship, you know? Not outfitted with weaponry or anything crazy. It's just supposed to get in there, drop them down, and then head on back and maybe pick up another load, and then go and drop that down in case it's still going. I don't know. I've never really done a war thing before. This is all extremely new to me, so yeah, I'm really excited." 
LIAM: Have you ever been here in this city before? 
MATT: "I've traveled to it once before. It was one long contract catch. Not really my vibe, to be honest, but you know, hanging here till the times happened. I met some nice folks. Better this go around, because you know, Key Breaker in the (clicks) Captain Key Bane over here. Got a load of respect that gets earned. So, yeah. Better second time around, but also kind of chilly." 
LIAM: Have you checked out the titan? We hear there's a really cool tavern in that thing's crack. (laughter) 
MATT: "Are you serious?" 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's right in the butthole. 
MATT: "You can go in that thing?" 
TALIESIN: Diagramming that, yeah. 
ASHLEY: We should probably go investigate it. 
TALIESIN: I definitely think-- 
ASHLEY: At some point. 
TALIESIN: -- we need to. 
ASHLEY: Get up in there. 
LAURA: Wait, what was the name of it again? 
MARISHA: I don't-- 
TRAVIS: The Butthole? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I think we just-- 
TALIESIN: It's the Puckered Starfish. 
MARISHA: -- made this up. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: No, no. 
ROBBIE: Not canon. 
MARISHA: We were filling in the blanks. 
LAURA: It's called The Long Road Home. 
LIAM: I don't think that's accurate. 
TALIESIN: Too late. 
TRAVIS: We call it the Dirt Bud. 
LIAM: You ought to go nose around in there. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: "Well, I--" 
MARISHA: What goes around-- 
ROBBIE: Hollow Haven. 
MARISHA: -- comes around. 
MATT: "I have to go follow up with the specifics of the rest of the supplies we're supposed to get down. I have an entire breakdown ledger of who we're supposed to be carrying on the first delivery mission tomorrow or the day after to try and get things prepared for the Hellcatch." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "So--" 
LAURA: So soon. 
MATT: "I'll be around. You know how to get in touch with me, right?" 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "So yeah, if you need anything." 
LAURA: Xandis, it's so good to see you again. I'm so happy-- 
MATT: "You too." 
LAURA: -- to see you're so well. 
MATT: "Well, you all, too. Where's the little guy?" 
LAURA: Not so well, unfortunately. 
MATT: "I'm sorry to hear that." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: They saved us. It was very brave. 
MATT: "Was... I liked them a lot. They were very kind, I don't know, uplifting sort of folk. Not a whole lot of those in these places, you know?" 
LAURA: Very true. 
MATT: "Well--" 
SAM: Lovely to meet you. Have fun at your key party or whatever, and-- 
MATT: "Okay, thank you. No. Absolute pleasure to meet you, Mr. Storm." 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
TALIESIN: How? (laughter) 
MATT: "Keep him safe." 
SAM: Oh, yes. 
ROBBIE: Oh, yes, because he's my-- 
SAM: My squire. What does a squire call them? 
ASHLEY: Squiee. 
SAM: Squiee? (laughter) 
SAM: I'm the squire. He's the squiee. 
ROBBIE: I don't think that's right, but we'll work it. We'll work it. 
TALIESIN: Squire. Squad. Everyone knows that. 
MATT: "Good luck with whatever's going on with the moon stuff. Hopefully not too dangerous." 
LAURA: Oh, it's going to be hell. 
LIAM: It's pretty dangerous. 
MATT: "I guess we're all going to hell again then, aren't we?" 
LAURA: That's right. 
MATT: "(laughs) Yeah, saw that look in your eyes when we first met. Knew it was just going to get crazier as it goes." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "(huffs) All right, with that, I'm going to get some breakfast and do some paperwork." 
LAURA: Aha. 
MATT: "Good to see you all." 
ASHLEY: Smiley day to you. 
LIAM: So good. 
SAM: Bidet. 
MATT: Stops and goes, "Smiley day to you, too." 
MARISHA: Aww. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Captain. 
MATT: "All right, Wait up!" and then runs off back down the street there. 
LAURA: He's alive! That's so good. 
TRAVIS: Unexpected. 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: For another week, at least. 
TRAVIS: Really statistically improbable. 
LAURA: Blew up. It seriously looked like they were-- 
SAM: He said that Ira saved his life? 
TALIESIN: He had a deal. 
LIAM: Oh yeah, we saw. 
SAM: Surprising. 
TRAVIS: No, that was part of the plan. 
MARISHA: Yes, he was supposed to bamf them-- 
ASHLEY: Ira's not that bad. 
LIAM: We saw them arc away, didn't we? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We had a plan for him to get off. We did not-- 
TRAVIS: Ira bamfed him off as we were crashing it down. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: But there was really nothing after being in the middle of the desert. 
MARISHA: No. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: You don't ever really have to worry about that type. It always just seems like they end up on the right side of the coin. 
TRAVIS: It really does. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: That really should not have happened. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Is there-- I have a question. Is there a, and do you think this would be of any benefit? Is there a temple of Asmodeus here? 
LAURA: Oh, I don't think there would be any temples to the betrayer gods here in Vasselheim. 
ASHLEY: So, betrayer gods-- 
LAURA: Are big nos. 
ASHLEY: They don't have those temples here? 
SAM: Why are you interested in-- 
ASHLEY: No, I'm just wondering if we should get some other opinions. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh, well, I mean, here's the thing. 
SAM: That's fair. 
LAURA: I think the Arch Heart and the Matron are going to have, you know, their opinion on things. I think they're the only two gods that have that opinion. If we want to talk to some of the other primes, I mean, we can try, and I think they're going to say what the Wildmother said is just fight and-- 
SAM: But you want the opinions of the not-so-primes. 
ASHLEY: I guess. I don't know. I don't know. 
SAM: No, that's a fair opinion. 
ASHLEY: But I guess only some of them are allowed here. 
MARISHA: Well, you said you wanted to pray. You wanted to pray on-- 
SAM: Yes. I wasn't planning on praying to him. 
MARISHA: Who would you pray to? 
SAM: Well, I am still trying-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Who you pray to? 
SAM: I just feel like if I pray to him holding this mask, he's going to be like, "Give me that thing," or something, you know? 
LAURA: Yeah, he might break it. 
SAM: Yeah, I don't want to-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's true. 
SAM: -- necessarily do that, so. 
MARISHA: So, you going to Pray to Matron of Ravens? 
SAM: No, maybe to the Platinum Dragon to just see-- 
LAURA: Well, we're on our way to the Sanctuary right now. 
SAM: I know. That's what I'm saying. 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
ROBBIE: For we may have some insight into the minds of the Betrayer Gods. When we were in the Matron of Ravens' den, fighting her illusions, I touched a thread, and-- 
MARISHA: (gasps) You're right, you haven't told us about this. That's right. 
ROBBIE: Well, I saw some things. I saw Opal alive, but perhaps not well. 
SAM: Oh. 
ROBBIE: With companions. They appeared to be preparing for some sort of conflict, I think like everything else around here, and-- 
LIAM: Could you tell what her surroundings were? 
ROBBIE: It was at-- 
LIAM: The world? 
ROBBIE: A place I hadn't seen. It felt wild and mounty. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I have limited knowledge on this area of the world. Unfamiliar to me. 
MATT: I'll say, what you saw was-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: What you saw was a cracked, dust bowl-type badlands scape. 
ROBBIE: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: That sounds like the Hellcatch. 
ASHLEY: Hellcatch? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: It sounds very similar to something Hellcatch- related, yeah. 
ASHLEY: That sounds Hellcatch-y. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wild lands. 
ROBBIE: Didn't-- Like I said, I don't know a lot really. 
LAURA: Well, the Hellcatch is where the Malleus Key is, so that would make sense if-- 
ASHLEY: Wow, what if she's there? 
LAURA: -- she's joining the battle. 
ROBBIE: Long and short of it is she's the champion of the Spider Queen as far as I can tell, and if the Betrayer Gods are enlisting champions to fight for their side, I would assume that Opal is preparing to fight as well. 
LAURA: The fact that, you know, what's your betrothed's name again? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Devin? 
MATT: Teven. 
ASHLEY: Teven. 
LAURA: Teven. Why do I always say Devon? I always say Devon. 
ASHLEY: Teven. Teven. 
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, he was from the Lord of Hells, right? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he was. 
LAURA: So-- 
ASHLEY: He was. 
SAM: Well, I mean, if she's preparing to fight, she might have some insight into what the other betrayer is. 
LIAM: We could reach out to Opal. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: We'll want to. 
LAURA: I don't know her. 
LIAM: Do you have to? I don't know how anything works. 
LAURA: I mean, I don't know. I guess-- 
SAM: Doesn't seem like the sort of thing that 25 words is going to really-- 
LAURA: "Hey, tell me all about your Spider Queen. Are you bad?" 
MARISHA: Hang on, because didn't, the last time you saw Opal, wasn't she trying to brutally murder you? 
ROBBIE: I'm not certain any information we would get from her would be particularly reliable. 
TALIESIN: I mean, I think communing with any of the betrayer gods is probably a bad idea. If you know someone's, by nature, either dishonest or has another agenda, there's nothing useful to usually be gained. 
LAURA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: But-- 
LAURA: We won't be able to trust it, anyway. 
TALIESIN: I've had plenty of reasonable conversations with people who tried to kill me the last time I saw them. If there's a connection and if you have that, you might have a sense of whether or not she's lying, or if she even knows. 
SAM: If they spoke, you mean? Face to face? 
TALIESIN: It might, or at least if there's a way to have a distanced conversation. I don't know. I'm-- I don't know. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, workshopping it. Riff it. 
SAM: No, this is good. 
ASHLEY: You know, there's lots of things we could do. 
LIAM: I know it was a nightmare, but... 
ROBBIE: It felt real. 
LIAM: You and I still care about her, and we might not have many more, if any, chances to say goodbye. In fact, everybody here should start thinking about any goodbyes. 
TRAVIS: Goodbyes? 
ASHLEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
TRAVIS: The fuck are you talking about? Goodbyes? 
ASHLEY: Negative Nancy over here. 
TRAVIS: No, this is, yeah, this is-- He's right. 
TRAVIS: Really?! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Goodbyes? Are we going to enter this with a negative disposition? 
LAURA: Definitely not. 
ASHLEY: No, we're going to win! 
LAURA: We're going to win. We are going to do whatever it takes to win. 
TRAVIS: Or-- 
LAURA: We're going to win. 
TRAVIS: If goodbye's your thing, go for it. Sure. Go say goodbye. Set a tone. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: (giggles) 
TRAVIS: Just tell yourself it's all going to go shit up. It's okay. 
MARISHA: I mean, I secretly say goodbye to you every night, Chetney, because lord knows. 
LIAM: Can't believe you're here. 
MARISHA: We don't know (laughs) if you're going to wake up. 
TRAVIS: What's the point of goodbye? 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughter) 
LAURA: So we should say goodbye to you every night, Chet. 
ASHLEY: Bye, Chet. 
SAM: Instead of good night. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: That's actually a good idea. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: That is a good idea! 
TRAVIS: You start doing that, I will leave. (laughter) 
LIAM: Goodnight, Westley. I'll most likely be dead in the morning. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I disagree. It is not a negative thing to be realistic about what we're going into and pretending everything's going to be fine... Pretending everything's going to be fine is not helping anybody, and if there's someone you want to talk to or if there's something you want to say and that's how you hit the end, however it goes, and I mean, what else the fuck do you have? 
MARISHA: What if we all, before we go into this do a eulogy for each other? We all get up like we're there at our own funerals and just say what we would say in case we die. 
TALIESIN: I don't want to hear you lie about me. 
SAM: I don't mind that. I mean, maybe it's morbid, but I've always wondered, you know, who would go to my funeral and what they would say. It's sort of interesting to think about. 
ASHLEY: That's something to do, for sure. 
LIAM: We could do it up on the titan. In his crack. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I actually-- 
SAM: The Hollow Haven, or whatever it's called. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: If they'll let me, I want to sleep in the head of that thing. 
MATT: It's canon now. 
ASHLEY: The Lava Flow? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's the winner. 
TALIESIN: Not even kidding. 
LAURA: It might be our last night to do it. If you're going to sleep in it, sleep in it tonight. 
TALIESIN: That's what I plan on doing. I'm going to try and drag Fearne if... 
ASHLEY: You don't have to drag me, I'll go. 
TALIESIN: No, I'll drag you. It'll be fun. 
ASHLEY: I was already thinking of it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Titan's Taint Inn. 
ASHLEY: Titan's Taint Inn. The Watering Hole. 
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. 
ROBBIE: Mm. (laughter) 
MATT: Mm. 
LAURA: The Watery Hole. 
ASHLEY: The Watery Hole. (laughter) 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: The Lottery Hole. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: No. 
SAM: Now we're just rhyming. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: Still have little a bit of blood in your ear. 
LAURA: Are we at the Sanctuary yet? 
TRAVIS: No, we're just talking. 
MATT: If you want be. 
TRAVIS: We're talking about nothing. 
SAM: Yes. We're there. 
MATT: Have as much conversation as you want to have. 
ROBBIE: Walk and talk. 
LAURA: We're there, we're there, we're there. 
SAM: So many stairs! (laughter) 
LAURA: I'm flying. I'm flying. I hate these stairs. 
LIAM: 233. 
MATT: Yeah, no worries. 
ASHLEY: Maybe it's called The Brown Note. 
SAM: Ooh! 
MARISHA: That's a good one. That's a good one too. 
MATT: No, as you approach Silver Talon's Reach, the majority of the forces that were here before, or the majority of the forces here are the ones you've seen here before, as well as renewed forces that have also gathered as well. You've not seen this much military might in one focused place, and it is challenging at times to carve through the Reach as you get close to it because a lot of the area is just amassed military set grounds. You have tents, massive war tents set up on one end to the other. But you get to the stairs and begin to ascend to the Platinum Sanctuary. Approaching there, the guards are present and two of the representatives of the Sanctuary are outside. Upon request, they go and gather Allura Vysoren, who, big heavy coat on, abruptly steps out into the snow. "Oh, wondrous! You're all here. That's good news. So what fares you all on your journey to the Fey?" 
LAURA: Yes. 
SAM: Utter success. 
TALIESIN: Honestly-- 
LAURA: Yeah. Lord Zathuda-- Is that how I say his name? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's great. That's good. 
LAURA: -- is no more. 
MATT: "Oh! That is good news." 
LAURA: The Unseelie hopefully will not be joining. So mission-- 
SAM: Definition will not be. 
MATT: "Hopefully? Yes." 
LAURA: Mission success. 
SAM: Definitely. 
ROBBIE: Quick question-- 
MATT: "Assurances on this? I want to make sure before we go into this, you are fairly certain there will be no Unseelie meddling?" 
SAM: Yes. 
ROBBIE: One moment. I'm going to, (whistles) I'm going to see if I can summon Coriolis back, if he's come back this way or if he's anywhere in the vicinity. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: You summoned Coriolis while you were in the Fey Realm. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Oh! How did that work? 
MATT: So if you want to call it, you'd have to recast the spell, which you could do as you're walking here I'd say, if you had that interest in mind. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: It's a ritual? 
SAM: Does it take an hour? 
LAURA: Is it a ritual spell? 
ROBBIE: It's not long. No, it takes 10 minutes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: We can just sit here in silence for 10 minutes. 
ROBBIE: Just staring. 
LAURA: Just staring. (laughter) 
SAM: Hold on, Allura. 
LAURA: You're just whistling the whole time. 
MATT: Just a moment. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll recast it and try to summon him to try to get some confirmation. 
TALIESIN: Dorian has a horse. It'll take about nine more minutes. 
MATT: Right. 
MATT and SAM: (laugh) 
MATT: No, easy enough. We'll say, as far as preparation of the day, you could have called Coriolis. 
ROBBIE: Okay. But I'll take this slot out. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Thank you. Yeah. 
MATT: So as you whistle into the air, (airborne arrival) it draws up over the side of the staircase, (rises and settles) sidles up next to you. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. I'll rub my head into him and rub his muzzle and whisper: Did you-- I mean, he can't speak back, but he can understand. He can understand me. 
MATT: Correct. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to say: Clop twice if you dropped off the guard. 
LAURA: Clop three times if you summoned him before he had done it. (laughter) 
LAURA: He just dropped the guy. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: (falling scream) 
ROBBIE: It's taken a minute. 
SAM: As your faithful squire, I could speak to him for you. 
ROBBIE: Like talk to him, talk to him? 
SAM: Sure. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
SAM: I am not a horse, but I've been around many in my life, so I speak-- 
LIAM: From a cow to a horse. 
SAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: That sounds neat! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: I don't need to do the clopping trick. 
ASHLEY: From the cow's mouth. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Could you ask him what happened? 
SAM: Sure. 
ROBBIE: What transpired? 
SAM: (whinnies) (laughter) 
SAM: (whinnies conversationally) 
TALIESIN: That felt very short. 
MATT: How do you speak? 
SAM: Speak to Animals. Speak with Animals. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I have that as part of my whatever. 
LIAM: I'm a horse. 
LAURA: (laughs) I'm a horse. 
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: I'm a horse. 
SAM: I'm a horse. 
ASHLEY: I'm a horse. 
LAURA: I'm a cow. 
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to ask him if he fulfilled his master's duty. 
MATT: All right. The equine dragon steps up-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: -- its piercing silvered eyes glancing towards you. The bluish coloration of the edges seem to be piercing your very essence. Its curled horns and its scaled exterior, the muscles, lithe as this creature's body is, still strong as it steps towards you. 
SAM: I thought it was a horse. 
MATT: Its somewhat ethereal body just holding a presence before you. 
ROBBIE: It's a dragon. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: (inhales) (huffs) (snarls conversationally) It begins to speak a language that you do not understand because it is technically not a beast. 
SAM: It's not an animal? 
MATT: Nope. 
LAURA: Oh! (laughter) 
MATT: Then, turns back to you and goes: (clops twice) (laughter) 
SAM: He said-- 
ROBBIE: He said yes. 
SAM: He said yes. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
SAM: He told me this. He said, "Yes, I have carried out my master's duty honorably and faithfully, and ahead of schedule," is what he said. 
MATT: (exasperated huff) 
SAM: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yes, that's exactly what he said. Yeah. 
SAM: He spoke with a French accent. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I knew it! (laughter) 
LIAM: Well, that's a horse of a different color! 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: But we don't know for sure if-- 
ROBBIE: We don't have confirmation of whether or not the task is 100% complete, but all of the pieces are there. All the pieces are there, and if everything goes according to plan, the Unseelie shouldn't be arriving. 
LIAM: It came at great cost, but it got there. 
MATT: "Well, I suppose the sooner the better then. In case this uncertainty comes to bear, the less time they have to prepare, the greater chance we have. Very well. Thank you for following through on this endeavor." 
LAURA: In your head, you hear: Should we tell her we talked to the gods? 
SAM: Drip, drip. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Its frozen now. I guess it couldn't hurt? I don't know. 
LAURA: I won't. 
MATT: "How are you all doing?" 
TALIESIN: (laughs dryly) 
MATT: "Genuinely. I can see there is much weight on your shoulders, and I just want to ensure that you are all still up for this." 
LIAM: No question, we're up for it. 
ROBBIE: Moreso than when we left. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: It is a lot to carry, but you and everyone in the city is helping us carry. 
MATT: "Good." 
MARISHA: Actually, question. 
MATT: "Of course." 
MARISHA: Some of us think we should say our goodbyes, just in case. When you were in an adventuring party, before you rushed into battle, would you ever say goodbye, or just know you were going to make it out alive? 
MATT: "When I was younger and impetuous, I would likely not focus on the possibility of failure. I do believe it also helped that the one I would say goodbye to was traveling with me. But traveling with them, we thought we were saying goodbye a number of times in multiple different ways. I think that depends on-- It depends on the individual's perspective." 
MARISHA: Mm. 
MATT: "If you're willing to leave things unsaid, or if that's what drives you, I suppose. Hmm. Speaking of which, I should probably check in with her. Anyway, to get you all up to speed from our perspective, our forces are now gathered, namely here, Ank'Harel, and Whitestone, and soon we'll have amassed enough magical means to directly deliver them to the Hellcatch in a flash, more or less. We have two spy units that have scoped out the other side of the Bloody Bridge with only one of them returning. But it seems that a rather vast army is gathering, preparing to cross the bridge in the near future, a number of Ruidian soldiers of all walks and forms, monstrous beasts, gargantuan armored insectoid siege creatures, all manner of terrifying things are--" 
LAURA: Vidulches. 
MATT: "-- preparing. Certainly." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: "But as we progress here, we cannot expect that they are waiting. So there is a general consensus that time may be of the essence. So, if you do wish to say your goodbyes, perhaps soon would be in order." 
LAURA: Should we leave today or in the morning? 
MATT: "Well, I mean, that's up to whenever you're ready. We have the better part of the afternoon, evening to have the majority of our forces here. Things are still in motion. I'm uncertain if everything will be ready for the assault soon. But we also are awaiting your arrival at Kreviris to even begin to signal our part of the plan." 
LIAM: So the sooner we get started, the better for the other two corners of the triangle to find their place. 
MATT: "I imagine." 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "You know, in ways that none of us do, what your path is from the lake to the core of that city. So that timeline is your own to set out. But when you are ready there, when you're at the outskirts of their capital, that would be when you would let us know." 
SAM: I've forgotten. How do we let you know? Did we discuss that? 
TALIESIN: We go: Caw! Caw! 
MATT: "I imagine the same way you've been letting us know a number of things." 
SAM: But is there a way to communicate from there to here? 
LAURA: We can send messages from Ruidus down? I can't remember. 
MATT: You have contacted people from across that boundary. 
LAURA: We've done it before. Yeah. 
MATT: It seems that that limitation has lifted. 
SAM: Oh, okay. Okay. 
ROBBIE: Above table question again. After that scrap we had with the Matron, we got all our hit points back? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: It was as if we had a long-- Do we get our spell slots back? Are we still back to-- 
LAURA: We're solid. 
MATT: Yeah. It was as if it was just a vision. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm just down some 3rd-levels now because I've been sending out messages, but that's fine, other than that. 
TALIESIN: I'd like to try the-- I'd like to try and see if there's anything in that Titan worth talking to, but other than that, I'm good to go. 
MARISHA: Where is the other group that we were going to be traveling with? Are they ready? 
MATT: "The Mighty Nein. They are a-- Well, I believe you've said you've met a couple of them, but they're supposed to be arriving in Lake Umamu within the day, if not by the evening." 
LAURA: All right. 
ASHLEY: They're going to meet us at the lake? 
MARISHA: Oh, we're meeting them there? 
MATT: "I believe so, yes." 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: "There is a Zephran outpost that was set up there to watch over this lake and portal at your instruction, I believe Lady Keyleth said." 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
LIAM: How many are there? 
MATT: "I've not been myself, but as an outpost, I imagine at least a dozen or more." 
ROBBIE: Is it far? 
LAURA: We'd have to teleport. 
MATT: "I likely could help you do so. After all, you need to keep your capabilities at your disposal, while the rest of us might have an evening of rest, should all go according to plan. But yes. The Mighty Nein are to escort you to the city of Kreviris, where they will deliver you to the base of the spire, the pillar, the crystal pillar you spoke of, and they are to infiltrate the Arx Creonum where the Weave Mind resides." 
LAURA: Then we head down to the-- 
MATT: "To find Ludinus, Liliana, and whoever else of the Vanguard is attempting to awaken and free Predathos, and stop them at all costs." 
LAURA: We know that they are mounting up those armies to cross through the bridge. The sooner we can do it, the less time we waste, the greater chance of survival for everyone fighting on the front. 
LIAM: Yeah, we should get moving as fast as we can. Anything that we need to do, we should decide it, do it, and maybe by nightfall here, at the latest. 
LAURA: Get out. Yeah. 
MARISHA: How long is it going to take the fleet to get to Hellcatch? It's quite a lot. 
MATT: "Well, we've pulled in quite a few favors, even many powerful arcanists and spell weavers who choose not to get involved in politics or religion do have a vested interest in the future of society. If they do not join in the front lines, they are at least available for the translocation of our forces. So should we have enough at the ready, the majority of our forces should be there rather quick." 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Oh, wow! 
ROBBIE: So this is just a forward operating base and then you send your forces to where they need to be? 
MATT: "Between the three cities." 
LAURA: Wow! 
ROBBIE: Amazing. 
MATT: "That's the goal, at least. (chuckles) I always have to keep that in mind." 
LIAM: Lady Allura, thank you so much for everything you've done for us through all of this. 
MATT: "I've been in your position before myself, and I am only here because others were so gracious as to aid me and the ones I care about to protect this realm. I recognize that sacrifice and that challenge." 
LIAM: Well, your wisdom is appreciated and your wife is a very lucky woman. 
MATT: "Yes, she is." 
LAURA and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
MATT: "But so am I. It's difficult to live a lifetime seemingly continuously on the cusp of history, but I guess that's just what life is in Exandria these days. (laughs)" 
LIAM: Final round pays for all. 
LAURA: So we'll see you in a few hours. 
MATT: "Certainly. I will make the arrangements, notifications that you intend to begin your trek soon enough. I will forward this on to Lady Keyleth and my contact with the Mighty Nein. Any other preparations you require, I know supplies are rather scarce and scattered throughout the city amongst the various forces here, but here, these will do you better than I under these circumstances." She pulls her side satchel over in front of her and reaches deep into it, up to-- 
LAURA: Mary Poppins. 
MATT: Yep. And pulls out a few clanking vials that sit within these two small, leather-strapped cases, one of which seems to carry two-- (murmurs of appreciation) 
MATT: -- additional healing potions. 
LAURA: Clutch! 
MARISHA: Wow, she is loading us up! 
SAM: Is that cracked? Does that one have a crack in it? 
MATT: The other one contains-- 
SAM: Oh, fuck right off! 
MATT: -- only a singular one. 
LAURA: That one's cracked. 
LIAM: Whoa! 
ROBBIE, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Whoa! 
ROBBIE: Look at that thing! 
LAURA: Goosh! 
ASHLEY: Biggie! 
SAM: Do you also have those, Marisha? 
MARISHA: I think so. 
LAURA: Yeah. We have all-- We should spread these out. 
ROBBIE: I have this. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll do a-- 
ROBBIE: That's it. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I think these were all of ours. I think this one I had, and then-- 
LIAM: I have a couple of regulars. 
MARISHA: But I also have two over here. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, I only have a little guy. 
LAURA: Who goes down the most? Orym. Laudna. 
TALIESIN: Chet, weirdly. 
MARISHA: I haven't been down in moment. 
SAM: You two go down on each other a lot. (laughter) 
LIAM: Yeah. Like, constantly. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, 
LIAM: Constantly. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You should take one. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: For sure. 
ASHLEY: I wonder if you should take biggie. 
LAURA: Who going to take the biggies? Who's going to take this biggie? 
MARISHA: Oh no, I spilled it! 
ROBBIE: You've ruined it! It's gone. 
MARISHA: 700 gold! 
ROBBIE: You spilled it. 
MATT: It's gone. Sorry. 
ROBBIE: And one. 
LIAM: Orym's in a different place since Seedling was exalted. 
ASHLEY: You take it. 
LIAM: So I have a couple of basics to try to administer to other people, but I'm not-- 
MARISHA: I think I had these two. Although, there's one-- 
LIAM: I grow. 
TALIESIN: Actually, do you want a-- 
ASHLEY: I feel like Orym should take this. 
TALIESIN: Anyone not have a-- 
ROBBIE: I have a regular. 
TALIESIN: Anybody need a regular? 
SAM: Nothing. But. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: Chetney has-- 
LAURA: Chetney. Does Chetney have any? 
MARISHA: Chetney has one. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Should we-- 
LAURA: You don't have any! 
ROBBIE: Did you take the big guy? 
ASHLEY: But I can do healing. 
MATT: That one's gone now too. 
LAURA: I took the biggun. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I can do healing. So I mean, I could take one of those. 
TALIESIN: Damn it, Laudna! 
TRAVIS: These are nice and all, but after the completion of a very first, what do we call it, a pre-mission? It would also be nice to see Bells Hells be funded adequately. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "What do you require?" 
TRAVIS: 30,000 gold would be good. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Chet! 
SAM: Inflation is crazy on the moon. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: We have to make sure that in between here and there, should we come across any obstacle, we have the resources-- 
LIAM: They're dealing with shrinkflation. 
TRAVIS: -- in order to deal with it. We don't want a bump in the road at the last minute. 
TALIESIN: Honestly-- 
TRAVIS: Surely you would admit that 30,000 gold toward what we're trying to achieve is money well spent. 
ASHLEY: I agree. 
TALIESIN: Actually-- 
TRAVIS: Shut up! 
TALIESIN: I have a retort for that. I have a retort, you strange little toy maker! 
TRAVIS: Was I talking to you? 
TALIESIN: Well, you are now. Gems, not gold. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
TALIESIN: Gems. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: We do have to make sure we have some Revivify gems. 
TRAVIS: 17. Natural 17. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we do need those. 
MATT: Natural 17 for a total of? 
TRAVIS: 17. (laughter) 
MATT: She goes-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: -- "Indeed, you are gracious heroes. Completed your pre-mission event, returned now twice to distant lands with information that might set us all on the path to victory. It is only fair that you receive whatever I can muster," and tosses her coin purse to you. 
TRAVIS: (jangling catch) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Gems would be more useful than gold. 
ASHLEY: Gems would be great. 
TRAVIS: Why? 
TALIESIN: A, they can use for spells-- 
SAM: For Revivify. 
LIAM: Spells. 
TALIESIN: Also, because people on the-- 
LAURA: (laughs) "Why?" Is that what you said? 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: "Why?" 
TALIESIN: Because that doesn't buy as much as gems do on our little, red moon. 
LAURA: On the moon. 
TRAVIS: Go find somebody else to hit up for money. This one's mine. (laughter) 
MATT: So in the coin purse, it'd be-- 
TALIESIN: Keep giving him money. 
MATT: -- 400 platinum. 
ROBBIE: 400. 
SAM: Whoa! 
LAURA: How much did she just give-- 
TRAVIS: 400 platinum. 
MATT: 400 platinum. 
LAURA: Holy shit! 
LIAM: That's a lot. 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
MATT: And we'll say 35 silver. There's not even a gold piece in there. 
TALIESIN: I love that. The 35 silver feels like a minor insult, and I appreciate that. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: It's just for tips. 
MARISHA: Change. Yeah, exactly! (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's not even a good tip. 
ROBBIE: No. 
MARISHA: Public transit. 
TALIESIN: But gems went really well up there. 
MATT: "Not going to be doing me any good (laughs) in the days to come. (sighs)" 
TALIESIN: That would actually-- You might know this, Allura. Miss? Lady Allura. Yeah. 
MATT: "Allura's fine." 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Thank you. That was just hard. Where would I find a holy person of the Ashari? Where would they be hiding around? Not necessarily a priest. I know they don't-- 
MATT: "Well--" 
TALIESIN: In town. 
MATT: "In town, the two most influential figures of the Ashari, one of which is currently off gathering her compatriots, the other one is Flamespeaker Cerkonos, who is also one of the front warrior generals helping us organize the assault. Generally, his home is Pyrah, not too far from here, maybe about 200 miles to the southwest of here." 
TALIESIN: Perfect. You think they'd be interested in talking to a couple of us, if they've got the time? Or would they know who we are at this point? 
MATT: "Well, they were in the meeting when we were in the sanctuary, so I imagine they know who you are and where your alliances lie. Just finding them would be the concern." 
TALIESIN: All right. Thank you. 
MATT: "Of course. Well, if there's anything else you require, you know where to find me. I'm going to start spreading the news." 
TALIESIN: So we're leaving today? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: ♪ Start spreading the news ♪ 
TALIESIN: Thank you. (laughter) That's all I wanted. 
TRAVIS: Bit of a brand new start of it. (laughter) 
LAURA: So Ashton, which one are you wanting to do? Are you wanting to go to the Titan's Head or you want to teleport over to Pyrah? 
TALIESIN: Well, he's not in Pyrah. Oh, he is in Pyrah? He's not here? 
LAURA: Cerkonos is in Pyrah, right? 
TALIESIN: Okay, he's not here here. 
MATT: You didn't get a clear-- 
TALIESIN: Okay, I thought-- 
MATT: -- Tag on it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: He's been helping organize, he was present at the Platinum Sanctuary. 
TALIESIN: So he might be here. 
MATT: He might be here, but-- 
TALIESIN: Mostly it was if they were in town to have somebody who could maybe lend some advice on how to deal with the skull. But you know, we can wing it. 
ASHLEY: I think it'll be fun to go see a titan up close. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Even if it's just the skull. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: If we have time. 
LAURA: I mean, that's what we gave the extra time to Allura for, unless we're going to go around town and use some of that fabulous money that Chet just got to buy some gems so that we could bring some people back to life if we go down in battle. 
SAM: Do you have Revivify? 
ASHLEY: Chetters. I do. 
SAM: So we need-- 
ASHLEY: I believe I put in on. 
SAM: -- 600 gold worth of-- ASHLEY Yeah, we need-- 
LAURA: Diamonds. 
SAM: -- diamond dust. For two Revivifies. 
ASHLEY: I will put it in. 
TALIESIN: Honestly, as many gems as we can get, in my opinion. Of any kind. 
ROBBIE: Is it consumed? 
SAM: Mm-hmm 
LAURA: Yeah. How about y'all go up to the Titan skull-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: See what you can see and we can go around town and see if we can find any diamond dust. 
TALIESIN: Yeah! 
LAURA: It's probably all gone with the coming battles, but we'll see what we can find. 
ASHLEY: I do have Revivify. 
TALIESIN: Somebody got to have something down here. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
MATT: All right. So who's Team Purchase, who's Team Titan? 
SAM: Team Titan, go! 
MATT: Yep. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We don't-- 
ROBBIE: I definitely want to go down into the town, into the military encampments. Yeah, I might even break away from the shopping party-- 
LAURA: All right. 
ROBBIE: -- for just a minute. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'll go to the Titan. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA: Chet? 
TRAVIS: Hmm? 
LAURA: You want to come shopping with us, or do you want to just give us some money? 
TRAVIS: I won't do that either. I'll give you a loan. 
LAURA: Okay, yeah. Give me a loan, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughter) 
LIAM: Pay you back after the end of the world. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: He'll never survive. That'll be great. 
TRAVIS: Interest accruing is a bitch. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: But Rome wasn't built in a day, baby! (laughter) 
LIAM: Hasn't been built at all, I think. 
TRAVIS: What is Rome? (laughter) 
MATT: Little blood trickles from the nose. 
ROBBIE: Why did I say that? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: This is it! (laughter) Sweet surrender! 
LAURA: Just a quarter. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The boatman cometh! 
LIAM: At last! 
LAURA: A quarter of what Allura just gave you would be helpful. Or you want to just give me the whole-- 
TRAVIS: I guess it would be, in theory. Yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: Chet! Come on! 
ASHLEY: Chetters! 
TRAVIS: Yes? 
LAURA: Help out! 
LIAM: I have some money. I'll go shopping with you. I have some. 
LAURA: Do you have enough-- 
ASHLEY: Here, I'm going to give what I have. 
LAURA: To buy 600 gold worth of diamond dust? 
LIAM: I have 550. 
LAURA: I have 60 gold. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to give you, I have 69 gold. 
LIAM, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Nice! 
ASHLEY: Then, I'm cleaned out. So take it. 
LIAM: So there. Between Fearne and I-- 
ASHLEY: Tried to give it away. 
TALIESIN: One. 
ASHLEY: I really tried to buy your egg. 
ROBBIE: How stubborn is Chet being about this money right now? 
TRAVIS: Listen, I only have about 11,000 gold. 
LAURA: Chet! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It honestly doesn't matter because we're not letting him come with us to the titan. So knock him out and drag him around. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to walk over to Chetney and I'm going to grab his little hands, and say, "Hi, buddy!" 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Hey, Dorian. 
ROBBIE: You and I have not had much solo time lately, have we? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: No? 
ROBBIE: I missed you. 
TRAVIS: Missed you, too. 
ROBBIE: I just think I know you love certain things. You love wood, you love money, you love vague sexual innuendo. (laughter) I just think this might be a time to maybe just let a little of that go for a second for your friends. And I'll cast Charm Person on him. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS: I also like overt (slurs) sexual innuendos. (laughter) 
MATT: Make wisdom saving throw with advantage because of your natural resistance to magic. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Got to try! Got to try! 
MARISHA: Advantage. 
TRAVIS: Eight. (laughter) Two and a six. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: (groans) So maybe-- 
MARISHA: All the sexual innuendos are running through his head. 
ROBBIE: Just maybe those tiny, supple, soft, strong, little hands can reach deep down in that coin purse. 
TRAVIS: Keep going. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: And give your friends a little bit of money. 
LIAM: Loan me, daddy. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Little bit of money. Everybody wins. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, just a little bit of money. 
TALIESIN: You've been a bad Chet. 
TRAVIS: Reach the peak! 
ROBBIE: Just a little bit. 
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughter) I'll reach in and I'll grab-- 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
TRAVIS: Half. (gasping) 
SAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: Ooh! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Thank you, Chet! 
TRAVIS: It's like a bag of sand. 
LAURA: Wow! (laughter) That's so kind. 
TRAVIS: Make it rain! 
LAURA: No, no, no! (laughter) (coins jingling) 
LAURA: Mage Hand, Mage Hand, Mage Hand! (laughter) 
LAURA: All right. 200 platinum. 
TRAVIS: Mm. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: And my 69 gold. 
LAURA: I got it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN and SAM: Nice! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I feel really optimistic about our outlook in the near future. Let's go shopping. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: You want to go shopping!? 
TRAVIS: I guess. 
ASHLEY: Chet, are you okay? 
LAURA: Let's do it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just feeling really warm. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LAURA: Apparently, all you need to do is flirt with Chet and he'll give you money. 
ROBBIE: It only lasts for an hour. (laughter) Anyway, I got stuff to do! I'm going to run off into the encampment. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: We go spend it before he realizes. Oh, he's going to be so pissed! 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) All right. So Dorian's on his brief excursion. Who's going to the Titan? 
TALIESIN: The three of us. 
MATT: Laudna, Ashton, and Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Oh, Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. And the rest are Team Shopping. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Sweet. 
MATT: Okay. So, first we'll go ahead with Team Shopping. As you begin to wander around, what is it you're looking for? 
LAURA: Diamond dust. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
SAM: Primarily. 
LAURA: Primarily-- 
TRAVIS: Dick. 
LAURA: -- stuff to help us if we fall down. 
TRAVIS: Ass. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) Perfect. Okay. Make a perception check for me, if you don't mind. 
SAM: All of us? 
LAURA: All of us? 
MATT: Those who are helming-- 
LAURA: Team Shop? 
MATT: Team Shopping. 
LIAM: 26. 
LAURA: 13. 
TALIESIN: There's no fighting. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Six. 
LAURA: Sex. 
LIAM: Sex, sex. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Six, six over here as well. 
TRAVIS: You heard what I said. 
ASHLEY: Sex. (laughter) 
MATT: A lot of the businesses here that are selling more flippant goods, things that are luxury items are fairly empty, and some of them are actually half closed today. The general air of the city itself notifying them that perhaps this isn't the most useful and fruitful time to be peddling their wares. As far as supplies go, asking a few questions and wandering around, a lot of places are fairly empty. Most of what they had when it comes to anything useful, whether it be for crafting, repairing, or traversing and heading out into a harsher environment has already been picked up and most places are cleaned out, and even some soldiers have gone around and probably cleaned up and buying gifts for folks at home in the hope that they could return to their families across Exandria and have something to show from it from a city like Vasselheim, which many of them likely had never been and probably might not have been to before or ever again. You do eventually find one smaller shop that's a little ramshackle, but it's only because the paint has withered in time. But you see it says, "Cidrick's Shines and Keepsakes." As you step up to the interior, you can see the interior has this extremely gaudy red velvet painted color to the walls, but it's faded a little bit and it's a little bit stripped. As you step in to the interior, it is empty and the shelves themselves are pretty threadbare, except for you do see one gentleman in the back with gray hair and a gray curved mustache and a little Van Dyke goatee. He looks up and goes, "Ah! Welcome, friends! Welcome to Cidrick's. I'm mostly sold out, but what can I do for you?" 
LAURA: Trying times. We are actually on our way out, but we're just wondering if you had any leftover-- 
SAM: Diamonds. 
LAURA: Diamond dust. (laughter) 
SAM: Some spare-- 
LIAM: Gem dust. 
SAM: -- diamonds. 
TRAVIS: Or a lead on gem dust or diamonds. 
LAURA: Just little bits, you know, that you don't need. 
MATT: "Strange requests in the middle of times such as these." 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: We're romantics. 
TRAVIS: We're also working with the High Council. We're reporting to the Platinum Sanctuary. 
MATT: "Mm! Sold straight out. No gems here. Sorry. (chuckles)" 
SAM: Do I believe him? 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
SAM: 18 plus insight. 22. Oh, I get a whisper! 
LAURA: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: Like that about that. 
SAM: I get a whisper. 
ROBBIE: (sings) 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: It's all tongue-- 
LAURA: This whisper brought to you by... 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: (sings) (exaggerated whispering) 
ROBBIE: This is normally when he would read the thing, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Hmm. 
LAURA: What? 
SAM: As he's talking, I can't help but swing my eyes down to his fingers, which are adorned with quite some-- Sir, I couldn't help but notice your bling. 
MATT: "Ah. Simple family collectibles, memories." 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: "My father--" 
SAM: Family is very important. 
MATT: "Yes." 
SAM: I can appreciate fine jewels, and those seem like they're quite nice. We have a friend who comes from nobility. I'm his squire, and he's taught me a bit about gems. It feels like you have some, maybe? It feels like you have some, maybe? I don't want to pry, but they're very beautiful. Could I just see them, just to see? 
TRAVIS: As Braius is talking, I walk up to the desk and I start stacking platinum like a poker player-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: -- in these nice, fatty-ass stacks. Licking my thumb, starting a new one. (laughter) 
MATT: "I appreciate your eye for quality, but these are extremely important to me. Such gems are not openly traded and rare to-- (gawks)" 
TRAVIS: (ruffles stack of coins) 
LIAM: These are very pressing times. 
TRAVIS: (continues ruffling coins) 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Believe it or not-- 
TRAVIS: I take the bag out. (hefty plop) 
LIAM: -- we're heading into the thick of it, so we would really-- 
LAURA: ♪ Into the thick of it ♪ 
LIAM: -- all respect, like to know what it would take to make that sort of a transaction worth the loss. 
MATT: "Close the door." 
LAURA: (closes door) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Prestidigitation. (laughter) 
MATT: He turns the flicker on the lantern low and pulls open this curtain in the back and there's a bunch of weird forgery machinery back there. (laughs) 
SAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: Wow! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
LAURA: He's questionable. That's why he didn't want-- 
ASHLEY: Amazing! 
MARISHA: I love him! 
TRAVIS: Love it. 
MATT: He's like, "All right. If you're paying well and depending on what you're looking for, you need some gems crushed down, right? What was it you're looking for? Tell me what it is you're looking for." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Diamond dust. 
MATT: Diamond dust. All right. 
TRAVIS: (continues laughing) 
MATT: Reaches. "No peeking!" Closes the curtain in front between the two of you, and you hear some rummaging around. 
TRAVIS: None of that diluted shit! 
MATT: You catch the back of his butt, rummaging through something, comes back. 
TRAVIS: I don't want to see any zirconia in there. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: He's like, "All right. How many diamonds? How much gold do you need?" 
TALIESIN: A bit more than one. 
SAM: It's 300 a pop. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: So 900 would be great? 
LAURA: 900. Here's 10 platinum. That much. 900 gold worth-- 
TRAVIS: But these are trying times, so your purest stuff. 12 platinum. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "Oh, I only have the purest stuff." Make a perception check-- 
LAURA: We're not going to be snorting it! (laughter) 
MATT: -- with advantage. 
SAM: Now I might! (laughter) 
LIAM: As a side note, with a 28 perception, do I see anything else of value through the cracks in that beaded curtain? 
MATT: Hold on a second. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: 30. 
MATT: 30. 
SAM: Oh jeez! 
MATT: Yeah. He goes, "Hmm." You see there's this, one of the various mechanisms looks like this massive metal geared grinding mechanism. He goes and (adding elements) takes off a ring, pries a diamond out of it, throws it in there. (tink) 
TRAVIS: Attaboy! Takes off his pinky ring, pries three diamonds out of it. 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MATT: (diamonds tinking) 
LIAM: Papaw, no! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Steps on something and is like, (grinding). 
SAM: So generous of you to give up family heirlooms for us. (laughter) 
MATT: "Like you said, trying times!" (laughter) 
MATT: "Always good to make new friends!" (laughter) 
MATT: (grinding) As he's doing this, you're looking around in there, you see there's a drafting table with all manner of collection of different types of vellum parchment. It looks like there are examples of signatures and handwriting written from places there. You also see a brewing apparatus, some sort of an alchemical apparatus with a number of a brewing supplies. Make a medicine check for me. 
LIAM: Medicine check. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Wow! Is this guy just making IPA back here? 
SAM: Or meth. 
LIAM: Yep. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LIAM: That is a 19. 
MATT: 19. 
LIAM: Rolled high. 
MATT: You recognize around this device, there's a whole number of dried herbs and plants, and it looks like this could be a station for the crafting of potions, various vials of medicinal or more type chemicals, liquids. Some of them you're like: Oh, that is meant for, you know, helping cure a stomach, and some that you know are just for color. You get the quick glance of, this could be used to make legitimate potions and liquids, but it also could be used to create ones that look like them. 
LAURA: Mm. 
SAM: Ah. 
LIAM: Ah. 
ASHLEY: Sneaky, sneaky! 
LIAM: I like this guy. (laughter) 
MATT: (grinding) 
MATT: "Almost." (grinding) 
SAM: While you're grinding-- 
LAURA: Dusty. 
SAM: This is a much easier request to fulfill, but do you have any art supplies? Canvas, some wood to make the frames, some paint, any of that stuff? 
MATT: "Oh, I've got you, big friend. Don't you worry about it For a price." 
SAM: Of course, of course, of course. I don't have any money. 
LAURA: We've got some money. Don't worry. Chet's got you covered. 
MATT: Finishes grinding, goes ahead and counts it out. "That is about the amount of diamond dust that was requested," and he puts it all in a singular pouch and zips it closed, sets it over. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
SAM: Open it up and make sure. 
MATT: Scoops the platinum off the counter. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Does it look like the right amount? 
LAURA: Any of us have the ability-- 
MARISHA: Do a little-- (tastes dust) 
LAURA: What, is it going to kill me? 
TRAVIS: Feel a little number. 
TALIESIN: You'll immediately start bleeding from your gums. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's the worst idea ever. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Got to make sure what it is! 
TALIESIN: Oh god! 
SAM: Try it. 
LAURA: Don't do it, Chet! 
ROBBIE: That's the good stuff. (laughter) 
LAURA: Just gushing blood. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah? 
TRAVIS: That's pure shit. (laughter) 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS: I'm on the alpine freeway, baby. (laughter) 
LAURA: 12 platinum. 
SAM: Does it seem like enough for a couple of uses of Revivify? 
MATT: Yeah, it would be about 900 gold worth-- 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: -- of diamond dust that you paid a little more for. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Just three doses? 
SAM and LAURA: Three doses. 
MATT: The last thing you see while you're looking in this chamber, beyond all the stuff, is what looks like a collection of books, but they're all educational. They all seem to be based around the teaching and learning of Common as well as basic arithmetic. 
LAURA: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
TRAVIS: Do you have kids? 
LAURA: What's that about? 
LIAM: Self-starter? 
MATT: "Me? No, no. Never quite a fatherly type. Just seemed to not be in my future, you understand." 
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: What are the books for, then? 
MATT: "I did a bit of tutoring years ago, but it's been some time. So if any of you have any kids that need tutoring, please let me know. I'm looking for an expansion on the business." 
LAURA: Insight check. 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
ASHLEY: What is that about? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah! (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
SAM: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
SAM: Guys-- 
ASHLEY: Whisper! 
ROBBIE: Do it, do it, do it! 
SAM: You can go buy this right now at our store. 
MARISHA: It's true. 
SAM: You can see through it right here. 
MARISHA: See through it there. 
SAM: You can see Marisha's skin. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's cool. 
MARISHA: That's my body. 
ASHLEY: The little spots? 
MARISHA: Yeah, little cutouts. 
ASHLEY: I didn't know those were open. That's cool. 
TRAVIS: Where's your body? 
LAURA: Don't do it, baby. 
MARISHA: Ah! 
ASHLEY, ROBBIE, and LAURA: (laugh) 
MATT: "So yes, your supplies," and he goes and gathers up a number of easel supplies. a number of easel supplies. There's some soft paints and brushes he throws into a package. 
SAM: Oh, thank you. 
MATT: He goes and takes one portrait off the wall and looks at it and goes (tearing) and rips it off of the canvas. (laughter) 
MATT: Gives you the frame. 
LIAM: Family portrait. 
MATT: Right. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Everything must go. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Is this his shop? (laughter) 
ROBBIE: It might not be. It might not be. 
TALIESIN: It would be amazing if the real owner is tied up-- 
TRAVIS: There's shoes underneath the counter. 
ROBBIE: The owner enlisted weeks ago. 
MARISHA: Yes! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Fucking squatter's rights at this point. 
TRAVIS: I hate to see you go, but-- (laughter) 
MATT: "Well, thank you for your time. Anything else you need? Any..." 
TRAVIS: We've just got so much money, and nothing to spend it on. Anything else rare that you've been holding onto for a rainy day? You never know, might not have an opportunity to sell it soon. 
MATT: "Well--" 
LIAM: The city's emptying out. 
MATT: "I'm almost free of some of my other wares." Reaches down below and pulls out a small wooden box and opens it up. "Have any of you tried Marquesian fusaka?" (laughter) 
LIAM: What's that? 
MATT: "Some refer to it as spice." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: You've never-- 
ROBBIE: Now I'm sad I left. 
TRAVIS: You've never dabbled? 
LIAM: I assume you have, Pop. 
TRAVIS: You've never dabbled? Please, I gave it the name. You've never spiced? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: I've never spiced. 
TRAVIS: Imogen, you spice? 
LAURA: I don't spice, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Braius? 
SAM: I would be down. 
MARISHA: (laughs) (laughter) 
LIAM: Is it a mellow thing, or-- 
ASHLEY: Get some spice! 
TRAVIS: How much for one of your little baggies? 
MATT: "Oh, well, I mean, this is the standard last batch I've acquired. It was imported from far off, far long ago." 
TRAVIS: Where? From where? 
MATT: "The soldiers have come through." 
TRAVIS: I like to know where my stuff comes from. 
MATT: "This was crafted in the finest of alchemical backstreets of Ank'Harel." 
SAM: The finest backstreets. 
TRAVIS: Marquesian spice! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You got to stay away from that Issylrian spice. Marquesian shit is rich. 
MATT: "I'll let you this-- We'll say a half box for 200, full box for 350." 
LAURA: I'm going to open my mind. I want to find out if he's fucking lying. 
MATT: You get the sense he's eager to make a sale. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Mm. Got stuff to sell. 
MATT: He sees customers with money, and he is eager to sell, and you get the other sense that maybe because of the chaos as of late, he seems like he hasn't-- He seems a little more desperate than you would think, given a store that's sold out. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You know, Imogen, sometimes under stress, random things can bond people. I think this will probably come in handy. I just have a hunch. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Sure, 200. 
MATT: "For the half batch?" 
TRAVIS: For the half batch. 
MATT: "Certainly!" 
ASHLEY: Half batch. (laughs) 
MATT: He goes and takes and opens up a little thick piece of cloth and dabbles out the box-- 
MARISHA: What happens if you sprinkle some of that-- 
MATT: -- shaking it a little bit, measuring out the weight. 
MARISHA: -- into the funnel? 
MATT: Indiana Joneses it for a second. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Goes and puts it up. "Now, don't let that be seen by any of the Bastions. It's going to get a little--" 
TRAVIS: Of course! 
MATT: "-- a little weird and sticky after that." 
TRAVIS: We just found this in the street. 
MATT: "Mm-hmm." 
TRAVIS: Here you go, 200. 
MATT: "Oh, thank you kindly. Sure you don't want the other half?" 
SAM: How do you do-- Is it a snort? Is it an eat? 
TRAVIS: I mean, it depends. 
LAURA: First you rip your gums up with little shards of glass. (laughter) 
LIAM: Right. (laughter) 
LAURA: Then you just-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: If you're a savage. There are more refined ways. I'll teach you. 
SAM: All right. 
LIAM: That'd be good in a brownie. 
TRAVIS: It loses a little potency in the heat. (laughter) 
MATT: Closes up his box. 
LAURA: Do we have everything we need? 
MATT: Sets it down below. 
LAURA: Should we head to the titan? 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: All right, let's go. 
LIAM: Let's go find our friends. 
MATT: "You are ever welcome!" 
LAURA: Thanks, Cidrick. 
SAM: Thank you, Cidrick. 
MATT: "Of course. Guildsman's honor. Anytime." 
LAURA: Killsman's? 
TRAVIS: Killsman's honor? Oh, the door shut. 
LIAM: Is there a sign above the shop? 
ASHLEY: Killsman sign? 
MATT: Yeah, Cidrick was the name that was-- 
LIAM: It does say it, okay. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: But he also just said, "I'm Cidrick," and then said nothing else, which I could do! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That dude is totally dead. He's totally dead. 
MARISHA: Cidrick is dead. 
TALIESIN: Have you been Cidrick this whole time? 
MARISHA: What is Cidrick's last name? 
ROBBIE: Well his store is like-- 
MARISHA: We don't know. 
ROBBIE: -- a vanity plate. 
MARISHA: Neither does he! 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Oh, you're Jeremy, for sure. 
TRAVIS: We interrupted a 187 for sure. (laughter) 
MARISHA: 100%! 
TRAVIS: There's a little drip, drip, drip right before the door closed. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Smell of iron in the air. 
LIAM: Above the table, my family and I once went to a mini golf course in upstate New York and we were like, man, this-- That we'd been to over the years, and we were like, this place is really run down. They really let this place go. We got home and told the fam, and they were like, that place has been shut down for five years. 
TRAVIS: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: What? 
LIAM: Did you give some teenagers your money? Yes, we did! (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Amazing! We got customers today! 
ROBBIE: Good investment. A couple of putters-- 
MATT: Yeah, I love that. 
ROBBIE: That's perfect. 
SAM: Large Marge has been dead for years! (laughter) 
MATT: So, Dorian-- 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MATT: -- as you've trekked from the troop, and you head down to the base of the Heaven's Stair Mountain and the larger portion of the Silver Talon's Reach where, I won't say a vast majority, but the largest density of soldiers, warriors, archers, all manner of warfare-fated figures are gathering, have gathered, are either resting or preparing for what's to come. What is it you'd like to do? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, I mean, when he was up higher, looking down at the layout of all the soldiers and tents and everyone preparing as you've described it, having flashbacks to his childhood when his dad used to run strategy, simulated. It was just something he loved. He hated it so much, but as he observed it and walked through it, he was enamored with the human element of it, and his curiosity got the better of him. Just watching these people come together, and the different ways, the sadness, the camaraderie, the hope of soldiers heading off to battle. He starts milling through these encampments, and, I don't know, he's just inspired by the feel of it, the very human element of it. He's going to use his background feature for the first time ever, By Popular Demand, and he's going to start to dip in and out and he's going to start to dip in and out and fade in and out of the most raucous encampments, and then the most mellow ones, and start to play a song for each of them as he goes and listen to the stories as they go, and weave his way through the encampments like a minstrel, feeling maybe like a bard for real for the first time ever. Like any good minstrel, he's got a few sets of chord progressions that are meant to go along with lyrics that he makes up on the spot. As he starts to sing these songs, he starts to sing them about his friends, about Bells Hells, and he starts to weave the lore of what he knows about them amongst the encampments and tell their stories, singling out each of his friends as he goes to a different spot, and as he does so, he finds his groove and does this for as long as he can, as long as we have time, while everyone else is doing their thing. This feature only does one thing, and it's curry favor for himself. But if possible, you know, if you'd allow it, I'd like to maybe see if that performance can curry favor for his friends, too. So at the end of this feature, it says, "If you've played for long enough, strangers recognize you in town that you perform, and they typically take a liking to you." 
LAURA: Ah. 
ROBBIE: I was hoping that maybe we could spread the good word of Bells Hells to the people that are about to go to fight. 
MARISHA: That's amazing. That's so good. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: That's awesome. 
MATT: That's wonderful. 
ROBBIE: That's the only purpose he had. 
MATT: Yeah. As the soldiers take note, at first just cocking an ear or following with a glance, you can't help but also hear the autonomic humming that seems to follow, the jovial step to those who are carrying supplies the jovial step to those who are carrying supplies from one space to another. It's wild, the solemn energy that has definitely clutched this region seems to noticeably shift in your presence. On these faces, nearly children, people in their late teens, early 20s, brought in to wield a sword and face their possible mortality for the betterment of their nation, of their god, of the people they wish to protect, to the oldest veteran soldier, the scars and deep-set wrinkles on their face revealing at a glance the lifetime of hardship and choices and vigorous honor and vigorous honor that binds them to the war once more. With each face that meets yours, you can see that comfort melt a part of them away. Moreso than playing for money in a tavern or playing to distract while a friend of yours tries to pick a pocket, here, moreso than any other time in your life, the power of music, the ability to grab the soul of anyone nearby and guiding them to a better memory is very powerful, and in times like this, extremely necessary. As you finish your final strum and walk beyond the density of the various war camps, you stop and look behind you, and you can see dozens of faces stopped in whatever business they were doing, just watching you step away. In a scattered pattern, they nod, smile, and begin to go about their business once more. 
ROBBIE: Cool. 
MARISHA: That's great. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MATT: While the three of you step more towards the center of the city of Vasselheim, the looming, shadowed specter of an ancient historical conflict casting darkness across whole swaths of neighborhood. There stands the Primordial Earth Titan that was stopped within its tracks and the necromantic powers that puppeted it by a self-made evil god but a few decades back. Strangely lively midday, as you can see the various carved, porthole-like windows amongst various parts of its body. You can see the bits of flowerbed-like structures that adorn the edges of its openings. You can see staircases that have been carved out of different parts of its body that emerge partway up the leg and then return back into a shadowed interior. This interesting, odd little place here in the middle of the city, ominous at a distance, feels like repurposed dark memory feels like repurposed dark memory given a new life through color and home. But as you approach, there's still something inside you, Ashton, something in the pit of your stomach that feels connected. Something that feels (sighs) ominous. That's where we're going to take our break. (oohing) 
ROBBIE: That was out of nowhere! 
LAURA: Ooh! 
ROBBIE: Woo hoo hoo! 
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up from this venture up into the shell of the Earth Titan. So yeah, see you guys back here in a few minutes. (cheering) 

Break[]
(epic music) (mysterious music) 
The future is frightening. It's a future which hasn't yet been written. Vox Machina, your world will be destroyed. This can't be happening. If we want to save it, we have to go to... Hell. Buckle the fuck up. Road trip! We shouldn't be here. Won't be needing jackets. To pull this off we're gonna need all kinds of miracles. What is that thing? Hold him off as long as you can! Vox Machina shall burn! That's a big problem! And I'm an even bigger one! -Ready? -No, but do it anyway! I'm ready to die for the people I love. We have to believe it's going to be all right. And if it isn't... No! ...then nothing matters. Vox Machina, you are now bound for eternity. They got some plush chairs in this bitch. It's okay to be scared. We can face anything if we're together. Oy! You think you can catch us, dingle dick? Maybe don't mock the murder man? 
(cheerful holiday music) (static crackling) 
NARRATOR M: Hi. Do you have a moment to talk about the cosmos? NARRATOR S: Specifically, the cosmos of Midst? NARRATOR X: What's that, you ask? Excellent question. M: The Midst cosmos is a vast realm with glittering skies above and spooky fathoms below. Full of strange worlds and surreal potential. X: What's out there? M: What does it all mean? S: Answers to these questions have always been just out of reach. X: Until now. M: A supernatural ship and its remarkable crew. S: Capable of traversing the highest heights, the deepest depths, the beginning and end of the cosmos. M: We'll venture to fantastic worlds and hidden wonders within the far reaches of the known universe. X: Confronting transformative realizations at the very edges of reality, and maybe even within their very selves. S: And we'll be there, too, narrating and stuff. M: We're the narrators. It's what we do. X: Will you join us? No prior Midst experience required. S: We've got you. M: Embrace the journey. X: We'll be with you to the UNEND. ♪ (mysterious music) ♪ X: New episodes will air weekly on Wednesdays. And as a member, you'll receive UNEND two weeks early and ad free. (festival music) 
ROBBIE: I can't wait until it's Campaign 18, 2065, and Matt shows up, he's like, "It's me, Pumat Sol." (laughing) 
ASHLEY: Pumat Sol. 
ROBBIE: Remember me, kids? 
ASHLEY: (laughing) 
ROBBIE: It's gonna be the best. 
MATT: It's gonna be so cool. It's gonna be a lot easier to do too when it's just my head in a jar. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
LIAM: Happy Halloweenies though, everybody. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: I'm foaming at the mouth of the thought of the Mothman. 
MATT: That was a sentence. 
ASHLEY: Give me the smut, Dani. 
ROBBIE: Joy has been sucked out of Liam's life. 
MATT: I don't know, you should come up on the weekend and meet the rest of my polycule. 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Check it out, look, it has pockets. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself. Ooo so moody. (gasp) Could anything be more perfect? I mean the Traveler always says, impulse purchases are a good decision. Oooh, so comfy cozy. Roll an investigation if you want. It's basically perfect. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now.
(mysterious music) (ominous music) 
KLAUS: In play, it felt so good. MOHAMAD: Everybody's engaged at the same time. ALISON: The Hope and the Fear mechanics are a wild, role-playing ride. MATT: The game is called Daggerheart, our own fantasy tabletop RPG we've been developing. It's a unique 2d12 dice rolling system that ensures that every roll of the game has some sort of impact on the game itself. DANI: It really fosters that collaborative role-play aspect. DARIUSH: Character building lets you do your own thing and organically be like, "I'll take a little of this, a little of that." CAI: You can be an unlikely combination of things. The Hope and Fear mechanics to me really feel more like the score of a good film. NATE: Mounting fear, just added a different layer of tension to the game. HANNA: The tactileness is really exciting for me. I just feel very represented in this game. EVAN: I would absolutely play again. TRAVIS: Daggerheart is fun as hell to play. RICH: I absolutely love Daggerheart. MATT: It's going to be something real special and it's just the beginning. (ominous music) (epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music) 
LAURA: (VO) Do you find yourself dealing with low energy, drowsiness, or boredom? 
MARISHA: You may have made a pact with an infernal demon, or you may be suffering from Low CR. 
LAURA: (VO) Low CR is a common condition that affects between most and nearly all adult humans. Low CR, or Low Critical Role, occurs when human people don't have enough nerdy voice actors in their lives. But now, there's a cure! 
MARISHA: I don't let Low CR control my life anymore. 
LAURA: (VO) Beacon is a non-invasive subscription that provides 24 hours exclusive content each day. 
MARISHA: This was when we decided it should look like a gender reveal party. 
LAURA: (VO) Early access to event tickets, members-only Discord, 10% off merchandise, and more. Do not take Beacon if you are allergic to Beacon. Consult your familiar if you think Beacon could work for you. 
MARISHA: Side effects may include excessive enjoyment, overexcitement, and diarrhea. 
LAURA: (VO) Critical Role is in no way a treatment, medication, or anything other than a bunch of nerdy voice actors. Do not watch Critical Role unless you enjoy it. [smoke alarm beeping] 
LAURA: (VO) We repeat. We are absolutely not any sort of help... anything. To learn more, visit beacon.tv, or find it on your App Store. 
MARISHA: Tomorrow feels a little brighter now that I have Beacon. (loud crunching) 

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So here, within the-- Sam, put that away. (laughter) 
MATT: Here within the central region, not far from the Quadroads of Vasselheim, the trio of Fearne, Laudna, and Ashton step closer on approach to the massive long-dead titan that looms over the central part of the city. Ashton, as you sense that subtle reverberation of proximity to this awe-inspiring shell of a creature to this awe-inspiring shell of a creature with a connection to that shard that sits within you. You all begin to cluster towards the base of its nearest leg. This massive mountain-like column of rough stone and rock, where you can see a staircase has since been carved into the base of the ankle, and a couple of neighborhood kids sit around like stoop kids, hanging around in the snow, chatting with each other, and eating snacks and jerky on the side, and as soon as you all begin to step up, they glare at you. You see this-- 
MARISHA: And jerky. And jerky. 
LAURA: Did he say "jerking"? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) it's... and jerky. 
SAM and MARISHA: And jerky. 
ROBBIE: And jerky. 
LAURA: I swear I thought I heard something else. 
MARISHA: As soon as he said it, I looked directly at you. 
TRAVIS: Where are your minds? 
MARISHA: I knew. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: It's what it sounded like. 
TRAVIS: Seriously, how is he supposed to do anything? 
MARISHA: It is just a little-- 
MATT: I give up. 
LIAM: What you doing on the stairs there, kids? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, just jerking on the side. (laughter) 
LAURA: Just jerking on the side. 
MATT: We've all been there. 
MARISHA: ♪ Jacking it, jacking it, jacking it, jacking it ♪ 
ROBBIE: This cookie's ookie. 
MATT: But as you all begin to step up, you see this one-- 
MARISHA: Well, I have a question. 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: What is the-- 
TRAVIS: You didn't want that. 
MARISHA: Is this-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: -- before you get into your spiel, I'm trying to save it. 
MATT: No, go for it, go for it. 
TRAVIS: Did I tell you about the time? (laughter) 
MATT: What you got? 
MARISHA: So, is this mainly being used for residential, or is it a lot of stuff? 
MATT: You're uncertain. The closest you've been is where you stand now, and this incredible wide leg, which is city blocks in width. From where you're approaching it, you can see there is a staircase entryway. Its base has been carved and then vanishes up into the interior. You can see there's a couple hooks and lanterns that hang from them that aren't lit at the moment, and there's some discarded refuse and a bit of muck and snow mud that's built around the base of it, and then there's six of these kids sitting on the front stairs and off to the side, talking, and as soon as you begin to get close to your approach, they get quiet and stare at the rest of you. 
MARISHA: (snaps) Hey. 
MATT: One of them is a young half-elven kid, maybe no more than 13, scraggly black hair that covers most of his face. "Yeah." 
MARISHA: Is there a lift or something? Is there a quicker way to get up to the top of this thing, or do we have to climb all these damn stairs? 
MATT: They look at each other. "Yeah, you got to go around." 
MARISHA: Go around where? 
MATT: "Around." 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Around the-- 
MATT: "No, this is how you get in here though." 
TALIESIN: Where does this here go? 
MATT: "Inside." 
TALIESIN: Does it go all the way to the top? 
MATT: "If you keep climbing." 
TALIESIN: All right, and if you're right. 
ASHLEY: Where's the tavern? In the asshole? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: They chuckle to themselves, they're like, "Sure, yeah, nah. The Shank's Cantina. It's right in the asshole." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Insight check. (laughter) 
MATT: Make an insight check. (laughter) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The Shank Cantina? 
LIAM: (sighs) 
ROBBIE: Tricked. 
TALIESIN: I like the mild shame that you had even saying that. 
ASHLEY: Where is my insight? 24. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
SAM: Oh. Oh! 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
SAM: There's a whisper about the asshole. 
MARISHA: Got a whisper over at Shank's Cantina. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: You can't just tell us? 
SAM: Guys. 
ROBBIE: The old whispering asshole. 
SAM: Guys. 
MARISHA: Yeah, the whispering asshole. 
SAM: Daggerheart pre-orders are live. 
ROBBIE: Wow! 
MARISHA: They are so live. 
SAM: You should-- 
MARISHA: They were live, they've been live a few weeks ago. 
SAM: I know that. 
TRAVIS: So come see the live show in New Jersey. 
MARISHA: Come see the live show. 
SAM: Oh, yes, or Philadelphia. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: Live show. Get tickets. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, you're too drunk to drink. Too young to drink. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Anyway. 
MATT: "But I don't know who's more drunk at this moment," and they all laugh a little bit. 
ASHLEY: (fake laughs) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Move the fuck out of the way please. 
MATT: "Oh, no, you got to pay the toll." 
MARISHA: No. 
ASHLEY: Get out of here. 
MARISHA: Get the fuck out of here. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I don't have time. 
MATT: "I don't make the rules here. Look, if you want to get inside, five copper." 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MARISHA: I change my form. 
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. You're going that way. I was going to join you. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Just straight to violence. 
MARISHA: I get down in their faces and then I make my skin peel. It's basically "Beetlejuice," make my flesh peel back, and I go-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: Move! 
MATT: They scatter, screaming. "(screams)" Just running to all different directions. 
ASHLEY: There we go. 
MATT: There's-- 
TALIESIN: Wait. No, come back. 
MATT: One guy carrying two bags of groceries behind, and goes, "What's the-- (screams)" and he drops his groceries and runs off, too, and this whole area immediately is bereft of locals. 
MARISHA: Great. Good. Let's go. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Okay. You do see based around the base of the entryway, not directly on the foot, but a little ways off, there is a wooden arch that reads a sentence. It says Titan's Block. It looks like it's been hand-carved. It's not an official place or somebody placed it there. It looks like some care went into it. But unlit lanterns in the staircase that ascends within. 
ASHLEY: All right. Shall we? 
TALIESIN: Let's head up. See what we find. 
MATT: All right. You step into the shaded interior and ascend. 50 stairs, 100 stairs. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: 150 stairs, and about then, you can smell the scent of alcohol from the older gentleman who's sitting halfway in this staircase that's winding and then winds back, and he's leaning against the wall with a dark brown jug, and as you then approach, he rouses a bit. "(groans)" Then goes right back to sleep on the side. 
TALIESIN: Attack and kill him immediately. (laughter) 
MATT: Now, we're playing D&D! 
TALIESIN: There's tradition. We are here. We're here. There's tradition. You got to murder the first person that we see. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's true! (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yeah. We got to kill one NPC without speaking to them, every time. 
TRAVIS: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Anyway, yeah. 
MATT: You clamber past and you have a few thoughts. If people do live here, they probably have incredible legs. 
TALIESIN: So many gains. 
MATT: Yeah, that's it. But about 200 or so stairs up, the staircase opens up into a bulb-like chamber, this rounded chamber that has a number of small shacks built into it, and the smell in here is musty. It smells a combination of old mildewed leather and wood that's been wet and rotted, beginning to rot a little bit, but you see a little bit of a little shanty neighborhood that's built into this interior. You can see there are a few folks just going about their business, gathering things. There's a woman. Little older woman in her 50s or 60s, bit more the age, and she's in the process of knitting some sort of a... looks almost like a scarf, or it could be a small shirt, but just people living their lives here. It looks like at least this portion of what you've seen so far has been taken for some of the folks who needed a place to live here in the city and others maybe would be less interested in, you know, building a life on the inside of something that tried to kill and destroy the city long ago. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: But to the edge of this bulb chamber, you can see there are some rock platforms that rise and carve upward and continue deeper up into the inside of the beast. 
TALIESIN: All right, do we keep going? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's keep going. 
MARISHA: We're on a bit of a time crunch. 
TALIESIN: Let's keep going. 
MATT: Okay. Continuing upward, you wind through other neighborhoods that are built into the sides. You can see there are little tiny tunnels that carve off, and to you, parts of it are almost comforting, because it reminds you of some of the interior spire Jrusar neighborhoods, where you've lived in recent years. There are elements where not quite as much of the scaffolding and interior platform structure of the neighborhoods where you and the remnants of the Nobodies, Milo and such lived, but it's a familiar vibe of where some of the, not folks that are forced out by society, but folks that choose to not necessarily live out in the pious daylight as strongly as others have instead chosen to hole up and not be bothered. Trekking and snaking through as you climb, it continues still into other chambers that spread off, and you can see there are small makeshift wooden signs that set to different locations. There's the column of stairs head off this direction. There's the Hollow Haven, which heads off to the left-hand direction. Indeed, there is a Shank's Cantina. (laughs) 
MARISHA: We got to stop by Shank's. 
TRAVIS: How would you spell Shank's Cantina? 
MATT: S-H-A-N-K apostrophe S. 
MARISHA: We got to stop by Shank's. 
ASHLEY: For sure, for sure. 
TALIESIN: On the way. 
ASHLEY: I wonder if we should tell everybody that's where we should meet. Maybe when we're done. Well-- 
MARISHA: You said on the way back. Go all the way up. Pop in on the way down. All right. 
TALIESIN: That's what I thought. 
MATT: Okay. Continue to climb it. It takes a little bit to figure out where to go, because a lot of them lead into alleyway dead ends, and you see there's maybe a couple of moments where as you wander into some of these dark nooks and crannies that there's two or three, whether ne'er-do-well, or at least figures that are sizing you up for a quick mark immediately avert their gaze and go back to their business. You carry an air about you to not necessarily be fucked with, whether or not they really understand the extent of your position within the city at the moment. 
TRAVIS: They'll learn. 
MATT: But as you ascend, Ashton, you can't help, and a little bit to you, Fearne, as well. Just being here, you can sense, even within the cavities of this long-dead titan, there is... an odd familiarity, like the most distant childhood memory you can't place. There's something about being here that part of you is obtusely connected to. But for you, Ashton, it's like a slowly bubbling anxiety. There's something in your stomach that continues to turn. Not to a point of nausea, but just... a dark curiosity. You begin to emerge from some of the most interior neighborhoods and find a handful of those exterior holes that you saw before from the outside. You get glimmers of daylight, and there are windows carved into some of the furthest edges of the inside of what you imagine at this height would be the titan's torso region, and it is a maze-like series of caverns that wind through here. You don't know what you envisioned it would be. Would it be one massive interior chamber? But it is a sprawling web network of caverns that have been, maybe some have been widened, you're uncertain, but they've all been retrofitted to be small little neighborhoods, one building wide, built into and constructed with makeshift materials carved out of the earth and stone itself. 
ASHLEY: This is so cool. 
MARISHA: It's cool. 
MATT: Here along these windows where you see, there are clusters of gathered flower boxes, there are clusters of gathered flower boxes, where a number of families and children, groups of young girls that are over there and tending to these flowers that have all been placed around the few areas where the sunlight does come through into the inside of the titan. It was this spread of color that... it's not... you thought they were just boxes to contain them, but as you step by, you can see it's more of a decoration. The flowers are planted directly into the titan's body itself and have taken root, and you're not sure how long it's been, but it's spread quite a bit. What little bit of sunlight comes in here, it seems like the actual titan's body itself seems to be mineral-rich enough to sustain whatever is planted within. 
ASHLEY: That's so cool. 
TALIESIN: It's like a coral reef. I like it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. This is very cool. How you feeling? 
TALIESIN: There's an echo, I guess. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It's like you don't hear the first voice. It's just the second or the third in the background. How about you? 
ASHLEY: It feels familiar. I don't really know why, but it feels kind of nice to me. 
TALIESIN: I have a thought, once we find somewhere. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Once we find the right place. 
ASHLEY: You feeling anything? 
MARISHA: I was wondering if I would get any type of residual necromantic energy, since I know what this was used for, so, because we're all looking for forms of answers. 
MATT: Make an arcana check. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. This is why I was glad you came out. 
ROBBIE: Do it. 
MARISHA: Nervous. Don't fuck this up. Yeah, it's not great. It's not the best. Could have been better. 15. 
MATT: 15's not terrible. 
MARISHA: It's okay. 
MATT: I mean, you definitely don't pick up any residual necromantic energy just lying around, but you do begin to pick up at a number of the entryways, and pathways, and the different forking points and crossroads throughout these winding staircases, platforms, and central tunnel walkways, there are glyphs pressed into the stone, like brands, but instead burned or chiseled into the rock itself. 
MARISHA: Eyes of the Rune Keeper. 
MATT: They are abjuration wards specifically to dispel and keep at bay any sort of necromantic magic that might still remain within. So, whatever teams went through here when the titan was left-- 
MARISHA: Interesting. 
MATT: -- empty and no longer under the influence of that historical assault to the Whispered One, since the interior of this structure has been more or less cleansed and locked to remain cleansed. 
MARISHA: Just run my fingers over the runes as we keep walking. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. As you dart past that one opening window that's closest to the path you're taking, you can see the flower beds. You can also see small little gardens that have been placed. There's little sections here where a semblance of vegetation can take root. You continue up and follow these winding paths, and you begin to see structures. Older structures. Things that existed here that weren't built by the people of Vasselheim. Ancient glimmers of cracked homesteads and half-swallowed towers that emerge from parts of the rock and stones, sometimes at odd angles. It's like you're seeing fractions of an ancient dungeon left exposed, and some of it now is the home to a small family that is in the process of making it comfortable as they can. You climb ever still, and that sinking feeling in your stomach gets thicker and denser. You would feel lost in wandering here, but you find that the wandering path that you take has more been instinctually led by you, Ashton. Eventually, you feel like you know where you're going, but you're not sure where. You quicken your pace subconsciously, and then at one point, you pass beyond this one half-broken missing keystone archway up past a section of ruin into a chamber that opens up. The first chamber that feels like a proper interior chasm. Maybe 80 to 100 feet tall, maybe 300 feet from side to side. It is this open expanse where bits of crystal remain broken, seemingly mined and chipped away until there's the broken exterior of clusters of geodes, now robbed of their most precious minerals and materials. There are a number of small huts and tents set around, and as you all enter the chamber, the air itself in here, it's still cool. You can see folks skittering off into their various tents to avoid the presence of these three strangers. But as you step into this room, that pit in your stomach, it feels like it's going to drag you down. Like something is pulling you towards the center of this chamber. 
MARISHA: Do we see any geodes or crystals still left, even if they're up really high? 
MATT: You glance around and you see there are maybe a couple high, high, high up in the ceiling that haven't been touched. Most of the ones that are accessible by ground level have been mostly broken and mined. 
MARISHA: Cast Spider Climb and go up. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
MATT: (skittering) You skitter up the wall. As you do, a few other folks who are watching (gasps) and pull back into their full tents and close the flaps. 
ROBBIE: (chuckles) 
MATT: You (skittering) up the side. 
MARISHA: Ashton? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Fearne? 
ASHLEY: Yeah? 
MARISHA: Catch. I take out my little rock chisel and (tapping) break some away. 
MATT: Okay. It takes you a minute. I'd say make a strength or dexterity check. Your choice. One is about brute forcing it, The other is finding the places within the geode where it's most fragile. 
MARISHA: It'll be dex. It'll be dex. Jeez Louise! 10. 
MATT: 10. It takes a good chunk of time, a solid 20 or so minutes for Laudna to try and chisel away a chunk of this that doesn't just break and shatter into crumbled bits of crystal. 
TALIESIN: While she's doing that, I'm going to find the spot that feels central and I'm going to start building a small fire. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: In the hopes that maybe I can take you along with me on whatever this is. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Whereabouts, do we feel like we're in the head or are we in the chest cavity? 
TALIESIN: Or is it heart? 
MATT: Make a wisdom check. 
MARISHA: Fucking, fucking give me one. 
MATT: Specifically a survival, actually. 
MARISHA: Survival? 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
ASHLEY: May I assist? 
LIAM: Turn to the left and cough. 
TRAVIS: Be a dungeoneering man. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Can she assist? 
ASHLEY: Can I assist? 
MATT: Sure! 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm looking, too. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take that. 19 for a 21. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: 21. You're not in the head, but you're certainly somewhere near the core of its chest, likely. 
ASHLEY: Do we stay here, by the heart, or do you want to go up closer to the brain? by the heart, or do you want to go up closer to the brain? 
TALIESIN: I feel like I live more in the heart. 
ASHLEY: Fair. 
TALIESIN: Wow! 
ASHLEY: I'm all brain. I'm all brains of this operation. (laughter) All right, well I can help you build a fire if that's what you want to do. 
TALIESIN: I think we build a fire. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: (fire erupting) Ignites in the center there. 
TALIESIN: Sit down by it, and join? 
ASHLEY: Sure. Sit down 
MATT: Tink. Tink, tink. Tink, tink. Upstairs still. 
MARISHA: Take a few chunks. Put it in pockets as I go. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I'll try to catch whatever's falling. 
MATT: There are a number of chunks that fall. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll just open my skirt. Hold my skirt. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: Perfect. 
ASHLEY: My pouch. My marsupial pouch. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: You feel anything? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I don't know what. I'm trying to be cautious. A sense of history can be dangerous, a dangerous temptation for people like me. 
ASHLEY: Why don't you stick your hand in it? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: In the fire? 
ASHLEY: No, I mean, just get in there, you know? Go in it. 
TALIESIN: I'll put my hand in the fire. That's okay. Yeah. No, I can do that. 
ASHLEY: Well, I meant the titan. You know? Like, stick your hand into it. 
LIAM: Getting the goods. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: Let's see. 
TALIESIN: I do not take my eyes off you. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Take a deep breath. 
ASHLEY: (inhales) 
TALIESIN: You don't have to take a deep breath. I'm taking a deep breath. (laughter) I'm seeing what happens if I just relax and start to put my hand down, the damaged hand, the rocky right hand. 
MATT: Right. 
TRAVIS: The rocky right hand. 
TALIESIN: Towards the ground to see what I feel. 
MATT: Okay. As you take the titan reforged hand, if you will, and press it against the hard ground next to where you sit, it impacts with it like any hard surface would and it gives away like clay for a moment, and you're down to a wrist. 
TALIESIN: I grab you. Come with me. I'm going to lie down and hold you, lying on the ground and I'm going to try and sink. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You (whooshes) sink up to the shoulder and now your titan arm is within the surrounding rock, but the rest of your body halts. You feel this strange shaking sensation, like the smallest of quakes is tremoring through your right arm. You feel that pit in your stomach. 
TALIESIN: Damn it! I was hoping not to do this. Come with me on this one, or no? You don't have to. 
ASHLEY: I mean, yeah. I would love to, if I could try. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to change. 
MATT: Okay. (whooshes) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to let you go first. 
MATT: (chuckles) As Ashton's form shifts the stone and rock, expanding, cracking, piercing, outward, the arm, currently invisible, but parts of it now pushing through and causing the rock around it to crack and bulge outward, Laudna, while you're up at the top of the chamber. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Hey, guys. I think I got-- (laughter) Shit! 
MATT: The very surface of this thing, you feel a gentle shake of his transformation. 
MARISHA: I put my ear up to it. Ashton? 
MATT: You notice, Fearne, Ashton is not transformed. He's just leaning on the ground, his arm present. It's like he laid down and asked you to come with him and he just laid there and sits there smiling for a moment. Ashton, you feel yourself beginning to sink into the ground, beginning to fall within the rock. From your fingers, slips Fearne and the presence of the chamber. You suddenly feel now this, you imagine what it would be like to be buried alive, that fear that so many people do when they consider the idea of just darkness, no air, no movement. When you come to focus on this sensation, your body is immobile, locked, empty. 
ASHLEY: Psst! Where'd you go? 
MATT: He's just laying there. 
ASHLEY: I just lift open an eyelid. Hey! 
MATT: The eyes are still. He's breathing. 
ASHLEY: All right, you're doing a thing. I'm going to wait for Laudna to come here, just hang out. 
MATT: You stand there in still darkness, empty. Seconds, days, years, millennia go by. It is just a dead stillness and absence of space. Warmth. 
TALIESIN: I'll try and rage. I'm going to try and activate, just to see if even I can just, even the light from any of that. 
MATT: You try and rage, and tense your body. There's a brief, like a red glow that pulses. But it's not light you're seeing, it's light you're feeling. Something inside you, something pulses (thump) (rumble) with the smallest of burning embers, like heated charcoal that seems to pulse in your chest. It's at that particular moment, that absence and darkness, you feel a specter around you and a presence. And that's all. 
TALIESIN: What's your name? I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours. I'm going to rage again. 
MATT: Okay. (whooshes) Now as you tense, you can feel rock around you cracking (cracking) like the very foundation of whatever endless stone has you entombed here seems to give ever so faintly, and you can feel that force pushing and giving slightly. (whooshes) With that, you have a flash, an image in your mind of ground crumbling, of valleys falling, of mountains rising and piercing, images of rain carving through still stone valleys. 
TALIESIN: The gods may leave. I might be able to chase them off. Talk to me. I'll rage again. 
MATT: (whooshes) You rage a third time. As you rally against this tomb, your body forces and it begins to break further. You tense one final time (cracking) and you feel it crack and break around you, like an outer shell of impossibly dense stone break away. You shake this outer shell off and you stand in this faintly lit purple midnight horizon on all sides. You watch as one ominous shape, like a mountain in the distance, (whooshes) rises. Its scope in size, imperceptible. (large, thudding cracks) Like you are suddenly surrounded by a crown of monolithic mountain peaks, and you feel them all looking at you. 
TALIESIN: I'm part of you. 
MATT: "She's part of you." 
TALIESIN: She's part of me? Who are you? 
MATT: "We are the rock and stone. We are this world." 
TALIESIN: I walk this world. I am from you, I'm of you, and I will return to you. I travel with Rau'shan, part of them. The gods may leave, if we do this. What's possible? What do you want? 
MATT: Dozens of other smaller mountains begin to appear on the horizon. "We are lost. We are scattered. We are everything." Other voices begin to chime in. 
TALIESIN: I don't know how to be lost in everything at the same time. How do I find you? How do we...? If we make them leave, how do we make a world? How do we remake it? 
MATT: "We've always been. Everything is cyclical." The presence is just beyond your comprehension. The fact that you can ascertain the sense of this communication is already dizzying to try and listen. This doesn't feel like you are conversing with the titan you are within, it's just kind of a gateway. You begin to lean towards the shadow. You see fragments of mountains across the world, of solitary stones left tumbling in a river. In but moments, hearing these voices, you feel like you can hear the the hearts of what was once the living breath of the land, now shattered and lost to its own vacant memory. 
TALIESIN: Cyclical. How do we restore you? I want to fix what's broken. No more lost, no more shattered. How do we return? What would you have me do? 
MATT: "Lost." "Lost." "Lost." "Lost." "Lost," "lost," "lost," "lost," "lost," "lost," "lost," "lost," "lost," "lost," "lost," "lost." The ground begins to shift beneath you and lift up higher and higher. These massive monolithic shadows begin to descend below, vanishing, their immense size, now becoming minuscule and distant as you stand upon the tallest pillar of any land, the peak looking down into a purple infinity around you. 
TALIESIN: This doesn't feel lost. (shouts) This doesn't feel lost! I'm not lost. If we make them leave, we can find you. 
MATT: (rock crunching) The peak you stand on shifts, but as it quakes, it's not standing on the top of a toppling cart or even a tower that's shifting, it's so immense in the movement that you cannot grasp what you were standing on to begin with. As you see a hand rise up and clasp you, As you see a hand rise up and clasp you, you feel yourself once more entombed in tight, gripping, endless strength, the density of whatever you've ever been nearly forced to an infinitesimal point like coal being pressed into a diamond. At that moment where you feel like your entire form is about to give in and either shatter or become a singular bead of a lost essence, the fingers open wide and all you see before you is a singular, green, burning gem of an eye. You know this to be the specter of the one who lives inside you. "You are my memory. We are lost. You are not." 
TALIESIN: It's you. Ah. I reach for it with my right hand and then I stop and I put both hands up to pick it up. He travels with me as well. Is he also memory? 
MATT: "Yes." 
TALIESIN: I would like to remember. I'm sorry that I'm broken. Will this hurt? 
MATT: "I don't remember." 
TALIESIN: Let's find out. I hold it up to my clouded eye, or I hold it up to the center and I'm going to see where it wants to go, actually. I keep my eyes very wide open. 
MATT: You glance into this gem-like eye. You see, more like you feel, flashing memories. You see visions, but they feel familiar. They feel like they're things that you've known. It's the beauty of chaos. Watching lands crumble and fall to be swallowed by the shifting of the fire and stone that remakes fertile ground for life to thrive and plants to grow, glimpses of the flames that burn the forests that leave blackened ash, and from that, new forests climb, lush. Glimpses of a time when maybe there was too much chaos. Or maybe there hasn't been enough since. There is beauty in destruction, for it's that sense of the temporary that gives meaning to anything. 
TALIESIN: Ha. Not broken. Just in motion. Will this world hold? 
MATT: "This world has held being remade before." 
TALIESIN: And those who live upon it? 
MATT: "If they're strong, they will. If not, they'll be remade into something stronger." 
TALIESIN: I think I understand. 
MATT: "Remake yourself. Never stop changing." 
TALIESIN: Mountains of dirt. 
MATT: The form shifts back into shadow as the mountain begins to crumble, the platform, the pillar you stand on, the tower seems to snap with an overwhelming crack (sharp crack) and you find yourself tumbling towards the endless purple below. (gentle whooshing) Wind coming by the warmth of invisible flame beginning to engulf you upon impact, and as you do, (hard thud) you come to consciousness on the ground sitting where you were. Ashton's just been passed out, not responding to anything for like a minute. 
ASHLEY: Were you just taking a fucking nap? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Where'd you go? 
TALIESIN: Well, that's the question, isn't it? How long have I been gone? 
ASHLEY: Like two minutes. I don't know. 
MATT: About two minutes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Do I feel anything outside of that initial rumble being on the Titan? 
MATT: You couldn't tell if it was a somehow exterior force or some sort of reaction, but yeah, it was a little odd. That's all. 
MARISHA: (clattering) I skitter down. 
ASHLEY: Why do you look like that? 
TALIESIN: I think I just had a talk with Exandria. I don't know. There was change and earth and mountains and fire. There was change and earth and mountains and fire. 
MARISHA: I got some pretty rocks. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Always useful. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: I think she sent a message-- 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: -- for your-- 
MARISHA: Exandria's a she? 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
MARISHA: I knew it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I knew it, too! 
TALIESIN: I don't think that's exactly how it works. The Shard of Titan in me, it's good. If things go the way that I think they're going to go, I think that nature is ready to right itself one way or another. 
MARISHA: Got a little tingly. Got a little vibrate-y. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, my-- 
MARISHA: Walls did. Felt something. It was weird. Was that you? 
TALIESIN: Is there anything different about me? Do I look normal? I thought I changed. I didn't change back? 
MATT: Nope. 
ASHLEY: No, you just put your hand in it up to your wrist and then you fell asleep. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I was going to go with you, but I was like, no-- 
TALIESIN: I was trying to, well-- 
ASHLEY: -- he wants to go to bed. 
TALIESIN: Clearly the fault's on me there. 
MARISHA: Does he have a thing in his hand? 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: No? 
SAM: His ass is on the front now, though. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Do we see anything different? Does he have a green eyeball or anything? 
MATT: No, not every vision gives you a vestige, guys. 
TALIESIN: No. 
MARISHA: Well... (laughter) 
SAM: I think it does. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I think the world is ready for a bit more chaos. I think that we could be good for this place and I don't think-- I think we will more than survive the gods if it comes to it. 
MARISHA: Are we the chaos? Are you saying that we, the three of us, are like a Chaos Crew? (laughs) 
TRAVIS: You went underhand. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Overhead grip. 
LAURA: Chaos. 
MARISHA: Chaos reign! 
TALIESIN: We're the other-- We're the West Coast Chaos Crew. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
MATT: This is left paw, right? 
TALIESIN: Sometimes you're standing, sometimes you're kneeling. 
MATT: I think in Southern Hemisphere, you do it that way, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Water goes the other direction. 
LIAM: You use it on yourself once. 
TRAVIS: R&R. 
MARISHA: (laughs) R&R. 
ASHLEY: It's different doing it myself. 
LIAM: I'm really phoning it in today, I'm sorry. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Well, I think I know where chaos starts. 
TALIESIN: Where does chaos start? 
MARISHA: I was going to stay in my pouch. 
ASHLEY: In the asshole. Should we go to Shank's? 
MARISHA: We should go to Shank's. 
TALIESIN: Let's go to Shank's and I'm going to be, on the way to Shank's, I'm going to be that guy who rambles about their ayahuasca trip. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: The entire walk down. I am intolerable. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wait, but if that's the case, if a mountain gave you an eyeball, why didn't you stick it in your eye? Did you stick it in your eye? 
TALIESIN: I mean, I thought about sticking it in my eye, but then I was like, you know, which eye? Then you just lost your sense, and then-- 
ASHLEY: Decision paralysis? 
TALIESIN: Well, by that point there's so many different mountains talking to you, and by that point it was just hard to concentrate and then I was in the eye and it was a little too late. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: (off-putting) "Hi there, welcome to Shank's." (screaming) (laughter) 
MATT: You step in there, there's this guy with an oily skullet of hair and thick-- 
LIAM: Orange skullet? ALL (except Liam): Oily. 
MATT: Oily skullet, thick bottle glasses and this long chin beard that knots into itself. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: It's like a... what was the character from "Baron Munchausen"? The sniper guy when in his older version? 
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Just like-- 
TALIESIN: No basis to personhood. 
MATT: "Come on through. Come on inside and I'll pour you a drink." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's a little tight in here. 
MATT: It's a tiny, it's maybe a five-person dive bar. 
LAURA: Tiny little hole. 
LIAM: There we go. 
LAURA: So tiny. 
TALIESIN: It's a tiny little hole. We can all fit. We'll squeeze in. 
MATT: It's against the walls. The wall slightly curves in and there's a long bar on the inside with stools and chairs along the way. 
ASHLEY: It's like a circle door. 
TALIESIN: Let's get in here and we'll each sit on a stool. It'll be fine. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Ah, I can't stop! 
ASHLEY: What's the drink special here? 
MATT: "We just make the Shank's." 
ASHLEY: I'll have the Shank's then. 
MATT: "Want a Shank's?" 
TALIESIN: Make that-- 
MARISHA: I'll have the Shank's. 
TALIESIN: Shank's all around. 
MATT: Three Shank's coming up. 
MARISHA: Three Shank's please. Oh, it's humid in here. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Humid. Should we tell them that we're here to-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, we can if we want to. If we want to do one last round. (gasps) 
ROBBIE: From a distance! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ There is harmony ♪ 
MARISHA: It was the poo rumbles. 
LAURA: Yeah, in your head you hear: Where the fuck are y'all? We're at the Sanctuary. 
MARISHA: Okay, I was literally just about to call you, I swear. I swear. Ashton's been talking a lot. We're in the butt hole zone. 
LAURA: Are you on your way down? 
MARISHA: Well, I didn't know if you wanted-- 
ASHLEY: Might be on our way out. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Did you guys want to come and join us at the-- 
LAURA: For a drink? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: For a drink? 
MARISHA: One last drink. 
LAURA: Armies are preparing to leave and y'all want to stop at a fucking bar?! You realize for every second we take longer, more people will die. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry, sweetheart. I love you so much. I'm sorry, I don't get good service in the ass. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: She was yelling at you. We needed that. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Is it possible, do you have, like, to-go Shank's? 
MATT: "I can get you a bottle of Shank's, yeah." 
ASHLEY: Oh, a bottle, that'd be even better. 
TALIESIN: How many bottles of Shank's? Have we tried the Shank's yet? 
MATT: No, but he has poured. It is this brackish, somewhat brown amber liqueur. 
TALIESIN: I'm giving it a taste. I'm so excited. 
MATT: It is like rubbing alcohol with a hint of clove and cinnamon. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's like, what's that stuff that we had to drink that one time? 
MATT: Could you narrow it down? 
TALIESIN: No, I mean like-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Do you remember when you rolled really poorly and it's that Chicago stuff, what's it called? 
MATT: Oh, oh no, it is not as bad as Malört. 
TALIESIN: Christmas Malört, because you said that-- 
MATT: Yeah, I don't-- 
TALIESIN: Okay, it's not that bad, all right. 
MATT: Not that bad. 
TALIESIN: Nothing is, okay, that's fair. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: We'll get a bottle of Shank's. 
TALIESIN: This is awful. Definitely a bottle. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's bad. 
MATT: "Two bottles?" 
MARISHA: Two bottles. 
ASHLEY: Well, I just realized I don't have any money, so. 
TALIESIN: How will you pay us to-- how much is a bottle? 
ASHLEY: I'm not buying. 
MATT: "Buy two bottles, get a third one free." 
TALIESIN: How much is a bottle? (laughter) 
MATT: He looks back at his paper. "Two and a half gold." 
ASHLEY: Two and a half gold? 
TALIESIN: I don't have two and a half gold. 
MARISHA: I have two silver. 
SAM: Wait. None of you have any money? 
MARISHA: No. 
ASHLEY: I don't have money. 
MARISHA: I think I spent all my money last time we went shopping. 
MATT: "One gold." 
TALIESIN: I don't have one gold. 
MARISHA: No. 
ASHLEY: Listen. 
MATT: Drags them back. 
ASHLEY: Listen. Here's the deal. 
TRAVIS: Deep research. 
ASHLEY: We are about to go to the front lines and possibly save the worlds. If we don't succeed, Shank's Canteen is no longer going to be here. 
MATT: "Um--" 
ASHLEY: What I'm saying is you should give those to us, since we are fighting for your life, basically. 
MATT: "Five silver and you sign the wall." 
ASHLEY: What does that mean? 
MATT: "If you're going to save the world, I want to have your signatures on the wall." 
TALIESIN: Done. 
ASHLEY: There's no binding contract? 
TALIESIN: Don't care. Signing it. 
ASHLEY: Because I've learned from signing things-- Okay. Done! 
MARISHA: Sign the wall. Do you have three silver because I have two? 
TALIESIN: I have silver. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I have nothing. I can contribute nothing. 
TALIESIN: I have some silver. You don't have to contribute any. 
LIAM: The symbol of the Whispered One and Fearne's autograph. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Worst case scenario, we dine and dash. 
TRAVIS: Just need one more. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can do five silver. 
MATT: Five silver and has y'all sign the wall. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
MARISHA: Have this lock of hair. 
MATT: "I'll take it." 
MARISHA: From this girl named Prism. There you go. Thank you. 
TALIESIN: You gave away Prism hair? 
MARISHA: Yeah I-- 
SAM: As you sign the wall, you see this on the wall right next to it. (laughter) 
LAURA: Fearne's mom. (laughter) 
MATT: That's pretty great. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MARISHA: I meet up with the others. 
TALIESIN: Morri gets around, man. 
MARISHA: Let's go meet up with the others. 
ASHLEY: Is the way out back here, straight to the outside? 
MATT: "Nah, it's too blocked up here in Shank's. (laughter) "You got to run down the leg." 
TRAVIS: Aw! 
MARISHA: Aw! 
TRAVIS: Matthew! (groaning) 
TALIESIN: That's all I wanted. That's all I wanted. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Grab the bottles. 
MATT: You grab the bottles. 
ASHLEY: We'll go. 
MATT: Eventually make your exit out the base of the Titan. The Titan's Block, technically. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Sorry we had to drink and run. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
MATT: But yeah, you all gather up around the outskirts of the Silver Talon's Reach. Is there anything else that you need to do? 
LAURA: Oh my gosh, we just got to fucking go. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Did you guys get some diamond dust? 
LAURA: We did, we got three diamonds dusted. 
SAM: We should give some to Fearne. 
LAURA: Here's a dusted diamond. 
TALIESIN: That doesn't look pure. Are you sure that's pure? 
LAURA: I don't know. 
LIAM: Chetney also got drugs. 
LAURA: Chet already rubbed it on his gums. 
MARISHA: Chet got drugs? 
LAURA: Don't worry. 
TALIESIN: I was actually just going to fake it to see if he'd do it anyway, that's cool. 
TRAVIS: While we were waiting, I'll spend-- 
ASHLEY: I'll just take one. 
TRAVIS: An hour. How long were they up there, two hours? 
MATT: There about three hours, I'd say. 
TRAVIS: I'll spend two of those hours working on some new toys. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. 
SAM: I'll also work on some art projects. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: So much crafting. 
LAURA: I will regain some spells and then regain my sorcery points with that short rest. 
MATT: You got it, all right. To that point, then, make a dexterity check for me, or a performance check, your choice, and the same for you. 
SAM: Okay. I can't inspire myself, right? 
TRAVIS: 20, dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20, finely-crafted toys. 
TRAVIS: Finely. 
MATT: Not your best work, but close. 
MARISHA: Finally. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Finally. 
SAM: Performance or? 
MATT: Or dex, your choice. 
SAM: 21. 
MATT: 21, yeah. So you can describe now if you want to, or wait till later to reveal your art pieces. 
TRAVIS: One of them is inspired by Nana Morri, of course. And the other one, is a surprise. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Mine will probably take a few attempts to finish. 
MATT: Okay, so-- 
SAM: Working on a painting. 
MATT: An ongoing project, you got it, okay. Well. 
MARISHA: Is Dorian back with us? 
ROBBIE: You hear laughter from like 25. (laughs) He's like, "Ah, guys, what have you been up to?" 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness, you look so jovial. 
SAM: You're so perky. 
ROBBIE: Oh, I've just, surprisingly, there's a positive energy in the air tonight. I feel like wherever we're headed next, is the right direction. I don't know why, it's just a vibe I'm getting. 
SAM: Did you did have sex with someone? 
ROBBIE: I had musical sex. 
SAM: Whoa! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
ROBBIE: It's like the sexy part, I just played music, okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay, okay. I was really excited. I was like, that is something I haven't tried. We need to try this before we die, possibly! 
TALIESIN: We drank in an ass. It was great. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: We did. We didn't drink in an ass. We drank inside of an ass, you know where we should go? 
ASHLEY: We can go back into the ass when we finish all this. 
TRAVIS: We scored gems. We got the hook up. 
ASHLEY: Great, yeah. 
LAURA: Successes all round. 
ASHLEY: We got gems. We got these Shank's bottles. 
MARISHA: I also got these, wait, can I take a second to look at the crystals? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Do they have an aura? 
MATT: Make an arcana check. 
LAURA: You can identify things, can't you? 
TALIESIN: (comical identifying blips) 
ASHLEY: I can. 
MARISHA: Oh, she can identify things? 
ROBBIE: I'm not going to, but I can. 
MATT: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: If I feel like it. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Can I have her take a look-- 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: -- as well to help me out or something? 
TALIESIN: Hmm, it's a rock. 
LAURA: Shiny rocks. 
MARISHA: Wait, what am I doing? What am I-- 
MATT: (laughs) Arcana check. 
MARISHA: 16. 
MATT: 16. Looking at these crystals, they look like they are very, very nice crystals. They're not inherently magical, but they are very much the type of crystals that you would want to use as a basis for an enchantment. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
ROBBIE: Hmm! 
MATT: So for crafting purposes of the creation of any crystal-based magical item, these would be prime materials. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: Also great for Etsy. 
MATT: Oh, tremendously for Etsy. 
LAURA: Make some pretty earrings. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to charge them under the red moon. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah. One of them is a little jade egg. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll put them up. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Charge them up. 
MATT: Sorry. The soldiers that were laughing and finishing their jovial conversation and banter with Dorian suddenly get quiet and scatter off a bit as you see a grouping of Kryn soldiers are walking through the reach. of Kryn soldiers are walking through the reach. At this point, you see four of these fully armored, decked warriors from the Dynasty. Their armor itself beautiful, rich, dark blue, purple chitinous metal armor, the plates themselves intersecting like some sort of mystical insect warrior. Their helmets obscuring their face other than the eye holes themselves, seeming to denote an intelligence in the darkness. curving up into horns, their weapons looking wicked and hooked on their side. The cloaks falling from their shoulder pauldrons. The Kryn warriors are by nature designed to be an intimidating presence. As they walk, most other folks of Vasselheim definitely keep a wide berth, but they are walking in your direction. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
LAURA: They're good guys, right? These are good guys? 
TRAVIS: Do we see the Bright Queen at all? 
SAM: Isn't everyone? 
MATT: You do not see the Bright Queen, no. 
TALIESIN: I feel like they would be more than-- 
TRAVIS: I got this. 
TALIESIN: Oh, no. 
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, take it away, Chet. 
SAM: I'll take out my weapon, just in case. 
TRAVIS: I'll take a couple steps forward. 
LAURA: I'll step behind Chet. 
TRAVIS: How fare thee? 
MATT: As you draw your weapon as this happens, you notice they all put their hands on the side of their blades. 
SAM: Sure. 
MATT: The front two divide a bit. What you see is the figure between the four that you couldn't see before, this older female goblin figure-- 
LIAM: Goblin. 
MATT: -- wearing beautiful, intricate ceremonial robes of purple and silver and gray, adorned in all manner of intricate silver and platinum jewelry containing sigils and symbols throughout the ceremonial shoulder mantle that curves up into multiple points on the sides, layered about four or five layers in each side. Long gray hair with streaks of white pulling through it that falls to the back. Pale skin and warm eyes look up towards you all, her hands wrapped in these thick, heavy sleeves that join in the center as she looks up in your direction. "Indeed. Hello." 
TRAVIS: Ah, greetings. 
MATT: "You are the ones called Bells Hells, yes?" 
TRAVIS: We are they, ey. 
ROBBIE and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: "I'm to present a gift from the Dynasty here on these midnight hours before the storm." She pulls back her sleeves and you see in her hand this small box, this intricate, beautifully carved box of dark metal and alabaster, her long nail-hooked fingers wrapping around the front of it. She shuffles forward towards you, Chetney. The four Kryn now flanking her and keeping a very close eye on Braius as she approaches. 
TRAVIS: Incredible. I am Chetney Pock O'Pea. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: The leader of Bells Hells. 
LAURA: Oh, well, okay. 
TALIESIN: He'll be dead soon. 
TRAVIS: And your name? 
TALIESIN: Let him have it. 
MATT: "I am the Skysybil Mirimm." 
TRAVIS: (excited whisper) Oh, the Skysybil. 
TRAVIS: It is an honor to meet you. 
MATT: "We of the Dynasty are not the most godly of beings that this city would call to arms, but the Dynasty is resolute in its intent to show its place in Exandria and to defend those we wish to maintain as allies on the world stage. We know and understand that you, amongst others, go off to attempt impossible tasks." 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "So, we wish to do what we can to aid your service for the future of Exandria. Do not forget this kindness we've done you." She hands it forward to you. 
TRAVIS: I'm sure, I'm sure we can't accept this. It's really not necessary. I'll open it. (laughter) 
MATT: Within it you see two-- 
TALIESIN: Make a dex check. 
TRAVIS: (explosion) 
MATT: -- gorgeous-looking squat crystal vials that seem to swirl up to a black wax cap on them. You see a gray glass orb You see a gray glass orb that seems to have some sort of odd, almost like a slow moving storm inside. You can't get a good look right now. It's just still and sitting. 
LAURA: Two of them, you said? 
MATT: Just one. 
LAURA: Just one. 
SAM: One orb and two- 
MARISHA: Two vials. 
SAM: -- vials. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Oh, an orb and two vials. Sorry, sorry. My bad. 
MATT: "We, as the Dynasty, and the many dens in the light of the Luxon wish unto you the greatest of luck, and may all the possibilities of the future align with your goals and intent." 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MATT: She turns around and begins to shuffle back amongst the soldiers. 
LAURA: I'm sorry. 
MATT: She stops. 
LAURA: What is it, what do these do? 
SAM and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
LAURA: How do you use it, the ball? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "You're clever." 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Imogen. May the light of the Luxon watch over you. 
MATT: The Kryn soldiers look- 
ASHLEY: Thank you for bringing enough for everyone. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: One of the soldiers off the side goes, "(snorts)." (laughter) 
MATT: The other guy slaps him in the shoulder. 
TRAVIS: Under the helm. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: High five, 
MATT: The Kryn go, nod and turn around and flank the Skysybil once more as they step off back into the reach. 
TRAVIS: Guys, under my leadership, we cannot fail. 
SAM: Wow. I have to say-- 
LAURA: Listen. 
SAM: The last four days with you guys have been incredible. (laughter) 
SAM: I mean, I have met the ruler of every single land. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
SAM: I've gone to four different dimensions. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yep. 
SAM: It's fucking amazing. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: You were just locked in a closet. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, you were just in the closet and now look where you are. 
TALIESIN: Sometimes you get locked in the right closet. 
ROBBIE and MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: When you come out of the closet though, everything's great. 
ASHLEY: Wait, has it really only been four days? 
LAURA: I think it's less than that. 
TRAVIS: Something like that, yeah. 
LAURA: It's been less than four days. 
MARISHA: Three days, tops. 
ASHLEY: Since we were at the-- Wow. 
LAURA: Yeah, time. 
ASHLEY: Time. 
TRAVIS: You have Identify. 
ASHLEY: I do, yeah. 
TRAVIS: So we should go somewhere to look at these other than the street. 
LAURA: This is the one orb you probably shouldn't stick up your ass, Chet. 
TRAVIS: Listen. 
LAURA: You'd have to pull out-- 
TRAVIS: If we want to exalt this thing, there's only one way to bake it. 
ASHLEY: That's true. That's true. Might have to. 
TRAVIS: Let me just get rid of-- (pop) Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Can we just take a second? 
TRAVIS: Sure. 
LAURA: We just sit down on the steps-- 
ASHLEY: Do you want me to do it now, or you want me to do it later? 
LAURA: -- of the Platinum-- 
LAURA: Oh, let's just do it. 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Do it now. 
TRAVIS: Form a perimeter. 
SAM: Okay. Circle up. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, well-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'll just bark at anybody who comes near. 
MATT: The two vials-- 
SAM: We'll all hold hands in a circle. 
MATT: Well, even just approaching this box, you get a-- You are filled with all sort of strange, conflicting biological sensations today. 
TALIESIN: Today has been, yeah, today has been a lot of bio. 
MATT: That odd sense of energy, that cyclical momentum that sometimes picks up in your head when you rage begins to react at the presence of this box. While the design of the vials is different, it is not dissimilar to what you had scavenged from Hexum's hoard-- 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: -- on its way to the Paragon's Call in Bassuras, as well as what was utilized in the reconstruction of your head by Milo. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Within a bit of a glance to say that scenario, these are both potions of possibility-- 
LAURA: Brilliant. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: -- that you can have at your disposal. 
MARISHA: Did we already have another one, too? 
TRAVIS: We had them earlier, but I think most everyone them used them up. 
ASHLEY: We did. 
LAURA: They've been used. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: And then the orb. 
TRAVIS and LAURA: What's the sphere? 
MATT: You said you have Identify? 
ASHLEY: I do. What is this big old fat orb of juicy juices? 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LIAM: What have they given us? 
TRAVIS: Ashton's other half of his brain. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: You look into this sphere and what was once a slow-moving storm seems to speed up into a swirl before it slows down again and stops, and then rapidly speeds up once more. It's almost-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, please. 
MATT: It's like some odd shifting of matter and time seems to be in a continuous pattern of stopping and then speeding up. 
TRAVIS: Read it. 
TALIESIN: I have a theory. 
ASHLEY: I feel like if this is thrown against a hard object with enough force, the orb will shatter, encircling any creatures within 15 feet of it with a burst of crafted dunamis. All creatures affected by the orb immediately regain half of their expended hit dice, rounded up. Spellcasters regain 1d4 plus four spell slots-- 
SAM: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: -- of their choice-- 
SAM: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
ASHLEY: -- and gain the benefits of a short rest. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Upon use, this item is destroyed. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Whoa, what did I just say? What did I just say? 
TRAVIS: What's the area of effect? 
SAM: 15 foot radius. 
ASHLEY: That was so weird, I was just talking. 
SAM: Break it right in the middle of us. 
LAURA: You have to do it right in the middle of a battle. Everybody has to circle up. 
TRAVIS: Does it have a name? Does it have a name? 
ASHLEY: It is called-- Let me think. Sphere of Dunamanic Restoration. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LAURA: Maybe it's like we do one thing, we're like: Fuck, we don't have time for a short rest. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
LAURA: (shatters orb) 
LIAM: It's akin to the crystal that we found. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: That is very cool. 
MARISHA: It's a "Shit, we don't have time for this." 
TRAVIS: That'll go to good use when we give it to the other groups. 
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Keep it away from Caleb. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wow, that's cool. While they're identifying those objects, can I search the box? Check for linings, secret, anything that might be used to track our location. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Just to ensure that the gift is truly a gift. 
MATT: Make an investigation check. 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. 
TRAVIS: That's not a good dice. 
TALIESIN: Go, Travis. 
TRAVIS: This one is. 
ASHLEY: I will not forget their kindness. 
TALIESIN: No trust. 
MARISHA: No trust. No trust. No trust. 
TRAVIS: 12, eight, 20. 
MATT: 20. No, box seems pretty standard. I mean, it's beautifully made and definitely has a very carefully crafted interior to house a somewhat fragile object to not be jostled and destroyed in transit. 
TRAVIS: Oh, good. 
MATT: But beyond that, you don't recognize anything else strange about it. 
TRAVIS: I'll put it in the bag of holding just in case there's a tracking charm on it. It won't be able to see shit. 
ASHLEY: Good idea. 
TRAVIS: (plops orb into bag) 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okie doke. 
TALIESIN: Let's go do this. 
ASHLEY: Do you want to keep it with you, Chet? 
TRAVIS: Oh, sure. 
LAURA: All right. 
MARISHA: Did you ever get a slip of paper for the mask? 
SAM: No. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
SAM: I don't think we know what it does. 
ASHLEY: Should I look at it? 
LAURA: That's right, no... 
SAM: Oh, you can Identify more than once? I mean, we know what it is. 
LAURA: It's a mask that will call her aid. 
MARISHA: It's got to be something that calls an undead army or something. 
LAURA: Yeah, I don't know. 
SAM: Or it's like a one time use Divine Intervention. 
TRAVIS: How can you Identify an item from a god? Well, I mean, it happens but... 
LAURA: I guess we did that with my ring. 
TRAVIS: Not when it's a mask. 
TALIESIN: Do it before bed. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: So what's the plan, y'all? 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: It's time to... Let's roll. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: The Sanct. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LIAM: Move on. 
MATT: Okay, heading back up the stairs to the Platinum Sanctuary, about halfway up you catch Allura on the way down mid-conversation with two other armored generals who are in the process of conversing in some sort of hurried state, she stops. "Oh, hello, do you need anything?" 
LAURA: Oh, we were just going to let you know we were ready to head to the lake. 
MATT: "Right. All right." 
MARISHA: Is that okay? 
MATT: "Good. Oh, no, it's great." 
SAM: Are you all right? 
TRAVIS: Are you okay? Yeah. 
MATT: "Yes, a lot to organize. I'm sorry, a bit scattered. My apologies, gentlemen. Yes." 
TRAVIS: We can wait. 
SAM: You don't seem great. 
MATT: "There's a lot going on." 
SAM: Well, of course, but you know... 
TALIESIN: Wow, wow. 
LAURA: No-- yeah, she's scattered. 
ASHLEY: We can wait. There's no-- 
MATT: "I would not be taking you here, actually." 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: "There have been a few figures, I think that might be a little more suited for this particular mission, as they've actually been to this lake before. Let me just let them know. Right, if you want to wait here on the stair, they'll be here in the next minute or so." 
ASHLEY: Should we wait on the stairs or? 
TRAVIS: On the stairs or inside? 
ASHLEY: Commit to a level? 
MATT: "You can meet them up there if you head there now. They're in the Sanctuary. Nevertheless," and you see, it's a moment of going like, "(exhales) This might be the last I see of you before you head on your journey. (exhales sharply)" 
TRAVIS: Nah. 
LAURA: Thank you, Allura. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Hey, this isn't goodbye. 
MATT: "No, no, not at all." 
TRAVIS: This is "Go get 'em." 
MATT: "(chuckles) You are right. Well, it's been a pleasure getting to know you, and it'll be more of a pleasure to get to know you better. So go get 'em, Bells Hells." 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Best of luck on your front as well. 
MARISHA: (whispering) She said our name. 
MATT: "See you on the other side." 
LAURA: See you on the other side. 
MATT: "Anyway," and she continues down the stairs and the two generals watch behind and they're like, "Who are those folks?" 
TRAVIS: Fucking... (laughter) 
MATT: She's like, "Ah, it's a long story," and they continue down the stairs. You continue climbing and towards the top. You see a figure jogging to the top and another figure trailing behind. Stops, glancing over down the steps to meet your gaze. Familiar sight, someone you haven't seen in a minute. You see short blonde hair, ends in a bit of a teal coloration. Septum piercing in the nose and light intricate Zephran armor. Who you see before you is the master of defenses, Leeta, and sister in marriage to Orym. Who looks over. 
LIAM: Leeta! 
MATT: "Orym!" 
LIAM: I start springing up the stairs and dive into a hug. 
MATT: She fights that instinct to rush and just girds herself. 
LIAM: I cover for her. 
MATT: Yep, (soft impact) takes the big impacted hug. "(sighs)" 
LIAM: You're here. 
MATT: "Brother, you're-- You are doing a lot." 
LIAM: Well, we're doing our part. 
LAURA: In the thick of it, as we approach. 
MATT: "Aren't we all?" They give a nod. "Good to see you as well, Dorian." 
ROBBIE: Hello, how are you? 
MATT: "Well, well." 
LIAM: How many have you brought with you? 
MATT: "Right now, it's just me and--" she turns over and you see Maeve standing there. Her long blonde hair, it's not tied back. It's just let go and the snow is gathered on top of her head. She has beautiful Zephran travel druid vestments, but definitely thicker now with the cold weather. You can see she's a little chilly. She carries her long staff and she glances and smiles sheepishly a bit at the rest of you. "So I'm taking you to the lake, I guess." 
LAURA: Oh! Great. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: "Since we've been there. We have a small encampment there." 
LIAM: How long have you been set up there? 
MATT: "Just about a week or so." 
LIAM: How's home? 
MATT: "It's going as good as it can be. People are asking questions, but we're safe. As long as everything we're doing here works, they're safe." 
MARISHA: Yeah, how's Ropey? Have you talked to our sentient rope? Never mind. 
MATT: "What?" 
MARISHA: Don't worry about it. 
TRAVIS: She was crawling around the ceiling for a little too long. Just ignore her. 
MARISHA: Blood is still coming back to my head. 
MATT: "I understand," and she goes up and gives Orym a big hug, too. She moves up and embraces you. 
LIAM: I'm going to stand between them with my arms up holding their hands. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, how does this work? Do we come closer to you? Do we need to all touch? 
MATT: Leeta turns to Maeve and-- 
MARISHA: (crack) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MATT: Maeve goes, "Actually, I did see right over this way," and you see on the outskirts of the Platinum Sanctuary, there are a number of platforms where small garden trees rise up and she's like, "that one should do. Come along." 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
SAM and ASHLEY: The tree situation. 
TRAVIS: The tree thing. Yeah, okay. 
TALIESIN: The tree at terminal three is ready to board. 
ASHLEY: This is such a cool way to travel. I really want to learn this. 
LAURA: Yeah, you got to figure this out. 
ASHLEY: I know! I just don't know how to do it. I can't figure it out. 
TRAVIS: You should just try running at the tree. I'm sure it'll open. 
ASHLEY: I'll try that, Chet. Thank you so much. 
TRAVIS: I don't know why the attitude. It's wood. It's very pliant. (laughter) 
MATT: As Maeve lifts her staff up and sets it in front, turns it to the side and as she pulls it back towards her chest, you see the bark seem to almost bow towards her before splitting like the front of a fruit, and where it splits open, you can see the walkway that's about 15 or so feet of a pathway that leads into a forested region. Leeta runs through and Maeve's like, "Quickly, quickly." 
TRAVIS: (rapid whooshes) 
LIAM: Wow, that comes way easier to you now. 
MATT: She falls in behind. You all emerge out the opposite end into a space that is not quite as chilled at the moment, not quite as gray as the Vasselheim skies around you. Here in this space, you are surrounded by dense forest and a chilled day. It's maybe 50s or so, but nowhere near the freezing temperatures of the city you just emerged from. 
LIAM: This area was kind of haunted the last time we were here. Is that the same, or? 
MATT: (Maeve) "I haven't noticed anything haunted." 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Like ghosts? 
MATT: She looks over at Leeta, and Leeta's like, "No, there was a warning about it, but we've kept an eye. Nothing seems to have emerged." 
LAURA: Great. 
TRAVIS: No ghosts. 
MATT: "Unless you're not telling us something, brother." 
TRAVIS: Bad energy. 
MARISHA: It was dead people in the lake. 
LIAM: Bad vibes when we were here last. 
ROBBIE: Oh, you fought ghosts. 
SAM: Divine Sense. 
ROBBIE: Oh, cool. 
SAM: Any undead around? 
ROBBIE: How do you punch a ghost? 
MATT: You focus outward into the forest surrounding you-- 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. 
MATT: -- and find nothing. 
TRAVIS: Oh, Matthew! 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I saw the lunge on that one. 
TRAVIS: Matthew fucking Mercer. 
MARISHA: "I saw the lunge." 
MATT: Leeta quickly looks at the rest of you, "It's just around this corner. Follow me," and she leads you through this patch of trees and you can hear the gentle sound of water lapping at the edge of a lake, that-- (waves lapping gently) As the trees begin to clear, you can see Lake Umamu before you. The memories of the tense discovery of this space. What you see here, Dorian and Braius, being your first time arriving in here, you are-- (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh my god, it's full of colors! 
MATT: This beautiful tree- dense valley that you sit in is surrounded like a crown of small mountains that reach up in all directions. Just green as far as you can see with the lightest dusting of what's probably melting snow from a heavier snowfall earlier this week. 
LAURA: You made it, Braius. You're on the moon! 
SAM: It looks the same. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: So different? 
LAURA: Just wait. 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: You also see what looks to be a small fishing village off to the left, just along the outskirts of this lake, maybe 200 feet from where you're currently standing. There's a dock that goes out into the water. But there are a number of tents set up on the edge that are warmly lit on the inside, as the day itself is finding itself coming to a close in the next hour or so. As you approach and follow the Zephran guides there, you can see other Zephran soldiers are doing perimeter walks and keeping an eye out. There are a couple of large birds that you see fly and perch on top of a rooftop that look around vigilantly before taking off again. Their movement and acknowledgement, they almost seem to look in your direction and nod as you approach before taking off again. 
LAURA: FCG would be so pissed right now. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Traitors. 
MATT: You also see on the outskirts of the town, there are large barricades set up of browned, tangled thorns and bramble. Some sort of defensible boundaries have been temporarily set up just in case something were to choose to assail the town. Stepping closer to this, what was abandoned the first time you visited it, elements of the town have been left alone, but some places have been lit from the inside. There's some parts of the town closest to the dock that have been outfitted as temporary homesteads for the Zephran people that currently watch this space. As you begin to get close, Leeta turns over towards Orym and the rest of the group. "So we've been given not too much information intentionally to make sure that if anyone were to be compromised, we would be less of an issue towards what you are attempting to do. But we have been given the instruction to keep you safe, and when it is time, to keep the waters of the lake at bay to allow you to travel." 
LAURA: That's right. 
LIAM: That's right. We're good on our end on that front. We're meeting people here, though. Have they shown up yet? 
MATT: "Not yet, but they should be here any moment soon. We do have some rooms cleared in one of the dusty inns or we have space in some of the nearby tents, if you'd wish to wait within. The choice is really yours. We don't have much to offer you in terms of food or comfort." 
LAURA: ♪ Don't have much ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
LIAM: Wow. 
TRAVIS: That one came roaring out. (laughter) 
MATT: ♪ All I need ♪ to know. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I don't know much ♪ (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ But I know I love you ♪ 
MATT: I watched that possess you. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: But I mean, in less than a second. 
MATT: You left us for about four seconds. 
TRAVIS: In less than a second. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (retches) (laughter) 
SAM: When the Neville hits. 
LAURA: Yeah, you just got to go with it. 
ASHLEY: You got to go with it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I think rooms would be great. 
SAM: Dusty rooms, or pretty tents? 
MARISHA: Yes, yes, dusty rooms. 
LAURA: I mean, that's where we stayed before. 
MATT: Indeed it is. You are brought to the familiar, maybe not the direct chambers where you had previously stayed and where some of you were called out to the siren's call, the spectral entity that claimed the lake before. But you find familiar rooms inside 
MARISHA: As we walk along the banks, do I see any ropes that resemble Ropey? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
MARISHA: All right. 
ASHLEY: Come on, Ropey. 
TALIESIN: You find a completely different rope. 
MARISHA: Wow, this has been-- 
SAM: There is a rope, but it's hanging from a noose. He killed himself. (laughter) 
MARISHA: What? Sam Riegel! 
SAM: He couldn't take it anymore. 
MATT: It's too lonely. 
MARISHA: 16. 
ASHLEY: (Ropey) I have no one to talk to. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Is that a nine? Yes, 16. 
MATT: You don't know if you see the rope for the boat that sank deep in the lake, but there are a number of other ropes around here, lengths of rope that are on the-- 
TALIESIN: There's always more ropes in the sea is what he's saying. 
TRAVIS: Ropey wasn't lonely. 
SAM: He had a family! 
MATT: Oh, that's right. You did ride it back, didn't you? 
MARISHA: We rode it back. We rode it back. 
MATT: Then yeah, actually you find-- Thank you for the right question. So you do find the boat itself that you had pulled back onto the shore and it remains up on the stone. It has not washed back-- 
LAURA: Boaty! 
MATT: -- into the water or been pushed in. 
TRAVIS: It's a boat. 
MATT: There is indeed the limp length of rope left within, a little bit of water still sitting on the bottom of the boat from probably recent rainfall. 
TRAVIS: Focus, focus, focus. 
LAURA: Just taking Ropey with you? 
MATT: You got it. You got it. 
MARISHA: Take him with me. 
ASHLEY: The boat. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (janky creaking) 
MARISHA: Boaty will be fine. 
TALIESIN: Boaty's alone now. 
MARISHA: Ropey was my favorite. Don't tell Boaty. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Boaty heard that. 
MARISHA: We all have a favorite child. 
ASHLEY: Ropey. 
TRAVIS: Pâté's going to murder that rope. 
MATT: Oh yeah. You are brought to these musty, old rooms that have been given some semblance of comfort. Rapidly, a number of other Zephran outpost soldiers Rapidly, a number of other Zephran outpost soldiers and guardians bring up some linens and pillows and things in the hopes of making this a more comfortable space for you. Within short order, you're left to your quiet devices in these rooms. For some of you in this new, if somewhat solemn space, somewhere in Exandria that you have no idea. This sleepy little town that looks like it was once a comfortable, bustling fishing village that lies empty, like it carries some sort of dark memory of the past, and the promise of others to soon arrive. and the promise of others to soon arrive. What would you like to do? 
LIAM: I-- 
LAURA: How late is it? Sorry. 
MATT: By the time you've gone through all this, I'd say the light is starting to fade. You probably have about an hour before the sun is fully set and the sky is dark. 
TRAVIS: I'd like to get a room with a window to the outside and try and-- (straining) 
MATT: It lifts. 
TRAVIS: -- perch up on it and get one foot in, one foot out. 
MATT: Okay, sit up in the sill. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: Okay. Whittling away? 
TRAVIS: Whittling away, always. You know, art is never finished. You just leave it alone at some point. But also keeping an eye out for this group of schmos that are supposed to join us. 
SAM: You've met some of these schmos? 
TRAVIS: I don't think so. 
LIAM: Yeah, we've met a couple of them. 
LAURA: No, we have. 
TRAVIS: We met a couple of them. 
ASHLEY: We did meet a couple. 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I wonder if some of the ones that were at the Malleus Key are going to be there. 
LAURA: I mean, they got free, right? That's what Essek was saying? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Abs. 
MARISHA: Abs. 
LAURA: Abs and-- 
TRAVIS: They're pretty handy. 
LAURA: -- this old wizard. 
MARISHA: Abs and dirt wizard. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that dirty wizard. 
LIAM: Salt and ginger. 
TRAVIS: Well, it was just two of them. 
ASHLEY: There was just the two. 
TRAVIS: But I guess there's-- 
LIAM: That's all I need. 
TRAVIS: -- more? 
LIAM: I'm going to go back outside for a minute and find my sisters. 
MATT: Leeta is in the process of talking with a few other folks, and Maeve is just keeping to the back and keeping an eye out, and sees you approach and gives you a wave. 
LIAM: I don't want to interrupt. Where are Baernie and mom, are they back home? 
MATT: "They are back home. We couldn't take everybody. We had to make sure we kept some folks to protect the town, just in case. Things have been weird all over since the solstice, and it's the challenge of all this is everyone's having to divide their time between defending their homestead and putting what they could to the front lines. We were told this was an important stakeout. We were told this position was of particular importance to you. So we've been doing our best to keep watch and not ask too many questions." 
LIAM: Mm, yeah, well, my friends and I we know our part to play. Once we're off, what happens for you both? 
MATT: "We make sure nobody follows." 
LIAM: So just on watch here? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LIAM: Okay. I know the Tempest is putting herself in the line of fire later in the week. 
MATT: "She mentioned that, and woe be onto whoever gets in her way." 
LIAM: Yeah. My mom okay? 
MATT: "She's good. She misses you. She's a little scared from all of this but Baernie's keeping an eye on her." 
LIAM: Okay. I didn't think I'd get a chance to see any of you before we headed out. It's a comfort. I miss you. 
MATT: "I miss you, too. You okay?" 
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: "Okay." 
LIAM: Your father taught me well. 
MATT: "Yeah, Dad wasn't the best at sharing his true emotions, so I guess he did." 
LIAM: Ah, he loved you all. Deeply. So do I. 
MATT: "But I'm glad you're okay." 
LIAM: I wordlessly hug her. I have many times before. Okay, well, I don't want to distract and we should probably take it easy before we go back to the moon again. 
MATT: "Is that where this goes?" 
LIAM: No, just kidding. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Goddamn it. 
TRAVIS: Top secret classification. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "No, I wouldn't say that out loud." 
MATT: She does the-- "Okay." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Amazing. 
LIAM: Anyway, I'm whooped. I love you, thank you. And I look forward to chilling the hell out at home. Soon. 
MATT: "Love you, too. When all this is said and done, you got to tell me all these stories. I'm going to sit you down and I'm going to get you a little tipsy and I need you to spill your guts to me." 
LIAM: It won't be that hard. 
MATT: "Okay." 
LIAM: I look forward to it. 
MATT: "All right." She circles into herself and turns into an owl. 
SAM: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
ROBBIE: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Owl! 
LIAM: Never not cool! Then I'm going to go find you. 
LAURA: Me? 
LIAM: Can I borrow you for a second? I'm sorry. Can I borrow you for a second? 
LAURA: Of course. 
LIAM: Thanks. I pull you outside to the back of the old shacks that we're in. I don't know where you're at. I don't know. Do you have any juice left? Are you able to reach out to anybody? 
LAURA: Oh, sure, yeah. 
LIAM: I wrote something down for my mom, Alma. It's real short. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Here, it's on this piece of paper, it's, "Hi from Vasselheim. With my friends where I'm meant to be. I love you. You're the best mom in the world." 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: There it is, written down. 
LAURA: I do that, I send that to her. 
MATT: She responds. "Oh goodness, love you, too. Have fun wherever you're going. When you come back, I got a new recipe, apricot pie." 
LAURA: Ooh, apricot pie. 
LIAM: Pie. 
MATT: "Heard you like pies more." That was it. 
LAURA: Oh, she's got a new recipe for you. 
LIAM: That'll be great. That'll be great, thanks. 
LAURA: Yeah. You excited? 
LIAM: Sort of. A lot of anticipation. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Imogen Temult, I appreciate you. 
LAURA: I appreciate you, too, Orym. 
LIAM: Okay, let's go do the thing. 
LAURA: All right, before I follow him, I'm going to send a message to my dad as well. Daddy, things are crazy. I love you no matter what. Thank you for doing your best. 
MATT: "Imogen, I think about you a lot. I hope wherever you are, you're happy. You always were a wandering spirit. Horses miss you as much as I do." 
LAURA: (laughs) I go inside. Well jeez, I'm sorry I pulled you all away from that butthole bar. Turns out we had time after all. 
ASHLEY: It's okay, we brought presents. 
LAURA: Oh good. 
ASHLEY: Just in case. If you-- 
LAURA: Dirty-- 
ASHLEY: -- wanted to try Shank's Asshole. 
LAURA: -- butt juice. 
ROBBIE: What is it? 
LAURA: What is it? What is this? 
SAM: Poo juice. 
MARISHA: It's named Shank's. 
TALIESIN: Shank's. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Which was also the name of the butthole bar. 
TALIESIN: Also, Shank's. 
MARISHA: It also may be the man, the weird man who greeted us at the door. 
TALIESIN: It is the essence of Shank's. 
MARISHA: Just everything seemed to be named Shank's. 
TALIESIN: In a bottle. 
ROBBIE: What do you think it is? 
TALIESIN: Shank's. 
MARISHA: We tried it. 
ASHLEY: We tried it, it's not bad. 
TALIESIN: It's not good. 
ASHLEY: If you want to try a little. 
LIAM: So not good, not bad. 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: It's not like the greatest liquor I've ever had. 
TALIESIN: I've had worse. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: You think we're going to go out tonight or we're going to sleep here? 
MARISHA: That's a great question. 
SAM: Probably go tonight, I wouldn't get too drunk. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: But maybe a sipsies. 
LAURA: A sipsies. 
LIAM: A sipper. 
SAM: A sip. 
LAURA: Teeny-weeny. 
MATT: It definitely has a grit sediment on the bottom of the jugs. 
LAURA: Oh, that's not acceptable. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Did we just poison ourselves? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Always, technically. 
SAM: As we drink and talk, I'm going to see if I can't pull Dorian away to a little private corner or something. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Hey, just curious for some advice. You seem to know these folks and get along with all of them so well. I get the impression that some of them don't trust me. 
ROBBIE: Oh-- 
SAM: Maybe it's because I've sworn myself to the prince of devils, but-- (laughter) 
ROBBIE: You also compulsively lie. 
SAM: I don't, though. Most of what I say-- 51% of what I say is absolutely true. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, honestly, I don't know if it matters. I used to lie a lot, too, and they still seem to like me, pretty much. 
SAM: So how did you do that? How do you get-- I guess my question is, how do you earn trust with these people? What can I do to make myself part of the furniture? 
ROBBIE: Hmm, I think step one, you have to stop trying to fuck everyone. 
SAM: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Can I pick a few, though? (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Actually, I think that's the key to long-term success. (laughter) 
SAM: I found it the opposite. 
ROBBIE: Oh really? 
SAM: I mean, so I play the statistics game. 
ROBBIE: Okay. No, do tell. 
SAM: If you just try to fuck everything, and you have like a 8% success ratio, you do pretty well. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: All right, but we're talking about earning their trust and becoming friends with them, not fucking them all. 
SAM: Yes, you're right, you're right. Yeah, those are two different goals, I see that now. 
ROBBIE: They were my instincts in the beginning, too, yeah. Okay, so step one, if we just go with this, don't try to fuck everyone. 
SAM: Great. 
ROBBIE: Just alternate. Pick a few. And then I think-- 
MARISHA: Alternate. Pick a few? 
SAM: Sure, sure. 
MARISHA: What advice! 
ROBBIE: And then I think-- 
LIAM: Just two a day. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Eenie meenie. 
ROBBIE: Honestly? I don't know. I've just been winging it this entire time. I mean it from the bottom of my heart, it just sort of happened naturally. You can't force it. If it's not there, it's not there. 
SAM: But I want to force it. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, well-- (laughter) All right, I'll have to-- 
SAM: The trust thing. 
ROBBIE: -- think about this more. 
SAM: The trust thing! 
ROBBIE: I understand. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Listen, I'm not going to let you dig yourself into this hole, I'll help you get out, by digging deeper. Let's go deeper. I don't know, I think you're doing pretty well. They're a good group. Do you trust them? 
SAM: Oh, I mean, I hardly know them. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I don't think I've ever done this. Insight check. (laughter) 
MATT: All right, so you roll insight. You roll either deception or persuasion. You don't have to say which, and just give the number. 
SAM: This is not a good roll. 
ROBBIE: First whatever. Oh, not great, 12 plus one. 
SAM: 21. 
ROBBIE: Gah! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Do you trust them? 
SAM: I'm starting to, I mean, it seems like they-- Great things happen to them, weirdly. It also, it struck me as interesting. Everyone was talking earlier, myself included, about saying goodbye before this mission. You know, say all your goodbyes. 
ROBBIE: Sure, sure. 
SAM: And have a mock funeral or whatever. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
SAM: Then I realized, for me anyway, I don't really have anyone to say goodbye to. And from what I gather from most of them I don't think they do either. 
ROBBIE: Hmm, that's pretty insightful. 
SAM: But they do have each other and they put their faith in each other and trust each other. I guess that's why I was sort of hoping to fast track that for myself. 
ROBBIE: All right, all right. 
SAM: But I have a plan. 
ROBBIE: You have a plan? 
SAM: Unless you have some sage advice. 
ROBBIE: No, no, I can pause on it until I hear your plan. 
SAM: Okay, here's my plan, you tell me if it's bad. 
ROBBIE: I'm so honored that you are trusting me with this. 
SAM: You're the wisest one among them. 
ROBBIE: You are correct. (laughter) 
SAM: And charming, I see a lot of myself in you. 
ROBBIE: Anyway... 
SAM: Anyway. The short one, Orenthal. 
ROBBIE: Oh, well, there are two short ones, but all right. 
SAM: The one that we care about, Orym. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Go on, go on. 
SAM: Orym. 
ROBBIE: Yes, yes. 
SAM: Orym seems to be very deliberate, very convicted. He's hard to sway. I figure if I can sway him to my side, if I can gain his trust somehow. Win him over. The others will fall. 
ROBBIE: Fall? 
SAM: Fall, I mean, fall. 
ROBBIE: Hold on, fall, or--? 
SAM: I mean, boy, I'm so used to talking Evil that I don't know how to talk Good. 
ROBBIE: I understand that, but I can still roll with you. Reframe it, reframe it for me. 
SAM: Once I win his trust. 
ROBBIE: Certainly. 
SAM: The others' distrust of me will perish in a wall of fire. 
ROBBIE: Yes, now I understand. (laughter) That's clear, that's clear. 
SAM: It will vanquish their distrust of me and leave it bleeding at the side of the road. 
ROBBIE: Of course, of course. I think you can smite them all, but I would say that is a plan, but if there's anyone among them who could stand up against your mighty deceit, it's probably that little man's strength and honor. If you choose to do this, you can. I assume it'll be in kind of a fun way. 
SAM: I was thinking of just painting a nice picture of him. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that's great. 
SAM: Okay. 
ROBBIE: It won't be easy, but I do think he is the best of us and I think he leads us in a way he doesn't know. 
SAM: I think you're right. I won't try to fuck everybody. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
SAM: But I might still try to fuck him. 
ROBBIE: We'll talk about that later. 
SAM: Okay. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: I do have, remember that piece of sage advice we put a pin in? 
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Okay. I want to back it up, I want to rewind. Pitch you a new step one. 
SAM: Okay? 
ROBBIE: It's one thing that I noticed. You say a lot of "Them. Them, them, them. How do I win them over? How do I?" 
SAM: Yes, because I'm me and they're them. 
ROBBIE: Maybe that's the trick. Maybe if you start to think of "them" as "us," you'll have a real chance at it. 
SAM: Hmm, not just-- You mean use those words but also believe it. 
ROBBIE: Feel it in your heart. I know it's tough being the new guy and it took me a while, too, but they'll let you in if you open yourself up to them. I don't think it's you and them anymore. I think it's just us. 
SAM: All right. I will heed your sage advice. And I thank you so much. I appreciate you. 
ROBBIE: Best of luck at smiting our distrust. 
SAM: I will. I will pull it out by the lungs and stomp on it. Oh, and we just hit our anniversary. 
ROBBIE: What anniversary? 
SAM: 100 hours I've known you. 
ROBBIE: 100 hours! (laughter) Aw, that's so special. I didn't get you anything, I'm sorry. 
SAM: That's all right, that's all right. Let's go drink some more poo water. 
ROBBIE: That sounds nice. (laughter) 
MATT: Anybody else have any business as you wait? 
MARISHA: Imogen? 
LAURA: Hmm? Yeah? 
MARISHA: I'm just wondering, I don't know, this could be our last time. Should we send a message-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: -- and say goodbye to Zhudanna? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh Jesus. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Zhudanna! 
SAM: (Zhudanna) Who is this? (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah, I definitely should keep using up all my spell slots. 
MARISHA: I know, I just-- 
LAURA: No, yeah, we should. 
MARISHA: I don't know. I hope that all the gold we gave her. 
LAURA: Here's the thing, I do want to do that. 
MARISHA: Do you really? 
LAURA: But at the same time, what if she's dead? I don't want to know it-- 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
LAURA: I don't want to know it going in. What if she's already-- 
MARISHA: She could be dead. 
LAURA: She could be dead. 
MARISHA: Wait, let me see if I can sense her beyond the grave. Can I sense Zhudanna's spirit? 
LAURA: Trailing you around? 
MARISHA: Wait, can I use my void puppet, my Screaming Spirit ability, and be like: Zhudanna! 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: Roll a d20 for me. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: What if you accidentally kill her right now? What if she's teetering on the edge and you suck her soul out? 
MARISHA: That's not how it works! You have to be dead, I think. 
MATT: Just a little push. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Just a little push. 
LIAM: She's just shallow breathing in her sleep. 
ROBBIE: Cat's already sleeping in her bed. 
MARISHA: Natural 19 on the d20. 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
MATT: Okay. She does not apparate. 
LAURA and ROBBIE: (gasp) 
TALIESIN: She's got better shit to do with her death. 
LAURA: She's alive. She's alive. 
MARISHA: I think she's still alive. 
MATT: If you had rolled a one... (laughs) 
MARISHA: I would have killed her? 
LAURA: She might have killed her? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Well, you wouldn't have killed her. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
MATT: Time would have. And the dice, and you. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I don't, you know-- Only, are we resting? 
LAURA: That's what I don't know. 
MARISHA: I don't either. 
MATT: I mean, this is a short rest, if anything as you guys are just gathering yourself and waiting for the other troop to arrive. 
MARISHA: I'm sure she's fine. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. She's-- 
LAURA: Let's just send a little mental prayer out to her. 
MARISHA: Okay, that sounds good. 
LAURA: Okay. Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. I'll-- 
LAURA: Okay, I'll hold your hands. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Watching this is bizarre. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (mystically) Oh, Zhudanna. (snickering) 
LAURA: I hope-- 
MARISHA: I hope-- 
LAURA: -- you got so much tea. 
MARISHA: -- you got so much macaroni. 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Hoping you're-- 
MARISHA: Zhudanna. 
LAURA: -- making little pots. 
MARISHA: I hope your crocheting is going so well. 
SAM: Do you know her? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's a scattershot of options. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Tea, crochet, pottery. 
ROBBIE: What do I remember about this character? (laughter) (laughter) 
LIAM: ♪ Oh Zhudanna ♪ 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's good. I think she'll get it. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. 
MARISHA: She'll get it on the wind. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to saunter over to Dorian-- 
SAM: Everybody wants Dorian. 
TALIESIN: -- with the good liquor. 
ROBBIE: Where did you get that? 
TALIESIN: It's mine. I always have good stuff. 
ROBBIE: Wow. Yeah, fuck yeah, come here. Using my little cape to hide it. Take a little nip. Woo! Oh, that is pungent. It's strong, but it's nice, it's good, thank you. 
TALIESIN: You seem different. Are you okay? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Yeah, I feel all right. Speaking of seeming different. 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to, I'm trying something else, yeah. I'm trying not to be quite as much of a dick. 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I wanted to say goodbye to people and I suddenly realized that I just, the list of people I thought I was going to say goodbye to are really just a list of people I wanted to apologize to. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
TALIESIN: That was really just for me, not for them, to make me feel better before going to do whatever the fuck we were doing. It might've just pissed them off to hear from me. So it just seemed pretty selfish. So, eh, fuck it. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, sorry I was a shit to you when we first met, too. 
ROBBIE: Ah, it's all right. 
TALIESIN: Nah, it really isn't. 
ROBBIE: Maybe not. 
TALIESIN: It really isn't. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I don't know. Do you like your family? 
ROBBIE: What? 
TALIESIN: Do you like your family? 
ROBBIE: Do I like my family? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Well sure. Yeah. They're great. 
TALIESIN: I have a difficult time believing in good parents. 
ROBBIE: Good parents? 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
ROBBIE: Hmm, that's a tough one. Yeah. We have a lot of conversations about fate. None more telling than who birthed you, so. 
TALIESIN: Well, you're-- I don't know how to be nice about it, you're irritatingly well-adjusted. 
ROBBIE: Oh, I'm getting there. It takes time, but I don't know that I'm there. I'm not. Give me that again, please. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. More. 
ROBBIE: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: I've been, I don't know. I've been trying to... You're someone I feel like I could actually apologize properly to, because I was just, I didn't have enough time to be a real shit to you. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: But Orym doesn't talk, but your friend, the one we saw. 
ROBBIE: Oh, Opal? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Sure. 
TALIESIN: I'm worried we're going to see her. 
ROBBIE: We may, or may not, I don't know. 
TALIESIN: What was she like? 
ROBBIE: (exhales) (chuckles) Young, impetuous, trying to prove herself. (sighs) Lost, maybe. 
TALIESIN: Is that what happened? 
ROBBIE: Well, she might've been the easiest of us to corrupt, but I don't believe that she's fully gone. You know what that's like, right? Something inside you, pulling you one direction or the other. 
TALIESIN: I-- I was given a thousand reasons to not trust anybody in my life to not trust anybody in my life and not a lot of good reasons to trust anybody in my life. I'm learning. 
ROBBIE: Hmm. Would it be the greatest tragedy if you became more likable? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wow. That's a way to say it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'd certainly... I'd like to like me. 
ROBBIE: Well, I do. The funny part is, that's true, it's true, I always have. 
TALIESIN: Really? 
ROBBIE: Of course. 
TALIESIN: Are you okay? 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
ROBBIE: I'm better than I've ever been. 
TALIESIN: I don't think-- It's a very short list of people who've ever said that to me. 
ROBBIE: Well, make it a longer list. 
TALIESIN: I hope we can save your friend. I'll be there to help, I just, I wanted to, I don't know, I want a picture of her in my head. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Why do you feel guilty wanting to say goodbye? 
TALIESIN: Because it's not really goodbye. I said goodbye to them, I-- 
ROBBIE: Are you scared? 
TALIESIN: Oh, always. Yeah, you get angry, you blame somebody. It's not their fault, you just figure, don't think about it enough to figure out it's your fault, and you fuck everything up. You piss them all off. They try and do good things for you, it doesn't fucking matter. And you hurt them. Maybe the best thing to do is, maybe the best apology is not to apologize, is just to stay the fuck away. Even if-- Yeah, there was just no part of me that thought it was going to make it better for them. It was just going to make me feel better. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. That sounds like the old Ashton talking to me. 
TALIESIN: If we survive-- 
ROBBIE: Sure. 
TALIESIN: -- I will apologize. 
ROBBIE: You know what might even be better than that? You were talking about good parents. My mother once told me that the act of giving a gift isn't for the person who receives it, it's for the giver. So maybe if you let yourself receive the gifts So maybe if you let yourself receive the gifts that your friends have been trying to give you for a long time, you can do them a service just by opening yourself up a tiny bit to receive them. Anyway, thanks for the booze, buddy.

LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we could get down to the front door. We can meet them on the front porch.

LAURA: (Jester) I still don't understand why we couldn't land in Vasselheim, I heard there's a bar in the butthole of the titan. 
MARISHA: (Beau) Wait, are these the fucking rookies we got to roll with? This fucking sucks, man. 
LAURA: No, they look cool. That one's floating. 
ASHLEY: (Yasha) Yeah, but some of them are very small. Like, look at the shadow of all of them, it's a weird... 
SAM: (Veth) (gasps) 
TALIESIN: (Caduceus) Most people-- 
LAURA: Nothing wrong with being small. 
TALIESIN: Most people are very small. 
LIAM: (Orym) We can hear you! 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
LIAM: Hi! 
LAURA: Veth, you're married, stay true. 
ASHLEY: Calm down. 
SAM: Yes, but, I mean, my fucking son is an asshole. My fucking husband just, he doesn't want to punish him at all for running off with you fuckers. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but, no-- 
TALIESIN: That's 20 words, you've run out of message for complaining about your kid. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) This really couldn't be worse. You know minotaurs are her weakness. 
MARISHA: Caduceus. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Do you have any Revivifies prepped because that guy looks like he's going to keel over dead, literally any moment. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: He looks like he's already dead. 
TALIESIN: There's not enough Revivify for that. 
ASHLEY: How is he going to be-- 
LAURA: What a cute little old man that is! 
TRAVIS: I'm sure he's not part of that group. I'm sure he's just like the-- 
ASHLEY: He's probably the inn keeper. 
LAURA: Hi! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I was thinking. 
LAURA: Hi! 
LIAM: (Caleb) We are the Mighty Nein. 
ASHLEY: Hello. 
LAURA: Nice to meet you. 
LIAM: We are called the Mighty Nein. 
LAURA: I run up. 
LIAM: Good to see see you again, some of you. 
LAURA: I run up to the little old man. Hello, I'm Pirate Jester, nice to meet you. 
MARISHA: (laughs) You're a pirate! 
TRAVIS: (Chetney) You're a pirate? 
LAURA: Yes, I am. 
TRAVIS: This is incredible. That's very nice. You're beautiful. 
LAURA: (gasps) Thank you so! He's really nice, you guys! Nice to meet you. 
TRAVIS: Well, of course I am. This is Bells Hells. Welcome to our lakefront estate. We are the owners and proprietors. 
ASHLEY: This is your inn, you take care of this inn? 
TRAVIS: Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Actually, this particular-- 
MARISHA: (Laudna) This is ours. 
TRAVIS: -- place is a B&B run by Fearne. Fearne, introduce yourself. 
ASHLEY: (Fearne) Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, my name is Professor Princess Fearne Calloway, Fey Scion of the Ancient Flame, at your service. 
MARISHA: You're adding princess? 
LAURA: Wow! 
MARISHA: I didn't know you were adding princess. 
ASHLEY: Sometimes I add princess. 
LAURA: Nice to meet you, I'm Pirate Jester. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: (Fjord) Jester, you don't have to be a pirate every time. 
LAURA: Best cleric to the most wonderful Traveler that ever lived and basically the ruler of all of the seas. 
TRAVIS: She's a princess and professor! 
TALIESIN: Is this what it's like meeting us? 
TRAVIS: I think so. 
LAURA: You look amazing. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, you're amazing. 
TALIESIN: This is a dark mirror. 
LAURA: You're so beautiful. 
LIAM: How long has she been doing the pirate thing? 
TRAVIS: A couple of years, but only when she feels like she needs to impress, which is very strange. 
LIAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: So wait, you all are the Mighty Nein. Why are there only seven of you? 
MATT: And that's where we're going to finish this episode. (laughter) 
MATT: We'll pick up there next week. (laughter and cheering) 
TALIESIN: This is going to be chaos! 
MATT: I am so happy right now! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What are we-- How are we-- 
MATT: (maniacal laugh) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What?! 
MARISHA: This is going to be insane! 
MATT: (maniacal laugh) 
TALIESIN: (Sméagol) We like the hobbits. (Gollum) No, kill the hobbits! 
MARISHA: There's already too many people at this table and we just doubled it. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
ASHLEY: No. 
SAM and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
LIAM: But that's all the less that Matt has to talk. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's so hard. I felt my brain bifurcating. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes. 
LIAM: Look at the schadenfreude on his face. 
SAM: We should have flags. 
MATT: Mm. It tastes so good. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
LAURA: We should! 
SAM: Flags that go up. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Genuinely, that's actually a really a good idea. 
MATT: That's really a good idea, actually. We'll figure something out before the next session now that we've thrown this chaos in. 
MARISHA: I think I have a bunch, because we ordered a lot of these, so maybe we could just have-- 
TALIESIN: We can't all be shadow daddy! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Damn it! (laughter) 
LIAM: What if we do that Halloween costume thing where one side of my face I'll have a beard-- 
SAM: Sure. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: -- and this is clean shaven. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's a good idea. 
TALIESIN: Every time I'm Caduceus, I'll have to talk over here, though. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Anyway, yeah. 
MATT: We'll figure something out. Anyway, thank you all so much for joining us. Excited for this chaos next time. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)

Cooldown[]
MARISHA: Holy Heck!
TALIESIN: Oh, no!
SAM: Oh boy.
MARISHA: Holy heckin' balls.
MATT: Oh man.
TALIESIN: I really didn't think about how weird that was going to be.
TRAVIS: You madman.
SAM: How are we going to do this?
LAURA: I don't know. I'm so nervous.
TRAVIS: Just like we did.
ROBBIE: You just did it.
TRAVIS: Just like--
MATT: You literally just did it.
SAM: It's too-- but it's too hard! (laughter)
ROBBIE: No.
LAURA: Matt just wants us to feel his pain.
TRAVIS: You might be hard. For yourself.
SAM: I'm going to fuck myself.
TRAVIS: I'm going to fuck myself!
ROBBIE: You just wait and see.
LIAM: The whole decade's been preparing for this moment.
SAM: It's all been leading up to this. I'm ready.
TRAVIS: Can I fuck myself on camera?
SAM: I'm going to RP the whole thing.
MARISHA: I love that Caleb went, "Remember you have a husband," but your first words were, "But my son's an asshole."
SAM: They're both the same.
MATT: Veth's in a rough place, apparently. Poor Dorian, thrown in the middle of this chaos.
ROBBIE: It feels like I don't know where I am.
SAM: So wait. So you're not with the Mighty Nein. You're not playing a character there.
ROBBIE: Nope.
LAURA: Okay.
ROBBIE: I will be your waypoint.
LAURA: Your sane? Yeah.
ROBBIE: I will be your anchor of sanity.
MARISHA: You're the anchor.
TALIESIN: You're going to be the point of order that the audience can rely on.
ROBBIE: Yeah, sure, I'm the reliable narrator.
TALIESIN: Sorry.
ROBBIE: Totally. I can't wait to learn Campaign Two's lore. What the fuck are your names?
TALIESIN: You kind of have already.
MATT: It's perfect.
ASHLEY: Yes, we'll introduce ourselves.
SAM: If it ever gets confusing, Dorian can just be like, "I think what Chetney's trying to say--"
MARISHA: Honestly, next episode should just be a Dorian episode. We'll all take the backseat.
ROBBIE: Yeah, sure. I'll just stare into the camera and hyperventilate for four hours.
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
LIAM: Speaking of backseat, we've finally eclipsed the smut shop with a giant a-hole. We willed it into existence.
LAURA: You drew the best picture of it, though.
TALIESIN: I was trying not to say anything because it was so great.
LIAM: I drew it just for you all.
SAM: Take a picture with the social phone.
LIAM: No, I don't want to do that.
ASHLEY: Oh, he doesn't want to.
LAURA: It really is a work of art.
MATT: Oh, he's turning pink.
ASHLEY: It's really good. It's really good.
TRAVIS: It's super tight. Tight, tight, tight.
ASHLEY: It's not what I was picturing in my mind, but I like it.
LAURA: No, it's not what I was picturing.
TALIESIN: No, it was definitely not what I was picturing.
LAURA: I was picturing more titan ass cheek. I thought-- You know what I mean?
ASHLEY: I pictured like a... (indicates a round shape)
LAURA: I pictured the Shank was going to be like inside a little bit more, less just right there.
SAM: Was it?
LIAM: Yeah, like a long--
LAUR: At least according to his illustration, it is right there up--
SAM: It was a long tube--
LIAM: This is an artistic interpretation.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was thinking like a long tube--
MATT: It was one of those--
TRAVIS: Picture the tube goes up to your mouth.
ROBBIE: I won't show it.
MATT: Oh my god. It was definitely one of those alley bars where it's like you're going through Golden Guy or something and there's just a row of people to sit.
TRAVIS: It's mid ass.
LAURA: Oh yeah.
MARISHA: Oh wait, oh, did you send?
ROBBIE: Yeah.
SAM: Oh, you texted it to us.
ROBBIE: That makes sense.
TRAVIS: Oh wow.
TALIESIN: You really went for it.
LAURA: It's a really good illustration.
LIAM: I was listening.
TRAVIS: That thing took some time.
LIAM: And arting, yes.
MATT: It's funny--
MARISHA: Wait, is the titan bent over?
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yep, sure is.
SAM: Is that something leaking out of its asshole?
LAURA: It's a little--
LIAM: That's like an elevator.
SAM: A dingleberry?
LAURA: Yeah, a dingleberry elevator.
ROBBIE: He picking up the soap factory.
MATT: I love the idea of this massive titan, the terrifying end of Campaign One, and it was locked frozen forever in place at the sealing of the Whispered One, and it wasn't swinging and destroying buildings, it dropped its wallet and is full on doing the, "Oops!"
LIAM: I thought of it in a three-point landing like this.
TALIESIN: It still has a terrifying--
ROBBIE: "Not like this!"
TALIESIN: It was doing the Spiderman.
MARISHA: Revisionist history.
MATT: It's funny. In all the chaos that I tried to-- I didn't spend too much time thinking of what would actually happen when these two groups came together, just knowing it would be ridiculous, and looking for the moment in which it was going to happen, the minute that Fearne and Jester shook hands, I was like, "Oh, no."
ASHLEY: I know, I was like this is--
LAURA: Everything!
ASHLEY: This is all of it.
MATT: This is bad.
ASHLEY: This is going to be really intense
LAURA: (Jester) Everything we ever could dream of. And more!
ASHLEY: So much fun!
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a good one.
MARISHA: I'm really excited. Insane.
MATT: It's a good thing you are all the most talented and important infiltration professional team to be on this mission.
SAM: Seal Team Six.
TRAVIS: On both sides.
LIAM: (Caleb) Seal Team Nein.
TRAVIS: The titan vision with the green gem in the eye. Did you shove it in your eye, or--
TALIESIN: I didn't.
LAURA: Yeah, what did you do with it?
TALIESIN: I was about to, and then I just looked into it trying to figure out-- I debated shoving it into my eye.
LAURA: So it just disappeared after your vision ended? Yeah, okay.
TRAVIS: Is that familiar imagery to us from any other campaign for any other reason? 
MATT: No, that's a glance at the before times.
TRAVIS: (to Marisha) You and I had multiple, "Wait, wait, wait."
MARISHA: I know, I know.
MATT: No, that was a glance at parts of the world pre-Pantheon.
LAURA: That's a good Spiderman.
MATT: And the perspective of the world according to elemental lords and ladies.
TRAVIS: The dawn.
MATT: Yeah. Just a little glimmer in that. That was all purely improvised, but it was--
TALIESIN: Well done. 
MATT: I was like, "Okay, let's see where this goes." But yeah, it was just-- at the very least, hopefully just a little bit of a glance into the alien perspective of the things that came before the gods.
LIAM: Well, that's interesting.
MATT: And what kind of exists within you. 
LIAM: As you always say, history is-- Well, not you. People say, we say that history is written by the victors and the titans were not the victors.
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: So we're seeing what happened to people who were vanquished.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was just trying to get a little bit of language for the notion that the world will continue to be spinning as long as there is some outcome to what happens. It's not going to-- That there is a version of the world that survives this one way or the other.
TRAVIS: If there are no gods to hold them down, I'm sure they would regenerate, regrow, whatever, by that cycle, right?
ROBBIE: Interesting, though, that you would ask the titans what to do. I thought that was so interesting. Because the gods-- you're sort of like this fuck the gods guy.
LAURA: Anti-gods. But you're like, "But you, Greater Entity, tell me."
ROBBIE: Yeah, there it is. Oh, this is mine.
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's the difference-- I was thinking about that. But yeah, it's the difference between the feeling of being small in front of someone rather than being small in front of everything. Is really what happened, which is instead of having the feeling of smallness and raging at this big person, it was, "I'm in the middle of this." I didn't feel separated from it.
ROBBIE: They presented themselves as nature. It's like people who say that "Hiking is my church."
TALIESIN: Wow, now I feel dirty.
ROBBIE: Sorry! I'm that person. Sorry, I'm sorry.
TALIESIN: It's very much-- it was more feeling the place in the cosmos rather than actual people going, "Oh, it's you." And you're like, "Fuck."
TRAVIS: Dude, the Kryn Dynasty coming in. I love it.
LAURA: So cool.
TALIESIN: That never goes poorly.
TRAVIS: Double agents.
SAM: We're celebrities.
MATT: It's a lot of investment in your troupe's success.
LAURA: Yeah, don't fuck it up.
MATT: Don't forget who invested in you when you're done.
TALIESIN: A double TPK? A double TPK is actually a thing.
LAURA: I mean, it's totally possible.
TRAVIS: I just got to give--
TALIESIN: We could lose more characters than players.
MATT: Wipe out two campaigns at once? Yes! Let's go!
LIAM: The world is like, "We're really sending the Suicide Squad? Okay, let's outfit them."
LAURA: Let's double it up. Two Suicide Squads.
TALIESIN: Horrifyingly true.
TRAVIS: Plus it can't just be us. Let's be honest. Lez be honest. There's going to be a couple other things, I'm sure, in the works.
TALIESIN: I am so curious to see how these two groups of people--
SAM: I am, too.
TALIESIN: I'm trying to, as Caduceus, I'm trying to figure out who I really want to prod.
ASHLEY: Spend some time with?
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: That was disorienting.
TALIESIN: It was very disorienting.
LIAM: Trying to imagine the two personalities on Travis's face, Marisha's face. Going around the table.
SAM: It's also going to be so challenging for Matt, honestly, and possibly for the audience, but it's going to be challenging because every single character I want to see interact with every single other character, because they're going to be so interesting.
LAURA: The combos are too--
SAM: But it's the math of that, there's not enough time. We won't ever get to it.
MATT: It's a shame that there's a ticking clock that's going to keep you moving towards the goal.
LAURA: It felt very dreamlike, though, because as we're playing as certain characters, you're seeing through their eyes, so you're seeing the world through their eyes, like first person. Then suddenly have that out of body experience and look at yourself is so fucking weird.
MATT: I don't know what that's like at all.
LAURA: I mean, but I've never experienced it. It must be insane for you all the time.
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Wow.
MATT: I love it.
TRAVIS: The overlay of relationships between the two groups? Like (whoosh).
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I think flags are actually a really-- or like some sort of little thing we can flip that's a color code or something.
LAURA: (Jester) You don't think you'll be able to tell just from the voices who it is?
MARISHA: We will abandon that so fucking fast.
ASHLEY: I won't remember that.
TALIESIN: At least the posture was changing with everybody.
MATT: I will say if you have a clothing item that you could-- With Caleb, you could throw a scarf over the shoulder or something. I don't know. This is all just a little bit of chaos to throw in here, and the good news is you guys will be traveling together for this infiltration mission. It shouldn't take too long, right? Maybe?
LAURA: Unless we keep stretching it because we're having too much fun.
MATT: Which is also viable.
SAM: It'll be four or five episodes at least.
MARISHA: I'm also admittedly thinking of our Post team and all the name plates. They're going to be like, "Ah, fuck. Ah, fuck! Ah! Fuck!"
TRAVIS: Boom! Boom! Boom! They should just rotate them like "Price is Right".
MATT: That might be the way to do it. Sorry, guys.
MARISHA: Sorry, Taylor. Sorry, Tal.
TRAVIS: My god, I can't wait. I got to brush up my character sheet.
MARISHA: Sorry, Max.
MATT: Yeah, guys, you got a little bit of time to get ready for the next stage of chaos in this. I'm excited.
TRAVIS: Good job, Matty.
MATT: All right, good job, you all. Let's go home.
