MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. 
ALL: We play Dungeons & Dragons! 
LIAM: (ridiculous scream) 
MATT: I almost made it through. Huh? (laughs) Before we jump into our episode tonight, we do have some quick announcements to get through. Including our sponsor this evening, Czepeku. 
LAURA: Czepeku. 
MATT: Just to be clear, Sam, Ashley. They have made some cologne and perfume spoof ads in the past. But Czepeku actually makes maps. So Sam, tell us about them. 
SAM: Maps, that's right, Matt. Looking for high quality fantasy maps for your next D&D, Pathfinder, or dare I say, Daggerheart campaign? 
ALL: Ooh! 
LAURA: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
SAM: Get your hands on more than 4,000 stunning hand-drawn fantasy battle maps that will take your role playing games to the next level. You can access the full archive for just $5 per month and buy individual maps at Czepeku.com. 
MATT: Right, maps. Not cologne. Not perfume, right, Sam? 
SAM: Yeah... but still... 
ASHLEY: I mean... 
MATT: Come on! 
SAM: It's just that me and Ashley are so, how would you say it? Sexy? 
ASHLEY: Sexy? 
SAM: Sexy. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, we ooze sensuality, Matt. I mean, it would really just be a shame, I think, to deprive our audience of just like-- 
SAM: I agree. 
ASHLEY: -- one more perfume commercial. 
SAM: Just one more. 
MATT: It makes no sense! 
SAM: No! 
ASHLEY: Yes, it does. 
SAM: But does love make sense, Matt? Does passion? No, but with maps by Czepeku, it doesn't need to make sense. It just needs to make. 
ASHLEY: Sense. (laughter) We're going to finish each other's... 
SAM: Sandwiches. 
ASHLEY: Sentences. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It just makes sense. So just roll it, just roll it. Just show it, show it! 
MATT: No, no, no! ♪ (sensual music) ♪ 
SAM: Maps for Him by Czepeku. ♪ (romantic orchestral music) ♪ 
SAM: Original and outlandish themes beautifully crafted. Enter a world of passion and seduction. 
ASHLEY: Maps for Her by Czepeku. ♪ (sensual orchestral music) ♪ 
ASHLEY: Choose the master cartographer level and get the maps of your fantasies. 
SAM: Use them on VTTs, consume a feast for the eyes. Oh! (crashes) 
ASHLEY: Or immerse your players in a truly tactile experience. 
SAM: (animalistic grunt) Maps for Him. 
ASHLEY: Maps for Her. 
SAM: Maps-- 
ASHLEY and SAM: -- for Them. ♪ (romantic orchestral music) ♪ 
ASHLEY and SAM: By Czepeku. 
SAM: (Wayne's World shimmering) And we're back. 
MATT: But... But why, though? 
SAM: Does it matter, Matt? Join the community at their Patreon. Choose your membership level and get your adventchez. Adventchez? Get ya adventchez started.

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So, last we left off, Bells Hells, after returning to finding your west encampment in the middle of the Hellcatch Valley destroyed, you escaped to Vasselheim where you encountered not just Keyleth, but many of the higher up movers and shakers of Exandria had gathered to discuss how to deal with the coming threat and the looming chaotic pinnacle of the Vanguard's plot. As part of this discussion, you yourself spoke with some of the familiar faces of which you had built a rapport with since this journey began and figured out a plan in hopes that it would be the one everyone could put themselves behind. You pitched this plan, this multi-pronged attack, utilizing the backdoor secret portal, the passage to Ruidus that you had discovered. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Sorry. 
LAURA: I didn't say anything. 
MATT: I know. 
ASHLEY: That was my bad. 
MATT: You don't have to say anything. (chuckling) 
MATT: It's a magical force. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
ASHLEY: I felt it. 
TALIESIN: (encompassing vibe) 
TRAVIS: The back door? 
MATT: Yeah. Where was I? (laughs) 
LIAM: You were hitting it from the back. Proceed. 
MATT: Thank you. Great. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: We love you. 
TALIESIN: That's what you get, fuckers. 
MATT: Just add hit points every time. (laughter) 
MATT: Upon beseeching all that had gathered within the Platinum Sanctuary to help you, Keyleth, the council, and the numerous other allies you had made to make this mission function. You sold your case, and most were convinced. As such, what you had decided upon is now being hatched as the initial plot against Ludinus and the Vanguard, which involves multiple groups of heroes from all across Exandria. Some being pulled from retirement, some being pulled from their current decrees, others being just sought after who've been missing for a while, until everything is aligned. Within a week, which is hopefully enough time, you are to all descend upon the Malleus Key, the Weave Mind, and the very core of Ruidus at the same time, with Bells Hells to be the key linchpin to head towards the center of that moon. After some chance encounters with some other interesting, powerful entities and a reunion with Dorian's father, you went to rest for the evening and consider what was to be had. After a discussion not too long before that, Imogen, with your mother, you had heard tale that a simulacrum of Ludinus was traveling with Lord Zathuda, the Sorrowlord Zathuda, to meet up with the Unseelie, who had been conspicuously absent since the destruction of the second Malleus Key. However, you also ran into a super fan of Chetney Pock O'Pea over here, and discovered, or I would say unraveled what appeared to be a community of super fans who have been collecting, cataloging, and essentially worshiping the grandiose, wonderful craftman legend that has walked alongside you. 
TRAVIS: Oh, stop. 
MATT: (laughs) After receiving a tour of his modest collection, you were allowed a room to sleep for the evening. As the rest of you gather your things and hole up within the guest chambers of the home of Scalebearer Waylon Amaredda, the night's rest is yours. So unless anybody needs to achieve anything over the night's rest, we can continue to the morning. Everyone good? 
LAURA: Do we need to send any messages to anyone? 
TRAVIS: I'm going to change an attunement. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: We mentioned maybe-- 
LIAM: Ira. 
MARISHA: -- reaching out to Ira. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: If we're going to go fuck with some Seelie, 
TALIESIN: Ira would be the one to talk to. 
SAM: (sneezes) 
MARISHA: Bless you, Braius. 
ASHLEY: Shh! 
TALIESIN: Stop it. 
ROBBIE: Gesund. 
LAURA: I forget, I should know how this spell works. Certainly used it enough. 
MARISHA: If it jumps beyond planes? 
LAURA: Yeah. "You can send the message across any distance, even to other planes of existence." 
SAM: Whoa. 
ROBBIE: Nice. I'm also going to attune to Pop's blade. 
MATT: You got it. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to switch mine over, too. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: All right, then I should try to send a message to Ira before we go to sleep. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LAURA: And say what? That we're on our way over? Help us fight the Unseelie? 
SAM: I think you should tell him about me, he's never met me. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, I'll be sure to do that. 
LIAM: Start with that. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Ask if-- 
TALIESIN: Tell him that the Unseelie might be aligning with his favorite person. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: True. 
TALIESIN: And that we're heading there to disrupt things and-- 
LAURA: Could use his help. All right. 
ROBBIE: And there's no chance this person will betray us or turn sideways? 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, I mean, there's-- 
ROBBIE: They're trustworthy? I don't know, I don't know them. You know, they're your friend, so. 
LAURA: Yeah, he's not really a friend. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
LAURA: But-- 
TRAVIS: He's like the worst person, basically. 
MARISHA: He's not the worst. 
ASHLEY: That's not-- 
LAURA: No, no, no. He's not the worst. 
ASHLEY: He's just a little more drastic. 
TRAVIS: Okay, everybody-- 
MARISHA: He's complicated. 
TRAVIS: -- that doesn't want to sleep with the Nightmare King can weigh in, okay? 
ROBBIE: Is he trustworthy, though? 
ASHLEY: Well... 
LAURA: No. 
TALIESIN: Absolutely not trustworthy. 
LAURA: I mean, he's fey. I don't know if you met a lot of fey. 
ROBBIE: Well-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, just like, just, just, just-- he's great, he's just a little hard to pin down. 
LIAM: He's a power player-- 
ASHLEY: But he's great. 
LIAM: -- in the Fey, and he likes us. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: For the most part. 
ROBBIE: He does, he likes you? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Hard to say. 
ROBBIE: But you don't like him. He sucks. 
LAURA: Yeah, well, the last time we saw him, everything blew up. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: But he helped you. 
ASHLEY: He did, he did. 
TALIESIN: He has-- 
ASHLEY: He did. 
TALIESIN: He has wants and desires and that makes him very easy to track. As long as we're doing things that coincide with his needs and desires, everything works out well. 
LAURA: All right. 
ROBBIE: So we're calling the one friend we have in the neighborhood. 
LAURA: Well, he might be on the moon. 
ROBBIE: Okay, all right. 
TRAVIS: We know one name in this town. 
LAURA: He might be on the moon, y'all. 
TRAVIS: He might. 
LIAM: Might? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, he might not even-- 
LAURA: I might not even be able to get this. 
TRAVIS: That won't stop him. 
LAURA: All right, I'm going to try to send it to him. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS: He's very creepy. 
LAURA: Who's going to help me? 
TALIESIN: In a fun way. 
LAURA: Who's helping me? 
TRAVIS: Are we assisting you? 
LAURA: Assisting me. 
ASHLEY: I can help. 
LAURA: With counting? 
ASHLEY: With counting? 
LAURA: With counting the words? 
LIAM: Oh, I got you. 
ASHLEY: Someone else is going to do that. 
TRAVIS: I got you. Oh, you got it. 
LIAM: Oh, you got it? 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: This is an old-- 
TRAVIS: Old hat. 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Guidance? 
LAURA: I'm going to send. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
LAURA: Send to-- 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Long time no see. Heading to the Unseelie Court. They may be working with your favorite person. Care to join us? It'll be fun. 
SAM: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: That's good. 
MARISHA: That's good. 
TALIESIN: That's real good. That's really good. 
MARISHA: Promising a good time. 
LIAM: That's the hook. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: We can already tell there's a response because Matt's making the face. 
LIAM: Chetney-- 
TRAVIS: Are you pooping? (laughter) 
LAURA: (grunts) It's so hard. 
TALIESIN: Are you having a movement? 
LIAM: (like Imogen) Yeah, are you pooping? 
LAURA: Are you pooping? 
TALIESIN: You pooping? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: It's 25 words, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: It doesn't take long for that dark, odd fey voice to slightly slither back into your mind. "Ah. Glad to see you're still alive. I've been keeping a low profile on Kreviris." 
MARISHA: (whispers) Kreviris. 
TRAVIS: We know where that is. 
MATT: "But if you want me to join, let me know where I'm most useful." 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
LAURA: All right. He's down to play. 
ASHLEY: Where is he right now? 
LAURA: Kreviris. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: I know that name. 
LAURA: I mean Ira's-- 
TRAVIS: Why do we know that name? 
MATT: Kreviris is the city of Ruidus. 
LAURA: -- but he's super powerful and he really dislikes her dad. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Athudashionus wiped out a bunch of names in my head. 
SAM: Okay. That's good. 
MATT: It does that. 
ASHLEY: That's good. 
SAM: Those are good things. 
TALIESIN: Probably the only person we know who actually has experience with the Unseelie. So that's why the name came up. Although, we should probably check that he's not going to be a problem dealing with them, that, you know, he's not going to draw undue attention to us, like he's got some sort of-- I don't know. 
TRAVIS: We should try and meet up outside of the target, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, not straight-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: So not at the Shrine of the Gilded Gifts, but in the town outside of it? Or has it overtaken that old town of Proven-- Dan Povenmire? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Pravenier. 
MATT: The shrine exists within the city of Pravenier. It's within the-- 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Pravenier, Chet. 
MATT: -- perimeter of it. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Keep up. 
ASHLEY: God. 
LAURA: C-POP. 
LIAM: Maybe we should see if he wants to meet up at Morri's. 
ASHLEY: That's an option. 
TALIESIN: Wouldn't say no to-- 
LIAM: Would that go down okay with Grandma? 
LAURA: They like each other. 
MARISHA: Weren't they an old fling? 
ASHLEY: (uncertain) Eh. 
LIAM: So would it go down? 
LAURA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: I think they were. I think they were, I don't know for sure. I mean, there were a couple times when I would like be in my room and sometimes hear things. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
LIAM: What'd it sound like? 
LAURA: Would it be like a threesome or what? 
MARISHA: Orym-- 
TALIESIN: Two and a halfsome, at the very least. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I can get into it if you want me to get into it, but. 
MARISHA: No. 
LAURA: I'm having too much fun just imagining. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Nana Morri's a good time. 
MATT: It's like watching a spider wrap up its prey. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus. Oh my god. (chuckling) 
TALIESIN: I like only seeing that much. I don't want to see the zipper on the monsters suit. I feel like that's too much. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: So tell him Nana Morri's? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Should we go to Nana? Did you go to Nana's? 
ROBBIE: I do not know who Nana is. 
ASHLEY: You were not at Nana's. 
LAURA: Oh, you're in for-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, we have to. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! You get to meet my Nana! 
MARISHA: Honestly, we have to go to Nana's just so that Dorian can see. 
LAURA: And Braius. 
TALIESIN: And Braius! 
ASHLEY: And Braius. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, you're here, too! 
ROBBIE: Yes, you've never met them before? 
SAM: No, I haven't. No. 
TRAVIS: Braius, have you been to the Fey Realm? 
SAM: I can't say that I have, actually, no. 
ASHLEY: Insight check. 
TRAVIS: And Dorian, anytime? 
MATT: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: We came close, but never went in. 
MATT: All right, so you roll deception or persuasion. 
LIAM: This is an auto win for Braius. 
SAM: Cocked. 
LAURA: That's good. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. he's got like a billion modifier. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 29. 
SAM: 23. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: Low for you. 
ASHLEY: Have you been to the Fey Realm? 
SAM: I have not been to the Fey Realm. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
SAM: No. 
TRAVIS: Listen, I'm going to tell you guys straight because these other dames are dizzy. (laughs) For the Nightmare King, Nana Morri's is fucked. It's a nightmare. It's absolutely psychotic. 
TALIESIN: It's amazing. 
TRAVIS: So just prep yourself. All right? 
LAURA: No-- 
TRAVIS: I mean, she's lovely and it's home, and the warm hearth and the yeah, yeah. There's like people gardens and shit. It's going to be bonkers. 
ASHLEY: It's artistic. 
SAM: Artistic? 
ROBBIE: I'm getting such different answers from both sides. 
ASHLEY: It's self expression. 
TRAVIS: I'm trying to tell you truth. 
ROBBIE: You say he's bad, you say he's cool. 
LAURA: Think about-- 
ROBBIE: They say she's great. 
ROBBIE: You know who you can trust. 
LAURA: -- Fearne here. It's like-- 
ASHLEY: You make up your own mind about it. 
LAURA: -- all of the best and also scariest things about Fearne. 
SAM: That sounds-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
SAM: -- like a lovely dichotomy. 
MARISHA: They have flesh curtains. 
ASHLEY: It's beautiful. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: That doesn't help anybody. 
TALIESIN: Thank you, thank you. Yes. 
TRAVIS: It's fucked up. 
ASHLEY: We're going to have amazing drinks. We're going to have amazing beds. 
TALIESIN: New kid has taste. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Unlike some people. 
ASHLEY: It'll be great. A wonderful, home cooked meal. 
LIAM: Between Ira and Nana Morri, we're going to have as good a shot as we can. 
LAURA: I think so. 
ASHLEY: I believe so. 
TRAVIS: I'll fill you in later. 
ASHLEY: I believe so. 
LAURA: All right. I'm going to send another message to Ira. 
TALIESIN: He's hitting on you. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: And say-- 
TALIESIN: You are-- Yeah. 
LIAM: I'll go. 
ASHLEY: I'm so excited. 
SAM: With this mirror... 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: All right, we're heading to Nana Morri's. See you there after we wake up. 
TRAVIS: Bitch. 
MARISHA: Bitch. 
MATT: "Ligament Manor, huh? (dark chuckles)" 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: "It has been some time." 
ASHLEY: (excited squeal) 
MATT: That's all. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
LAURA: That sounds-- 
TRAVIS: Ligament Manor. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Matchmaker, matchmaker ♪ ♪ Make me a match ♪ 
TRAVIS: Just telling you so we're clear. 
ROBBIE: Ligament? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ligament. 
ROBBIE: Not ligature, like on a woodwind. Ligament, like in your knees? 
TRAVIS: Yep, yep. 
TALIESIN: Like spearmint, ligament. 
TRAVIS: Like things you cut when you need to disable an enemy. 
LAURA: So then-- 
SAM: We sleep. 
LAURA: We sleep, we wake up, we go. 
TRAVIS: Wake up! 
SAM: We're there. 
TRAVIS: ♪ ("Chop Suey!" by System of a Down) 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Wait, but before we go to bed, I want to sneak to-- This is going to be very quick. 
MATT: Yeah, go for it. 
ASHLEY: I want to go over to Waylon for a moment. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. Waylon's in his own room. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: You guys are all in the guest room. 
ASHLEY: I'll knock on his door. 
MATT: Okay. "Hi." 
ASHLEY: I am so sorry to bother you. 
MATT: "That's okay, it's really early." 
ASHLEY: Yes, it is. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: So I just, I really wanted to know-- I really want to buy the egg, Chet's egg. 
MATT: "Oh." 
ASHLEY: What would you sell it for? I was considering stealing it, but I'm not going to. 
MATT: "Don't-- It's not for sale. I mean, theoretically it has a price, but to me, it's priceless." 
ASHLEY: Really? 
LAURA and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: "Yeah." 
ASHLEY: Okay, well, literally the only gold that I have in my pocket, I have 69 gold pieces. 
MATT: "Nice." 
ASHLEY: Would you consi-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Bravo. 
ASHLEY: Would you consider, and I would, I'm going to try to find the fifth egg. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) So fast. 
MATT: "Look, I--" 
ASHLEY: Please, is there anything I can give you in return? I made out with him. Okay? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) With the lean-in. 
MATT: "What?" 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: "Are you like a-- Are you and Chet--" 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Sort of like a-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Sort of in a relationship. 
MATT: "Wow." 
ASHLEY: Possibly marriage, I don't know. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Really?" 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: "Chetney Pock O'Pea is classically a man of the wind. He's been untethered--" 
ASHLEY: That's why I was thinking this could possibly be like a really nice present to give him. 
MATT: "The tales and stories of his conquests--" 
ASHLEY: Yes, I know. 
MATT: "-- spread to--" 
ASHLEY: All over. 
MATT: "Within our circles, at least." 
ASHLEY: All over, all over. The line of-- The body count is insane. 
MATT: "Wow. Sorry, I just-- Do you make things, too?" 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yes, I do. (laughter) 
MATT: "That makes a lot of sense then." 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's an artistic synergy that we have together. 
MATT: "It would have to be. I can't imagine anybody could tie him down unless they themselves were a force of--" 
ASHLEY: Can I have the egg? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm so tired. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I just want the egg and I want to go to bed. (laughter) 
MATT: "I can't sell it. But if you're this close with him, I might be willing to trade for anything that's a Chetney Pock O'Pea original that no one knows about." 
ASHLEY: Ooh. Well. 
MATT: "If you're this close to him. I mean--" 
ASHLEY: Listen. Listen, okay. He gave me a wolf, I'm not going to give you that, but he did make me some members of my family. I would give you, I could give you like the one that he made of me. You know, it's one of a kind. 
MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) This is a pretty high DC. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. (groans) That's a two. (groaning) 
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait, wait. Plus-- 15. 
MATT: 15. He goes, "I appreciate your interest. I really do--" 
ASHLEY: No, it's okay. 
MATT: "But this piece is sentimental beyond--" 
TRAVIS: PSA rating 9.8. 
MATT: "-- the known languages of Exandria. I mean, it's the centerpiece, it's the core that holds the rest of the collection together. It's the end of my presentation. Everyone I bring through, it's what I finish on." 
ASHLEY: That's what you finish with? 
MATT: "The whole story I've crafted is based on this piece." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's definitely finished. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: "I'm sorry." 
ASHLEY: No, really. I understand what it means to be a collector and have the main piece. Well, that's okay. 
MATT: "Well, thank you. I appreciate that." 
ASHLEY: I understand. Have a wonderful night. 
MATT: "Thank you. You too." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Good night. 
MATT: "All right." (door clicking) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to go take the egg. (laughter) 
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Alarm's going to go off, isn't it? 
ASHLEY: I mean, if I don't, I don't. 
TRAVIS: They just closed the door? 
MATT: They just closed the door. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to Guide myself. 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: That's cocked. That's cocked. I'm really sorry. 
LAURA: Ashley! 
ASHLEY: That was almost a natural 20, too. Okay. But look how good they're almost. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That was-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: "Look how good they're almost." 
ASHLEY: Okay. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That was said weird. Okay. 
LIAM: Dungeons & Dragons. 
MATT: That's her, "It has begin," shirt. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Guidance is decent. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, but look how close I was almost not speeding. 
ASHLEY: A d4. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: 17. 
TRAVIS: What my blood alcohol level is almost. 
MARISHA: Almost. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy! 
MATT: So as you approach the cabinet vessel that holds this egg within, you head towards the doors that open it and they're closed. They're not locked. There is a lock on it, but you see the lock hasn't been placed. He may have forgotten to do so in the intensity of being overwhelmed at the presence of such a legend. 
ASHLEY: Lucky me! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: You open it up inside and you can see there's the pedestal that the wooden egg sits upon. It's right there in front of you. 
ASHLEY: So I'm going to try to just take the gold, the 69 gold, and try to swap it out really quick. 
MATT: Okay. You weigh it, see the best you can. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You don't know what a wooden egg weighs. 
MATT: (snapping) The platform (whooshes) suddenly, the minute you begin to move the egg from it, these large metal latches (snapping) just arc around and affix your wrist to the top. You're holding the egg, but your wrist is now locked to the cabinet. 
ASHLEY: Waylon? (laughter) 
MATT: (hinge squeaking) "Yeah?" 
ASHLEY: I am so sorry. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I was going to try to just take it-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: -- but I'm not. It didn't work. I was going to leave a note, but I'm going to step away. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I just was so excited about it. I'm telling you, though. Look, I'm being so honest with you. (laughter) 
MATT: (footstep) 
SAM: Uh-oh! 
MATT: (footstep) 
ASHLEY: Hey, Waylon. You're kind of freaking me out. 
MATT: He begins to step towards you, here, in the still, nearly lightless base chamber of his collection, this pompadour just barely lit by the low embers of the nearby magical lantern light. You hear him beneath his breath. "It is through his light forgiveness and justice is maintained. It's through his light forgiveness and justice is maintained." He steps forward, the shadow just obscuring the top of his face as he looks up. "Not a problem! I can get you out of that--" 
SAM: Whoa! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: "Lickety-split." His hand reaches just beyond view underneath some sort of wooden lip on the side. (snapping) It unleashes your wrist. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
MATT: You pull your hand back and he immediately catches the egg from your grip and places it gingerly back down. 
ASHLEY: Fair enough. I just get a little overzealous. I'm so sorry. I'm so tired. I'm going to go to bed. Thank you so much. Good night. 
MATT: "Rest well. He's always watching." (quiet laughter) 
ASHLEY: Not sure who you're talking about, but yes. (quiet laughter) 
MATT: Closes the cabinet, touches his symbol of the Platinum Dragon around his neck, and then heads back to bed. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm just going to sneak in and go to bed. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I just-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (nervous noise) 
TRAVIS: That dude wears people skin. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: All righty. The morning greets you all as you awaken. 
LAURA: Are you dead? 
TRAVIS: Oh! I'm sure it's fine. 
MARISHA: I need to know right now! 
LAURA: I need to know right now if you're dead in this house! No! 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MARISHA: No, but I'm telling you, it's getting closer. 
TRAVIS: If I had made that change, that would've been it. 
ASHLEY: What was it? 
MARISHA: ♪ It's getting closer and closer ♪ 
TRAVIS: It was off by four. 
LAURA: (gasps) (laughter) 
MATT: Oh! 
ASHLEY: I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! 
TRAVIS: I think I'm entertaining making it in between 100 and my level. So, like 100 and 14. 
LAURA: When are you going to make that switch, though? 
TALIESIN: That's more than a one in 10 chance, by the way. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That is more than a one in 10 chance every day. 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: 100%! 
LIAM: Inevitability 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ROBBIE: He's old. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's old! This is taxing stuff. And think how valuable the collection will be after. 
ASHLEY: No! 
MARISHA: That's true. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's true. 
TALIESIN: You just have to make a bunch of stuff right now. 
LAURA: Do think any of us will ever find the egg in your butt? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I don't know what you're talking about. 
TALIESIN: I want to know, when we finally loot the body, how much of our gold is currently sitting in those pockets? Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: As you gather your things, you can smell the wafting scent of fresh bacon. It smells like steamed and maybe lightly fried vegetables. Just a nice, hearty breakfast that's being prepared in the other chamber. You hear Waylon's voice around the side, "Be right there! Almost ready! Don't worry!" Immediately comes around a minute later with number of plates and has a little apron on that has the Platinum Dragon on the front as well. He's like "(whistles). Okay." You can see one of his display tables has had its display moved off to the corner and now has a tablecloth over it, and he sets down a number of dishes to each of you as you sit around it. You can see like the meals are pretty nice, standard, hearty. When it comes to Chetney's, it is a grandiose collection of a Michelin star breakfast meal. "I have a friend of mine over in the Abundant Terrace, who manages to acquire these blessed vegetables and fruits within a very special grove blessed by the Wildmother. It's very expensive, but I pulled a favor last night, and I hope you like it." 
TRAVIS: I'll use my wolf nose to (sniffs). (sighs) Exquisite! 
MATT: "Enjoy! Enjoy! I'm so sorry, we're out," and handed you a plate that just has an old biscuit on it. 
SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I love biscuits! 
MATT: "Great." 
ASHLEY: It's my favorite, actually, so. 
TRAVIS: Would you like some, Fearne? 
ASHLEY: I would love some. 
TRAVIS: No. (food scarfing) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You know, they used to tell a story in Bassuras of the oldest person who ever lived in Bassuras. It was a elf. My god, they say, like, 400. Ate every meal was nothing but starchy potatoes, nothing else. Eventually, he had a little bit of rich food and that's what killed him. One meal, one meal of rich food. (slashing) 
SAM: Uh-oh! 
TALIESIN: Dropped right dead. 
TRAVIS: How likely is that, though? 
TALIESIN: Well. 
TRAVIS: As far as last meals go, though, hard to beat it. (laughter) 
MARISHA: That's a good point, you know. You should check for poison. 
TRAVIS: What? I smelled with my nose! 
MATT: "Absolutely not!" 
MARISHA: Just saying. As you said last night, more valuable once you're dead. 
TRAVIS: Listen, Señor Amaredda understands how important my continued works are. 
MATT: "Indeed! Not a worry!" Grabs his holy symbol out from underneath his apron, was goes, "Platinum Dragon, cleanse it of its possible impurities. This energy (whooshes) bursts and pulses out from the meal. It glows with a strange, beautiful golden light for a second before it slightly fades away, the sound of chimes in the distance. (chimes clinking) 
TALIESIN: Did you just cast Magical Judgment on breakfast? 
MATT: "I ensured that it was purified and free of any sort of toxins, poisons, to make sure that... I know my friend in the Terrace is trustworthy, but just to be sure and to make you feel comfortable in my house." 
TRAVIS: Just to be sure. You're doing an excellent job of spreading the word. 
LAURA: Waylon, this is delicious. 
MATT: "Thank you so much!" 
TRAVIS: Scalebearer, keep it up. I want to hear that the C-Poppers community has doubled by the next time that we meet. 
MATT: "Okay. Yes! You know what? I'll put together a special version of our zine, maybe a double feature. Can I have an interview to put in there? I think that would really draw people to your cause." 
TRAVIS: I think I can find some time in my schedule. 
SAM: We really have to go. We really have to go. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'll make some custom pieces. It'll be fine. 
TALIESIN: Call it "Top of the Pops." 
SAM: Ooh! 
MATT: "Top of the Pops." (laughter) 
TRAVIS: "Top of the Pops!" 
TALIESIN: This biscuit's really good. 
LIAM: Is the zine handwritten, or do you have a press? 
MATT: "Oh, I have a friend with the press who's down in the Quadroads." 
LIAM: Hmm! 
LAURA: Wow! 
TALIESIN: I feel like this will be useful later. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to make a cult. 
MARISHA: I think it already exists. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to make a cult. 
LIAM: That's not us. 
LAURA: That's wonderful. 
TRAVIS: I'm doing it. I'll grow my hair out. 
TALIESIN: I really thought it'd be you with a cult first. 
TRAVIS: Start wearing white. 
MARISHA: You thought I'd have the cult first? 
TALIESIN: Of all of us, yeah. 
MARISHA: No. No one wants to follow me. They're all scared of me. 
TALIESIN: No, fear. Fear is a great motivator. 
MARISHA: That's true. That's true. It feels a little bit more like a multi-level marketing scheme, honestly. But we can go with cult. 
TRAVIS: From hero to hero. (laughter) 
MATT: You finish up your meal. Waylon picks up after all of you, cleans up the space, and excitedly, if you have time in the morning to do a quick interview with him, he just begins to ask question after question after question. It runs a little long and you all have to-- 
TRAVIS: I oblige. 
MATT: Catch him a little bit. At one point, he pulls you aside and goes, "By the way, I think your partner, your lady friend, there's something about her I don't trust. I'd just be careful." 
TRAVIS: Which one? The dead one? 
MARISHA: Hmm! 
MATT: "No, no. The one that you were with. The tall one with hooves." 
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh! 
MARISHA: Hooves. 
TRAVIS: Did she give you a funny vibe? 
MATT: "Yeah. I don't know if she has your best interest in mind." 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Good to know. Your loyalty will be rewarded. 
MATT: "Thank you, my liege!" (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I got lieged! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We will take our leave now. Thank you, Waylon. 
MATT: "Of course. Of course. You are ever welcome here in the abode of Amaredda. Of course, should any of you be graced with any further individually crafted gifts by the hands of this great man, there is always a home for them here. So if you're ever hard up for change, just let me know. Anyway." 
LAURA: If I die on the moon, my horse is going to you, Waylon. 
MATT: "Sure." 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Scalebearer. I take out a very small, avian-looking wooden sculpture, and with my thumbs, I fan out (fluttering) peacock feathers from the back. 
MATT: "(gasps)" 
TRAVIS: This is for you. 
MARISHA: That's actually really cool. I kind of want that. 
MATT: "It's so light and fragile, but the structure feels sound, like it could almost fly. How do you bend--" 
TRAVIS: No more. We must go! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: This got way too sensual. I need to get out of here. 
MATT: You see a single tear trickle down his cheek. He doesn't even notice you all step out as he's just staring at the piece before, "Good luck! Stay safe! The rest of you also." (laughter) 
MATT: Closes the door behind. As you step out into the morning light, there's a bit of the warmth from the sunlight hitting you, but there's still a chill in the morning, a gentle snow still following here in the mid-morning sun, just a little bit of broken through from the gray patches of cloud above. But the snow dappled city of Vasselheim sits around you. The day is yours. 
TALIESIN: Let's head to the Fey Realm, somewhere normal. That was a lot. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Somewhere normal. 
LAURA: We need to find Keyleth, though. 
TRAVIS: I'm so full. I wonder if we could maybe just take our time getting there, let this food work its way through my exquisite intestines. 
TALIESIN: Well, I suppose we could go shopping. 
TRAVIS: Let's just get on with it. 
TALIESIN: I knew it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Chet, where do you think that fifth egg is? 
TRAVIS: What's that? 
ASHLEY: Where do you think the fifth egg is? 
TRAVIS: Fifth egg? Hmm. Fifth egg? Are you sure that's what you heard? 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Stupid. 
LAURA: (laughs) That is so stupid! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to find it and I'm not going to give it to him or sell it to him ever, even if-- 
TRAVIS: Great idea. You should do that, yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Find it. 
TALIESIN: Where did-- That's a lot of spite suddenly. I'm not against it, but where did it come from? 
LAURA: Yeah, what happened? 
ASHLEY: No, I-- Well, I asked him very politely and offered him a very decent amount of money for the egg. 
TALIESIN: You tried to steal it, didn't you? 
ASHLEY: I did. 
TALIESIN: Okay, and it apparently didn't-- 
ASHLEY: And it didn't work. 
TALIESIN: No, it didn't work. 
ASHLEY: Which I understand. I told him, and I-- I told him. Whatever. It's fine. 
LIAM: He seemed-- 
ASHLEY: Where are we going? 
LIAM: -- seemed super possessive from the get-go. I don't think you were wrong to be suspicious. I once read a book called "Misery" by Dreben King-- 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
LIAM: The best-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: No, it's really good. 
LIAM: The best piece for his collection-- 
ASHLEY: It was a best-seller, I think. 
LIAM: -- is the artist. 
MARISHA: No, for sure. I mean, and Fearne, you should honestly be careful. I've heard if a fandom ever turns on you-- 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's bad. 
MARISHA: It could ruin your life. 
ASHLEY: It could ruin your life. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: I've heard about this, too. 
TALIESIN: They have agents everywhere. 
ROBBIE: Well, I trusted them completely. 
TRAVIS: Oh, good, yeah. They're good. Yeah. 
ROBBIE: They seemed very nice. 
TRAVIS: 100%. What you see is what you get. 
LAURA: Honestly, he did seem really nice. He made you a really good breakfast, Chet. 
TRAVIS: He did. He did. He's got an excellent eye for quality. 
MARISHA: Hmm. Anyway. 
LIAM: Well. (laughter) 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: With all of your things gathered, you recall her noting that she would probably be over in the Abundant Terrace, not far from the exterior surrounding groves of the Birthheart. Upon arriving on the outside of the beautiful, lush forest interior of the terrace itself, and asking around for some of the various handlers and aids in that area, eventually, Keyleth does emerge from the forest. Her lush, multicolored, dragging mantle behind her. She's in the process of talking to a person to the right before sending them off, and then turns back to the rest of you. "Good morning, friends. I take it your presence here means you have places to be. I, myself, do as well shortly. Do you still intend to make this trek?" 
LAURA: Yeah, I think so. 
LIAM: We want to be useful in the downtime. 
MATT: "(sighs) Good. Well, whatever you can find, whatever we're concerned about or whatever can be-- Well, whatever part the Unseelie has had to play, or will, please bring that information back. Stop at whatever seems to be of interest towards achieving our goals. That is one blind spot that makes me anxious. Anyway, I have to be off, so if you have a place--" 
TRAVIS: One logistical questions. Getting there, okay. Getting back? 
LAURA: Nana Morri. 
LIAM: Well, Nana sent us to that one friend or associate, remember? 
LAURA: Yeah. Hopefully, we'll be able to-- 
TALIESIN: Ira might also be able to get us in the right direction. 
LAURA: Also, worst case scenario, Keyleth, if we get stranded there, can I send you a message? 
MATT: "Reach out to me, and unless I'm in the middle of being attacked or escaping some terrible thing, then yeah, I will be happy to come help you." 
TRAVIS: Or dead. 
TALIESIN: I suppose, last question, I don't suppose there's any potions or anything, I don't know, that we can stock up on before we go into the middle of whatever the fuck we're going to be going into? And also, I sort of-- 
MARISHA: Didn't we get some? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got-- 
TALIESIN: I hurt myself doing that transformation yesterday, and if it's possible to-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: They're exhausted. 
MATT: "Certainly, I can help you with that. As far as any sort of potions or healing balms, salves and such, there are some sellers in the Quadroads. So you can keep an eye out there, and see who has what stock is available. If you need any sort of monetary aid in that as well, let me know, I may have little bit of change on me I could toss your way as one of my-- Our compatriots." 
TALIESIN: We could do that real quick. I would not say no to any of that. 
ASHLEY: That might be kind of nice. 
TRAVIS: Do it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: "Very well." She reaches back into her pouch and rummages for a second before pulling out a sack of what looks to be a fair amount of coins, a solid, larger than a handful of coins, and tosses it to you, Orym. 
LIAM: Thank you, Tempest. Put it to good use. 
MATT: "Zephrah war funds. It's not a lot, but now is the time to use them, if we can." 
MARISHA: Where are you headed? 
MATT: "Well, I'm going to try and gather the rest of my-- The rest of my friends." 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
MATT: "There's a few-- There's one in particular that's been kind of hard to reach. Wish me luck. Nevertheless, I'll be here for the next hour or so, and then I should definitely be off." 
TALIESIN: We'll make it quick. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: How much does it weigh-ish? 
MATT: There's a mixture of gold and platinum, but it's about 550 gold, all said and done. 
TRAVIS: You want me to hold onto it? 
LAURA: How many healing potions will we be able to get with that? 
LIAM: I got it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, all right. 
TALIESIN: Some healing! 
LAURA: Should we truncate that, or do you want to go shopping? 
TALIESIN: Healing, greater, and unless, yeah, I was going to say, I mean, while I'm always amused by-- 
TRAVIS: If you give it to me I'll give you a fair 
LAURA: Don't. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- 4.4% yield-- You don't want to open a CD? 
TALIESIN: I'm always looking for whatever magic items might be rolling around, but I will admit-- 
LIAM: Very suspicious of the exchange rate. 
LAURA: I know, I don't think we have-- I mean, I don't have a ton of gold. I don't know if we'd be able to get any magic items. 
MARISHA: Let's just go to the Fey Realm. We can use it when we get back. Look at all these potions! 
TALIESIN: We'll get a couple potions, and well-- 
LIAM: We got a couple. 
TALIESIN: Got a couple? 
MARISHA: We just got a bunch. 
ASHLEY: I've also been carrying this around, everybody. This Potion of Invulnerability. Did somebody want this? 
SAM: What does that do? 
ASHLEY: "For one minute after you drink this potion, you have resistance to all damage." 
SAM: Damn! 
TRAVIS: Feels like we should use that as a life jacket. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: In a big battle. 
ASHLEY: I feel like a squishy would need this. 
TALIESIN: You two are the squishies. 
LAURA: Well, I feel like the up-fronts should use it. 
ROBBIE: Somebody tanky. 
SAM: The tiny warrior. 
LAURA: A tanky. 
MARISHA: Save it for-- 
LAURA: Orym. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you tend to-- 
LAURA: Orym goes down a lot. 
LIAM: That's maybe something to hold onto for Luda. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I agree. 
SAM: I won't need it. I have-- 
TRAVIS: Luda! 
SAM: -- my god to protect me. 
LIAM: (reverberating clang) 
TALIESIN: And armor, which also-- 
SAM: That, too. 
TRAVIS: Your god is? 
ROBBIE: That's a good question. I feel like you're weighing between-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, teeter-tottering. 
LAURA: Definitely. 
ROBBIE: Picking your best option. 
TRAVIS: You're so glam and glitzy now. 
SAM: Perhaps next time we go into battle, I'll reach out to one or the other, and see who offers me the most protection. 
TRAVIS: Ooh, a bidding war. 
LIAM: Why not both? 
SAM: Make them work for me. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, why not-- 
LIAM: Why not both? 
SAM: Why not both? 
ASHLEY: Yes, this is a question for the religious ones. Why do you only have to choose one? 
SAM: I never thought about that before. 
TALIESIN: That's interesting. 
SAM: I think most of the gods prefer it that way. They're sort of-- 
MARISHA: Vain. 
SAM: -- selfish. Your Prime Deities, I mean. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but they all offer different things. 
SAM: Ours don't-- 
LAURA: Yeah, definitely not selfish at all. 
SAM: No, the bad ones, they don't care. 
LAURA: Yeah, they don't care. 
SAM: They don't care. 
ASHLEY: Oh, so Asmodeus won't care that you also worship the Platinum Dragon. 
SAM: I mean... 
LAURA: Yeah, I think they get along, so Asmodeus will probably have no problems at all. 
SAM: He just wants his family back. So maybe he won't have a problem with it. 
MARISHA: But this is a good point. If you have the Primes on one side, and then the Betrayers on the other, do they even communicate? Could you walk the line, and they would never know? 
SAM: That's a really good question. I don't know how that works. 
MARISHA: It's not like they're talking. It's not like they have a shared thread-- 
SAM: I will pray on this. 
MARISHA: -- yes, of scrying. 
SAM: I will pray on this. 
LAURA: To someone else. 
ROBBIE: A web of communication. 
MARISHA: Yes! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That stretches the world. 
ROBBIE and MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: The wide, wide world. 
LIAM: Now's the time, because they all have divine skin in the game, right? They're all in the same boat. 
SAM: They do. From my religious training, DM, do I know if they would know? 
TRAVIS: If you started talking to the other side? 
SAM: Yeah, if a worshiper of the Betrayers also started worshiping a Prime, would they even know? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Roll a religion check. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
TALIESIN: I am so excited. 
ROBBIE: Are you looking to multi-god? 
SAM: Maybe! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Guidance, I say on behalf of Ashley. 
ROBBIE: I like this. 
ASHLEY: Guidance! 
LIAM: It looks like you're trying to contact another god. 
ROBBIE: Looks good. 
SAM: No, it's religion, though. 14. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
SAM: Okay, Guidance. Okay, Guidance. Oh! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That was almost really bad! 
SAM: 15. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
MATT: 15. 
ASHLEY: That's just what you needed. (laughter) 
MATT: The best that you can imagine is it depends on how deep that goes. A conversation, a curiosity, likely will not find attention. But a divided faith across that line can eventually begin to raise questions of your commitment to your faith. It also depends on how faithful you are. 
SAM: That's true. 
MATT: Split commitments are fine for those who haven't given themselves wholly to the cause. 
SAM: (whispers) What I've given. 
MATT: But also, these are strange times, so who knows? 
MARISHA: Open relationships are really in right now. 
MATT: Polytheism is in. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
ROBBIE: And I hear they almost never go wrong. 
MARISHA: (laughs) (laughter) 
SAM: Am I going to be-- I could be poly! 
LIAM: As long as your god gives you consent. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: I should be open about it. 
ASHLEY: Yes, of course. 
TALIESIN: Polytheism adds 10 points there. That's really-- 
MATT: So make sure you discuss all the tenets in advance. 
SAM: Sure, sure. (laughter) 
SAM: If anyone feels uncomfortable-- 
ASHLEY: Talk about it. 
SAM: Huh. 
TALIESIN: A lot of prayer. 
LIAM: Is there any question the gods are poly? Come on. 
MARISHA: No. 
LIAM: When they came out of that palace of light, what do you think they were doing in there? 
MATT: Tengar was a crazy place, y'all. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Infinite gender. 
MARISHA: If I was a glowing orb. 
LAURA: So we're just going straight to the Fey Realm, y'all. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Wait, are we fast-forwarding through us buying potions? 
LAURA: No, apparently we're not buying potions-- 
TALIESIN: I think we're good. 
LAURA: -- and we just took Keyleth's-- 
TALIESIN: We just took Keyleth's money, which is better. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: We might need it later! 
MATT: Is that what you guys are doing? 
ASHLEY: We'll need it! 
ROBBIE: I like it! 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Free cash. 
TALIESIN: I think we're good. 
LAURA: Or we can just fast- forward buying some potions. 
TALIESIN: No, no. If we already have some-- If we already have enough and we feel comfy, then we can save our money for the Fey Realm. 
LIAM: I'm sure there's not an expiration date on this. We can go take care of the fey, come home. 
LAURA: All right. 
LIAM: Use it to gear up. 
ASHLEY: Do you want to give it back to her? 
LIAM: Hm? 
ASHLEY: Do you want to give her back the money? 
LIAM: I'm trustworthy. 
ASHLEY and MATT: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Did getting caught do something to you? No! 
LAURA: Yeah, okay. 
ASHLEY: No, no no no. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I was just being funny. 
LAURA: All right, just kidding. We're going to just take this. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: I'm Orym. 
LAURA: We're not going to just go buy it right now. We're going to buy it when we get back from the Fey Realm. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: "Okay..." 
LAURA: We're very decisive. 
MATT: "That's completely fine, yeah. Okay. Well then, you're headed towards whereabouts in the Fey Realm?" 
ASHLEY: Well, we're going to go to my Nana's. 
LAURA: Ligament Manor. 
ASHLEY: Ligament Manor. 
MATT: "Right." 
ASHLEY: Do you know where that is? It's in the-- 
MATT: "Yes." 
MARISHA: She came with us last time. 
MATT: "I've not been." 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
LAURA: No, Allura did. 
ASHLEY: That's right. 
MARISHA: Allura! 
MATT: "Allura spoke of it, said it was a kind of fun place." 
ASHLEY: Uh-huh! 
MATT: "My interpretation; she thought it was strange, but what she thinks is strange, I often find a lot of fun, so." 
ASHLEY: I feel like you would love it. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "Anyway." 
MARISHA: Keyleth's more fun than Allura. 
TRAVIS: Yep. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: She got a tattoo. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Allura has strong spinster professor vibes. (laughter) 
LIAM: Allura's not numbing her tongue in bars across the planet. 
MATT: Yeah. Well, Kima drags her into some shit. Anyway, that's above table. 
TALIESIN: She once smoked something in Girl Scouts. She doesn't know what it was. 
MATT: Right, right. 
TALIESIN: Could've been just tea. They told her it was something. It really wasn't. It was just, yeah. 
LIAM: Wilde out. 
MATT: "Well, I guess we're in the right place for this. Follow me." She brushes the snow off her shoulders, goes to the nearest heavy enough tree with a wide enough trunk, puts her staff in front, and as she sets it, she turns it to the side and runs her finger across and down, and then as she zips it upward, the tree (quick rumbling) and a portal erupts in the middle of the tree as the bark tears open. As it does, you can see there's a slight path beyond that leads to a shadow-filled, heavily wooded space on the opposite side. 
ASHLEY: Such a cool way to travel. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "Quickly! It only remains a moment!" 
TALIESIN: I'm running through, skipping my way in. 
MATT: "Stay safe, I'll see you on the other side!" It closes behind you. Now, the temperature gets a bit warmer, though not by much. It's no longer the snowy cold of Vasselheim, but more of an oddly chilled, frost-coated swamp. The darkened clusters of ash blue and purple leaves mix with dark greens. The vines wind and twist between each other. You can see the massive, oversized mangrove trunks that seem to arc up and connect to elevated branches, the trees crossing and knotting into each other as it creates this strange, alien canopy. A familiar space to some of you, but definitely a new experience to both of you, Dorian and Braius. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: You can hear the surrounding sound of odd insects creaking and clicking, and the soft, chilled mist that drifts over the occasional muck-sunken walkway. You are in the middle of a strange, swampy space. 
TRAVIS: Can I look back at the tree that we just came out of? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Can I touch it with my fingers? Feels like bark? 
MATT: Yeah, it's hardened bark. The bark of these particular trees, what opened up for you is almost the trunk's divide about 20 feet up into these massive, long roots that are exposed and elevated that then pierce into the ground and then burrow further beneath. 
TRAVIS: Crazy. 
MATT: They're almost like natural archways that are 10, 15, 20 feet above, with four or five or more of these arching roots that reach up to combine above. 
TRAVIS: If there are any broken or discarded branches from this fey tree, I'll grab one, and if not, I might reach up and snap a small branch to take. 
MATT: Okay, yeah. What you find are not branches to this particular part. This is a smooth, gliding piece. But there are fallen branches from higher up in the tree that you can find around the area. 
TRAVIS: I'll forage those. 
MATT: The smell around here is very-- It's a gentle pungence of decaying earthen matter, plant matter, the little faint smells of sulfurous gas from that scattered compost that makes up a lot of this vicinity. Fearne, you see the familiar, enclosed mass of vine and leaf that leads to where Ligament Manor resides. Leading the troop, you begin to push and follow. Dorian, the sense of unease creeping up your back, your shoulders tensing instinctually, and you feel the hairs on the back of your neck never letting up, at attention perpetually. A few steps, and you hear (hoots) up in the air and you glance up and see two glowing yellow eyes, and then another set right beneath them. Stepping forward, you see a strange owl with two sets of eyes, a smaller sub-pair and the two large ones. They blink out of pattern, and then as it takes off, you see beneath its wings, there are four long-hanging tendrils as opposed to talons that dangle like it caught an octopus. 
ROBBIE: Are they all going to be like that? 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's honestly mild. Isn't it so wonderful? 
ROBBIE: Oh, it's delightful. 
ASHLEY: So good. 
MARISHA: I skip next Fearne. 
LIAM: This is where Fearne was raised. 
ASHLEY: Isn't it the best? 
MARISHA: I'm so excited to be back. 
ASHLEY: We just skip. 
MARISHA: We just-- 
ROBBIE: Is it squishy when they skip? Is it marshy? 
MATT: (squelching) A little bit. Sometimes it hits a stone. There's some harder earth at certain points, but it is at that area of the marsh where as it rolls, it goes from a hardened, cold, packed earth, to dampened moss, to swamp muck, and then back again. 
ASHLEY: I love it. 
MARISHA: Oh, Dorian, be careful of the flora. Sometimes the blooms will scream at you. 
ROBBIE: What? 
MARISHA: So just be careful. 
ROBBIE: (sneezes) 
LAURA: Oh. Bless you. I'm going to hook my arm through yours and just pat your arm as we walk together. 
ROBBIE: Do we have to skip here? 
LAURA: We don't have to skip, no. 
ROBBIE: It's not magic, or-- 
LAURA: I'm just here for comfort. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It can happen, though. Skipping, it can be mandatory on occasion. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes. It's mandatory. You need to do it, Dorian. 
TALIESIN: Is the word compulsory? Compulsory. 
LAURA: I'm not going to skip. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Your funeral. 
MATT: As you approach the massive cluster of twisted, tangled vines and growth, you watch as these little buds all across the exterior, as Fearne begins to approach, begin to open up. Within a matter of moments, dozens, hundreds of multicolored flowers begin to open in this archway that seems to open up at her arrival, like a tunnel (deep inhale) stretches and extends, like whatever this massive section of the forest is is inhaling at your arrival. As you all begin to step through, you watch these flowers seem to follow you as you step beneath this archway, and you swear you can see them breathing. (eerie breathing) 
MARISHA: They like pretty music. 
LAURA: Oh yeah! 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, play for them. 
MARISHA: You should play for them. 
ASHLEY: They really do. 
ROBBIE: Oh, you're more of a painter? 
SAM: Yes, I paint. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Play a little tune. 
TRAVIS: They're also aggressive towards monochromatic palettes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: You might have barely noticed, but with each of my footsteps, the green around my feet, the green grass, turns gray and black as I step through it. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: Just around six inches, around my feet. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
LAURA: Ruh-roh. 
LIAM: Reverse Druidcraft? 
SAM: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
LAURA and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: "I don't know." 
ROBBIE: I'll play a tune to the plants. 
ASHLEY: Oh, they're going to love it. 
TALIESIN: Better be a good one. 
ROBBIE: ♪ (humming a tune) ♪ 
LAURA: Don't fuck it up. They'll trap you here forever. 
ROBBIE: Now my mouth is dry. (laughter) 
SAM: Are you playing "Taps"? What is that? 
ROBBIE: I'm playing a song! It's the first thing that came to my head. 
SAM: ♪ (humming "Cantina Band") ♪ 
ROBBIE: That sounds familiar! I like that! 
MATT: We can't clear that. (laughter) 
MATT: Roll a performance check for me, Dorian. 
ROBBIE: Oh no! Okay. Oh. 
SAM: Oh yes. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, 28. 
MATT: 28. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: As improvised as this jazz flute solo may have started-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- it becomes a beautiful, offbeat flow. As your magic whisks through your instrument, you begin to conjure haunting harmonies to match your initial tone, like there are three instruments coming from one. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: You lean into it, and as you do, you watch the color of these flowers pulse and shift with the music, and that breathing sound from them begins to change to humming. You can hear dozens and dozens of these little flowers humming along with it, like they're all following the tune just one beat off of it, giving this echoed sense that trickles behind you. As ominous as this place was, suddenly it feels a little more welcoming. 
ROBBIE: I've always wanted backup singers. 
ASHLEY: Isn't it cool? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: You have as many as you want here. 
ROBBIE: This place isn't so bad. 
ASHLEY: It's not, It's really not. 
MATT: At which point-- 
ROBBIE: I get it now. It's like scary, but then it's not scary. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: -- the vines open before you. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, not at all. 
MATT: Now you see yourself emerging into the interior of this massive, forest-like cocoon, and there in the center is this impossibly tall tree, similar to the scale of the Birthheart, the massive tree you saw in Vasselheim. Not quite that large, but definitely thinner, and the foliage of it is dense and dangling and extended and twisted, like an oil-sheened weeping willow that has gotten tangled within itself over centuries. Glancing at it, you can see little bits of it that seem to emit these faint, barely hidden orange glows, massive fire lights flicker stationary beyond the curtain of the leaves and dark. As you follow Fearne into what looks to be an entryway curtain, you step within that canopy and glance upward to an incredibly tall and multi-tiered treehouse. You see the trunk of this tree knot and spiral upward into multiple, dozens of floors that rise up as branches extend outward, each one seeming to cradle a chamber that is decorated and lit with its own coloration and theme. A faint sound of music, sourceless, different from your own that you've been playing, seems to mingle and drift throughout the interior. You can see numerous pairs of glowing eyes from creatures that sit just beyond the visible light, watching you all as you enter. Welcome to Ligament Manor. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: This is where I grew up. 
SAM: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Come, let's go. 
ROBBIE: Makes a lot of sense. 
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Should we have sent a message ahead, or--? 
ASHLEY: No, it's okay. (shouts) Nana! (laughter) 
MATT: (frantic fluttering) A bunch of these birds scatter off as you scream, darting through the small ecosystem that exists within this tree as you hear a creaking sound come to a halt and a voice goes, (Morri) "Is that my Fearne?" 
ASHLEY: Yes, it is! 
MATT: "Let me put away my machine." 
LAURA: Machine? 
MARISHA: Machine. 
ROBBIE: (whispering) Machine. 
ASHLEY: Who knows? She's always building something. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Uh... 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You do recall that she has in particular this massive iron sewing machine-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. 
MATT: -- that she keeps every now and then, and it's how she passes some of her time. 
LAURA: Oh, and she makes things out of human hair. How exciting. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes, that's right. 
SAM: I like her. 
MARISHA: Resourceful. 
ASHLEY: She's great. 
MARISHA: Don't want it to go to waste. 
TALIESIN: Recyclable. 
MATT: A short time later, you can watch as you hear the heavy footfalls (massive steps) begin to head down from above, and you see this looming shadow streak past the lanterns that sit on the outside of the spiral staircase, casting this stretched, dark shape across the wood, the source just out of sight. As it descends, you notice a number of small creatures scamper about, rushing down the steps, these little squirrel-like creatures with a singular eye in the center of its head skittering and disappearing into the nearby brush. As the shape begins to loom at the top, you see this massive, hill-like humanoid shape begin to step to the top of the landing of these natural winding stairs. You see a female shape, shoulders wide and extended, a barrel-like torso, itself wrapped in a thick shawl of a purple dyed, sack cloth-like, thick material, tied and drifting off with tassels that seem to drag on the ground and have darkened with gathered muck through travel. Where you see the shawl and coat held in these thin, long arms that extend from the shoulder joints that are longer than they should be and don't match the proportions of the thick, wide torso. From the shoulders, this head looks towards you, and it is extended beyond the shoulders and neck by a good solid two, three feet, like a giraffe head that has a horse mane of whitish hair that drifts off to one side. The face, you see a female-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- noseless grin, extended, pointed chin filled with teeth, sparse amongst blackened gums, and a big, toothy smile. These vacuous holes where eyes seem to be receded into darkness, except for two little points of light that find you as she smiles. 
SAM: I think she's looking at you. 
MATT: "Welcome, friends of my sweet Fearne." 
ASHLEY: Kisses, kisses, kisses! 
MATT: "Kisses to you, my dear." 
ASHLEY: Okay, I have new friends for you to meet. This is Dorian. 
MATT: "Oh my! Aren't you handsome?" 
ASHLEY: Incredible musician. 
ROBBIE: Oh, aren't you... You are beautiful. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: "Please, let us give you kisses, sweet one." She pulls the hand forward to her. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MATT: You feel something beneath go (growls)-- 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MATT: -- as another mouth emerges from the inside of the coat and kisses the hand that's brought forward, and the extended hand kisses your forehead simultaneously. 
ROBBIE: (uncomfortably) Mm. 
SAM: Ugh. 
ROBBIE: Ooh, grandma kisses are always wet. (laughter) 
MATT: "Welcome to my domain." 
ROBBIE: I'm so glad to be here. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "What's your name?" 
ASHLEY: We've actually-- Orym and I traveled with Dorian for a very long time. 
LIAM: Old friend. 
ASHLEY: So I'm very, very excited for you to meet Dorian. This is a very new friend of ours, Braius. 
ROBBIE: Yes, this is a very new friend of ours, as well. (laughter) 
MATT: Now this was, when Dorian arrived, it was the, "Oh, who's this cute boy you brought over?" This is the, "Who's this man?" (laughter) 
MATT: Nana Morri almost stumbles onto her back massive, elephant-like foot and is like-- 
LAURA: Ooh! 
LIAM: This is your moment. 
LIAM: Get it! 
SAM: It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Goodness!" (laughter) 
MATT: "What is this creature you brought to my home, Fearne?" 
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know. 
SAM: Your grandchild said that you were ravishing, but she did not accurately describe how beautiful, indeed, you are. 
MATT: (Morri 1) "(giggles)" (Morri 2) "(deep laugh)" (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Can I cast Gust to make his hair blow in the wind? 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Just a quick cantrip. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
SAM: That smell, what is that smell? Is that a perfume I'm detecting, or is that-- 
MATT: "Oh." 
MARISHA: Czepeku. (laughter) 
SAM: -- or is it just a swamp rot of some sort? 
MATT: "No, I've been-- I'm on my fourth cocktail of the morning. Do you like amaretto?" 
MARISHA: Little perk. 
SAM: I would never say no to you. 
MATT: "Let me make you something." 
ASHLEY: She makes the best cocktails, just the greatest. 
SAM: Only in the morning, or--? 
ASHLEY: Anytime. Anytime you want it. 
TALIESIN: It's always morning somewhere. 
ASHLEY: All the time growing up, I always had cocktails at my fingertips. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ASHLEY: If I wanted them. 
MATT: "Well--" 
TRAVIS: This explains so much. (laughter) 
MATT: "I don't know if you know this about Fearne, but she tends to exaggerate." 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no! 
SAM: No, no, no. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no. 
MATT: "(laughs)" 
SAM: No, no. 
MATT: "You're so cute!" 
SAM: Oh, well, thank you, ma'am. 
MATT: "Where are you from? You smell like shadow and bad choices." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) (laughter) 
SAM: Yes, that's where I'm from. (laughter) 
MATT: "Double dipping in the Hells, are we, dear?" 
ASHLEY: Yeah, well, what're you going to do? 
MATT: "Indeed." 
ASHLEY: It just keeps happening. 
SAM: It seems the Hells are very attracted to her. 
MATT: "Mm. Careful." 
ASHLEY: What can I say? 
MATT: "I don't know which would undo first, you or them. Friends, come inside, please. Your parents, I'm sure, would love to see you." 
ASHLEY: Are they here? 
MATT: "They haven't left. It's the safest place for them to be." 
LAURA: We would totally remembered that! 
ASHLEY: Excellent. Yes, I do. I do remember. That's what I remembered. 
MATT: "Your father's resting while your mother is tending garden." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: "Come, come. Please, stay as long as you like. You're always welcome here at Nana Morri's." 
MARISHA: Nana, can I request one of those cocktails as well? 
MATT: "Of course." 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll get in on that as well. 
MARISHA: Oh, thank you! 
MATT: "I'll make a round for all of you sweet children." 
MARISHA: Thank you. 
MATT: "Oh, and how's the legend doing?" 
TRAVIS: (dreamy sigh) 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MARISHA: You should tell her! 
LAURA: How does she know? 
TRAVIS: Yes, of course I should. You should know that my renown has grown in our world. People are starting to know about my great works. 
MATT: "It's amazing how someone's practiced craft can have an impact with just a bit of passion and perseverance." 
TRAVIS: Just that. Just that and that alone. I actually brought you something, not intact, but slightly broken. I'll take out of the bag of holding the blue-hued crystal axe from Ruidus that broke, that shattered. 
MATT: Ah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: A little shard of it. Just a memento. Nothing much. Just an expression of my thanks for the last time we spoke. 
MATT: Her hand reaches and seems to reach longer than the limbs have ever allowed previously, stretching before plucking it from your grip. 
TRAVIS: (shudders) 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: She makes a sniffing sound, and where there is no nose, you see the slits open. 
LAURA: Somebody barfed, I think. (laughter) (retching) 
TRAVIS: Ruidian glass. 
MATT: "It seems to be psychically resonant. Have you more of this?" 
TRAVIS: More to come. It was only our first trip. But I wanted to make sure that there was something just for you. 
MATT: "Bring me more." 
LAURA: Yeah, they said that Ruidian glass was actually a part of Predathos at one point. 
MATT: "Curious, curious indeed. I shall find a use for this. Thank you, Chetney." 
TRAVIS: Of course. Thank you. 
MATT: "Friends--" 
ASHLEY: It is so cool up there. 
MATT: "Tell me everything, please." 
ASHLEY: It was so incredible. 
MATT: "Let me get to those drinks." 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: (massive footfalls) Begins to step up. 
ROBBIE: (whispering) Fearne! 
ASHLEY: Yes? 
ROBBIE: Is she your biological grandmother, or is Nana a term of endearment, or--? 
ASHLEY: I mean, (sighs) that's kind of hard-- Well, I was left with her when I was little-- 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
ASHLEY: -- for her to take care of me-- 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
ASHLEY: -- and protect me. But I don't-- I mean, she feels more like family than anyone else I've known. 
ROBBIE: Oh, yes. 
ASHLEY: You know? 
ROBBIE: I'm just curious. 
LAURA: Fearne doesn't have an extra face down in her cooch, if you're wondering. 
SAM: Cooch! 
ASHLEY: As far as you know. You have no idea what's in this marsupial pouch. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I don't have an extra face. 
LAURA: That's true. 
TRAVIS: Dorian, you know should know-- 
ASHLEY: I don't have an extra face. 
TRAVIS: -- that Nana is also known as the Fatestitcher. 
ROBBIE: The Fatestitcher? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: She'll make little tradesies. 
TRAVIS: Super powerful. 
LIAM: But her whole family is here, because that's Nana, you met Nana, but her mom and dad, Mom and Pop are here, too. 
SAM: Biological mother and father? 
ASHLEY: My mother, but-- 
ROBBIE: I thought your dad was a big bad man on a dragon. 
ASHLEY: He is. I think-- It's really complicated. Ollie is not my actual father, but he was, for a moment in time, kind of like a stepdad, but a very brief moment in time. I don't really know him super well. 
SAM: Your real dad's a demon. 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: No. No, he's-- 
MARISHA: He's a fey. 
ASHLEY: He's a fey. 
LIAM: Kind of an asshole. 
ASHLEY: He's the Sorrowlord. 
TRAVIS: Sorrowlord Zathuda. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: Layers of found family. 
ASHLEY: Layers of found family. 
ROBBIE: No, it's just interesting. I come from a very core family, so I'm always interested in other people's experiences. 
TRAVIS: Your gran doesn't look like that? 
ASHLEY: Absolutely. 
ROBBIE: No! 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh. Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Cool. Just curious. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, of course. 
SAM: Siblings? 
ASHLEY: Do I have siblings? I don't think so. 
LAURA: Do you have siblings? 
SAM: I hadn't thought about that. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Everybody else has. You're okay. (laughter) 
SAM: Let's say no. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You don't know the names of all your siblings? 
ROBBIE: They could've died in a tragic accident. 
TRAVIS: They're all doing very well and happy. 
MATT: They all died in the tragic backstory reveal of the live show at the Greek. (laughter) 
MATT: Stepping up within the central greeting study chamber of Ligament Manor, it's changed even since last time you all were here. You can see the decor are shades of carved wood and stone shelving. It's very comfortable. You can see all sorts of hanging baubles and strange little keepsakes, some that look like they beautifully accentuate the decor, some contrast with it and feel like maybe it's some sort of a charm or protective relic. Others seem like they are just ghastly reminders of some past story you care not to ask about. But as the music gets louder as you approach, you see her humming to herself. You can see there is, many of you have already witnessed the experience, an intricate tiki bar built into the back of this area where she's dancing throughout, humming to herself and mixing into a shaker with one hand while she grabs a drink from the other, and sets up a series of cups and mugs around and begins to shake and pour. "You all don't mind things that taste a bit nutty, do you?" 
LIAM: No. 
MARISHA: Mm, I love nutty. 
ASHLEY: Love the taste of nuts. 
SAM: Nuts in my mouth. 
MATT: "Lovely." 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
MATT: She prepares all the drinks. Nothing escapes unscathed. 
LAURA: It's just so quickly. 
LIAM: That's my fault. 
MATT: That was you? 
LIAM: Yeah. (snickering) 
MATT: She approaches and sets all these drinks around for you all, and sits down within this beautiful, massive, ramshackle recliner that looks like it was a series of woven, stripped bark and leather, and the more you look at it, the more you swear there are wrinkles in it. 
TRAVIS: Oh man! Oh man! 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: She sits into the chair. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: It's a newer chair? 
MATT: Yes. 
ASHLEY: It's a new skin chair. 
MARISHA: I love it. 
MATT: "Welcome." 
TALIESIN: Speaking of bad decisions. 
LAURA: Uh... 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Ira might be stopping by. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, that is a possibility. In fact, very likely. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: "What?" 
TRAVIS: Ira Wendagoth. 
LAURA: Yeah, he might be swinging on by. 
TALIESIN: We're on our way to the Unseelie. 
MARISHA: Is that all right? 
MATT: You see her eyes go wide for a second. 
MARISHA: He asked about you last time we saw him. 
MATT: (Morri 2) "What did he say?" 
TRAVIS: Oh jeez! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: He said, always a good time? 
LAURA: What did he say? Yeah, he spoke very admirably. 
MARISHA: Yes, very highly. 
TALIESIN: It sounded positive. 
ASHLEY: I think he still has a little bit of a crush, Nana. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: He was very interested when I asked if-- Well, see, we're on a mission, and he could be of great help there, and so we kind of need him, and this seemed like the most logical place to meet. 
MATT: (Morri 1) "Of course." 
LAURA: Fearne said. 
ASHLEY: It did. I was the one who suggested it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) "Fearne said." 
ASHLEY: I just feel like it's an unrequited love situation with him. I feel like he wants to see you. 
MATT: "That ship's sailed." 
ASHLEY: Well, you don't know that. 
LIAM: Insight check. 
SAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: The Fatestitcher? 
LIAM: Yeah. It's low. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It's low. 
MATT: You're not even sure what face to look at. She goes, "That ship has sailed. Morrigan is always looking for the next--" 
ASHLEY: Conquest? 
MATT: "-- opportunity. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: Mm! (laughter) 
MATT: "Let him come. It'll be good to see a familiar face. It's been some time." 
LAURA: Speaking of faces, do we see one on the chair? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: Or an ear, or a nostril. 
TALIESIN: Any chunk of face, really. There's probably a lot of options. 
MARISHA: Chunk of face. 
TRAVIS: Flavor saver. 
LAURA: Perception? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Aw, I have shit perception. 
LIAM: What if I assist? 
LAURA: What if you do it? Shit. 
LIAM: You thought of it. 
LAURA: No, it didn't help at all. 
LIAM: Is that a one? 
LAURA: Yeah, that's a one. 
TRAVIS: It's probably a bad dice. 
LIAM: Well, because I'm standing next to you, and I have such a positive outlook, and because I chose Bountiful Luck as a feat, you reroll ones. 
LAURA: I reroll ones?! 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Just if I'm near you?! 
LIAM: Mm-hmm! 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
LIAM: It's that cheerful smile. 
LAURA: That's amazing. 
ASHLEY: That's better. 
LAURA: Oh, that's the same thing I rolled before. (laughter) 
LIAM: It just eradicates ones. 
LAURA: Yeah. It's just 12. 
MATT: It's hard to tell. A lot of the leathery part of it, the woven elements-- 
LAURA: That's amazing. 
MATT: -- she's leaned into, so by the time you even start to look, she's leaned back into it further, so you can't really tell. 
LIAM: But you got to be near me. 
TALIESIN: My heart. 
LAURA: How close to you? 
MATT: "So--" 
LAURA: Five? 10? 
LIAM: 30. 
MATT: "I would love to think this is just a friendly visit, but you all are carrying an air of purpose around you." 
MARISHA: We can't stay long. 
SAM: Yes, we-- 
MARISHA: Also, we do come with a bit of unfortunate news. Our time on Ruidus, though very fascinating, very incredible in some ways, we did lose our little-- 
MATT: "Your metallic friend, yes." 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: "I sensed his departure from here. I watch from a distance, best that I can, in the ways that I can. Our threads have tangled, or at least, I've tangled my fingers in your threads a bit. It's good to be aware of when they are tugged. I felt that one break. I'm sorry to hear." 
LAURA: In your head, you hear: You think she was watching when you made out with her granddaughter? That's all. (laughter) 
MARISHA: If you could feel the tug, do you happen to know if they're okay, or if they went to a better place? We've been quite conflicted with this debate of what happens, where one goes once they depart this realm. 
MATT: "That is beyond my purview. Unless I have them written into my specific periphery, whether it be by word or bind, they're beyond my sight when they pass. I'm sorry." 
MARISHA: I got this little alien, though! 
MATT: "Bwuh?" (laughter) 
MATT: Grabs it and pulls it in. 
ASHLEY: What was that? (like Morri) "Bwuh?" 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "For me?" 
MARISHA: Oh...! 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no. 
MARISHA: No, I was just going to show you. 
LAURA: Might be a little late now. 
ROBBIE: That's a nice housewarming gift. 
ASHLEY: I know, isn't it so cute? 
TRAVIS: It goes right on the mantel. 
ROBBIE: We did invite a guest to their house. 
MATT: She flicks the outside of the glass, and it twitches and moves inside. 
LAURA: She's helped us a lot. 
MATT: She's like, "Oh, but you'd be so fun to experiment with."  
ASHLEY: Well, let's just wait. Let's just wait. 
MARISHA: Do you have a little alien? I would trade you. 
MATT: "Ooh, I have many things I can trade you." 
MARISHA: I got this behemoth finger. Do you want that? 
MATT: "I like tiny, twitching things in jars. (giggles) Well, when you're done with your excursions, could I have it after?" 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: Have we told her where we're going after here? 
MARISHA: Thank you. 
TALIESIN: That was the question, actually. 
ASHLEY: No. 
ROBBIE: Not really. 
TALIESIN: We are headed into the Unseelie Court. 
MATT: "Doesn't surprise me." 
ASHLEY: Do you have any-- I mean, I know how to get there, but I don't think we're-- 
MATT: "I keep watch on their movements, just in case." 
ASHLEY: You do? 
MATT: "Well, you do know they are still bound in some way to your fate, and your fate I pay close attention to. Seems your father is still-- Your biological father is still mucking about, yes?" 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: (grunts) 
ASHLEY: Yes, I've had moments with him, but I haven't really talked to him yet. 
MATT: "Well, you seem to be on a collision course with his thread soon enough, yes?" 
ASHLEY: Yes, I think so. 
LAURA: He's on his way to the same court. 
MATT: "Arrived naught but two hours ago." 
LAURA: Oh shit, they're already there? 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: "They're trekking towards." 
ASHLEY: Oh, well-- 
LIAM: We came here to piss in Zathuda and Ludinus's pool. They're trying to reestablish a connection with the Unseelie. We really don't want that to happen. We were hoping-- 
MATT: "Yes. They've kept their forces ready, but docile, waiting. Perhaps their presence here is to stir up whatever lies in wait." 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "Dangerous indeed to what you seek to do, yes. Yes, I see. Well, we can't have that, can we?" 
ASHLEY: Nana. 
LAURA: Oh, wait. 
SAM: Uh-oh. She's doing something. 
LAURA: What is-- 
LIAM: She's got that look. 
ASHLEY: Oh, Ira's here? 
TRAVIS: In the distance. 
LAURA: In the distance. 
MATT: Coming up the steps, you see-- 
TRAVIS: Oh no! 
LAURA: (gasps) Is it Ira? 
MATT: -- hands curl at the top-- 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! 
MATT: -- as Ira Wendagoth-- 
TRAVIS: Love is blind. 
MATT: -- curls to the top of the stairs. The tall, lanky, dark fey figure of Ira, smooth, bald of head, with long, pointed ears that seem to curl off into nothing, blackened eyes beneath a browless forehead, a tooth-filled grin that's curled into a twisting smile and his long, spider-like body itself wrapped in his well-tailored, ragged, long-tailed coat. 
ASHLEY: So handsome. 
LIAM: Now it's a party. 
MATT: "Hello, Morri and friends. It's been some time. My apologies. It's been a bit of a journey to get here." As he dusts himself, you see red Ruidian dust (dust shaking loose) cloud around and drift onto the ground. He pulls his scarf off and hangs it on this knotted bit of wood that's hanging off to the side and lifts his goggles that were hanging off of his epaulet and unhooks it and puts it up as well. "Morrigan." He smiles, and she goes, "Hm. Hello, Ira." He seems a bit taken aback. (Ira) "Well, friends, new and old. You, I know." 
ROBBIE: We tried to kill each other last time we met. 
MATT: "Yes. Shall we have another go?" 
ROBBIE: I don't think so. 
MATT: "How about a handshake, then?" 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's all good. 
MATT: His fingers wrap around your comparably small hand to where the fingers seem to go around twice as it encircles you. 
SAM: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: (grunts uncomfortably) 
MATT: Gives one stern shake before (creaky unfurling) pulls back. 
TALIESIN: This is good practice. It's an entire realm of people who always sound sarcastic but really aren't, so just start getting that into your head. 
ROBBIE: Regardless, glad to be on better terms. 
MATT: "And you." 
SAM: Ah, yes. I'm a new friend, also. I'm friends with Morrigan, actually. She's quite lovely. 
MATT: "She is." He looks over towards her, and she goes, (Morri 1) "They told me you were coming here, and--" 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I'm glad to see you're doing well." She scoots her heavy chair (screeching scoot) about two feet closer to you. 
TRAVIS: Then it goes, "Ah!" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: (chair grunts) (laughter) 
LIAM: We've crafted this ancient man into a usable chair. 
ASHLEY: A La-Z-Boy. 
LIAM: Ah! 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
ROBBIE: I still feel! (lingering laughter) 
MATT: (Ira) "Well, if I might." He puts his hand out to Morrigan. She extends her hand. He takes it and goes to kiss it, and she pulls back. (Morri 1) "But there is too much to do, and so little time." 
LAURA: I just sip my drink. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: "Now, sweet, wonderful, supple friends, you are here to stop, halt, or demolish this meeting of the Vanguard and the Unseelie. Whereabouts?" 
LAURA: Oh, Prover-- (trails off to mumbles) 
ASHLEY: Proven-- Provene-- 
SAM: Dan Povenmire. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Pravenier, Pravenier. 
LAURA: Pravenier, Pravenier. 
LIAM: Amethyst Gulch Sierras. 
ASHLEY: Pravenier, the purple range mountain cliffs. 
LIAM: In provolone. 
LAURA: You know, the kaleidoscopic tapestry. 
MARISHA: The kaleidoscopic-- 
MATT: "Indeed." 
ASHLEY: Amethyst Gulch Sierras. 
MARISHA: -- tapestry. 
ROBBIE: We all say it. 
TALIESIN: Flowery. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yellow, green. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Her arm goes out and touches some of the nearby vines, and they wrap around her fingers rapidly. Her eyes gloss over a cloudy gray for a minute before they drift back to the dark absence, and she pulls her fingers back. "They trek there now themselves. Then you must make haste, all of you." She looks to Ira, who's like, (Ira) "But of course, that's why I'm here, to help your sweet niece and your compatriots. We've already done quite some wonderful things together, haven't we?" 
ASHLEY: I'm her granddaughter, Ira. 
MATT: "It's familial." 
ASHLEY: Fine. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Ira. You kind of, you know, ghosted us a little bit on the moon. 
MATT: "Ghosted? I'm sorry, I had to protect myself when all hell broke loose. You kind of left a mess. A delicious, delightful mess. Oh, it was glorious to behold, to watch them all scramble and run. Oh, I do love plans of arrogant pricks tumbling at their feet." 
TALIESIN: It was a little rougher-- 
LAURA: Let's do it again. 
TALIESIN: -- than we were intending. 
LIAM: You're in the right place. We need to make another mess. 
MARISHA: Maybe this time, Sorrowlord will actually go boom boom, because it didn't really work last time. 
MATT: "I like boom boom." 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Well, if time is of the essence..." He reaches back, his arm grasping his scarf and goggles once more. He stands up, and now that he's-- He walked up like a hunched spider. Now he stands at full height, back arched. He's probably 12, 13 feet tall. 
SAM: Whoa. 
LIAM: Shit. 
LAURA: Oh! Whoa. 
ROBBIE: Gross. 
MATT: Just a extended-- 
LAURA: Hadn't realized that. 
LIAM: What's up, shorty? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Really. 
MATT: He looks down at you. 
SAM: Uh-huh? 
MATT: "Then I guess we must be on our way." 
SAM: If we must. I'll turn around and face Nana Morri and get down on my knee, extend my hand. Ma'am, it's been a pleasure. 
MATT: (Morri 1) "Oh, I do hope it's not the last." 
SAM: I will gently kiss her hand while making eye contact with Ira. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah! 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: It's like kissing a thrifted leather jacket that's gotten wet. 
SAM: Ugh! 
LAURA: Oh! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Well done, sir. That is rough! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: As-- (laughs) 
MARISHA: That's great. 
MATT: As your lips grace her knuckles, she goes, (Morri 1) "(giggles)" (Morri 2) "(deep giggles)" (laughter) 
MATT: Immediately Ira kneels down. (Ira) "And the honor is mine as well, dear." She goes-- Gives him the other hand, and he kisses it, making eye contact with you. She goes, and looks over at you, Fearne, and goes, "Mm." 
SAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I can't even tell you how many times this used to happen. The men, the women, everybody who would be down the stairs wanting Nana's love. 
MARISHA: Pâté flies off and gets on a knee. (laughter) 
MATT: (Pâté) "Miss, if you don't mind, I'd very much appreciate to kiss something of yours as well." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: Good boy, good boy. 
MATT: She goes, (Morri 1) "Mostly occupied at the moment," but extends her foot. He goes, (Pâté smooches) (laughter) 
MATT: (Pâté sputtering) (laughter) 
MATT: (Pâté spitting) 
TALIESIN: Where does the tongue even sit in that-- Never mind, never mind. Never mind. 
TRAVIS: Doesn't have lips. 
MATT: It's the campaign of tongue questions. We're not going to-- (laughter) 
LIAM: She grossed out a hollow skull. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That was such a fast reaction! (smooching) (sputtering) 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
MATT: Ira's still holding her hand and looking at you. 
SAM: I'm not going to let go. 
MATT: Like the people who are afraid to stop clapping at Stalin's gathering. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Until eventually she withdraws both hands and goes, "Well, I do love having gentleman visitors, and family and friends. Let us celebrate when all this is done. It's been quite some time since we've had a true celebration here in the Manor. Isn't that right?" 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: You watch as she runs her fingers through her long, extended neck, and you watch as her mane of gray hair seems to grow longer and more lush as her fingers do. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: This glamour magic seems to spread across her. You watch as she seems to, not change her form, but the skin tightens in places, a color seems to rush to her cheeks, and in the way that Nana Morri can doll herself up with a brief bit of illusion magic, she exhibits an air of availability. (laughter) 
LIAM: How's tummy face look? 
MATT: Tummy face, you can see-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Tummy dance! 
TALIESIN: Tum tum. 
MATT: The usual large, gritted jaw has pursed up into little duck lips. (laughter) 
MARISHA: She got those injections. 
ASHLEY: Yeah! (laughter) (laughter) 
MATT: Ira backs up like a spider skittering backwards slightly, still not breaking eye contact from you, and goes-- 
LAURA: Tummy Nana's got a lip flip. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Little BBL. 
ASHLEY: Boop! 
MATT: (Ira) "Well then, we must be on our way." 
MARISHA: Her ass is just looking real good now. 
ROBBIE: Hindsight. 
TALIESIN: Children! 
SAM: Let us go! 
LAURA: All right, all right, all right. 
TALIESIN: Even the chair's going: Hmm! 
ASHLEY: I learned from the best. 
MATT: As you're all gathering your things, she turns around to you, Orym. (Morri 1) "Hello." 
LIAM: Nana. 
MATT: "Boy the wind has tossed." 
LIAM: Your aid was appreciated on Ruidus. 
MATT: "I'm only sorry it wasn't enough, but I have my influences and purviews, but I'm not all-powerful." 
LIAM: Probably helped us lose less than we otherwise would've. 
MATT: "Well, your journey is not yet done." She grins and turns back around. You hear footsteps begin to descend and a voice go, (Birdie) "Fearne? Fearne, is that you?" 
ASHLEY: Hey! 
MATT: Birdie emerges. You see she's got big heavy leather gloves on and some shears in one hand and you can see she's got some dirt under her cheeks a bit and her hair is kind of wild and goes-- 
ASHLEY: Hi. 
MATT: "Hi!" Puts it down and runs up and gives you a big hug and spins you for a minute and looks over to Nana with an excited expression and Morri goes, (Morri) "I'm sorry, child, they're off. You have a moment, but they have business to attend. You understand, your daughter is in fact quite an important piece in this chess game." She looks back and goes, (Birdie) "I understand. Well, don't be afraid to come back, please." 
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm hoping that if things go well there we can come back and maybe celebrate a little bit before we go. 
MATT: "Of course! Oh, there's a whole chest of decorations back here that Nana hasn't put up in well over a century. I'd love to spruce the place up a bit." Nana goes, "We'll discuss sprucing anything up." 
ASHLEY: That would be fun. 
MATT: "But yes." Still holding you says, (Birdie) "Well, I'd go wake up your father, but you look like you're on your way out." 
ASHLEY: It's okay. 
MATT: "Come back safe." 
ASHLEY: I will. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
ASHLEY: I'm glad you're safe. 
MATT: "Me too. It's nice to be home." 
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Sure. What are you looking for? 
MARISHA: Does Nana Morri seem like she's, I don't know, trying to move things along? 
LAURA: Over Birdie? 
MARISHA: Yeah. Like trying to keep them separated. 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: That's not great. 12. 
MATT: 12. Hard to tell. I mean, she seems like she's just trying to move things along given the stakes and the timeline that are at hand, but that's as much as you can make out. Birdie, as she finishes hugging you and holds your hands in her hands, she curls your fingers open and puts something in your palm and holds it close and says, (Birdie) "Just if ever you need to refocus yourself at all or recenter yourself in all this crazy, we'll always be here thinking of you here in the Manor. So the next time you come back, we can maybe catch up proper, you know?" 
ASHLEY: I would love that. 
MATT: "Me too." 
ASHLEY: I'll give her a kiss on her cheek. 
MATT: She rustles your hair a bit. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to look in my hand. 
MATT: Okay. You look in your hand and it's a necklace that's been made from part of the broken green lens that was shattered back when you first found them. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
MATT: "Of course." Morri goes, "Well then, posthaste is it." She brings her hands up, and as she does, the wind begins to (swirling) kick up inside, all the branches shift and change. You can hear the entire interior of this tree beginning to move and shift with this faint cyclone that's beginning to billow up and turn. As she does so, mist, this pale, green/purple mist begins to drift up between the wood and tangled bits of branch and as it begins to pick up into the wind, begins to take on shapes, take on the shape of these various spectral horses. They all begin to apparate, these clouded shapes, six hooves each and a strange elongated neck, but these are spectral steeds and there are nine of them conjured before you. 
LAURA: Awesome! 
ASHLEY: Oh, cool! 
TRAVIS: Sick! 
LAURA: Sick! 
MATT: Just as that ends, the wind dies down. (wind gently whooshing) It grows slightly more quiet and they all drift there, floating a few inches off the ground, (ethereal breeze) making no sound. "These should carry you to your destinations rapidly." 
ASHLEY: Look at those big boys. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: "Just be warned. Flying high may offer you speed, but you're quite visible beyond the trees. Stay safe." 
LAURA: Thank you, Nana. 
MATT: "And come back. You know you're always welcome. Always." (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'll go up and give her a kiss. Bye, Nana. 
MATT: She accepts it and reaches over and grabs your head. Her long neck arcs for her to kiss the top of your head. It's kind of grotesque in the way that it bends unnaturally. "I'll be watching from here." 
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait, I had a question. 
MATT: "Hmm?" 
ASHLEY: When you see a thread, can you see the end of it? 
MATT: "The funny thing about fate is the end of the threads are unfocused, cloudy. You can see possibilities, but that's where the weave of the fate's threads is important. I don't weave them, that lies in the Matron's domain. I just tend to sneak in and tug a little here and there." 
ASHLEY: That must drive her crazy. 
MATT: "I'm sure it does. (laughs)" 
ASHLEY: Interesting. Okay. 
LAURA: This might be inappropriate. How long have you been alive, Nana Morri? 
MATT: "I cannot really remember. Time has a funny, weird, soup-like quality in this realm." 
ASHLEY: G'oh! (laughter) 
LAURA: But this realm was around before the gods arrived. 
ASHLEY: Oh, good question. 
MATT: "Supposedly, in some way. I don't recall a time before them, but the magics, magics are quite old." 
ROBBIE: So what happens to the Fey Realm if things go wrong in our world? Are we connected? 
MATT: "We are, in some ways, yes. Some come here to escape the dangers of your world, and some escape here to create dangers in yours. They are tied, tethered, and there are reverberations that occur between the two. But we are not bound by, well, not bound by the gods as much as you are, but their presence is here, indeed. The courts more than I." 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, does the Raven-- I mean, does the Matron, can she actually make her way here? Can she pluck people here? 
MATT: "The Matron's sway exists across the realms, yes. Though this domain lies more under the Moonweaver and the Arch Heart. This is the Arch Heart's domain, after all. But our relationship with divinity is a bit more like roommates." 
LAURA: You said the Unseelie, I'm sorry, were close to the gods. Which ones do they serve? 
MATT: "They serve them both, the Moonweaver and Arch Heart." 
LAURA: Oh, all right. 
MATT: "The courts themselves have made vows and dealings in the past. They're more bound to the rules of their tenets and their divine relationships than us more free fey. (laughs)" 
LAURA: What were you going to say? 
MARISHA: That was pretty much it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: "Then be off." 
LAURA: All right. 
MATT: "The steeds will only last you an hour." 
LAURA: Oh, let's go. (clamoring) 
TRAVIS: I run up behind mine and I jump, put both hands on the ass. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Like a cowboy mount? 
MATT: Make an athletics check. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Down my drink. 
LIAM: How tall are these steeds? 
MARISHA: It's pretty cocked. 
LAURA: Are they all sized to us? 
MATT: They're all sized like the same sort of steed. 
LIAM: So horse size, general horse size. 
TALIESIN: Like a merry-go-round. 
TRAVIS: 22. 
ROBBIE: Did you want a pony? 
MATT: Yeah, easy enough to do. 
LAURA: Were you hoping for a spectral pony? 
LIAM: Bro, I can jump 20 feet in the air. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: A Clydesdale. 
SAM: Do you need help getting on yours? Is that-- 
TALIESIN: He definitely does not. 
LIAM: I leap and parkour off a nearby tree and land. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Does it look like when you guys put Ronin on a horse? 
LAURA: Yeah, probably. 
LIAM: I land on my feet. 
TALIESIN: The tree goes, "Ow!" 
LIAM: Stomp my heel into it and surf away. 
LAURA: You stomp your heel on the horse? 
LIAM: Just do a little bump. 
LAURA: Be kind to animals, Orym. 
LIAM: I'm already gone. 
TALIESIN: Let's go "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" this shit. All right. 
MARISHA: So what did you roll? 
ROBBIE: Quad strength. 
TRAVIS: 22. 
MATT: All right, I'm just fucking with you, we're just-- 
LAURA: Oh. (laughter) 
MATT: You don't have to roll to jump on a horse. 
TRAVIS: Tell me, though. 
MARISHA: What are we doing? 
TRAVIS: Spectral steed. 
ASHLEY: All right, I kind of know where to go. 
SAM: Then lead the way. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: Or unless Ira knows better. 
TRAVIS: I love how you say it with a question mark at the end. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I kind of know where to go? 
LIAM: Isn't that every Fearne line? 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah. 
MATT: Ira glides up-- 
ASHLEY: I probably know how to do this? 
MATT: These spectral steeds, as they run, their hooves, all six hooves turn, but they have no impact. You just hear (wind whooshing). 
LAURA: Six hooves? 
MATT: They have-- Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, she said they've got six legs. 
ASHLEY: Six legs. 
MATT: They're weird, thin-- 
LIAM: Sorry, Titmouse. 
MATT: -- ghostly horses, like they've been stretched and they look a little off. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to lean down to my horse and say, "Hey, go to the Unseelie Court, okay?" 
LAURA: No, not, wait. No, we're not going to the Unseelie Court. 
ASHLEY: We're going to the Seelie Court. 
LAURA: No. 
ASHLEY: No, we're not. 
LAURA: We're going to another city. 
ASHLEY: We're going to the another city. (laughter) 
MATT: Where does Fearne stop? 
TRAVIS: We are fucked. We are screwed. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, that's not where we're going. I'm really sorry, we're going to Pravenier. My bad, just scratch what I said first. 
MATT: Ira goes, "I've been there. Come." 
LAURA: Oh, he knows. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. We've got Ira. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, I got a little excited. 
MATT: As you all begin to gather your group up together and begin to glide a bit in that direction, Ira goes, "Perhaps I'll come back and visit when all this is said and done." 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MATT: She goes, "Maybe, if I'm available," and she slaps Braius on the ass right as they're about to take off. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
SAM: (pleased humming) 
ASHLEY: So Braius is riding a horse? 
TRAVIS: Which kind of clangs, doesn't it? 
SAM: I'm a cow on a horse. 
TRAVIS: Does he have full armor? 
MATT: Oh yeah. (clangs) 
TRAVIS: (clanging) 
LIAM: Yours probably does look like a pony. 
ASHLEY: How do your knees work? 
SAM: My knees are-- (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. 
TALIESIN: No, that's really hurting my head the more I think about that. That's a lot. 
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. 
TALIESIN: Wait. 
MATT: Wait. 
LIAM: Wait. 
ASHLEY: You're a minotaur. 
LAURA: What does Braius' lower half look like? 
ASHLEY: A horse. 
SAM: Like a minotaur, like a bull. 
LAURA: So you're not wearing pants? 
SAM: No, I have, let me look at my art. 
TRAVIS: He's got full plate armor now. 
TALIESIN: He's got the backwards-- 
TRAVIS: He's got the full plate armor. 
ROBBIE: I do like the idea of him Donald Ducking it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: Full plate up top. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) 
LAURA: Full plate up top and then just-- 
SAM: Furry legs. It's sort of like Fearne. It's like Fearne. 
ASHLEY: So you have four legs over the horse? 
TRAVIS: She's so-- 
TALIESIN: No, two. 
SAM: No, I only have two legs. 
LIAM: Hands. 
SAM: I'm just like you. 
LAURA: He's not an actual cow. 
ASHLEY: No, I'm thinking of centaur. 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: Sorry, my bad, my bad, my bad. 
ROBBIE: Eight hooves, though. That's cool. 
ASHLEY: I mean, yeah. 
LIAM: Those cocktails, I swear. 
ASHLEY: Woo-wee! (laughter) 
MATT: The spectral steeds whisk you all through and up running through the interior of Ligament Manor's canopy, darting from branch to branch and flying higher and higher and higher. Your group spiraling up until eventually you begin to see the top of the canopy where the branches breach open and you go flying out through and above the garden. You can see the masses of beautifully cultivated hedges and sculptures. 
ASHLEY: I made those. 
MATT: As you drift up and now above the entirety of the surrounding forests and swampland, you can see around you the strange, alien-looking mountainscapes of purples and oranges and greens, the continuous dusk coloration that strikes the entirety of the horizon. The skies clouded over with darkened blues and purples. The landscape has this dreamlike quality to it, unchanging, perpetual, and as you all rise up and gather, you take your reins and the spectral steeds rocket off towards your chosen destination. 
LIAM: Raise rise up. 
MATT: And that's where we'll take a break. 
TRAVIS: Ooh, shit. 
ROBBIE: That's so cool. 
TRAVIS: Yee-haw! Whoo! 
MATT: We'll come back to that here in a minute and pick up upon your trek towards this Amethyst Gulch Sierras and what lies within. So yeah, rest up in just a minute. We'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll see you guys soon.

(mysterious music) The future is frightening. It's a future which hasn't yet been written. Vox Machina, your world will be destroyed. This can't be happening. If we want to save it, we have to go to... Hell. Buckle the fuck up. Road trip! We shouldn't be here. Won't be needing jackets. To pull this off we're gonna need all kinds of miracles. What is that thing? Hold him off as long as you can! Vox Machina shall burn! That's a big problem! And I'm an even bigger one! -Ready? -No, but do it anyway! I'm ready to die for the people I love. We have to believe it's going to be alright. And if it isn't... No! ...then nothing matters. Vox Machina, you are now bound for eternity. They got some plush chairs in this bitch. It's okay to be scared. We can face anything if we're together. Oy! You think you can catch us, dingle dick? Maybe don't mock the murder man? 
(holiday music) 
XEN: It doesn't occur to any of you that the moon is about to fall out of the sky. And why would it? It's just a regular Monday here on the moon. Goe is watching the gigantic wall of darkness inbound. This isn't going to have transformative, long-lasting, incredibly far-reaching consequences, is it? Unfortunately, it will. We have gathered together a small squad of unlikely chums to seek what perhaps cannot be found. SARA: This is feeling really weird, really fast. XEN: I think it's time to go. All aboard. What could possibly go wrong? Such as, for example, the moon literally exploding literally right now. LIAM: What's in it for you? Helping us... MATT: If there is even the remotest chance that they are still alive, I have to see that through. MARISHA: It's not about knowing or not knowing. It's about being willing to find out. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to read it like I'm smart. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: If it's an acting thing, she can do it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Ludinus has seemingly confirmed his, nope. 
TRAVIS: (chuckles) 
LAURA: Seemingly confirmed his need for Ruidusborn and that he deeply-- (laughter) 
SAM: I'm enteringmy villain era. 
LAURA: What grand demon do you have trapped in your ass? 
MARISHA: You weren't a teen girl in the 90s! Don't worry about it! It's magic! 
TRAVIS: And now Fjord's getting cold feet. 
LAURA: Shut up! 
SAM: This is the best part of the show! 
LAURA: Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here to guide you through what's new in the Critical Role shop. Oops. Oh my gosh, it's so amazing. Style should never be a dump stat, darling. Oooh, so comfy cozy. This is seriously magical. Roll an investigation if you want. It's basically perfect. Look at this. Isn't it fashion? So much fashion happening here. I mean, the Traveler always says, impulse purchases are a good decision. This is, this is a lot of stuff, you guys. We have like so many cool things right now. And hey if you want, you could head over to the Critical Role shop right now. 
LAURA: You fought well, princesses. But you didn't think winning the throne was gonna be that easy. Did you? [laughter] No, no, no. Midnight draws on. But this battle is just getting started. [laughter] I can't wait to see how this turns out. 
(ominous music) (epic music) (mischievous music) (typewriter clacking) (peaceful music) 
LAURA: (VO) Do you find yourself dealing with low energy, drowsiness, or boredom? 
MARISHA: You may have made a pact with an infernal demon, or you may be suffering from Low CR. 
LAURA: (VO) Low CR is a common condition that affects between most and nearly all adult humans. Low CR, or Low Critical Role, occurs when human people don't have enough nerdy voice actors in their lives. But now, there's a cure! 
MARISHA: I don't let Low CR control my life anymore. 
LAURA: (VO) Beacon is a non-invasive subscription that provides 24 hours exclusive content each day. 
MARISHA: This was when we decided it should look like a gender reveal party. 
LAURA: (VO) Early access to event tickets, members-only Discord, 10% off merchandise, and more. Do not take Beacon if you are allergic to Beacon. Consult your familiar if you think Beacon could work for you. 
MARISHA: Side effects may include excessive enjoyment, overexcitement, and diarrhea. 
LAURA: (VO) Critical Role is in no way a treatment, medication, or anything other than a bunch of nerdy voice actors. Do not watch Critical Role unless you enjoy it. [smoke alarm beeping] 
LAURA: (VO) We repeat. We are absolutely not any sort of help... anything. To learn more, visit beacon.tv, or find it on your App Store. 
MARISHA: Tomorrow feels a little brighter now that I have Beacon. (loud crunching) 

Part II[]
SAM: (high-pitched) Theodore! (laughter) 
MATT: And welcome back. All righty. (laughter) 
MATT: So Bells Hells cresting off into the Fey horizon, guided by the memory of Fearne Calloway. Once absconding off into the various realms of the dark fey and beyond, Ira Wendagoth, who you've called from his hiding spot on Ruidus to join you this side of the realms. You all right? 
MARISHA: Yeah, it's just my neck, sorry, keep going. 
MATT: Don't do that. 
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm just going to drop dead one day. (laughter) 
MATT: I was like-- 
TRAVIS: That's my job! (laughter) 
LIAM: All right, Laudna. 
MATT: And guided by the-- 
ASHLEY: Glass bottle back there? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: The spectral steeds that were conjured by Nana Morri to send you on your way, you crest through the clouds, but whereabouts do you want to spend this journey? They're moving at a rapid speed. You are (wind whooshing) cresting through. You're uncertain how soon you'll get there, but you're moving at quite a high speed. You want to stay above everything? Do you want to stay below in the tree line? What's your plot? 
MARISHA: Do we have any way to help conceal our high speed journey? 
TALIESIN: I mean... 
LAURA: I mean, we could Pass Without a Trace. 
TALIESIN: Would that actually work on that? 
LAURA: It-- 
ROBBIE: How bright are the flying horses? Are they glowing like celestial? 
LAURA: Or like see-through? Oh, look at that. 
TALIESIN: Neon pegasi. (laughter) 
LAURA: That was so fast. 
LIAM: Did you craft that at the break? 
SAM: No, this was on from the beginning of the show. 
ROBBIE: Really? 
LAURA: What? 
MARISHA: Is that true? 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
LAURA: How? 
ROBBIE: That's the meme horse from the, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Critical Role is scripted. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah, so are they glowy celestials, or are they ghosty? 
MATT: They're more spectral. They give a very, very faint light, but they're not like bright beacons of glowing light in the sky. 
ASHLEY: We could try to Pass Without a Trace. Do you think that would work? 
MATT: You can give it a shot. 
TALIESIN: There's part of me that wants to be like the dodging under, dodging the trees sounds like a lot of fun. 
SAM: Like a speeder? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, like a speeder. I want to see the turning radius on these. 
LAURA: She gave us a specific warning, don't go above the tree line. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Well, she said we could go above the tree line, but it would be riskier. 
LAURA: It would attract more attention. 
MARISHA: But faster. 
LAURA: I also don't want them to see us when we're approaching. 
LIAM: What if we spend the first 20 minutes at a full pace on the tippy tops and then dive in for a speeder? 
MARISHA: I'm fine with that. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: Sure. 
LIAM: My horse is called Mochi. 
SAM: Oh. 
ROBBIE: Are we naming them now? 
TALIESIN: Of course we are. 
SAM: We usually do and we also usually kill them, but we can't kill these. 
LAURA: They're already ghosts. 
TALIESIN: Challenge accepted. 
ROBBIE: Can we stack them? 
SAM: Yes. (laughter) 
LIAM: What else do you do with horses? 
MARISHA: Mine will be Wagu. 
MATT: Wagu. 
ROBBIE: Are they all food? 
MATT: Mochi. 
MARISHA: I tend to name mine food. 
SAM: They're all Japanese foods? (laughter) 
SAM: Mine will be Udon. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: What is this land you speak of? 
LIAM: I picked Mochi because he's squishy. 
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: He's a squishy jelly horse. 
TRAVIS: Edamame. 
LAURA: Mine's Pocky. 
MATT: Pocky, okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's a good one. 
TRAVIS: Grab up the names before they're gone. 
ROBBIE: I'll be Shishito. 
MATT: Shishito, all right. 
ROBBIE: It's a little spicy. 
LIAM: Anyone want to grab Natto? 
TALIESIN: It's tempting. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to be... 
LAURA: Panda. (laughter) 
SAM: Panda Express? (laughter) 
LAURA: A little chocolate one. 
ASHLEY: Let me think on it and then it'll come to me. Just give me a second. 
MARISHA: Ramune. 
ASHLEY: Hmm? 
LAURA: Ramune is good. 
MATT: The stakes couldn't be lower. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: They're going to die in an hour. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Takoyaki. 
ASHLEY: Takoyaki. 
LAURA: Oh, that's good, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Let me think on it, let me think on it. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: California Roll. 
ASHLEY: I was thinking Marzipan, but that's going to throw everything off. 
ROBBIE: That's perfect. 
LAURA: Marzipan is kind of cute, though. 
MARISHA: It is pretty cute. 
MATT: I love that. Break the theme, be yourself. 
ASHLEY: Well, I kind of want to be in the theme. Whatever, it's Marzipan for now, and then I'll think of another name. 
MATT: Great. 
ASHLEY: Let's move on. This is not important. 
MATT: Writing this all down. 
SAM: Pretty important. 
MATT: No, I'm not. 
ROBBIE: Did you say Angela Lansbury? 
TALIESIN: Well, I was saying "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" because so the flying horses without feet are from "Bedknobs and Broomsticks." (laughter) 
TALIESIN: When the knights, and the-- go kill the Nazis. It's great. 
MATT: All the great flavors of the world. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: The umami, if you will. You have the marzipan. You have the-- 
ROBBIE: The Angela Lansbury. (laughter) 
MATT: Fearne, you and Ira begin to see the hue of landscape begin to shift quickly in this journey, and you begin to recognize some of the surrounding rolling mountainscape to remind you of that time in your youth that you snuck off and explored for a good solid week, week and a half, where we recovered by Nana Morri. While you were out and about trying to spread your legs a little bit. Spread your wings. (mumbling) 
ASHLEY: I was spreading those legs all over town. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: For anyone that takes that out of context. 
MATT: I was trying to say-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Can't be done. Can't be done. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Stretch! Stretch your legs, spread your wings! 
MATT: I know! They both collided. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Just the scissoring of wings and legs, just for effect. 
SAM: Just going at it there. (laughter) 
SAM: Sowing your wild pussy. (laughter) 
MATT: Goddamn it. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Spread your legs, girl. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Oh, man. 
MARISHA: (pleasant sigh) 
MATT: Goddamn it. 
ASHLEY: You know it! You know me. (laughter) 
LIAM: Spread your legs and fly! 
ASHLEY: Just spread my legs and fly, that's all-- Finally got a week away and I just had to spread them open. 
MATT: Inescapable. I am my own doom. (laughter) 
SAM: Put it on a shirt. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. (laughter) 
MATT: Why do I come here? 
MARISHA: That's right up there with shiver and quiff. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Put it on the ass of a pair of sweatpants. There you go. 
ROBBIE: So funny. 
ASHLEY: Holy shit. 
SAM: Okay, okay. (laughter) 
SAM: We forgive Matt. We love Matt. 
TALIESIN: We love Matt. 
SAM: Move on. 
ASHLEY: Just sitting here waiting with my legs open. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Akimbo. 
LIAM: He has to say so many words, guys. 
ASHLEY: My legs akimbo. 
LIAM: So many words. 
MATT: They're filling a parachute at this speed. 
TALIESIN: You're good. You're good. 
LIAM: Oh my goodness. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I had a week and a half where I was just out and about, spreading my hooves. 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: ♪ With hooves wide open ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: You begin to recognize this strange region as you approach, the rolling patterns of cliffs and crevices that waves of rock and timberland frozen mid-crash, arcing and locked in place, this tumultuous snapshot of an entire region in cataclysm frozen. The colors of the twilight sun here catch looks like gemstone hues of purple and blue against the chaotic woodland that calls you in, and wrapping throughout the very peaks and valleys that wind through it. Numerous of the cliffs here spill sourceless waterfalls that tumble hundreds of feet into the brush or chasm around there, gently cascading before vanishing into the wind. If you stare long enough, you swear you can see parts of the carpet-like treetops beneath you shift at the edges like a giant's mossy arm reaching for purchase. You know you're near and a short way into this, you can barely see atop one of the nearest mountain peaks of these Sierras. Maybe a brief ride away, a visible outline of structures and towers and you're fairly certain that this is likely your destination. So you all kind of-- 
ASHLEY: I think this is it. 
MATT: -- coast down into the top of the tree line. Now, are you skirting the top, or are you going into the trees? 
ASHLEY: I think we should go down. 
LAURA: (whooshes) Speeder style. 
ASHLEY: Now that we're close. Yeah, speeder style. 
MATT: You got it. All righty. With that, you all begin to descend and you've been going quickly on these horses. It isn't until you get beneath the tree line that it's immediately (trees whipping by), it is whipping past. These horses, you try to pull the reins to go slow. They're going. You're steering them, but they are moving to the destination. You didn't conjure these. They were conjured for a purpose and they are a bit beyond your control, so each of you, I need a group-- 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: -- either athletics or acrobatics check, your choice. 
LAURA: Animal handling. 
MATT: I'll allow animal handling if you prefer that over the other. 
SAM: Oh, thank you. Wait, do we all have to choose the same stat? 
TALIESIN and MATT: No. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (uncertain noises) 
MARISHA: Oh sorry, sorry. 
TALIESIN: I'll take it. 
MATT: All righty, starting on this end. 
TRAVIS: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20. As you're coasting through the space here, flinging by, one catches the side of your face and you feel one of the branches scratch the side of your cheek and you can feel that faint bit of warmth begin to hit. No damage taken. 
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 
MATT: But these branches are-- You barely miss one and it's already cut right past your face. 
TRAVIS: 22. These branches are sharp. 
MARISHA: 18. 
MATT: 18. You're following in Chetney's wake as that branch that moves past strikes you right across the jaw and shoulder and carves right past it like a blade. You take four points of slashing damage. 
MARISHA: It cuts the side of my mouth and exposes a bit of my back gum. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Want to know how I got these scars? 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Dorian. 
ROBBIE: 24. 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: 24. 
LAURA: Because you have ghosty horses on your own. 
ROBBIE: I'm very strong. I've been riding side saddle the whole time, by the way. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Just so you know. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: I only assume. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: As most of them are hitting the top of the canopy where it's densest, you, who have done some riding in your time, coast just below where they are and begin to avoid the most dense portion of it (wind whipping) whip between, feeling fairly confident in this space. Braius. 
SAM: My hoof keeps falling out of the stirrup. (laughter) 
SAM: I rolled a 14. 
MATT: A 14. Trying to keep up with the others, your spectral steed seems to be pulling at the reins as you tug on one side, bucking your intent, and in that frustration, your hoof slipping out of the spectral stirrup. As it does, one branch knocks you in the shoulder, hitting your armor, no damage, but the impact sends you careening and beginning to angle off the top of the steed to correct yourself. The steed corrects with a back turn, its ass end skidding a little bit. Wham! Into one of the nearby trees. (impacts) Impact as it's ringing through your ears as you take nine points of bludgeoning damage. 
SAM: Ow. Ow, ow, ow. 
ASHLEY: Sheesh. 
MATT: Fearne. 
ASHLEY: 16. 
MATT: 16. You see Braius take this impact. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that sucks. (laughter) 
MATT: As he picks up speed and spins away, this heavy branch catches the edge of his steed and his leg pulls away. As you fall behind, it gets released and slaps you for two points of slashing damage. 
MATT: Imogen. 
LAURA: 20. 
MATT: 20. Coasting down carefully following behind, you watch as Fearne gets struck and you fall into that position behind, avoiding that branch. 
ROBBIE: Horse girl. 
ASHLEY: Horse girl. 
MATT: You're comfy in this space. 
LAURA: I'm like down. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: 24. I'm smaller than the back of the horse's head. 
MATT: You are. You jockey, set yourself up behind, keeping a very narrow profile, (horse swooshing) running the space simulator grid of the interior of this forest upper area, dodging through them all. 
MATT: Ashton. 
TALIESIN: 16. 
MATT: 16. You as the one following up on the tail, end up coming just above the canopy for a moment because you have to, a series of branches and thorns catch your way and you duck up just in time to catch a strange fey bird in flight. Its two necks encircle like a corkscrew spiral as it picks up as well, and a split second, you see it go (screeching) as you (crashing) and barrel into it, its feathers (poofing). 
SAM: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: How dare you Fabio me. Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) Yep. You take five points of bludgeoning damage. 
TALIESIN: Five points. 
MATT: And the fey bird is no more as you have to wipe the remnants of it off of your shoulder. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
MATT: But with that, you begin to slow down as Ira and Fearne, you begin to reach the edge of the thinning tree line. It doesn't go away. This whole place is fairly overgrown, but it begins to give way slightly to a number of small, fairly left paths to be overgrown and left to disuse. They begin to move and shift beneath you and you begin to follow those as a sign to gradually lead you towards your destination as you-- 
ASHLEY: (bouncing) 
MATT: -- skid to a slower point. Eventually the branches, safer speed. You coast down lower, lower, lower, to reach the base of the trees. Just gently drifting through them until eventually you can see, approaching rapidly, what looks like a stone wall standing about 15 feet high. 
ASHLEY: Slow down, slow down, slow down. 
LIAM: Orym's threat radar is up. 
SAM: Throat radar? 
LIAM: Threat. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: (radar beeping) 
LIAM: You're our throat radar. 
ASHLEY: (grunts) 
LIAM: That is 29. 
MATT: 29, okay. As you all slowly come to a stop, the steeds drifting there before they, one-by-one, (whooshes) dissipate. The destination reached, the spell comes to a close, and you all are dropped down onto your own two legs. 
ASHLEY: Maybe Shabu Shabu would've been a good name. 
SAM: Shabu Shabu would be a great name. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to name him Shabu Shabu. 
SAM: And he disappears. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MATT: I dub thee Sha-- Oh... (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Didn't like that name. (laughter) 
LIAM: Ira, where is this? What is this? 
MATT: "This here, friends, was once a well-celebrated center for all means of artistic expression. There is was whole community of free fey that found home, found purpose, and found community until a dark and terrible fate befell them. Some likely still rest within, as those that remained fled, never to return. They say the very ground of this town is cursed, haunted by those who despise the guidance of the Arch Heart from within his temple." 
MARISHA: They don't like the Arch Heart? 
MATT: "To have poisoned those who crafted in his image, I imagine they likely weren't fans." 
MARISHA: It's fair. 
SAM: You said an arts community? 
MATT: "Generally all communication, all forms of expression given physical form, whether that be performing arts, crafts, sculpture, music, all the things that make free fey strange and boring." 
SAM: Theater. 
MARISHA: Do you think the Arch Heart still watches over this place or that he's forsaken it? 
MATT: "I wouldn't know. I don't dally in divine circles." 
MARISHA: Mm. 
SAM: Let's go in. 
MATT: "Best to stay quiet." And he disappears from view. 
LIAM: How high is the wall in front of us? 
MATT: About 15 or so feet. You don't see a particular entrance from this point, but you can see it's cracked and it's heavily overgrown. There are thick bits of ivy and vine that have taken root and essentially overtaken much of the wall. It has that abandoned urban decay feel to it where nature has definitely reclaimed the stone work and the structure. 
LIAM: Covered in vine: climbable? 
MATT: Could be, yeah. Want to give it a shot? 
LIAM: Yes, I do. 
MATT: Make an athletic check. 
ASHLEY: Careful with that vine. 
LIAM: Okay, athletics? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Okay. (thinking noises) Oh, no, that's acrobatics, which would just be one. Natural 20. 
MATT: Ooh, woo! 
LIAM: So that is 25 total. 
MATT: 25 total. 
TRAVIS: Boy howdy. 
MATT: (acrobatic leaping and climbing) Like a monkey climbing its favorite tree, Orym, without issue, a grace to his movement, seems to trapeze artist leap along the wall until you crest to its top. As you reach the precipice and glance over, you can see within this peanut-shaped wall that surrounds this city. It has a smaller interior that then curves out to a much larger space of it. Within is a sprawling village of beautiful buildings of Elvish and Fey design. These little spiraling tower-peaked buildings, these abandoned tents that have fallen in on themselves. You can see all manner of stone-carved structures and reliefs and statues and beautiful freestanding archways that accompany every major road intersection, themselves also overgrown. Everything here is overgrown. Green and blue and gray leaf and vine and bush that seems to have infiltrated and overtaken much of the visible structure. You can just see peeking through along some of the bases and the edges the glimmer of old stone. 
LIAM: Are there any signs with that 29 perception of Fey or Cerberus life? 
MATT: I'll get to that in just a second. What you also notice is in the center of that larger curved outer wall on the opposite end of where you're standing, there are a number of towers that rise up. They all themselves also appear to be mostly retaken, like the vines are still climbing to reach the peak or apex of it, but in time, still haven't completed their journey. There is one stone structure that is, stands taller than the others, built intentionally to be the visual pinnacle of all the surrounding city itself. This beautiful, wide roof, temple-like structure has the multiple squat hut-like roofs made of cerulean stone with purple crystal lining the outside. As those expand outward to multiple sections, you can see there's rising towers that eventually come into a dual peak that is connected by numerous small walkways in between. It is beautiful. There are emerald or jade inlaid designs that meet and spiral into each other along the length of these rising towers. You can see banners that still flicker, though now they are tattered and weathered over time. It looks to definitely be the centerpiece of this village, this town. 
LIAM: Forgive me, was that the center of it all or at the opposite wall? 
MATT: The center-- I said that the outer wall forms almost a peanut shaped or an eight, an upside down eight. It's in the center of the larger rounded wall area where you're up on the smaller section. 
LIAM: Thank you. 
MATT: Glancing around, a lot of the town, you see carts in the middle of the road. You see what look to be banners and a whole marketplace, frozen and forgotten. It looks like everyone just vanished. You look closer and you see shreds of old cloth. You see shapes that are humanoid, lying down, overgrown. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You can now see that much of the vine and bush that you at first glance saw was just a retaken township are bodies that have been cocooned, more or less, by the expansion of Fey nature. 
MARISHA: Is there a way to tell by the overgrowth how long ago this all took place? 
MATT: The rest of you want to try and climb up and join him? 
TRAVIS: I'm going to join him. 
LAURA: I'm going to use a sorcery point and just fly on up. 
SAM: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Show off. 
MATT: Drift to the top, no issue. 
MARISHA: I'll Spider Climb. 
TALIESIN: I'll hop up. 
MATT: (skittering) 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: I'll climb. 
MATT: Those that are climbing, athletics checks, please. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: I'm also going to spend another sorcery point and my eyes are going to turn white with a little bit of a glowing, flash of red every once in a while, just kind of (sparking flashes), and I'm going to be able to see invisibility. 
LIAM: Sick. 
LAURA: I want to be able to-- 
MATT: Cool. 
LAURA: -- see Ira, wherever he is. 
ASHLEY: Good. 
MARISHA: That's a good idea. 
MATT: Indeed. As that flickers on as you fly up, you see already at the top of the wall, maybe three feet from Orym, perched up there, his knees and elbows bent and upward to the point where he looks like a spider that has come to rest on its prey. He's just perched at the top, overlooking and scanning the cityscape, that weird drifting magic that obscures him from most vision glimmering around him. 
TRAVIS: 16. 
MATT: 16. 
MATT: You had Spider Climb. 
ROBBIE: What? 
MATT: What did you roll for athletics? 
ROBBIE: Oh, 22. 
MATT: 22. 
SAM: 12. 
MATT: 12. 
ASHLEY: Three. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
MATT: Three. Ashton? 
ASHLEY: My hooves are so slippery. 
TALIESIN: 19. 
SAM: Mine are, too. 
MATT: 19. Okay, so-- 
LAURA: Oh, it's the hooves. 
ASHLEY: It's really so hard to climb straight up a wall. 
MATT: Most of you rolled pretty good. It's going to take you a little bit to get up there, but you do manage to finally get Fearne up to the top of the hill. 
SAM: Grab my tail. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
MATT: While this is happening-- 
LAURA: Doesn't that hurt? That's like your spine. 
MATT: -- because of the time it takes-- 
SAM: It's worth it. 
MATT: -- you catch some movement deeper in the town, and you get a glimpse of what would've been the main street that snakes through the central part of this village. It leads from the, what would've been currently the closed and locked gate that is just out of your view from where you arrived, snakes through the town and heads towards that central building. You see what looks to be a group of armored figures, dark armored figures that are now walking through the desolate, still, and abandoned town. 
LIAM: So the larger part of the hourglass around that structure. 
MATT: Yeah, they're heading that direction. 
LAURA: What about her dad's dragon? Any sign of that in the sky? 
MATT: No. Don't see her dragon. You don't see anything else beyond this cluster of figures. 
TRAVIS: As I try to get to the top, can I use Hunter's Bane to sense for, certainly going to be a bunch of fey, but any fiends or undead in the area since this is a cursed town? 
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make a general perception check to see if you can pick out in the wind something that-- 
TRAVIS: 17. 
MATT: 17. 
TRAVIS: With the nas. 
MATT: Sniffing on the wind, you sense there is an aged, you sense there is an aged, dire air to this town, definitely that lingering scent of historical loss and tragedy. But where you stand now, nothing undead, nothing fiend, nothing fey, aside from some of your compatriots, catches your attention. 
TRAVIS: Only deserted stank-ass people. Okay. 
MARISHA: Is this wall that we're on, does it have a parapet that we can walk around? 
MATT: It does. There's probably a good five, six feet of width between the two edges where you can step in between. There's about a two-foot rise on each side, like a lip where you could maybe crouch down and move, depending on your size, comfortably, but it does seem to walk along the perimeter. 
TALIESIN: Do we want a little Pass Without a Trace going on? 
LAURA: Mm. 
LIAM: Yep. 
TALIESIN: I am casting Pass Without a Trace. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: How's that work? Is that a stay close to you kind of thing, or anywhere we go? I can't remember. 
TALIESIN: Somewhat close. Where is it? 
MARISHA: 30 feet, I think. 
MATT: I think so, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. We inch closer. 
MATT: Yeah. Each creature within 30 feet of him gets that bonus. 
ROBBIE: Did you tell us that there's people there in the distance? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Do we know how many? 
LIAM: Well, how many did I see? 
MATT: At a rapid glance, you would've seen maybe eight. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: The armor would not be-- 
MATT: Eight or nine figures. It's too far. 
ROBBIE: Well, it's not a platoon. 
MATT: It's too far to make out any specific details. 
LIAM: That's what we've seen so far. We have to assume that Gloomglut, Gloamglut. 
LAURA: (glottal) Gloamglut. 
LIAM: (glottal) Gloamglut. Gloamglut. I like them mushy potaters. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Is around. Right? What are we doing? 
MARISHA: I don't know. I was just-- 
SAM: Are we waiting for something to happen? 
LAURA: Or are we actually attacking? Are we going to attack? 
LIAM: The whole point is to sour the Unseelie on Luda. What's going to sour them on Luda? Us attacking them? 
SAM: No. 
LIAM: No. 
TALIESIN: We need more information-- 
SAM: Are we on the top of the wall still? 
LAURA: Yeah, we should go down. 
SAM: Yeah, let's go down and stealth. 
TALIESIN: We need to see what's actually happening. 
MARISHA: We're going to go down? We can skitter around. 
SAM: On the wall? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Yeah, there's a slight little-- 
TALIESIN: Let's skitter 'til we find a nice easy path. There's got to be a way up and down here. 
MARISHA: I agree with Ashton. Let's get closer. 
TALIESIN: Make note that I'm agreed with-- 
LAURA: We're seeable to be walking along the top of a wall. 
MARISHA: No, it's a parapet. So there's like, we can crouch. 
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: There's a two-foot lip. 
LAURA: Got it. 
LIAM: From below, that's-- 
SAM: Skitter. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that helps. 
MATT: It's not a lot of space to stay in. 
TALIESIN: We got some Pass Without a Trace. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to use another sorcery point. No, I can't do that. I'm going to cast Invisibility. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Wow. Don't trust the Pass. All right. 
LAURA: No, I do. I do. I just don't trust me. 
TALIESIN: No, that's fair. 
MATT: Okay, so are you heading along the wall perimeter or are you descending into the town? 
MARISHA: I vote perimeter, at least for a little bit. 
LIAM: Yeah. I would, too. 
TRAVIS: If you can fly and get down quick, yeah, that's fine. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'll go down on the ♪ ground ♪ 
LIAM: Just because we-- 
TRAVIS: I threw myself on the ground. 
MARISHA: (swats) 
MATT: So you're clambering into the town? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm a werewolf. 
MATT: Okay. Anybody else joining Chetney into the-- 
LAURA: I'll fly down and hover next to him. I don't want to touch the ground in here. 
LIAM: You don't have us brain linked, do you? 
LAURA: I could do that before I turn invisible. 
LIAM: I don't know how your shit works. That'd be helpful. 
LAURA: Okay. I am going to have done that. If we're splitting up and I knew that was going to happen, I'd telepathically link us before. All right, so I link us all. 
MATT: Okay. So we have you flying, you coasting down below, and who else in the floor, if anybody? Rest of you on the parapet? 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I'm going to Spider Climb. So if there's that two-foot lip, I'm going to Spider Climb on the inside of the two-foot. 
MATT: Sounds good. 
MARISHA: What were you going to say? 
ROBBIE: I don't know. My gut's I want to go down with Chetney for some reason. 
MARISHA: Go down. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to go. Yeah. I don't know why I'm like censoring myself. 
SAM: Do well down there. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Be brave. You have my inspiration. 
ROBBIE: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: Damn. 
MATT: You notice invisibly, Ira follows you down into the town as well. I need everyone to make a stealth check for me, please. 
ASHLEY: Plus 10. 
TALIESIN: If you're upstairs. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
MATT: Those who are on the parapet with Ashton get plus 10. 
LAURA: Do we get advantage if we're invisible? 
MATT: If you're invisible, you have advantage, yes. 
TALIESIN: Thank god because that was a shit roll. 
MATT: All right, let's start over here with Ashton. 
TALIESIN: 20. 
MATT: 20. Okay. 
LIAM: 19. 
MATT: Orym. All right. 
LAURA: 24. 
MATT: 24. Okay. 
ASHLEY: 16. 
MATT: 16 with the plus 10? 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: 32. 
MATT: All righty. 
SAM: With disadvantage. 
ROBBIE: Dirty 20. 
MATT: Dirty 20. 
SAM: I thought you were going down with them. Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes. 
MARISHA: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
TRAVIS: 25. 
ROBBIE: Ooh. 
MATT: 25. 
TALIESIN: I feel really good about that Pass Without a Trace now because oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: It was rough. 
TALIESIN: We would've been-- 
MATT: As you guide in separate directions, those of you moving along the wall, you get partway around the edge before you see an element of that parapet has fallen inward. There's about a six-foot gap and about an eight-foot chunk of that walkway that has fallen in and tumbled down into a pile of stone and rubble below. There are vines and various other bits of growth that have clambered up through that bit and holding it there that could be leapt across, but it's a bit touch and go. It doesn't seem impossible. 
TALIESIN: Maybe it's time to roll down at this point. 
LIAM: Meaning it's just exposed. 
MATT: It's exposed, and to get across, you have to carefully go down and follow to the opposite side. It just bows down slightly. 
TALIESIN: Maybe this is the point to start heading down. 
MARISHA: I'm staying up here. You can join them if you want. 
TALIESIN: You got to-- Yeah. 
MARISHA: I'm made of paper. 
SAM: I think we can still stay up here for a while longer. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Okay. You all carefully maneuver across this gap. Fearne, your hoof catches one of the knots in this branch and it snaps under your hoof and you lose your footing for a second. Ashton, you reach back quickly and catch her arm and keep her from tumbling the full 20 feet down into it and pull her up, but the root in a section of the cracked stone, like (clattering). 
SAM: Clop, clop, clop, clop. 
TALIESIN: Shit. 
LIAM: Just hold for a second. 
MATT: Those of you on the ground hear it, everyone keeps quiet and still. 
TRAVIS: Full prone. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Moment later, you watch this hawk and circle overhead and it circles twice-- 
MARISHA: Shit. 
MATT: -- before it vanishes back in the direction of that central structure. 
MARISHA: Shit. 
TRAVIS: That was no hawk. 
LAURA: Did it make any noise? It just passed over and didn't-- 
MATT: Just quietly passed overhead. 
LAURA: Shit. 
MATT: 100 feet up. 
MARISHA: I send Pâté. 
LAURA: How far? It was 100 feet up? 
MATT: About 100, 150 feet up. 
ROBBIE: We all saw it? 
MATT: Yeah. It was-- 
LAURA: It was 100 feet up? Hmm. 
MARISHA: I make Pâté invisible and I send him after the hawk. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Follow him. 
MATT: "What? The bird?" 
MARISHA: Yes. The fucking bird. 
MATT: "Okay." (whooshes) 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: He's not as fast as the hawk, but he is doing his best. 
ASHLEY: (wings flapping) 
MARISHA: Little-- 
MATT: (fluttering) Okay. Now, are you just letting him go or are you looking through his eyes? 
MARISHA: No, I'm just-- I'm not going to look. I'm going to keep going. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: But he's going. 
MATT: All right. You all, feeling the hawk out of your current vision and carefully situated yourself as unseen at the moment, continue to step along the edge of the wall and through the town. Those who are on the ground, you're skittering from building, shaded alleyway to shaded alleyway, through and between these beautiful towns. Like these are homes that are built not just for function, but for presentation. Every house seems to have custom-carved wood framing alongside each window sill that catches your attention. As old and as weathered as it may be, a lot of beautiful craftsmanship. It surrounds every nook and cranny here. Every door frame seems to be its own unique shape. Every doorknob seems to be its own beautifully cast iron design to it. Some look like it's a rooted tree that digs into and spreads out into the door. Others have a beautiful, geometric design to its intersection, like the knob itself is a key and a lock. There is some uniform idea of architecture throughout parts of the city, but it seems like every building is trying to carve its own identity and tell you a little bit of whoever may have lived inside, at least from what you can see, because much of the town still remains completely swallowed by what the Fey Realm has taken back. Eventually, you skirt the exterior of this main roadway. The trees that were once beautiful parks and central cultivated natural spaces within this town begin to greet you as you move from that smaller ring into the larger one. And keeping your eyes peeled, the hawk does not seem to return. 
MARISHA: I now peek into Pâté's eyes. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Following the hawk. 
MATT: You now peek into Pâté's eyes and Pâté is carefully floating above a group of trees that surrounds and encircles that central structure, that massive stone, dual tower building. He's flying there, glancing around like he's looking for the hawk, but doesn't see it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: As we're moving slowly through the streets, do I spot any of the humanoid shapes that have been fallen to the ground and overtaken by some of the growth? 
MATT: You see many of them. 
TRAVIS: Any within-- Any close that I could go up and try and inspect? 
MATT: Yeah. Make an investigation check. 
TRAVIS: Instead of investigation, I will touch it and use Dark Augmentations. 
LAURA: Ah. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Yes, yes. 
TRAVIS: I'm sorry-- 
MARISHA: Grim Psychometry. 
ASHLEY: Grim Psychometry. 
TRAVIS: Grim Psychometry. 
MATT: Yep. 
TRAVIS: What did I say, Dark Augmentation? 
MATT: Go ahead and roll a history check. 
LAURA: Ooh, Dark Augmentation! 
ASHLEY: That would be cool. 
TRAVIS: Oh yes. We're going to eat. 22. 
MATT: 22. So you reach down carefully and pull back some of the softer bits of the ivy and various other leaves that have covered the majority of this corpse. As you pull it back, you can see these beautiful cerulean robes, now grayed with dust and age. You can see the skeletal shape of a face, skin pulled tight and almost mummified against the elvish bone features, the vacant empty sockets, and the lips curled back tight, exposing the teeth. As you reach over to touch it, you see them on the ground, their eyes glazed over with blood pouring from their mouth and nose and ears and the middle of their eyes as it all begins to seep back in. As it all pulls in, they convulse. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a reverse order! 
MATT: The foam pulling back in until they stand back up. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Catch themself, looking around, and others around are coughing, too, and reaching for each other. Then they start walking back and smiling. 
SAM: Cool! 
LAURA: That is so cool. 
TRAVIS: It's an OK Go video, man. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome. 
MATT: They take the hand of a little boy-- 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: -- and brush something into his hair. They both walk back and they take an apple from the kid and put it back on a nearby tree. You see them walk backward as you pull back into, it would seem like a gentle festival, or maybe every day is like this. You don't know. But there is a vibrance and a life to the people here. Even the color of this landscape is different in this dream. Even the perpetual twilight of the Fey Realm that sits in this region hits more in the amber hues. This mountaintop village was once a safe and protected space. As you watch them return back to the inside their abode and setting their satchel down as if they were ready to go out and head to the market, they come back to the kitchen and finish spitting their tea into their cup. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Set the water back into the kettle. You stay focused on that kettle, and you feel that (roiling), that simmering, ominous sense of something settled within that liquid, within all the liquid. You feel the groundwater itself, the various rivers and streams and waterfalls of the surrounding chasms and valley. Something settled within the life's blood of this culture and snuffed it. (inhales sharply) You pull back to touching the edge of that skull and as you pull your hand back, the brush falls back over to obfuscate it. 
TRAVIS: (shuddering scoff) 
ASHLEY: What'd you see? 
TRAVIS: There was something in the water, something that poisoned this entire place, permeated everything. 
MARISHA: Jeez. 
TRAVIS: (scoffs) 
LAURA: Did it feel like an actual being that poisoned it or the water itself was part of the entity? 
TRAVIS: Couldn't tell. 
LIAM: This is a psychic conversation. 
LAURA: Yeah, obviously. 
TRAVIS: (sputters and spits) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Pâté picks up now that cluster of armored figures beginning to step up towards the opening to this temple. You can see around the exterior of it, there are beautiful archways partially crumbled on each side of the main opening. You can see there are windows on the edges that themselves are overgrown as well, banners that lay tattered, slowly drifting with the breeze from the outside of the stone structure itself as it rises up beyond view. The rocky landscape around here has multiple levels and layers to it with trees that have grown up out of it. You watch as three of the figures enter the temple and the rest of them fan out to protect and keep watch. Two figures, one with a heavy shield and one with a massive, dual-handed axe, stand side by side, almost shoulder to shoulder, about five feet apart, protecting the entrance to this temple. There's those two. Three others you see scatter amongst the nearby brush, staying low and vanishing from Pâté's sight. Actually, roll a perception check for Pâté, if you don't mind. 
MARISHA: Oh boy. 
ROBBIE: You can do it. 
MARISHA: This is not his strong suit. 
ROBBIE: He can do it. 
TALIESIN: You should really attach-- 
MARISHA: He can do it. 
TALIESIN: -- some eyes to him at some point. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Nat 20, Pâté, let's go. 
ASHLEY: So that massive stone tower is-- 
MARISHA: Wisdom, right? 
ROBBIE: Let's go, Pâté. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Come on, Pâté. 
TRAVIS: Come on, Pâté. 
MARISHA: Come on, Pâté. Seven. 
MATT: Three of these figures that are in lighter armor, and you've encountered these sort of, this type of armor design before when you first assaulted the-- 
MARISHA: His passive perception's 11, so his passive is higher than that. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: That's the active search. 
MARISHA: Keep going. 
LIAM: Familiars. 
MATT: Yeah. They can only be so helpful. 
MARISHA: Yeah, he's a dead rat. 
TRAVIS: Kind of. 
TALIESIN: Some of it. 
MATT: The Unseelie armor that you recognize from your last assault on the secondary Malleus Key here allows you to see the design of these folks definitely ties them to the same faction, tangentially or directly, you're uncertain. But the heavily armored two stand at the front while the less armored three separate and then disappear into the nearby brush and trees. The thing you also pick up, it looks like a dark hound, like a dog of some kind with jet black fur that also begins to walk and patrol around. Pâté only catches a glimpse of its head as it turns, its long, wolf-like ears that point backwards. Where its snout is, you just see a human face-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Wow! 
MATT: -- turn and go (slobbery growl). 
ROBBIE: No. 
TRAVIS: Cool! 
MATT: It has little red burning coals for eyes. It stands about shoulder high to one of the armored figures. 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: It like-- (stands firm) 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: As the three of them vanish, that hound begins to walk around and keep a patrol out front. So they seem to have-- 
TRAVIS: They do have a watch. 
MATT: They have set up a watch position here outside. 
MARISHA: Is any of the figures heading into this temple structure? 
MATT: Three of them entered originally. 
MARISHA: Three of them entered, two heavily armored, one not so much, or no? 
MATT: From what you entered-- From the ones that you saw enter, you didn't get quite a good look at them at first. 
MARISHA: But there are two very heavily armed guards guarding the door. 
MATT: Correct. There are five figures outside, three of which have vanished from view into the nearby brush, and two that guard the immediate entrance. 
MARISHA: Three heavily armored. 
MATT: And that hound that's in the perimeter, and then three that vanished inside the temple. 
LIAM: This is a spot that only Pâté can see at the moment. 
MATT: At the moment, yeah. 
LAURA: The manticore, is that what it is? 
MATT: It's not a manticore. 
LAURA: It's not a manticore? 
TALIESIN: No, just manticore-esque. 
LIAM: Those faceless things that we ran into? 
MATT: It's not those. 
LAURA: No, it's not that? 
LIAM: Something new? 
MATT: It's not those either. This is a large black hound creature-- 
TRAVIS: It's a new friend. 
MARISHA: A new friend? 
MATT: -- but it has a human face there. 
MARISHA: Does he want pets? 
LAURA: That's so-- 
LIAM: We love that. 
MATT: Now, here's the thing. Because Pâté has a view on this, and this might help for spatial awareness. I'll throw a map down and show you. (exclaiming) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go battle these motherfuckers! 
ROBBIE: I'll throw a map down real quick. 
SAM: This combat brought to you-- 
MARISHA: I say all of this to everybody. I say all this to everybody. 
SAM: This combat map! This combat is brought to you by WizKids Minis. Shademother boxed mini for pre-order, first encountered in the table by Bells Hells. Now you can own your own brumestone-embedded hovering horror. The Shademother is sure to turn a few stomachs and a few heads. 
MARISHA: Shademother! 
SAM: Order yours today at wizkids.io/Shademother. 
ASHLEY: Oh! Cool! 
ROBBIE: Whoa! That's out of control! 
ASHLEY: What?! 
LAURA: Wow! 
ROBBIE: What are you talking about? 
ASHLEY: That's cool! 
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Matt! 
ROBBIE: That's crazy! 
MATT: So this is the entrance to this massive temple structure here. 
LAURA: Cool! 
TALIESIN: Oh my-- Wow. 
MATT: Somewhere in the nearby brush are these three figures and this hound-- 
LIAM: With a face. 
MATT: -- that is currently-- 
LAURA: This guy. 
MATT: -- watching the perimeter on that side. 
LAURA: He's like you, Braius. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: But in reverse? 
ROBBIE: You say out loud to your friend. 
TALIESIN: Human face hound. 
ASHLEY: Look at that beautiful-- 
MATT: You're just like us. 
LAURA: -- castle. 
MARISHA: This temple! 
ROBBIE: Wow! 
LIAM: Yeah, and the overgrowth on the top of the building. 
SAM: Where are we on the wall? 
TALIESIN: I know, it's so pretty. 
MATT: You are all on the outside there. The actual, the cityscape surrounds it. Just around this temple, it's more of a, what was once a cultivated garden and forest of trees that has since been left to become overgrown. 
LAURA: Which direction is team ground coming from? 
MATT: You're all coming-- 
TRAVIS: Team ground! 
MATT: -- from this direction here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: The wall's probably a little closer to that direction. 
MARISHA: It's a great question. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
ROBBIE: Did we creep in and watch what was happening? 
SAM: Do we create a distraction? Do we go in, send in some stealthies? 
LAURA: There's six people outside and three inside? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: We don't think the conversation's happening here, do we? Or do we? 
MARISHA: It could be happening inside. 
ROBBIE: We don't know. Should we send in the invisibles to-- 
LIAM: What if we just watched for a few minutes? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: So, yeah. Laudna says all of that over coms. 
LAURA: All right. 
LAURA: Does Pâté see Gloamglut anywhere? 
MARISHA: Does Pâté see Gloamglut? 
ROBBIE: (garbled) Gloamglut. 
MATT: Pâté does not see Gloamglut anywhere. 
TRAVIS: I mean, he didn't see Gloamglut anywhere. You have See Invisibility, right? 
LAURA: I do, but I don't see him. 
TALIESIN: Can Pâté get to one of the windows? 
MARISHA: So that's exactly what I was going to say. Because Pâté is invisible, can I have him swoop down and peek into one of these little top windows? 
MATT: Sure. Have Pâté make a stealth check with advantage. 
TRAVIS: No, no. 
MARISHA: With advantage. 
MATT: Because he's invisible. 
MARISHA: He actually has very high stealth. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, come on you dip shit, let's go! 
MARISHA: Come on, bubby. You got this, buddy. 
TALIESIN: I believe in our 80% rat. 
ASHLEY: Come on, Patty. 
ROBBIE: Come on. 
MARISHA: He's invisibles. 
LIAM: Come on, sneaky Pete. 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. That's not real. That is not real! 
ASHLEY: What? 
MATT: A two and a one. 
LAURA: Wait. Wait, you're right by Orym-- Never mind. 
TALIESIN: No, Pâté is not. 
LAURA: Pâté is not. Am I by Orym-- Does my-- 
MATT: No, no. (laughs) 
MARISHA: No. Okay, cool. 
TRAVIS: It made you a little drunk, it was so bad. 
MARISHA: So that's-- 
MATT: Good try, though. 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was rough. That was rough. 
MARISHA: Seven. 
LAURA: Shit. 
LIAM: Wow. 
MARISHA: He has plus five stealth. He's actually pretty good. 
TRAVIS: You keep saying that. 
LAURA: That's not that good. 
TRAVIS: His perception blew ass and so did his stealth. 
MARISHA: Well, his perception sucks. 
TRAVIS: He's fired. 
MARISHA: But I rolled a two! Okay. 
MATT: So he flies and lands on the edge of the window sill and his feet miss catching a purchase on it and slips and he skitters down. (splat) The sound of heavy bone and preserved rat carcass slap against the stone below. Picks up and flickers his invisibility for a second, "Oh! Sorry. I kind of got--" 
MARISHA: Shut up, shut up, shut up. 
TRAVIS: Shut up, shut up. 
MATT: Your connection's lost. (groaning) 
MARISHA: Shit. 
SAM: Did the-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: We're made. 
LAURA: We're made. 
MARISHA: He's dead. 
LAURA: We're made. 
TRAVIS: Well, Pâté is made. 
MARISHA: Pâté is made. 
LAURA: Well, all of us are made now they know that somebody's here. 
TALIESIN: Well, I mean-- 
SAM: They're at least on edge. 
LIAM: There's lots of little weird-- 
MARISHA: Creatures in the Fey. 
LIAM: -- creatures in the Fey. 
MATT: You do also know that when your familiar is destroyed, they vanish. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: There's no like-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- remnants. 
TRAVIS: Nothing left behind. 
MARISHA: Remnants. 
LAURA: Right, right, right. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. So powdered like a moth. 
MATT: (vaporizing puff) 
ASHLEY: (vaporizing puff) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: So we could still be undercover. 
ASHLEY: I could go up there-- 
TALIESIN: They're on edge at least. 
ASHLEY: -- and be like-- 
LAURA: Hi, Dad. 
ASHLEY: -- Professor, I mean-- 
TRAVIS: I can get a look. 
MARISHA: That's what I was going to say. 
ASHLEY: Sorrowlord sent me here. 
TRAVIS: I'm super stealthy. 
MARISHA: Chetney has a little-- 
LAURA: I can also fly up-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, Chet go do-- 
LAURA: -- and look in a window too. 
MARISHA: And he's got, you're floating. 
TRAVIS: You're invisible, right? 
LAURA: I'm invisible. 
TRAVIS: So you don't have to-- 
ASHLEY: I think you guys should go take a looksie. 
TRAVIS: My stealth is real good though. Is yours? 
LIAM: Watching for a minute while this conversation happens in everyone's heads, is there any visible change in the visible guards? Conversation between them? Reactions of any kind? 
MATT: Because you're still up on the wall, right? 
LIAM and TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah. You cannot tell from this distance. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Right now from your view, you can just barely see the temple now. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So you can't make out any of this. The only reason you're able to know any of this is because of-- 
LIAM: Pâté vision. 
MATT: -- Pâté's vision and-- 
LIAM: And what Laudna-- 
MATT: -- with Laudna keeping an eye. 
LIAM: -- sort of describes. 
MATT: Yeah, the trees are too thick around here from your wall side perspective. 
LIAM: Gotcha. Gotcha. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Why don't we tandem it? 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: You from above, me from below. 
LAURA: All right. 
TRAVIS: We say in our heads. 
LAURA: Okay. What about-- 
MARISHA: Can you send out your eyeball? 
LAURA: Dorian, what are you going to do? 
TRAVIS: I can. 
ROBBIE: I'll go wherever you tell me to. I don't know. What should I do? 
LAURA: I don't know. 
ROBBIE: Do you need help? 
LAURA: No. You going to stay here? 
ROBBIE: Do you want help? 
ASHLEY: Be careful. 
ROBBIE: No, I don't want to stay here. I want to be helpful. 
LAURA: Okay, well, you're not invisible. 
ROBBIE: Okay. (snaps) I'll go invisible. (laughter) 
MATT: There you go. 
LAURA: All right. And so Ira-- Okay, so, great. Now we can all go. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: So ground team is completely invisible. 
LAURA: Ground team is invisible. 
MARISHA: Great. Cool. 
MATT: The rest of you are still-- You're about, I'd say 300, 400 feet on the wall that way. 
ASHLEY: We should start making our way. 
LIAM: We should start getting closer. 
SAM: ♪ Makin' our way ♪ 
TALIESIN: It's time for us to start making our way. 
MATT: ♪ Makin' our way ♪ 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: (high-pitched creaking) 
MARISHA: I'm going to continue to, I'm still Spider Climbing, so I'm staying low and skittering. 
TALIESIN: Stay within 30 feet of us. 
LAURA: Chet and I tandem, were going to try to go in. I'm going to go high, he's going to go low, and we're going to try to get an eye in on the building. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to put on my Monocle of True Essence and cast (gasps) Arcane Eye. 
MARISHA: Hell yes. Let's fucking go. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Could you guys-- 
LAURA: So you see invisibility too now? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Both of us? Great. 
LIAM: -- hold for 30 to 60 so that we can be close to help you instead of having to run eight city blocks. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: No, not true. It's normal vision, but the eye is invisible and it can go as far as it wants to. 
LAURA: Sick. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
TRAVIS: So I can stay back. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Give us 60 seconds to scatter close. 
LIAM: Gives us time to catch up a little. 
ASHLEY: Give us a little time to get there. 
MATT: So the wall team begins to wait for the next portion of the wall where the vine overgrowth has clambered over the edge and descends into the city to carefully climb down. As you're doing so, you said you're gliding up? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Over whereabouts? 
LAURA: Definitely not where Pâté went. But I don't know where he was, so I'm going to look for an open window on a higher level. Is there any? 
MATT: Okay. The towers rise up from here. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: So you could try and look up at the tower on this point, if you want to, or you could look up any of this area, or anything beyond that. 
MARISHA: Want me to stay up and get closer? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'll go high tower and fly up alongside the side of it and see if I can see in the window. 
MATT: Okay. We'll say that you are up here in the high tower, gliding up. 
LIAM: Depends on the description. 
MATT: You are-- 
LIAM: How far it is from the wall. 
SAM: It's a dude taking a shower. 
TRAVIS: Pretty far back. 
MATT: Pretty far back. Way over here, we'll say. 
MARISHA: I mean, I'm not afraid to climb down. 
MATT: Creating an Arcane Eye to drift over. You are invisible, Dorian. 
MARISHA: That's true. 
MATT: Are you staying with Chet? Are you moving in? 
ROBBIE: If they're all splitting up, you worked your way up behind the house? 
LAURA: Yeah, but Chet is still down below. 
LIAM: Maybe just-- 
ROBBIE: Oh, he's flying his eyeball in? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Can I-- How far away are we? 
MATT: I mean, you're all coming in from this direction. So Chet's way off in the bush. 
LAURA: Yeah, he is. 
MATT: Over here. Hang on. 
TRAVIS: Favored terrain. 
ROBBIE: You're up behind the building. 
MATT: She can go ahead now. 
ROBBIE: I want to try to work my way-- (uncertain noise) 
SAM: ♪ Workin' my way ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ Workin' my way ♪ 
ROBBIE: I know, but behind that-- 
MARISHA: (groans) 
SAM: I beat you. 
ROBBIE: Behind that guard that's outside of the periphery-- 
TRAVIS: I beat you! 
ROBBIE: --- of the two guards in the front. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: That 10 o'clock guard. I want to try to get as close behind him as I can. 
MATT: Okay. On this one over-- 
ROBBIE: Yeah, the straggler. Yeah. 
MATT: Yep. Okay. So you-- I would need both Dorian and Imogen to make stealth checks with advantage, please. 
SAM: With advantage. Nice, nice, nice. 
ROBBIE: Good. 
SAM: Great, great, great. 
ROBBIE: Do it again. Not as good. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
ROBBIE: 18 still. 24. 
MATT: 24. Great. 
LAURA: 22. 
MATT: 22. All right. You begin to skirt around to this side, and Imogen, you drift down to the nearest window there. No one seems to take notice in this surrounding space. Your Arcane Eye appears, and begins to drift over in that region. This small little bauble of arcane power that floats between realms. You follow it as you do, keeping low to a place where you won't be noticed. Where are you sending that little eye? 
TRAVIS: I'll send it wide, obviously not chancing near the guards. I'll try and find a window or any sort of opening one inch in diameter, preferably on the sides away from the guards, if I can. 
MATT: Okay, from which side? 
TRAVIS: I'll come right down the middle and then send it wide left. Yeah. Towards you. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Then in through a window or door. 
MATT: Okay, there is a window on this side that you drift into. So Dorian, you glance over there. Make a perception check for me. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: Nat 20. 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
LIAM: Let's go. 
MATT: As you come around the edge, you see that guard who's just standing there, his fey elf form in jagged dark armor, two blades at each side, keeping watch, not as heavily armored as the other two. As you peer past him, you (spotting) immediately make out each of the other hidden stealth figures-- 
LAURA: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
MATT: -- that are keeping unseen and keeping watch. 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
MATT: One is up in the top of this tree and these are all more lightly armored-- 
LAURA: We're all connected telepathically. 
MATT: -- with heavy crossbows, big longbows, and they're all watching the vicinity. 
LAURA: Yeah, you can tell everybody everything because we're all cohesive. 
ROBBIE: (whispers) Can you hear me? 
LAURA: We can all hear you. 
ROBBIE: Okay, we have ranged enemies hiding everywhere. 
ASHLEY: Who's this? 
ROBBIE: It's Dorian! 
SAM: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Why are you thinking in a whisper? 
ROBBIE: It just feels right. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: It does. 
ROBBIE: There's way more than what you can see, at least three. How many do I see? 
MATT: There's three that were hidden here. One here, one here, one there. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: There's the one by you and the two up front, as well as the hound. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Three, maybe half a dozen other enemies that you can't see right now. 
SAM: Where? 
ROBBIE: Yeah. In the trees. They're in the trees! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Getting hyped! 
LIAM: There's trees on every side! 
TRAVIS: I like it! 
LAURA: Maybe just think real hard about where they are, Dorian. 
ROBBIE: (grunts) 
MATT: All right, you fly up to the window, looking inside. There are a number of circular halls that follow the interior perimeter of this upper area, before it breaks into the two separate spires. You can smell the musty scent of forgotten academia, like the smell of maybe mildewed old paper somewhere in the halls. Some of the growth is still spreading throughout. As you're inside, you do feel the building (shifts) like some sort of shift to it around you, like dust (shaking loose). 
LAURA: Something just happened in here. 
MATT: Settles slightly. 
TALIESIN: I have a terrible notion of what that might've been. Carry on. 
LAURA: Did it just teleport in? 
TALIESIN: No, I think something just landed on the roof. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: That you can't see. 
TRAVIS: You're still outside or inside? 
LAURA: Oh! Yeah, I see invisibility. Would I-- 
MATT: You're inside the window, though. You don't see anything on the inside. 
LAURA: If I peek my head out, do I see? 
MATT: You drift out and you see-- Actually, make a perception check for me. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm really good at this. Oh! 17! No, wait. 19! 
MATT: 19 total? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. So you (whooshes) drift out to look around the structure itself, and you're not sure if it's the See Invisibility or what it is, but a shape has clambered onto the side of the building, and you watch as the coloration of this entity's skin, its scales, shifts like a chameleon, and now seems to (whooshes) take a natural shape, of vibrant purples and oranges. Its extremely bright wings wrapped around the outside as its long neck and its cloudy, wide eyes-- 
LAURA: Shit! I duck back inside before it turns it head. 
MATT: The familiar sight of Gloamglut having arrived and shift its chameleon-like exterior, almost sweeps its vision towards you as you (whooshes) duck inside the building. 
LAURA: Gloamglut's here! Gloamglut's here! 
MATT: You feel (impacts). 
SAM: Where? 
LAURA: He's on top. 
MATT: The rest of you who have come down the hill, you can now, she says as you look over, and you can now see the bright color of Gloamglut, massive and terrifying, (stomping) climb down and seem to like, (slurping) like its body, its bones seem flexible or its joints switch where it slithers and pours into the opening of this temple. 
LAURA: Like a little hamster. Does the little butt stuck in the door and then he wiggles his little legs. 
MATT: It does (crack) damage it. 
TRAVIS: It's a fucking dragon! It's not a hamster. 
LAURA: You know what I mean, though. 
TRAVIS: It's a deadly killing machine! 
MATT: It does damage the stone as it forces its way through. It is a massive creature when it's expanded, but it also has very thin, lithe form that serpent slithers into the building. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
MATT: As it does, you, with your high perception roll and your Arcane Eye that's gone inside the structure, it's following in, and then she says that, and the Arcane Eye spins around just as you see the head of Gloamglut (whooshes) begin to come in towards where your Arcane Eye is (whooshes) dart off to the side. And it slithers in. So then you see this, Dorian, as it clambers down the side, two beings (whooshes) leap off of the large harness on its back. (thumping) One of them is a heavily armored, tall, dark fey being with a long billowing cloak, a nasty-looking, dark metal helmet hooks upward into horns, and a massive blade sheathed at its side, and the other, an elven figure with long, silver hair, blue robes. Ludinus Da'leth, both of them emerge-- 
MARISHA: Look at Ludinus making deals. 
MATT: They step inside the temple structure after Gloamglut. 
LAURA: How do we stop this? How do we stop this? What are we going to do? 
LIAM: Point of order. 
LAURA: We really should've had a plan. 
LIAM: One to two minutes of time elapsed. 
MATT: The rest of you have-- 
LIAM: Wall team dropped, right? 
MATT: You've definitely dropped and you're starting to try and carefully clamber close. 
MARISHA: Did we want to drop? I don't think that was the plan. 
LIAM: Well, how far is the wall from this building? 
SAM: We were 300 feet-- 
MATT: About-- Yeah. 
LIAM: We don't want to be 300 feet away. 
TRAVIS: If we could make it look like the Unseelie are being attacked by Ludinus. 
MARISHA: Ludo. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, if we could make it seem like these talks are not peaceful or something, if we could sabotage them, that would help. It's not about attacking those two. We don't want that fight, right? 
ROBBIE: We're still undetected, right, at this point? 
TRAVIS: So far. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: That we know. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: What do we do? 
TRAVIS: But it's the Unseelie we got to find, unless they're in there already. 
LAURA: They're in there. They've got to be. 
TRAVIS: Well, we don't know. Does the Arcane Eye see anything inside? 
MATT: Do you follow in as they walk past? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: Ludinus is going to see us. 
TRAVIS: Fucking Ludinus is going to see that, yeah. 
SAM: Wouldn't the dragon see it? They have truesight, don't they? 
MARISHA: Some do. 
LAURA: Probably. 
MARISHA: Not all of them. 
TALIESIN: Probably does. 
ASHLEY: I feel like he does. 
LAURA: Didn't he see you guys when you were invisible and on the moon? 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: It might be a thing where you have to actively search. 
LAURA: Oh, maybe. 
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll put the eye up on the ceiling, like (whooshes) go up real high. 
LAURA: Just a little inch. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Hide it underneath by a magic. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, looking for anybody besides Gloamglut and those two individuals, even just a glimpse. 
MATT: Yep. Make a perception check for me. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Come on! 
TRAVIS: Just regular roll. 
MATT: Yep. Straight roll. 
SAM: ♪ Regular roll ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Regular roll ♪ Regular roll. Natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Let's go! 
LIAM: Irregular roll. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: The Eye of Uk'otoa doesn't lie. 
MARISHA: (whispers) Uk'otoa! Oh, this is your Uk'otoa die? 
TALIESIN: Nice! 
MATT: Okay, you only take visual information from this eye. As it turns, and indeed, you see the three figures that walked in are waiting in the center of this chamber. You see, past this hall, there's a large open chamber that's further back that encompasses the core interior, the base floor of this massive temple-like structure, this Shrine of Gilded Gifts, if you will. Passing by even the interior glance of the halls around here from the Arcane Eye's view, you can see between the ivy overgrown walls beautiful carvings of what looks like-- or murals that are painted and faded with time framed in intricate stone, chiseled carvings of rising flowers and faeries framing and spiraling around each one. There are pillars that are standing still with busts and statues. It's like a museum as much as it is also a temple. Glancing past this to the inside, you can see there is a massive raised, it looks almost like a well but it's a dais, maybe 15, 20 feet across this upper platform with some crumbled stone on it. There are raised steps on the side and massive central pillars that are load-bearing of this wide, curved dome on the inside. There is a statue across the way of a representation of the Arch Heart, and the climbing walls have beautiful murals painted and scrawled up along all the ways. There are two fountains that sit on the opposite ends of the central dais. You watch as Gloamglut has torn through and then climbed up and out of sight near the roof of this interior as the two other figures that you recognize to be the Sorrowlord Zathuda and Ludinus to step within chamber beyond them. 
TALIESIN: With that roll, would we know if it's a real Ludinus or-- 
LAURA: It's a Simulacrum. 
TALIESIN: It is. Okay. Thank you. 
MATT: Yeah, I'd say the glimmer you can see, there is the central gem in its forehead as it walks within and forward. 
TRAVIS: Any other Unseelie representatives in the room, or just Gloamglut and these two? 
MATT: Well, there's Gloamglut and the Sorrowlord. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: And Ludinus on their end. 
TRAVIS: Right. 
MATT: There are three other Unseelie. 
TRAVIS: There are three. 
MATT: The two that are heavily armored, shields, and a hooked blade they have sheathed and at the ready, and then the central figure wears more armor that looks both ornamental as well as it is effective. No helmet. What looks to be long silver hair with black streaks that run through it, and they look to have a pointed chin goatee that comes down into an upward curve at the end. They just stand there. 
LAURA: They don't look familiar at all? 
TRAVIS: As soon as I see the three Unseelie, I'll drop the Arcane Eye and get on the mind horn and say: It's three Unseelie, Ludinus, and Lord Zathuda. We have to stop the conversation they're having. 
LAURA: All right, and you described what you saw inside? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: And we do this by attacking? We do this by-- 
TRAVIS: I would love to collapse the building or make the conversation unsafe-- 
LAURA: There's load-bearing pillars. 
TRAVIS: -- or something, right? 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Because this has got to be a tenuous relationship, and if they both agreed to meet on terms of peace and it's not-- Yeah. 
MARISHA: If it sounds like a trap. 
LAURA: How many pillars did you see? 
MATT: Well, there are two pillars that rise up in the center. But the temple itself, you're uncertain if they're load-bearing or ornamental. 
LAURA: You said load-bearing-- 
MATT: Well-- 
LAURA: -- when you described it! 
MATT: My apologies. It was a descriptor. 
LAURA: Damn! 
MATT: It could be load-bearing, but no one here seems to be masters of architecture either. You have-- 
TRAVIS: Excuse me! 
ROBBIE: All the guarding-- 
TRAVIS: I minored in architecture. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: All the guarding factions are Unseelie? 
MATT: They all seem to have a unified look to their armor, both coloration and design. 
MARISHA: I can maybe fuck with their heads. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that's-- Yeah. 
LAURA: Maybe you can fuck with their heads. 
MARISHA: I can. 
ROBBIE: I've got-- I can. We could try. 
MARISHA: The other thing, this is really dumb, above the table, we'd have to do a costume change, but we all have our Ruby Vanguard uniform. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah! 
MARISHA: If we make it look like Ruby Vanguard is holding them hostage, but I don't know. I can-- 
MATT: The hound drifts over, sniffing around. 
SAM: Uh-oh! Getting closer to you. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
ROBBIE: Sniffing? 
MARISHA: Uh-oh! 
ROBBIE: Snoofing? 
MATT: Just like, (snuffles) and still doesn't look like it's caught anything yet, but it's just moving around. Everyone else is stationary, but the hound is the one that's patrolling. 
LIAM: Can we assess where wall team is before this goes tits up? 
MATT: You've all been coming from this direction, and so we'll say you're probably maybe 40 feet off in a tree line and the very end of the nearby village. 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. Okay. 
SAM: I don't have any spells that can knock down buildings. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, nobody has Earthquake or anything, right? 
LAURA: No. 
TALIESIN: If I get right up close and personal, I can knock it down. But that's a-- 
LAURA: You've got Stonky's Ring and I've got Telekinesis, which both have the ability to try to do stuff to things that are heavy. 
SAM: Still feels like that would take multiple rounds. 
LAURA: Potentially, yeah. 
MARISHA: The only thing I can attempt is a Phantasmal Force situation and try and get into Zathuda's head to think that this is a trap. 
SAM: We could also just yell from outside, "Ah! It's an ambush!" 
MATT: Dorian, you watch as the guy up in the tree who's sitting there-- "(silent yelling)" 
SAM: Uh-oh! 
LAURA: Ira! 
SAM: Ira! 
TRAVIS: Oh! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TALIESIN: That went well! 
MATT: And is-- 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah, we got an Ira. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: -- torn down. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: You don't see what did it. 
MARISHA: Silence. 
LAURA: Did I see what did it? 
MATT: You glance out and see, indeed, up here in the tree, now perched is Ira Wendagoth. 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
TALIESIN: Our boy! 
MARISHA: So cool! (cheering) 
MATT: Who has just magically silenced the top of that tree and essentially tore this figure apart. 
LAURA: Amazing! 
MATT: And set them down carefully into the nearby brush. 
LAURA: I love him! 
MATT: He just sits there, looking and waiting for any of the rest of the cues here. 
TALIESIN: So should we-- 
SAM: Maybe try to silently take out these dudes? 
TALIESIN: I think we can take out the-- 
LIAM: Above table, though, we don't need to convince Zathuda that something's wrong, right? He's already on Ludinus' side. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LIAM: It's the nameless dude in the trio. 
MARISHA: Totally. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's the Unseelie we need to-- Yeah. 
ROBBIE: If we could get them to in-fight somehow. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: We were never here. 
SAM: Well, we got to kill these guys to get close. 
MARISHA: We got to get closer. 
TRAVIS: Do it. Let's go. 
MARISHA: Okay. Let's stealthily-- 
LIAM: But it'd have to be all silent kills. 
MARISHA: -- take out the jungle team. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ROBBIE: I love it! 
SAM: Who's closest to us? The guy over there? 
ROBBIE: Dude. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We got one guy there. 
MATT: One guy here, one guy here, one guy here, and the two up front, as well as the hound. 
MARISHA: Once again, how far away is the wall team? 
MATT: The wall team is about maybe 40 feet, 50 feet out from the edge of this map. 
MARISHA: Because we've been trying to creep closer. 
MATT: Yeah, we talked about that. So you guys are just beyond the opening of this one little area here before you feel comfortable being seen. 
TALIESIN: So I feel like we can come around this way and take out that guy and then take out that guy. 
MARISHA: Let's just try and do it quietly. 
TALIESIN: Thankfully, Pass Without a Trace is still up. 
TRAVIS: I love how we're all just shallow thought thinking about this, because as soon as Ludinus and Lord Zathuda and Gloamglut come out, that's the worst fight we've ever had. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: I know. 
SAM: Yeah, but let's cross that bridge when we get to it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Why are we not thinking about this! 
MARISHA: It's Snowdinus. It's Snowdinus. Snowdinus rocked us last time. 
LIAM: Yeah. That's-- 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
SAM: That's before you had me. 
LIAM: -- level wizard missing the highest level slot. That's it. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
LIAM: They're just missing their-- 
MATT: Well, also half hit points. 
LIAM: Sure. 
TRAVIS: We have a Braius. 
LIAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: We have a Braius. 
LIAM: But the arsenal is very strong. 
LAURA: We haven't fought fought Lord Zathuda, though. We just ran from Lord Zathuda the last time. 
MARISHA: That is true. 
SAM: Less talk, more action! Come on, let's go! 
TRAVIS: I'm going to silently transform into a werewolf and then cast Invisibility on myself. 
MATT: Okay! 
TRAVIS: I reach behind my back and grab my zipper and slowly pull down as I unfurl my evening dress of flesh-- into the fluffy (gruffly) fuckboy beneath. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: DM, using Orym's Know your Enemy after watching these guys for multiple minutes. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Their total class levels and their HP are all lower than mine? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Good to know. 
LAURA: I've re-upped my See Invisibility and my Flying. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's-- 
SAM: Why don't you go kill this guy, Chet? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going to say, do we want to try-- 
SAM: I can Silence him. 
TRAVIS: Which guy? 
SAM: The guy in front of you. 
TALIESIN: The guy closest to you. 
TRAVIS: Sure! 
MATT: Did you connect with Ira as well mentally, or not? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. I don't think he was-- He was listening in to all this. 
LIAM: There's two in the woods and two at the door. 
MATT: "I can also make them quiet." 
SAM: Why don't you do that? 
MATT: "So between the two of us." 
SAM: Okay. Which one do you want to do? (laughs) 
LAURA: Ira, you should do the one farthest away from the group. 
LIAM: One, two, three is-- 
MATT: It's also the closest one to Chet. 
TRAVIS: With a bonus action, I'm going to take my claws and drag them alongside my calves and get a little thing going. 
MATT: All right. Ira curls over the edge here. Gets really low, really low into the brush to where he almost becomes part of the branches of the tree and flicks his finger this way. His invisibility drops, but he remains stealthed within the branch as he casts Silence down in the space around this guy here. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. Great. 
MATT: "Now's the time." 
SAM: Okay. Is Chetney doing this solo or are we helping him? 
TRAVIS: Anybody that can-- 
SAM: Are we close to him or where are we? 
MATT: You're all over in this area. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I thought we were coming around this way. 
LIAM: I mean, we got to do this all at once. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: Otherwise it's pointless. 
SAM: Well, we can take out that guy. 
MATT: These of you all kind of over-- 
MARISHA: If you can do it quietly. 
LIAM: Quietly. 
TALIESIN: The guy in the woods. 
SAM: Are we that close to Chetney? 
MATT: I'd say if you want to, you can move over that direction or move this way. It's up to you. 
MARISHA: Laudna will start shifting this way towards where Dorian is. 
MATT: Okay. Everyone who's moving this direction, please make a stealth check. 
TALIESIN: Plus 10. 
MARISHA: Who's moving this direction? 
MATT: Yeah. Everyone who's moving closer roll a stealth check. 
TALIESIN: Plus 10. 
LIAM: That's a one. I'm rerolling. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Plus 10, thank god. 
SAM: (sighs) Woof. 
ASHLEY: Do we have the plus 10 still? 
LIAM: I rolled a second one. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we do. 
LIAM: I'm going to use Indomitable-- Nope, that's for saves. 
LIAM: One. I rolled a one. 
TALIESIN: Plus 10. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
LIAM: It's still a one. 
TALIESIN: I know, it's still one. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
MARISHA: 25. 
MATT: 25. 
SAM: 18. 
MATT: 18. 
TALIESIN: Actually that is better, never mind. 
ASHLEY: 24. 
MATT: 24. 
ASHLEY: Try to say it with hope? 
SAM: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's good. 
SAM: 18! 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 27. 
MATT: 27. 
TRAVIS: 37. 
MATT: Oof. All right. So as you all begin to move forward, Orym, all these things are coming together and the anxiety of all these different pieces arriving at once. 
LIAM: Doesn't seem like it can work. 
MATT: You take a step and your foot catches one of the roots in the ground and you're about to tumble before-- (snatch) Ashton catches you. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Ashton coming in clutch. 
TALIESIN: Shh. Shh. 
LAURA: Yeah. Catching everybody today. 
TALIESIN: (quietly shushing) 
MATT: All right. So this entity here has been silenced. What do you want to do? 
MARISHA: Which one? 
MATT: Over here. 
LAURA: Chet was going to take him out, wasn't he? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- Yeah. 
MATT: You going to go for it? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. Shift forward to this one here off in the brush. 
TRAVIS: Stealthy with a little sneak attack. Okay. I'm going to roll, I'm going to take three claw attacks against him. 
MATT: Go for it. 
MARISHA: Come on, come on, come on. 
TRAVIS: Dope. I mean, that's a billion. 29. 
MATT: You have an advantage on each of these because you're invisible. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 29 for the first one. 
MATT: 29 hits. 
TRAVIS: Oh, if I was wearing that butcher's bib that would've been a crit. 21 on the second one. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Last one. 
TRAVIS: Two natural 20s. (exclaiming) 
TALIESIN: (party horn) 
MARISHA: Oh, let's fucking go! 
ASHLEY: Damn! 
MATT: Okay. All right. 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! 
LIAM: Right off my two ones. 
ROBBIE: Wow! 
TRAVIS: That's nice, that's nice. 
MATT: Sometimes things balance out, I guess. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, so I'll do this. Two, eight, plus seven. 15 plus five. It is 23 for the first one. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That's the sneak attack only on one of them, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Okay, so that's the sneak attack one. Second one is... [metallic ding] 
TRAVIS: Ding! 12-- 
LIAM: Huzzah! 
TRAVIS: 19 points on the second one. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Then the crit. Amazing. Eight, That's 29 points on the third one. 
MATT: Slowly curl up. How do you want to do this? 
LAURA: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
MATT: In absolute silence. 
TRAVIS: Sweet. I'll creep up and then-- 
MARISHA: So fucking sick! 
TRAVIS: -- with my claws extended, I'll reach up and put two claw-fulls, two paws into his kidneys just under the ribs on each side. (claws stabbing) 
MARISHA: Jesus. 
TRAVIS: Pick him up a little bit. Seeing that he's quiet, I'll take one hand out and just reach around, and ear to ear: (slashes) I'll reach around and grab his chin and (grotesque cracking) just pull his head off. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
SAM: Jesus. 
MARISHA: Let's go! 
LAURA: (gags) 
TRAVIS: You just got to loosen this part and then everything just-- (tongue lolling) (laughter) 
MATT: A grisly sight-- 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: -- only seen by your friends behind you, but not a sound is made as you then pull the remains into the nearby brush. 
ASHLEY: Damn, Chet! 
LIAM: (deeply) Clap your hands if you believe in faeries. 
TRAVIS: I put the head in the bag of holding. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: This is why all of our shit smells bad. 
SAM: Two down. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: Two down, two down. 
MARISHA: How many more Silences do we have? 
MATT: The hound has now walked around over and is starting to-- 
SAM: I can do a Silence. 
SAM: Uh-oh. Do we see this dog coming? 
MATT: Hmm? Oh yeah. You guys see the dog cruising about just walking around. 
ASHLEY: With a human face. 
ROBBIE: As it breaks away from me being invisible, I'm actually going to follow it in the air, if I can, I'll engage my wing boots but stay really close to the ground. 
MATT: Right. 
ROBBIE: I don't want to make noise. 
MATT: Right. They don't make you cast the spell Flight you just can fly for a time. 
ROBBIE: Right, right, right, right. 
MATT: Great. Yeah, you can do that. 
ROBBIE: Okay. I'll go after him and get within a range of 30 feet, and I'm going to try to cast-- 
LAURA: You won't be invisible anymore once you do that. 
ROBBIE: I hope I'm enough in the bush to be out of sightline. 
MATT: Do you want to try and hide to do this? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, kind of. Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So you will have to probably get prone in the brush here as you glide down. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Oh, that's so sad. 
MATT: I know. Make a stealth check for me. 
ROBBIE: Stealth check? Yeah. Of course. 
MATT: With advantage. 
ROBBIE: All right. That's all right. That's worse. 16. 
MATT: 16. 
ROBBIE: On the edge. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Living on the edge ♪ 
LAURA: ♪ I'm on the edge ♪ 
ROBBIE: Haven't cast anything yet. 
MATT: No, you haven't. 
ROBBIE: (laughs nervously) 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: You think you're pretty hidden. 
ROBBIE: Uh-oh. 
MATT: What do you want to do? 
LIAM: Shit. 
SAM: Do your thing. 
ROBBIE: Okay. This will drop my invisibility. I'm going to try and cast Charm Monster on the dog. 
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. Mm-hmm. 
MATT: All right. 
ROBBIE: So that's a 16 wisdom. 
ASHLEY: Get it, get it, get it. 
MATT: 16 wisdom save. That is going to be a 13. 
LAURA: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
SAM: That's your dog. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Fuck yes. 
ASHLEY: Amazing. 
ROBBIE: So from the bushes and it's scratched, I'm scratched. Psst! Psst, psst, psst! Good boy, come here. Yeah, to me. 
ASHLEY: (kissy noises) 
ROBBIE: Hi, come here. (tongue clicking) Come here. Oh, that's so good. 
TRAVIS: With its human face. 
MATT: It has these thick jowls that-- 
LAURA: So gross. 
MATT: (slobbery sloshing) 
MARISHA: Oh god. 
TRAVIS: Oh, what? Human Droopy Dog? 
MATT: Its eyes burning red in the pupils. 
ASHLEY: It's so weird. 
LAURA: I don't like it. 
ROBBIE: Oh, aren't you so-- Aren't you so handsome? You're so handsome. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Are you a good boy? 
MATT: You can see him, his-- It's interesting, his body as he gets closer, you could see, it looks like dark fur, but it also is a faint translucent quality to it like it's made of shadow or isn't fully material. It looks present and physical and you can see the ground moving and shifting with its claw steps. But yeah, it's not even fully corporeal in some way.
ROBBIE: Wow. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's so weird hearing you think this. 
ROBBIE: All right, go on now. Go on. Get! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Get out of here. You're free now. (laughter) 
SAM: You're free. 
ROBBIE: You're free! You get! 
ASHLEY: I don't want you anymore! (laughter) 
MATT: It looks at you and goes like-- 
ROBBIE: Oh, it's okay. No, no, no. It's better out there, I promise. I promise. They were so mean to you, weren't they? Weren't they mean to you? Yeah. Yeah, you go, you get out of here. You go on, you get. (laughter) 
MATT: And just starts walking off. 
SAM: Oh! Not this way! 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait. 
SAM: Oh go! 
ROBBIE: No, no, wait. Not that way. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: You go get the other way. (laughter) 
MATT: It turns back like: Hmm? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, no, go this way. Yeah, that way, that way. 
MATT: You watch as it moves and begins to dart off, its feet leave the ground and it just glides off. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: It's a flying hound-- 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- that (soft gliding) begins to take off in that direction. This guy here is patrolling, sees it go off and goes like-- 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
LIAM: That's okay. (groaning) 
MATT: Starts walking this way. 
LAURA: Oh, no, no, no. (anxious groaning) 
LAURA: Oh no! (panicked exclaiming) (laughter) 
MARISHA: Oh shit. 
MATT: Curious as to where the hound is going. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: We should split up and-- 
LAURA: No, we need to kill that guy. 
SAM: There's another guy over there-- 
LAURA: We're going to want to kill him. 
SAM: -- and then we should go over to help Dorian. 
MATT: It turns and goes-- And looks down and sees you-- 
LIAM: (groans) 
MATT: -- down on the ground. 
LAURA: Can you silence him? 
ROBBIE: I don't have Silence! 
SAM: I do. Do I see this happening? 
LAURA: Are you close enough? 
TALIESIN: I mean, technically speaking, there's line of sight on this shit, in my opinion. (Southern) In my opinion, there's line of sight. 
SAM: If I see it happening. 
LAURA: You would've seen Dorian. 
SAM: Oh, I'm watching Dorian for sure. He's hot. (laughter) 
LIAM: Is that how far away as we are? 
MATT: I mean, you guys can be shifting this way a little bit. There's no initiative order in this, it's just in the moment so-- 
LAURA: Can you silence it? 
SAM: Do I see this happening? 
MATT: Oh yeah. You all are watching this from the brushes as you're coasting through. 
SAM: Then I will cast Silence. 
MATT: Okay. Want to move that over here for me? Thank you. You shift over-- 
SAM: It just has to be 120 feet. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay, great, oh my god. 
MATT: So you might want to stay out of sight for the rest of these as you shift over. Make a stealth check for me, if you don't mind, Braius. You are leaving your radius, but you still get the bonus as you're taking it. 
MARISHA, ROBBIE, and ASHLEY: (gibbering) 
SAM: Okay. 27. 
MATT: Okay, so it's 80. Actually, you could have gotten it from back then. But if you want to move closer you can, but you're-- 
SAM: Maybe we'll be at the edge of the volume. 
MATT: There you go. (laughter) 
LAURA: [Inaudible], please. 
MATT: Staying low. So 120-foot range on the Silence. Indeed, you can throw Silence over as the guy goes like-- "(silent unhappy talking)" 
SAM: It won't last for long. 
LAURA: Yeah, Dorian. Get him. Kill him, Dorian. 
MATT: Pulls out its two blades and seems confused. What are the rest of you doing? 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. 
LIAM: This is wide open, right? 
LAURA: I can't see anything, right? I'm not seeing any of this happen. 
MATT: You're over here by the window, if you wanted to fly over and-- 
TALIESIN: You know in our heads. 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. Everybody-- 
MATT: Yeah. You're talking. You're hearing all this stuff happening. Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to peek out the other side. If I peek out the other side, can I see, or go around? 
MATT: Yeah. You definitely see him up there. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, if anyone's got some ranged stuff and-- 
MARISHA: I will. Okay, so-- 
TALIESIN: Dorian, you'll hear it in your head. You got a second. 
MARISHA: Wait, are you doing something? 
LAURA: I mean, I can. 
LIAM: He's going to move fast. 
LAURA: If we do it the same time. I'm going to lower down to where I'm not going to be sticking out above, so I'll just drop. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: I have an idea, too. 
SAM: (like Fearne) Go for it. 
LAURA: I'm going to Psychic Lance him. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So you're Psychic Lancing. What's its save? Intelligence? 
LAURA: That's a 19. 
MATT: 19 Intelligence? 
LAURA: Intelligence. 
MATT: No, that is a 12. 
LAURA: Okay, great. Okay. One, two, three, four, five. 
SAM: Oh god. Oh god. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
SAM: This is one off, by the way. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. (chuckles) 
LAURA: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Thank you. 
LIAM: Is there cover off the map here or is this wide open as well? 
MATT: There's a little bit of, I'll say, continuation of this cover where it's little bits of rock and stone, maybe a few trees. So there is brush, but there are periods of darting out in the open to get to the next bit, which is where the stealth check is required. 
SAM: By 10 minutes. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Okay. 
SAM: But it's a 20-foot sphere. 
MARISHA: Okay. So as long as he doesn't move. 
LIAM: I'm going to say that Orym creeps up at least-- 
LAURA: 25 points of psychic damage. 
MATT: Five points? 
LAURA: 25 points. 
MATT: 25 points. 
TALIESIN: Good to remember you cannot cast spells. 
MATT: Okay. So he goes and pulls his blades out, these two hooked shortswords and then-- "(pained silent scream)" 
SAM: Oh nice. 
MATT: Does this massive scream that makes no sound as he's clutching his head, stumbles onto one leg and still standing. 
LAURA: He's incapacitated. 
MATT: Incapacitated. Yeah. So he's just going-- 
TALIESIN: Kill him now. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I don't see, but I see him clutch his head and then from where I am, I'm going to sink my fingers into the dirt and tap into all of the dead bodies that are here. and from 240 feet away, I'm going to do a Chill Touch. So it's an elven skeletal hand comes up from under the ground. 
MATT: Okay. You roll for attack on this? 
MARISHA: Starts to yank him down. 
MATT: Okay. He's incapacitated, so you have advantage on the attack. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (dice clinking) 
MARISHA: Natural 20. (exclaiming) 
MATT: And a one. 
MARISHA: And a one. (laughs) 
MATT: You guys are swinging-- 
ROBBIE: No in between! 
MATT: -- back and forth on this! 
MARISHA and ROBBIE: No in between! (laughter) 
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait. You're by me. Reroll the one. 
MARISHA: Well, I rolled a natural 20. 
LIAM: Just do it. 
ROBBIE and TRAVIS: Just do it. 
MARISHA: Fine. Wait. Can I save this for later or whenever-- 
LIAM: No. 
MARISHA: 13. 
MATT: We'll go with the natural 20. All right, so roll the dice on that. 
ASHLEY: Go with the 13. 
MATT: That's 3d-- 
MARISHA: 3d8. 
MATT: Then you double the roll. 
MARISHA: I double the roll and regain hit points for whatever that means. Is there something else? 
LAURA: I burped. 
LIAM: Was it? 
ROBBIE: Something. 
LAURA: Just a little (cute noises). 
LIAM: Like a death rattle. 
MARISHA: He has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
LAURA: It's just a demure little dainty-- 
LIAM: Looked like something came up. 
MARISHA: Come on. Be big, be big. I want to just kill this fucker. 
LAURA: (large belch) 
ROBBIE: Murder him! 
MARISHA: I'm going to kill him. I will take that. Seven, seven, five. So that's 14 times two. Wait, 14 plus five. 19 times two. 
MATT: Oh, it's times two then plus five. So it'd be 28, 30-- 
MARISHA: Wait, no, no, no. I rolled seven, seven, and five and I double all the dice. 
MATT: Oh sorry. I thought you were adding your bonus. 
MARISHA: No, sorry. I was doing dumb math. 
MATT: You're right, you're right. 
MARISHA: I was doing backwards math. 
MATT: My bad. You're good. 
SAM: It's 19 doubled. 
MARISHA: 19 doubles. 
SAM: 38. 
MARISHA: So 38. 
MATT: How do you want do this? (cheering) 
ROBBIE: Quietly. 
MARISHA: Quietly. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Kind of seeing him, I want to combo attack this with Imogen, like it happened at the same time. So yeah, as he arches back almost in a broken way, you see this hand basically come up and suck him underground. 
MATT: "(scared silent yelling)" 
TRAVIS: So "Evil Dead." 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Very cool. 
MATT: He's gone, the ground itself seems to swallow him up. You swear you see the loose earth go, "(burps)" (laughter) 
ROBBIE: As soon as that happens, I pop out of the moss and I like: Good job. 
LAURA: Yeah. Stay hidden. 
ROBBIE: Oh sorry. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: We're feeling good, we're feeling good. Terrible shit's inside. We're feeling good. 
MATT: All right. Do you want to stay put or do you want to move closer? 
MARISHA: Well, I do want to start to inch my way around. 
TRAVIS, SAM, and MARISHA: ♪ Inchin' my way ♪ 
MATT: Make a stealth check. 
MARISHA: Well, I made that stealth check before. Do I still have? 
MATT: You mean the one as you were approaching, you mean, in this round, or--? 
MARISHA: Well, I guess I'll do it again. I don't know. We all rolled the ones and I thought to inch this way? 
TALIESIN: I think we're going to take care of this last motherfucker over here. 
SAM: He's not last. There's another guy at the door. 
MARISHA: There's two guys. 
ROBBIE: Those are the beefy boys. 
TALIESIN: I'm talking about the outskirts people who are going to be firing bolts at us from the distance. 
MARISHA: Yeah. I just want to start. I guess I'll be where Orym is, so I think that's fine. 
TALIESIN: So we have one more of these hiding in the woods motherfuckers. 
MARISHA: Okay. How many of those Silences do you have? 
MATT: Keep your stealth check from before. That's fine. 
SAM: Huh? What? 
MARISHA: How many of those Silences do you have? 
SAM: I can do it again and again. 
MARISHA: To this guy over here in the woods. 
MATT: You're not in the field of view as you move in there from either of these guys, so I think you're okay. 
TALIESIN: If we keep wandering around, you will be able to. 
LIAM: A bunch. 
MATT: Ashton, Fearne, Braius, what would you like to do? 
TALIESIN: I would say if we can collect at least some of the group and start making our way around so that we can-- 
SAM and MARISHA: ♪ Makin' our way ♪ 
TALIESIN: -- deal with this motherfucker. 
ASHLEY: I have an idea, but I might want to wait-- 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: -- 'til we get the guys. 
MATT: Are you all moving this way? 
SAM: I think we should start splitting up. 
ASHLEY: The guys outside. 
SAM: I'm going to go with Laudna and Orym. 
MATT: Okay. So the three of you-- 
LIAM: Gloamglut's inside the building, right? 
MATT: Inside the building, yeah. 
LAURA: So there's just one more guy over in these trees over here. 
MATT: There's one guy over here and the two at the front. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Then so the three of us-- So it's the three of us. Fearne, Chet, and myself. We currently have Pass Without a Trace. 
SAM: You also have Ira who can silence that guy, too. 
TRAVIS: How much material can you transmute? 
ASHLEY: A 40-foot cube. 
TALIESIN: That's pretty big. 
MATT: For what? 
LAURA: What? You could transmute stone? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, transmute rock. 
LAURA: You could transmute one of those pillars inside? 
ASHLEY: I was thinking of maybe trying and then everything would just melt and then they also-- 
LAURA: I can combo with Telekinesis and pull on it when you do. 
ASHLEY: "The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that the creature can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs four feet of movement." 
LAURA: So do that inside the building? 
MARISHA: I have an idea as well. I think I can help, but I think we just need to get closer. 
ASHLEY: We just need to get the guys. That's why, yeah. I kind of want to wait. 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I think let's get these guys. 
LAURA: Save that for once this other guys are taken out? 
ASHLEY: Because I feel like we should get everybody silently killed outside. 
LAURA: All right. Then can I tell Ira, can I ask him to silence that last remaining bush guy? 
MATT: Sure. 
TALIESIN: Let's get a little closer. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Let's start to-- 
LAURA: ♪ A little closer ♪ 
TALIESIN: Chet, you with us? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Drift through the space here. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Come a little bit closer ♪ ♪ you're my kind of man ♪ ♪ So big and so strong ♪ 
MATT: Shift over to this edge of the brush. 
LIAM: How big is the Silence? 
SAM: 20-foot radius. 
MARISHA: But even if-- 
SAM: So I can-- 
MATT: Ira takes your cue and spends a third 2nd-level slot to curl over the edges, the hands drift over the edge and wiggle a little bit 
LAURA: As all this silence is happening out here, can we hear any talking coming from inside of the building? 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
LAURA: Okay. Great. 
TALIESIN: Chet, you want this one since you're still invisible or no? 
LAURA: I'm so good at it. 14. 
TRAVIS: I'm not invisible anymore. 
MATT: 14? 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: You hear the faintest bit of an echo of conversation, but you-- 
TRAVIS: But I'm super stealthy. 
MATT: You're outside, focused on all this, you can't make out any of the words. You'd have to be probably inside to even hear anything. 
LAURA: (sighs) Okay. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you know what, Matt? I wanted to stay with this group. Sorry. 
MATT: Oh, you did? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Okay. So you would be drifting over with this group. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So, I think Chet and I would've gotten a little further before we would've pulled the Silence spell trick. We assume that this guy's looking other direction right now. 
MATT: He is currently... He was sitting there keeping watch, and he's now looking over and seeing that some of his compatriots-- 
TALIESIN: All right, let's go for it. 
MATT: -- are currently missing. 
TALIESIN: We'll start in three-- 
MATT: Starting to stand up from his perch. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, the two of us are coming in. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. Both of you make stealth checks for me. 
TRAVIS: You got it. 
TALIESIN: Plus 10. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
LAURA: Chet wasn't there when you cast it, so he wouldn't get plus 10. 
TALIESIN: No, I can-- Is it that, or is it I wouldn't be able to choose anybody within 30 feet at any time. 
TRAVIS: I don't need it. 
MARISHA: It's pretty good, yeah. 
LAURA: He doesn't need it. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. 
LAURA: It's when you cast the spell, it's anybody that's within 30 feet of you. 
MATT: "For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you." 
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. 
MATT: So he can, I think-- My interpretation of it, is somebody enters it, you can give it to them-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
MATT: -- but they have to leave your radius and you can't do it. 
LAURA: I did that wrong the entire first campaign. (laughter) 
MATT: To be fair, it's a little vague-- 
TRAVIS: You didn't use it a ton. 
MATT: -- and it's circumstances. 
TALIESIN: It's mushy. Like 36. 
MATT: 36. 
TRAVIS: 34. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: You both-- (soft, smooth glide) Both dive down below into the brush. Right as this figure is standing up with his crossbow and is starting to yell in the direction of the two over that way, you both come up from behind. 
TALIESIN: I just go tap, tap. 
MATT: Spins around. 
TALIESIN: (whack) 
MATT: All right, and you're attacking as well? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Both of you, do your round of attacks. 
TALIESIN: Reckless. I'll do tandem. Here we go. I don't need Reckless, we have advantage. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: A ridiculous number. 
TRAVIS: Natural 20. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MATT: Oh no! 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go. 
TALIESIN: I'm not even raging, man. 
ROBBIE: Hot tonight. 
MARISHA: Hot table. Hot table. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, and a 19! 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god, that's going to hit. 
ROBBIE: It feels good. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it does. Yeah, it does. 
ASHLEY: I know. I was already getting it. 
TRAVIS: All three attacks, nothing under a 26. 
TALIESIN: 16 points of damage. 19 points of damage for my two attacks. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Oh! 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
MARISHA: What was that? 
SAM: Just doing some yoga moves. 
TRAVIS: 15, 16. 
LAURA: You okay? 
ASHLEY: I'm just stretching. 
MATT: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Stretching my hammies. 
TALIESIN: So, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Do it. Open up! 
TALIESIN: 16 points, 19 points. 
MATT: You got it. 
TALIESIN: Then-- 
TRAVIS: 24, plus six, 28 on the first one, because that's the correct-- 
MATT: How do you guys want to do this? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wow, yes, yes, yes. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to smash him and try and spin him around towards you. 
TRAVIS: Oh, beautiful. I'll try and cover his mouth to keep him quiet, but my claws go straight through his nose and soft parts of his face. 
TALIESIN: I then take the hammer, and I nail it further into your claw. 
TRAVIS: (skull crushing) Ugh! (impressed noise) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Then I'll put my hand into his gut and up under his rib cage. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
SAM: Jesus. 
TRAVIS: Make a little-- 
MARISHA: Little puppet? 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: This little gnome has seen some shit. 
SAM: Oh no. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: It's a gnome? It was a little gnome? 
MATT: No, I mean, this guy. 
LAURA: Oh. 
ROBBIE: Oh. (laughs) 
MATT: The fact that you were like, "Yeah, I'll just do this." (laughter) 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Well, that's over with. Then we're going to slink-- 
TRAVIS: (deeply) I love to watch you work. 
TALIESIN: -- back into the shadow a little bit. 
MATT: He hears nothing. Oh, you're doing it, mentally I guess you could. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. So we're going to get back down. 
MATT: You both duck down. 
MATT: Removed from the space, and you're no longer invisible. 
SAM: We should hit these guys fast. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: They're going to start notice-- 
LIAM: Hit them with a Silence, and then yank them away from the door and end them in the Silence, if it's 20-foot radius out, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: So, pull them, (split) pull, kill. 
MARISHA: Over here? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: We're on the side. 
MARISHA: I will do this. Okay, so wait, where do want us-- 
LAURA: I'm going to cast Telekinesis on myself. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Right now. 
MARISHA: Do we want to bring them over here? Bring them into the woods? 
LIAM: Bring them? 
MARISHA: The big boys. 
LIAM: I was thinking-- 
LAURA: More like one and-- 
LIAM: -- hitting this out, be able to pull this guy that way, that guy that way in a Silence circle. 
MATT: Ira turns invisible. 
SAM: Yeah, we can only pull-- 
LIAM: Insta-kill them. 
SAM: -- them five feet. 
TALIESIN: Well, here comes Ira. 
MATT: Climbs down the tree. 
LIAM: Insta-kill them. 
ROBBIE: Uh-oh. 
LIAM: On the spot. 
TALIESIN: That's the plan, Stan. 
LIAM: Once they're silenced. 
MATT: Both the two of you stay low, and all of a sudden the voice nowhere, in your minds goes, "These are the final two, yes?" 
TALIESIN: Except for the three inside, and the dragon and the problem people. 
MATT: "(sighs)" (snaps) He snaps his fingers. Yeah. Both of them go, (stifled grunt). 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
MATT: They're both held for the time being. 
SAM: Let's go! 
MATT: He says, "Now is the time to make your move." 
SAM: Let's go! 
TRAVIS: So I have one crazy idea. If you're going to do your transmute thing that might topple the building. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: If I can turn myself invisible one more time, which I have, I could sneak in and use the Brand of Castigation, and with its upgrade, it would prohibit somebody from Teleporting or Misty Stepping or leaving. 
LAURA: Yes, do that. 
TRAVIS: So if we do that to either Zathuda or Lud-- I don't think we care about Ludinus, because he's a-- 
ASHLEY: Because he's just-- 
TRAVIS: -- snow cone. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. It could maybe make it hurt more. I mean the dragon might still be okay and might actually protect his owner, but it might keep him from bamfing out, if that's something he could do. It would be risky to me, but that's the whole point. 
SAM: Yeah, we got to kill these guys first. 
ASHLEY: I mean, that's a cool idea. 
LAURA: How long are they held when you do a Hold-- 
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh, are we dispatching them first, before we try to-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: They are held-- 
LIAM: We're emptying everything. 
MATT: -- for a round-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay, so we need to take them out. 
MATT: -- and they get to save each round until they get rid of it. 
LAURA: Okay, we need to take them out. 
LIAM: I'm just going to go for it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to head down. 
LIAM: I'm going sprint 30 feet-- 
TRAVIS: Do your shit. 
LIAM: -- and Misty Step to the first one. 
ASHLEY: (rapid acrobatics) 
LIAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to sneak my way. I'm going to sneak my way to the first one-- 
MARISHA: ♪ Sneakin' your way ♪ 
TALIESIN: -- keeping my-- 
LAURA: Pull him away from the door before you-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Now, sneaking is half speed? 
TALIESIN: Um... 
LAURA: You don't have to-- Oh, well, I guess you don't want the inside people to hear you. 
TALIESIN: Pass Without a Trace will work if I'm moving at-- Will it help if I'm moving at full speed or no? 
MATT: You're not choosing to be stealthy if you're going full speed. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So then 20 feet. 
MATT: 15, 20 gets you about there. 
MARISHA: How about we just do it? 
TALIESIN: Then, you're thinking just go for it? 
MARISHA: He's held. 
LAURA: Yeah, because he's held. 
TALIESIN: All right. Let's go 40 feet then. 
LAURA: That's going to go away in a round. 
MARISHA: Go away, yeah. 
TALIESIN: And then-- 
SAM: I'm going to do what Liam did, and sprint and Misty Step. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
TALIESIN: He's held, so I have-- 
MATT: You get about there. 
SAM: Does that me close enough to attack or no? 
MATT: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Misty Step. 
TALIESIN: It's worth it. This is worth a rage. 
MATT: One, two-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck it. 
MATT: -- three, four, five. Yeah, you can get right there. 
SAM: Great. 
MARISHA: Can I just peek around the corner so they're in my view? 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: We should still silence those areas, though, if we can. 
MARISHA: Yeah, correct. 
LAURA: Can you do that, Braius? 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
LAURA: Just so they don't hear it on the inside, the fight that happens? 
MATT: Ira's holding him, so he's not silencing them. 
LAURA: Yeah, I know. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Can Braius silence it? 
SAM: Shit. Okay. 
TALIESIN: I just lost it. 
SAM: Then I won't attack. I will silence. 
TRAVIS: I can run up and attack if you want to silent. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah, I'll silence. 
MARISHA: I can attack from a distance. 
LIAM: I got this dude. 
TALIESIN: Pulling up a-- 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh, perfect. That's actually absolutely perfect. I am going to do something a little weird that I've never done before. I'm so excited. 
SAM: Wait, I can't silence if I have Misty Stepped. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. 
SAM: That's two spells, so-- 
MATT: That's true, you cannot. 
LAURA: But you don't have to Misty Step in because you can Silence from 120 feet. 
SAM: Are are you willing to let me undo that move? 
MATT: Yeah, if you guys are wanting to tactically do this differently. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Here, I'll tell you what. Roll a d20 for me. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: On a one to 10, you unfortunately made that impulse move, and it fucks you up. On an 11 plus, then you get to-- 
SAM: It's an 11. 
MATT: It's an 11? Okay. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! Ooh! 
ASHLEY: Oh yes! 
MATT: So, as you're about to rush, you have this conversation about Silence and Ira holding them and you're like: Shit, all right, I'm going to focus on this. You still stay back here then? 
SAM: I would move forward, but not Misty Step. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So about there likely. (spellcast) Silence on there. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Orym and Ashton (whooshing) appear. 
TALIESIN: I've got a crazy-ass thing I'm going to do, so. 
MATT: You can dart down there as well. 
TALIESIN: You don't have to dart down quite as far because I'm going to move him away from the door really quickly. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: So, I'm going to take 25 feet worth of steps forward. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to use-- 
LAURA: You don't want to move him out of the Silence cone, though. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. The Silence cone got made. 
LAURA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Never mind, I'm going to go straight up. 
SAM: Just kill him. 
TALIESIN: I'm not going to-- 
LIAM: Shank this motherfucker and pull them away. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: So, Orym, you're up first. Now, they are paralyzed. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Right? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: So that's advantage on all rolls? 
MATT: So paralyzed, just to go back to the condition here for that, so we know all the specifics here. Paralyzed, attack rolls against them have an advantage, and any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if you're within five feet of it. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
LAURA: Amazing. 
LIAM: It's a critical hit. 
ROBBIE: That's great. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So this is going to be vicious. 
LIAM: Well, I got a total of 30 to hit. 
MATT: That hits, and then roll critical damage on that first hit. 
LIAM: I'm going to make it a push. I'm actually going to take him from here, and do a pushing attack. Knock him and follow him. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: So that was-- 
LAURA: Will that take him out of the cone? 
LIAM: It's 15 feet, and Silence is a 20-foot radius? 
SAM and MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: So, no. He would stay. 
LAURA: Did you go in front of the door when you did that? 
MATT: He did, to push him there. 
LIAM: I consider-- Okay. 
MATT: Quickly. 
LIAM: Yep. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to have a little fun then once you're done. 
LIAM: Okay. So, (calculating noises) six plus eight, so that is one plus eight. 
TALIESIN: At least it was quiet. 
LIAM: Nine with a-- 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Similar range, similar range. 
LIAM: 19. So it's a crit? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Oh shit. So 11 doubles, 22. 
TRAVIS: Fearne, you should move up. 
LIAM: 30 for the first. 
TRAVIS: Just in case it goes tits up. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Yeah, they're being held right now. 
LIAM: It's a pushing attack, he has to make a strength save. 
LAURA: You should be on the other side. 
MATT: Strength save. Ooh, it's a 20. 
LIAM: Oh, 20? Okay. Saves. Next attack. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to move around. I'm going to move up. I got 35 feet, so I'll come up. Yeah. 
MATT: About there. 
LAURA: Not in front of the door. 
ASHLEY: Not in front of the door, towards Braius. 
MATT: So over here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: 24, and it's an auto crit still? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: To hit. Okay. So, 36, It's another pushing attack. So, 18 plus six, is 24, plus eight, 32 points of damage. 
MATT: 32 points of damage. 
LIAM: Pushing attack. 
MATT: At the first strike, you carve through the second one. How do you want to do this with a pushing attack? 
LIAM: Oh, okay. 
SAM: Ooh. 
LIAM: So I slash right up along his front and up along the neck and watch him go (bloody choke) in place, rigid. Then the second, I jam the sword as hard as I can in and he flies, and it hits and impacts, and there's a miniature shockwave, and he flies back off the blade rolling on the floor, 15 feet, which will keep him within-- Well, he's dead. 
SAM: (chuckles) 
MATT: No, his landing at least would be, no sound. 
LAURA: Oh. 
LIAM: It's 20-foot radius? 
LAURA: His landing would be-- 
MATT: Yeah, 20-foot radius from the center here-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- which would be 20 feet, so everything here. So 15 feet would put him right at the radius. 
LAURA: Regardless, I'm watching it. So I would've caught him with my Telekinesis and pulled him off silently. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yes, that's sick. 
MATT: Cool. 
LIAM: If I have any movement left, I will step five feet that way, as much as is allowed. 
MATT: So you went 30 feet this way and then Misty Stepped. Here? 
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: To get to that point? 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: So I don't think you have any more movement. 
LIAM: If I have to, then I will Action Surge and get the fuck out of the way. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I think I probably got this. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: This will be fun. 
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up. 
TALIESIN: It'd be hard to do. Natural 20, which doesn't matter because it was going to be a crit anyway, which means that since I'm also, I've got-- 
MATT: You're cleaning up right now. 
TRAVIS: You know what this is? It's a pendulum swing. 
MARISHA: I know. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: It makes me nervous. 
TALIESIN: I get that. The head goes cosmic. The hammer gets that nice little red-blue. it gets that little weird cosmic thing, too. It doesn't do, I'm so sorry, it does the weird cosmic space thing. 
MARISHA: 3D glasses. 
TALIESIN: Watch this amount of damage I'm about to do, it's going to be gross. 
SAM: Four. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I don't actually think it's humanly possible. Okay, this is going to take a second. 
MARISHA: Don't talk this up too much, Taliesin. 
TALIESIN: Well-- 
LAURA: I know. 
LAURA: Check this out. 
ROBBIE: I'm into it, I'm into it. 
MARISHA: It's going to be dope. 
SAM: This is going to be so dope. 
LIAM: This ollie is going to be sick. Whoa! 
SAM: Oh fuck! 
TALIESIN: 54 points of damage on the first hit. 
TRAVIS: Damn! 
ROBBIE: On the first hit. 
TRAVIS: Porridge. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? 
TRAVIS: Porridge! 
LAURA: Okay, he talked it up to-- 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take the hammer, I'm going to swing it up and crack him right in the back of the neck and see if I can just snap it. I'm then going to grab his body and I'm going to drop through a worm hole down into the ground and come out dropping him about 30, behind that little-- You see that little arch over there? 
LAURA: In the back? 
MATT: Over here? 
TALIESIN: Back there. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop his body down there coming out of that-- 
MATT: That's cool! 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. We just step out. 
LAURA: Sweet. 
TALIESIN: And put it there. 
ASHLEY: That was cool. 
MARISHA: That was cool. 
LAURA: Yay. 
ROBBIE: Yay. 
MARISHA: Worth the hype. 
TALIESIN: Worth the hype. 
LIAM: "Solid Snake" body disposal! 
ROBBIE: I believed him all along. 
LAURA: Ding a ling a ling. 
MATT: All right, so the exterior guard are gone and the hound is off finding its new adventure for the next hour. 
TALIESIN: We keep making great new sequels to "Milo and Otis." We eventually just have to go with it. 
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to start to ♪ make my way ♪ I want to swing wide onto this side. 
LAURA: Are there windows? 
MARISHA: Or maybe even-- 
MATT: There are like windows, yeah. 
MARISHA: Maybe even here. 
ROBBIE: Yes, the coast is clear. I'm still face down in the fucking grass. 
MATT: Yeah, you are. 
LAURA: Get up, Dorian, everyone's dead. 
TALIESIN: Don't get up, don't get up-- 
ROBBIE: Okay, okay! 
MATT: So you all move in this direction if you-- 
LAURA: Okay, but be very quiet because they're right inside doing their little talkie walkie. 
MATT: Correct. 
ROBBIE: We did it, you guys. 
LAURA: All right. 
SAM: We won. It's done, yeah. 
MATT: Ira clambers up the side and just sits in the top looking at all of you. 
TALIESIN: Ira, what do you-- There's a big fuck all dragon in here. 
MARISHA: Yeah. What do we see? 
MATT: What do you see? Are you all glancing in? 
TALIESIN: I'm not glancing in, but I'm-- 
MATT: Through the windows, lead into the interior hallways. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: But the central chamber is only visible from-- 
LAURA: The front door. 
MATT: The front door. It's like there's an open area here. 
LAURA: Got it. 
MATT: It cycles around and then the larger central chamber is beyond that. So there's a hall that coasts around. The windows look into that hall, but the entryway to that central chamber, the only way in is from the front and you can only see that from the inside. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: You can hear the sounds of voices talking echoing from within. 
LIAM: I thought there would be bagels. 
TRAVIS: Unless we have crazy area of effect things planned, it would be awesome if-- There's only one entrance in and that's the front into that center area-- 
MATT: That you can see. That's the only way from where you're standing that you can see a way in. 
TRAVIS: Right. 
LIAM: What's the op, Pop? 
ASHLEY: That's the way they walked in? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: What do you think? 
TRAVIS: You either flush them out and you cover all the exits and hit them when they come out, or we try and drop the thing which is going to flush them out or bury them either way. If we rush in, then we expose ourselves more than the other way, right? Fatal funnels. 
ROBBIE: All three of those are a fight, though. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, 100%. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: Can you see the interior chamber from the higher windows at all? Or is it-- 
MATT: From what you can tell, there's other floors around it, but they're all circular hallways and other side chambers that are built around this large dome central chamber that looks like it, as a temple, especially a temple to the Arch Heart, it would be the central place of worship and teaching and you know. 
TRAVIS: If anybody has like-- 
MARISHA: Yes, can we see it? 
MATT: No, from what you can see, you see the hallways, but there's no real like-- 
LAURA: How far-- 
MATT: -- visual entry to it. 
LAURA: How far of a distance can you cast your-- 
ASHLEY: 120 feet. 
LAURA: 120 feet. Okay. I can use a sorcery point to up my Telekinesis to 120 feet as well, so we would have enough distance. So if you mushed the ground, I could try to Telekinesis out the-- 
ASHLEY: Pillar. 
LAURA: -- pillar because it wouldn't have the stability. 
TALIESIN: I can also start beating, if we really are going to go with this, I can start beating the fuck out of the exterior of this. 
MARISHA: -- quietly or doesn't it matter? 
LAURA: I think we do those first two moves fast and then it goes to hell. 
ROBBIE: Well, we're picking the fight then for sure. 
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on, hang on. Can I scurry to the roof? 
TRAVIS: Is there a non-fighting option? 
ROBBIE: Is that what we're here to do? 
TRAVIS: Is there a non-fighting option? 
MARISHA: I still have Spider Climb. Can I scurry to the roof? 
ROBBIE: We have the three people we're supposed to pit against each other alone. 
MATT: The voices are getting a little louder. 
ROBBIE: You can compel people to do stuff. 
MARISHA: Voices are getting loud. I know, I feel like we need to at least seed doubt in their heads, right? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
ROBBIE: Wouldn't it be-- 
MARISHA: Instead of just-- 
ASHLEY: -- trying to take them out. 
TRAVIS: Dropping the roof on them. 
ROBBIE: I mean, it's a crazy fight, right? 
TALIESIN: That is a crazy fucking fight in there. It's a lot less of a crazy fight now. 
MARISHA: Just in the Seelie court head, the Seelie court guy's head, right? Don't we want to be like-- 
ASHLEY: We can always just walk in. 
MARISHA: "This is fucked." 
MATT: Yeah, the voices are certainly raising a little bit like the-- 
MARISHA: Like it's heated. 
SAM: Should we be Ruby Vanguard-- 
ASHLEY: -- what they're saying? 
SAM: -- people? 
MATT: If you want to roll a perception check for this. 
ASHLEY: Yes, I'll roll perception. 
SAM: We're not going to deceive anybody. We should just kill and leave. 
LIAM: Just try to hear. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, try to hear. 
ROBBIE: Do you have anything like a-- 
MATT: All right, go for it. 
ASHLEY: Guidance. 
MATT: You're close to the entrance way, anyway. So roll a perception check. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LIAM: That is-- 
LAURA: Wait for it? 
LIAM: -- seven plus the Guidance. 
LAURA: (sensually) Uh-huh. 
LIAM: That's a 28. 
ROBBIE: You guys are smart-- 
MATT: 28. 
LAURA: Oh, I can't see that. 
MATT: All right, so, Orym, where you pick up in this conversation which would be, with the time that's gone by here. Okay, so where you pick up in the conversation you hear-- First, you pick up Ludinus's voice saying, "Your absence during these crucial milestones of our great plan is both disquieting and telling. Time, while a flexible commodity here, does require some respect regarding our endeavors." Another voice you don't recognize inside goes, (Voice 1) "We watch with bated breath as you and your Vanguard continue to climb towards your goal unaided. Centuries of mindful plot crashing into reality with continued success. Our strength lies with staying in the shadows until the moment is right." Ludinus kicks in. "I do not need your platitudes nor your dubious explanations. I bear the weight of our dealings and the support of the court has been noticeably absent!" (Voice 1) "That involvement demands discretion after the fall of the secondary key." (Ludinus) "You allowed that to fall. All of you. You and your lords hide behind poor excuses and feigned ignorance. I know Sammanar to be far too clever to withhold without several good selfish reasons." (Voice 1) "We believe in your dream, Ludinus, and share in your vision. Do not mistake our caution for negligence." (Ludinus) "I mistake nothing, especially your nature. If you'll no longer aid us, should we fail because your master's discretion left you an absent ally, then this realm remains under their protection and you remain kept under their balance." (Voice 1) "I shall relay this to my keeper and the court. How best might I prepare them to aid in your endeavors?" (Ludinus) "Tell them I expect an assault soon. The nations rally and will plot and advance on the Key. I will need your armies ready to deliver their uncanny ambush. Your keeper should know of what I speak. Go and be quick about it. The window closes and the cage is nearly at hand." 
MARISHA: Fucking-- Let's just bring shit down-- 
LIAM: I would've scattershot like: They're angry at each other. Ludinus is calling them cowards, they want to hang back. 
MATT: You also hear a voice say, (Ludinus) "How I despise, how challenging to communicate with the fey. And you! Nary a word to bolster our cause with your own people! Are you truly bereft of any worth to our cause, Athion? Daft as you are disappointing." 
TRAVIS: Does he recognize that voice at all? Is that Zathuda? 
MATT: That's Ludinus. 
LAURA: That's Ludinus. 
TRAVIS: That's Ludinus. 
LAURA: Talking shit to Lord-- 
LIAM: To Zathuda. 
LAURA: -- Zathuda. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Can I peek in this top window? Just very stealthily peek in one of the upper floor windows. 
MATT: Sure, you climb into the window. 
MARISHA: I've still got Spider Climb and I want to peek through. 
LAURA: I'm going to tell her that Gloamglut is on the ceiling. 
MARISHA: I just want to-- 
MATT: You go in and you can see there's slits. Most of it is just a stone wall, but arrow slits every 10 feet around this hallway that glances down and into the chamber. You can see there's smoke stains in the stone. It looks like when they used to maybe have internal flames and braziers. These were smoke reliefs that would release out, or they also have an incense smell to the inside here, almost, as you get close. So it seems like ceremonial burning of herbs or different types of smoke would billow out, but you can glance down inside. Make a perception check for me. 
MARISHA: I mainly want to know if I see this Arch Heart statue. Okay, 17. 
MATT: 17. Looking inside, you can see, you see in the middle of this chamber, there are the two fountains that flank the large central pillar. You see, there is, amongst all the beauty of the overgrown, partially crumbled interior of this central temple, towards the very back, near the far wall, there is a single statue of the Arch Heart that sits unassuming against all the art that surrounds it. It's like of everything that's in here, there is a singular statue that's maybe 10-feet tall that feels dwarfed by the surroundings. 
TALIESIN: I got an idea if no one else has got one. 
MARISHA: Are we taking this down? 
TALIESIN: I got a crazy idea, actually. 
TRAVIS: Well, we all got ideas-- 
TALIESIN: If we-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: If we wait for all of them to leave, we can kill the fey and then it looks like they did it. It looks like the argument happened. The message to join the attack never gets there. 
SAM: Seems like we have to stop this message from being-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Exactly. So if we just wait for the dragon and Ludinus and all of them to get the fuck out of here, then we can make this look like an ambush. 
TRAVIS: As long as they don't teleport out of here, is the thing, right. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
TALIESIN: So we just have to keep our eye on it. 
LAURA: But they did march in. The Unseelie, at least, marched in. 
TALIESIN: Exactly. 
MATT: You hear the ever-growing footfalls-- 
LAURA: What if we all put on our-- 
MATT: -- of footsteps heading towards the entrance.
LAURA: -- our red cloaks. 
TALIESIN: We don't have time for that. They're heading out. 
LIAM: Then we're going to be recognized. 
ROBBIE: If we can get them to fight amongst themselves. 
SAM: Someone's coming to the door. Get ready. 
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Animate Object on the statue. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
TALIESIN: Well, shit's going. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going cast Bless on the people next to me, which is Dorian-- 
MARISHA: I don't know. I'm sorry. 
ROBBIE: (stammering) 
SAM: -- Orym-- 
TALIESIN: Did you just panic? 
SAM: -- and I guess Laudna's close. 
LAURA: I can run. 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. 
MATT: Laudna's inside, you can't see her. 
MARISHA: I'm not inside, I'm on the roof looking in. 
SAM: Can I get werewolf boy across the way? 
MATT: You can. Yeah. 
SAM: Okay. Yeah. 
MATT: So Bless. 
TRAVIS: What'd you get us with? Bless? 
SAM: Bless, and also me. Why not? Can I do myself? 
LIAM: Is it three people? 
MATT: Three, unless you cast it at 2nd-level, in which case-- 
SAM: Yeah, I can do 2nd-level. 
ASHLEY: I also wanted to get by that-- Am I close to a window ish? 
LAURA: But from the window, you can't see the interior chamber. You can only see like a hallway. 
TRAVIS: If they're walking out the front door, you should just drop the building now. 
LAURA: -- you should just do the thing. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Should we do it? 
TALIESIN: It's a little late. 
MATT: You are currently, you're concentrating on there. You now, as you cast Animate Object, the statue of the Arch Heart that stands there, the form of it (crunching) steps off of its pedestal and you hear, (Ludinus) "Are you kidding me?" Then there's a loud whistle, and what you don't notice is just out of sight of you, wings go moving as Gloamglut was attached on one of the higher parts of the dome. (thudding) Lands on the ground. All of you feel this impact from inside The two, oh sorry, the three dark fey figures that were walking towards the entrance stop and turn. 
ASHLEY: Gloamglut's on the ground now? 
MATT: Draw their weapons and go rushing into the central chamber. 
TRAVIS: Drop it! 
ASHLEY: Gloamglut's on the ground? 
MATT: Correct. 
ASHLEY: Great! Okay, so-- 
LAURA: Do your thing. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Transmute Rock, just try to peek in there. 
LAURA: Aim it through the central-- 
MATT: You're going to-- 
ASHLEY: Aim it through the central, so it lands in the middle on the ground where there are pillars. 
MATT: Okay. So in order to do that, you have to get towards the entrance to see where it is. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: They're rushing back to fight the statue? 
MATT: They're rushing back into the central chamber, yes. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Great. Great. 
LAURA: I'm going to fly around and be right behind Fearne. 
TALIESIN: Is it time to knock this fucker down? 
TRAVIS: As soon as she casts the thing. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: All right. I'm using the Shard because that's hilarious. 
LAURA: I'm dropping down so I can see into the chamber, too. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Can you see the pillars from the central opening? 
TRAVIS: Thunderwave at 4th-level. 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! Let's just fucking go! 
MATT: Nope. 
ASHLEY: Witchies be bitchies. 
MATT: Not from down the hall. So as you step in there-- 
SAM: Orym, you might want to stand back. 
MATT: -- and from where you're standing in the main entryway, you can see the central dais, you can see the two fountains. From what you saw earlier, the pillars are just beyond. You have to step towards the entryway to that open chamber to see the two because they're on the inside. 
ASHLEY: Let's do it! 
ROBBIE: Are you casting? 
TRAVIS: I'm holding it until she does her thing. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, I'll wait. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: You hear the sounds of combat beginning to ensue. 
LAURA: Oh shit balls motherfucker! 
MATT: (clash of battle) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: You do it. 
MATT: (battle roaring) 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA: I'm going to go up to the roof and I'm going to cast Passwall. 
TALIESIN: I'm walking-- 
TRAVIS: What is that? 
TALIESIN: Oh no, I'm exactly-- 
LAURA: I'm going to create an opening through the roof. 
TALIESIN: -- where I want to be. 
TRAVIS: You're going to let him out? 
MATT: The roof? How big? 
LAURA: No, just small. It's like this big, just so I can see through, what's happening. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: Okay. (spellcast whoosh) You do so. How wide can you make it? 
MARISHA: That's cool. 
LAURA: I can make it wide, but I'm only going to make it three feet wide so I can see. 
MATT: Okay. So what you'd want to do is you probably want to fly in through the window and do it because the overall ceiling has towers above it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So in order to get to the dome there, you'd have to-- You could actually probably fly into where she is to look inside. 
LAURA: Where Laudna is? Great. 
MATT: They have a pin bit of view there. 
LAURA: Great! Then me and Laudna can both see. 
MATT: Okay, so you fly in where Laudna is, glancing in that window and you open (expanding) a space there in the middle of the stone. Now you have a good view of the interior. 
LAURA: Okay, as soon as Fearne hits. 
TALIESIN: Fearne, are we doing this? 
MATT: So Fearne, you're rushing inside to see where these pillars are? 
LAURA: Or you're just hitting the ground? 
ASHLEY: I was just going to hit the ground because it's a 40-foot cube. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: But I do want to get, I want it to mush the ground where there are pillars because I want to be able to topple. 
MATT: Right. You haven't seen the interior where the pillars are, you just know what you've been told. From you're standing at the doorway, the tunnel doesn't show you where the pillars are. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll go in. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
ASHLEY: No? 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: It's going to fall down though! 
LIAM: That's the plan. 
ASHLEY: That's the plan I can get out. 
TRAVIS: No pain, no gain. 
TALIESIN: It's going to fall down. 
MATT: You step down, you rush in 20, 25 feet to get towards the entrance to this inner chamber. As you rush in, you can see here in the center of there, you can finally-- 
ASHLEY: I'm trying to stealthily go in. 
MATT: Right. 
ASHLEY: You know. 
LAURA: Sure. 
MATT: Sure. You stealthily move in with nothing to hide you. 
ASHLEY and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
MATT: But everyone in there is-- 
ASHLEY: You can't see me. 
MATT: -- momentarily distracted-- 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: -- as, in the middle of the space, there is the massive Gloamglut dragon, brightened war colors on its skin, is slashing at this animated stone statue of the Arch Heart that is currently swinging at it. How powerful is this animated stone? 
MARISHA: I'm assuming this is a-- Is this large or huge? 
MATT: This would be considered a large entity. 
MARISHA: Okay, 2d10 plus two damage. 
MATT: If it helps you to have a perspective on what you're looking at. 
TALIESIN: Ooh! 
LAURA: Yes! Yes! 
MARISHA: Oh shit! Oh shit! 
MATT: I don't know if you're going in or not, but at the very least to see what you are seeing inside. 
TALIESIN: Okay, because the minute you cast this, I'm going to start knocking this shit down. So as long as you're ready to run the fuck out of there. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'll get out of there. 
TALIESIN: It's going to come down-- 
ASHLEY: I'll get out of there. 
TALIESIN: -- all around you. 
LAURA: You have siege abilities, right? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah! 
LAURA: Great. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
SAM: Oh my god! This is still brought to you by WizKids. 
LAURA: Wow! That's so big! 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
ROBBIE: Wow! 
LIAM: What?! 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Careful, careful! 
LAURA: Holy-- 
ROBBIE: Yep! (nervous exclaiming) 
MATT: It's all good. 
ROBBIE: We're bringing it down! 
LAURA: That's the plan! 
MATT: We got it, we got it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: So we're aiming for the stuff in there or we're aiming for the stuff outside, the pillar? What are we knocking down? 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
SAM: The pillars outside? 
LAURA: We got to bring down the ceiling in this room. 
SAM: We all got to go in there. 
TALIESIN: No, I'm doing it from the outside. I'm going to just start knocking shit down. 
SAM: But we're not in this chamber, are we? 
LIAM: Yeah, this is an entry hall, and past this is that. 
SAM: Yeah, bringing down the entry hall doesn't-- 
MATT: This is deeper into the main chamber. 
SAM: -- make any difference. 
TRAVIS: Oh! I thought everybody was in this structure here that they're standing on top of. 
MATT: This structure is the beginning of, I was saying, a massive structure that gets bigger from this point. 
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Okay. 
ASHLEY: So are we coming this way, or if I'm-- 
TRAVIS: Matt Mercer stuff. 
ASHLEY: If I'm running in, which way am I coming in? 
MATT: You're coming in from this direction. 
ASHLEY: Okay, great. 
TALIESIN: Oh Jesus Christ! 
ASHLEY: Okay, so-- 
MATT: To give you some perspective, this is the statue that is currently battling. 
LAURA: Yeah. I thought it was a little bit bigger than that, but. 
MATT: We'll say Ludinus is back here. 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
ROBBIE: Oh god! 
TRAVIS: That's not-- 
TALIESIN: This is not what I was expecting. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: This is a little more complicated. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: We're not knocking anything there. 
LAURA: (groans) 
MARISHA: We can bring the ceiling down. 
LAURA: Maybe. 
TRAVIS: On top of us. 
MARISHA: That's the four structures? 
ROBBIE: That's a big structure. 
TRAVIS: On top of us. (laughs) 
MATT: The entities there-- 
SAM: Oh boy! 
MATT: -- those are the three dark fey that have rushed back in. Then here-- 
MARISHA: Three dark fey. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Oh! ALL: Oh! (increasing intensity) Oh! 
TALIESIN: I just don't like any of this. 
ASHLEY: Big boy! 
LAURA: Our perception of the scenario was a little off here. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit! 
MARISHA: (laughs) We got this! 
LAURA: It's fine! Everything's fine! 
LIAM: Holy shit! 
ASHLEY: Look at him! He's so cute! 
ROBBIE: That's Pop on top of that. 
MATT: So Fearne, as you step into the chamber and look down, you see this chaos happening around you as everyone is now descending-- 
ASHLEY: Shit! This is different than what I thought! 
MATT: -- on this animated statue. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: The statue has how many hit points? 
MARISHA: 50. 
MATT: 50? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: The minute you glance there, the statue (crash) gets shattered off to the side. 
MARISHA: Oh! Okay. Okay, great. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MARISHA: Okay, great. Well, it kept him inside. That was my goal. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. They turned around. 
MARISHA: Kept him inside. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: So this is like a 25-foot hallway? 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: So I'm like (skitters) Okay, so-- 
LAURA: You only need to get about there before you can see, but-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not going to go-- 
ROBBIE: They still don't know it's us. 
ASHLEY, MARISHA, and LAURA: They still don't know it's us. 
ROBBIE: They still don't know it's us. 
LAURA: The thing is, is you do the mud thing, go running back. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: We try to take down the pillars or something. 
ASHLEY: Great. 
LAURA: Then we break it down from the outside because there's only one exit. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Once you're outside the exit, I'm going to start knocking this shit down, just all around. 
LIAM: Matt, this room is what Laudna and Imogen have eyes on, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: From a hole in the ceiling. 
ASHLEY: So I'm only going to try to go in a little bit and I want to shoot it to where at least one of the pillars are and towards the entrance of this front hallway. So wait. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: We were thinking it was a much smaller room. 
SAM: We blew it. 
LAURA: We blew it. 
MATT: I was explaining how this is the front way and the towers rise up here and it spreads out from there. 
ASHLEY: That's okay. That's okay. We're going to figure it out. 
TRAVIS: Ashton, you got to go inside. 
TALIESIN: Hmm? 
TRAVIS: Maybe via the ground. You got to get inside. Outside's not going to-- 
TALIESIN: I can't get through that ground because it's worked stone. 
TRAVIS: Oh, is that right? 
ROBBIE: All the three factions think right now is that they're under attack. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: They don't know by who. It could still be each other. But the minute they see one of us, we give away the goose. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: We have a chance to still fucking set them at odds somehow if we use our thinkers. But I don't know. 
LIAM: Right now, if they see Fearne, they might think that it's some sort of-- 
LAURA: Zathuda. 
LIAM: Zathuda fuckery. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Darth Vader and offspring. 
SAM: Maybe she should just run in there and be like, "Dad, I'm here!" 
LAURA: Dad, I got your back! 
MATT: What are we doing, Fearne? You step up there, you're now standing in the middle of the hallway. You're about maybe 15 feet from the entrance of this chamber. You just watched the statue of the Arch Heart get shattered into dozens of pieces against the wall from one massive tail swipe from Gloamglut. There's that brief moment where everyone's still not looking in your direction. What are you doing? 
ASHLEY: Okay. So in that brief moment, I'm going to shoot a Transmute Rock over to here because I want to at least try to get a couple of these guys and the pillar. 
LIAM: That dragon has been hitting the gym since we last saw him. 
LAURA: Yeah, that dragon is bigger, right? 
ASHLEY: He's a big boy. Maybe that's his full, when he's in the Fey, he's in his full form. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
LAURA: He was in the Fey the last time we saw him. 
MATT: Is this where you were? 
ASHLEY: Okay. So since it's 120 feet, if I'm in the hallway, I probably could-- 
TRAVIS: You're good. 
ASHLEY: Get an eye on the-- 
MATT: To get close enough to see where the pillars are, because the entryway is about that wide. I didn't have the full arch there. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: So you'd have to get about there is where you'd be able to see the pillars. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MARISHA: I can try. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to (tosses spell) and run. 
TALIESIN: And run. 
MATT: Okay. What's the radius on the spell? 
ASHLEY: 120. Oh, 40 feet. 
MATT: 40-foot radius? 
ASHLEY: 40-foot cube. 
MATT: Cube. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
TRAVIS: That's-- 
MATT: So that's about-- 
ASHLEY: Big. 
MATT: -- that side. 
MARISHA: Here's the thing, you can-- 
MATT: So it's about this distance by this distance by this distance. 
MARISHA: You can take out these two pillars, right? 
LIAM: It's wider. 
MARISHA: Can it cover two pillars? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I'd want to take out at least one of the pillars. 
LIAM: One of them. 
ASHLEY: But on the side that Imogen and Laudna-- 
LAURA: We'd be on this side. But I'd be able to see that pillar. 
ASHLEY: You'd be able to see it. 
LAURA: I could see what you're doing and know what you're-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. So I would want to try to get it around that area. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. Surround the pillar. 
ASHLEY: That pillar and those two-- 
MARISHA: If you do that support pillar and, yeah, the walls, then-- 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: Maybe. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Try to get these guys because they'll be stuck. If they don't pass the dexterity save, they'll be-- 
MATT: All right, so 40-foot there by 40-foot there. You could get those two-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: -- and that support pillar in there, if you'd like. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Okay. 
ASHLEY: So on a failed save, the creatures will sink into the mud and be restrained. 
MATT: All righty. So you (forceful cast) unleash the spell. All of the stone in that area suddenly (gooey slop). You're getting the pillar in that as well? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: The center of the base of that pillar, about 40 feet up, something goes (gooey slop). 
ASHLEY: I'm going to book it back outside. 
MATT: You go to turn to run. Okay. So you turn around and begin to run. Now you've done your action and part of your movement to get there, so you turn around and begin to run right as you hear: (structural crack) There is a shift on the foundation of the chamber. 
LAURA: Right as she-- So that pillar's broken? 
MATT: That one-- 
LAURA: It's done? 
MATT: Its stone is hanging and about the last 40 feet of it are just (slopping). 
LAURA: Then I'm going to try to Telekinesis grip the other pillar and pull to shift it to where it makes that unstable as well. 
TALIESIN: I'm also at this point diving underground and heading towards underneath this chamber. and heading towards underneath this chamber. 
MATT: Okay, you're (burrowing) going underneath the stone. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, full speed. 
MATT: You got it. (burrowing) Moving that way. Both of them are making their saving throw. Natural four is not going to do it for that one, and for the emissary that's there, natural five. Uh-oh! Okay. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Both of them are restrained. 
ROBBIE: Nice! 
MATT: All right, so Fearne, you're now turning around and running in that direction. As they both sink into the mud, looking confused, the other fey looks around and turns, looking your direction. 
SAM: Are we-- 
MATT: And goes-- 
SAM: Oh, sorry. 
MATT: Shouts in Sylvan, "Hey! (halting shout)" Just starts yelling in that direction. Gloamglut, that is currently curled up, (massive shift) turns back in your direction. (snarls) 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Does he see me? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Oh yeah. (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) Does he see me? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: And that's where we're going to pick up next time. (clamoring) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: No! (groans) 
MARISHA: No! 
ROBBIE: We're made! 
TRAVIS: (groans) 
ASHLEY: Sheesh! 
SAM: It was a perfect plan! 
TRAVIS: Got to take a picture of this. 
LAURA: That's where we're picking up? 
MATT: He's now turned around to face you, so now you have a good view of him. 
MARISHA: (laughs) It was. 
TRAVIS: That is a bad dragon! 
MARISHA: I also thought you were talking about a chamber inside a chamber. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: It is. 
LAURA: I don't know. I wasn't picturing-- I knew it was a secondary thing, but I wasn't picturing it that much bigger than the first one. 
SAM: Foiled by our own lack of imagination! 
ASHLEY: Look at his mouth! 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh man! 
MATT: If you want to call that my bad for not being descriptive enough. 
SAM: No, no, no. ALL: (protesting) 
LIAM: No. 
TALIESIN: Absolutely not. 
LAURA: -- square footage, you know what I mean? 
TRAVIS: I like this. 
LIAM: Me too. Look at that dragon! 
ASHLEY: Look at Gloamglut's jaw! 
TRAVIS: Where did that dragon mini come from? Mini." 
LAURA: It's amazing. 
MATT: Oh, we had it custom made. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Wow! Brilliant. 
ASHLEY: I love him! 
MARISHA: That is fucking sick! 
LAURA: So pretty! 
MATT: I'll make sure to post the deets-- 
MARISHA: I mean, with this plan-- 
MATT: -- of the amazing team that put that together. 
MARISHA: If we can kill Gloamglut, we don't have to deal with him later. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no! He's going to be my baby! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're still bringing it down. 
MARISHA: Your baby? 
TRAVIS: Holy shit! 
MARISHA: I think we could still bring it down and maybe shave a little bit off. 
TALIESIN: ♪ There he is, my tiny horse ♪ 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Emissary. Emissary's got to go. 
LIAM: Yes. The first thing. 
ROBBIE: What, the emissary? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: The emissary. 
ROBBIE: No, I think he's got to stay. I think he's the key. 
LAURA: The emissary's got to survive and like-- 
ROBBIE: We got to get him out and we got to-- Sorry. 
LAURA: -- and act like, yeah. 
ROBBIE: We can do a tone of stuff. 
LAURA: We'll talk about this, yeah. 
SAM: We'll talk about this next. 
MARISHA: We're going to fire up the thread. We got to fire up the thread! We got to fire up the thread! 
MATT: Indeed. 
TALIESIN: Chat. 
MATT: We'll plot this until next time. But we'll pick it up then. 
ASHLEY: (groans) 
MATT: Thank you so much for joining us. We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet? Good night. (cheering)

Cooldown[]
MATT: (chuckles) 
ASHLEY: Dang it. 
TALIESIN: (shouts)
SAM: Okay, now we plan. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, this thread is now. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Now is the Cooldown. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Wait. 
SAM: So, wait.
ASHLEY: Well-- 
MATT: So this is--
TRAVIS: Wait, so why do we want to--
MARISHA: So, yeah, talk to-- Tell me your plan.
ROBBIE: I really do think-- I think if we can save the emissary, get him out quickly, if they still only see that it's Fearne, he can still go back to the Unseelie and say, "I was attacked by Ludinus. They're dickheads."
LAURA:Yeah, if we make it seem like we were with Ludinus while we save him-- or if he gets out and we can be like-- let him overhear us saying, "Ludinus said leave no survivors. If they're not going to work with us, then..."
ROBBIE: Yeah, and it's not a big deal that Fearne's been seen because you've got the connection and you can still pitch it as "Oh, his daughter was like--"
LAURA: Working with him.
ROBBIE: But we got to get him out of there and then turn his army against him. But that was our mission, right?
LAURA: Right. Or just destroy the--
MARISHA: Make them indifferent.
LAURA: If he dies, that information doesn't get to them anyway, and then it stalls out.
TRAVIS: Yeah, the flip side of that coin is if you kill everybody, then he sent an emissary and a team to meet with Ludinus and they all ended up dead.
LAURA: And they died. And that's all they know.
ROBBIE: Yeah.
SAM: Easier to kill everyone, although not easier to kill anyone because there's a fucking dragon right there.
TRAVIS: Well, so to talk it out, how would we convince the emissary to go back--
LAURA: It would be a deception.
ROBBIE: Maybe we could put on some armor real quick while we do something--?
TRAVIS: While a fight's going on inside? Are we going to get that much time with it?
ROBBIE: Yeah, like a soldier and usher him out of there?
MARISHA: We might not even have to be like, "We're with Ludinus." We could just be like, "This guy sucks and he's been fucking you this whole time and we have proof he's been..."
LIAM: But we're still the ones who ran in--
TRAVIS: The thing I was thinking earlier is that if we were going to try to convince him of something, we'd have to offer him something sweeter than what he's getting with Ludinus and Zathuda, right?
LAURA: Plus, we just killed a lot of his elite soldiers.
MARISHA: That's true.
TRAVIS: Somebody did.
SAM: Or did we?
ROBBIE: Yeah.
LAURA: Somebody did.
TRAVIS: What would we--
SAM: There was this guy that killed all your soldiers!
TALIESIN: It was a one-armed man.
SAM: He was right here a second ago.
ASHLEY: I don't know where he went.
SAM: We chased him off. Don't worry.
TRAVIS: And we don't know what the Unseelie get out of this bargain, right?
ROBBIE: Deception check.
TALIESIN: Oh, I mean they've got--
TRAVIS: They mentioned a couple of names that we hadn't heard before, and we don't know what the Uncanny Ambush is.
LAURA: I think what they get out of it is that they wouldn't be under the control of the gods anymore, either. Ludinus is saying that if they help him, then the Arch Heart won't be able to control what they're doing anymore, or won't have...
ROBBIE: They were getting salty with each other, for sure.
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: There's one name, though...
ROBBIE: There's already dissent between them.
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: The name "Sammanar" came up. Sammanar is the head of the Unseelie Court.
LAURA: Because if all of those emissaries die when meeting with Ludinus, that sends a pretty strong message. You know what I mean?
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.
ROBBIE: But who delivers it to whoever is second in line?
TALIESIN: Anybody who comes--
LAURA: Then we send a fucking-- We send a message to the Unseelie Court from Ludinus. You know what I mean?
TALIESIN: Honestly, they're going to-- someone eventually is going to go try to find this guy and this is what they're going to find.
SAM: Regardless of whether we let this guy live or try to kill everybody, how do we even attack? We're not in a good position right here.
LAURA: Well...
SAM: Are we waiting until they all run out towards us or are we all charging in?
TRAVIS: The first part of the attack, I think, was to-- We've softened the floor, one of the columns is down. There's a second one that we can see. If Ashton could pop up in the ground and take that second column down, then maybe the roof would start to come down.
TALIESIN: My hope is-- yeah, pop up or even hit it from below.
TRAVIS: But that would force us outside. If it comes down. Otherwise we're fighting in rubble.
LAURA: Plus, Gloamglut is just going to (minor explosion) through the ceiling anyway.
TRAVIS: Feels like it.
TALIESIN: But if the ceiling is coming down--
MARISHA: If the ceiling comes down it might be able to shave off some of his health.
LIAM: It shaves some off, and the power players will all stay on their feet, but these three fey will either be heavily softened up or done.
LAURA: Yeah, especially if they can't run while the ceiling's coming down.
SAM: How do we knock down that second pillar?
LAURA: Ashton--
TALIESIN: I'm going to swim underneath it.
SAM: Solo?
TALIESIN: I'm swimming underneath this right now, and I do double damage to structures right now.
SAM: Okay. Okay.
TALIESIN: So I can do a hundred. I might be able to do 100 points of damage right off.
ASHLEY: There's no negotiating we can do.
LIAM: I don't know how we control how those three people perceive what's about to unfold.
TALIESIN: If there's a way to turn it to our advantage where they figure out-- decide that it's his fault, that's great because then there's more people to fight a dragon.
ROBBIE: Well, fuck, if you wanted to lean into the narrative that you're with dad, you could do a little play acting right off the bat.
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: We've also got Ira still.
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: And Ira is a political...
LAURA: Who loves chaos.
SAM: Who can erase people's memories and stuff.
LAURA: Ira loves chaos.
ASHLEY: Ira is so down.
SAM: He might have Replace Memory.
ROBBIE: And Ira is sided with Ludinus currently or no?
TALIESIN: No.
ROBBIE: Not at all?
LAURA: No.
ROBBIE: He's not with anyone.
LAURA: No, because Ira hates Lord Zathuda so much that... Yeah. That he's just trying to fuck up any of his plans.
MATT: Ira once worked with Ludinus, and then feels super-slighted.
ASHLEY: He hates all of them.
SAM: But he wants to impress Nana Morri to get back in her--
ROBBIE: What are Ira's performance stats?
SAM: --in her bed.
LAURA: Her sexy good grace.
SAM: Her sexy bed. So he'll do whatever it takes to please her. As he should.
TRAVIS: Yeah, the bargaining thing would be with Sammanar, not the emissary.
LAURA: Maybe you and I can work together, Ashton, because once you hit the pillar it'll be easier for me to yank--
TALIESIN: I mean, if you're pulling it, that's why I'm--
ROBBIE: Don't kill the messenger!
MARISHA: I know!
TRAVIS: That's what he said. He was like, "I'll go back and relay the thing." That's why he said to go tell him to bring your Uncanny Ambush with your armies. He'll know what that means. Bitch, what does it mean!?
SAM: Whatever we do, we can let him die last.
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Poke through and then--
ROBBIE: You think we're going to take these two at once?
TRAVIS: Uncanny Ambush feels like they were going to do some mass disguise, look like Vasselheim or infiltration or something.
MARISHA: Theoretically I guess we could try and, once again, keep the emissary alive last, and if persuading him goes poorly, then he still dies.
LAURA: Yeah. We can also Speak with Dead on him if they all die to find out what the plans are.
LIAM: Yeah, bring the skull back to Vasselheim.
ASHLEY: Is there any negotiating we could do with Papa?
TRAVIS: Zathuda?
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: You can.
LAURA: You can try.
ASHLEY: But what?
MARISHA: Well, he wants you.
LAURA: "I'm on your side now, Dad. I want to work with you."
SAM: Even though I just tried to knock down the roof over your head.
ASHLEY: I didn't see you.
TRAVIS: You'd have to know--
LIAM: What are the circumstances with this dragon now turning towards Fearne and moving towards her, and Dad's on top, right?
TALIESIN: It's going to have to get squishy to get out.
LIAM: Right. That dragon's going to start screaming and he's going to be like, "My daughter!" This is about to go upside down. So I don't know how you'd be like, "Guys, there's been a mix up. You don't understand. We need to convince you to not--"
SAM: This is a family matter.
TALIESIN: Record scratch. You're probably wondering how we got here.
ROBBIE: How's your deception?
SAM: It's pretty good, isn't it?
LAURA: Your deception's pretty good.
ASHLEY: It's not great. Weirdly.
TRAVIS: Just in case you get captured or something, it would be good to know what Zathuda is getting out of it. What's the--
ASHLEY: Yeah. What's the angle for him?
ROBBIE: Can we turn those two against each other somehow?
TRAVIS: Zathuda and Ludinus?
ASHLEY: I feel like Zathuda already hates Ludinus.
LAURA: They do. They already hate each other. He treats him like shit. He treats him like he's just a brute.
ASHLEY: Yeah, he treats him like shit.
TALIESIN: No one in this group likes anybody else.
ASHLEY: No, they all want power and control.
TALIESIN: So it's just trying to figure out how to set them all off against each other.
ROBBIE: "I'm here to help you. Let's take him down, Dad."
SAM: So then yeah, is it appealing to have your dad saying--
LAURA: What if his two biggest lieutenants, my mom and your dad, both turn against him? That might be a huge thing in the final battles.
ASHLEY: Wait, say that again?
LAURA: If you can get Zathuda turned against Ludinus and my mom turned against Ludinus, what a big boon in the final battles.
TRAVIS: You'd have to make some guarantees, though.
LAURA: You've already pledged to so many entities at this point.
ROBBIE and MARISHA: What's one more?
ASHLEY: Options, options, options.
TRAVIS: You just summon your hell army when he summons his Unseelie army and we'll rock and roll.
TALIESIN: Hopefully the hell army won't fight the demon army. And they fey army will be perfectly happy with the hell army.
ASHLEY: I got to go make a hell army.
TRAVIS: (deeply) Hell army.
LIAM: Well, hell.
SAM: I wouldn't mind that.
MARISHA: So we know we're going to try to drop this other pillar. Everything else is TBD?
SAM: Is Step One going to be Fearne saying, "Dad! Don't let him disrespect you like that! Fight back!"
LAURA: "I heard what he was saying."
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: "My dad would totally beat your dad in a fight."
TRAVIS: We're not going to have a chance to ask what they're doing.
LAURA: I know.
ASHLEY: It's an option, but--
LAURA: We might just be out of time in that regard.
TALIESIN: I was also thinking about trying to knock down the entrance to this room.
LAURA: I mean, yeah.
TALIESIN: Although again, trying to drop some stones on this dragon--
MARISHA: But they can all fucking teleport and shit.
SAM: Not all of them.
LAURA: The fey ones might not be able to.
ASHLEY: Ludinus will be gone.
TALIESIN: It's not the real Ludinus.
SAM: I hate the idea of all of us just waiting outside and hoping Ashton knocks down the pillar, and just sort of waiting. I'd love to be doing something to prepare or to help.
TRAVIS: Yeah. I was going to do Thunderwave either inside or outside.
SAM: I can do Thunderwave also.
TRAVIS: If we can shake a bunch of shit, it would be really bad.
SAM: I mean, we're in there.
ASHLEY: I tried to do it at the entrance so that it'll block all that.
SAM: We can Misty Step out, or we can get out of there quick.
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm just going to stay under there for as long as I can doing damage and then pop up when I have to.
ROBBIE: I was thinking about prepping-- I always mispronounce it-- Guys? Geas?
MARISHA: Geas.
MATT: I love this stuff so much.
TRAVIS: You guys ever feel like we're just a bunch of guppies in the ocean and a great white shark is over there watching us?
TALIESIN: All the fucking time!
ROBBIE: Well, I can make somebody do something truly shady.
MATT: I love this shit.
SAM: Not to neg you, doesn't Geas take a while to cast?
ROBBIE: It takes a minute.
TALIESIN: We do not have a minute.
ROBBIE: It's a long time.
LAURA: Ten rounds.
TALIESIN: We do not have 10 rounds.
LIAM: That dragon is about to start--
SAM: But if we need this guy alive at the end of the fight, if he's still alive, then you could do it, yeah.
LIAM: We don't have a minute.
LAURA: No, 10 rounds because a round is 6 seconds.
TRAVIS: 6 seconds a round.
ROBBIE: Ten individual, not ten.
LAURA: No, 10 full fucking rounds.
ROBBIE: A round is six seconds?
MATT: Nope.
MARISHA: When everybody goes is six seconds.
MATT: A full round is six seconds.
ROBBIE: I thought it was each person! You learn something new every day.
MATT: The idea is everything's happening simultaneously.
MARISHA: So you still move in and do your attack within six seconds, but so is everybody else.
ROBBIE: Yeah, that's too much time to prep.
TALIESIN: We feel you there, though. I can do a lot of structural damage. That's the one thing that I really, really, like a good point for right now.
SAM: If you and me run in, we Thunderwave while you're knocking down a pillar--
ROBBIE: Who can't Thunderwave?
SAM: --Rubble, rubble, bang, bang, bang. We win!
MARISHA: I love it! That's great.
TALIESIN: At least it's a start. 
ASHLEY: It's a start. We'll discuss.
TALIESIN: The thing will be tactics, because we've all learned no plan survives one round.
TRAVIS: True.
TALIESIN: Immediately one round in.
TRAVIS: The good thing about it being inside if the roof doesn't fall down is it limits his ability to fly out of range.
TALIESIN: Yes.
TRAVIS: If he goes through the roof--
TALIESIN: We're in big trouble.
LIAM: Matt, what was the shit Ludinus threw at Zathuda again?
ASHLEY: I can turn into something to fly away.
MATT: The phrase you heard was, "How I despise the challenge of communicating with the fey. And you-- nary a word to bolster our cause with your own people. Are you truly bereft of any worth to our cause, Athion? Daft as you are disappointing."
TRAVIS: "Athion?"
ASHLEY: Athion Zathuda.
MATT: Athion is his name.
LIAM: Ludinus just fucking insulted him to his face.
TALIESIN: We might be able to turn him.
LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: So that's what Ludinus was saying to Zathuda.
LIAM: Ludinus said "You're worthless" to him. "You suck. You're not saying anything and you suck."
ASHLEY: You suck. I'm disappointed.
ROBBIE: We just created a pressure cooker scenario but that's all we have. We don't know what to do with it.
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: It's going to get real interesting real fast next game.
TRAVIS: All right, we'll pick it up with that. Good luck, everybody.
MATT: Yeah.
