MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of The Menagerie, where a bunch of us nerdy-voice actors sit around and play the Daggerheart Open Beta. 
TRAVIS: Open beta! Open beta! (excited clamoring) 
MATT: Indeed. So today, we're taking the Daggerheart version 1.4 for a spin with the leveled-up Menagerie characters. If you guys hadn't had a chance to check it out yet, we had our level-up video that went up earlier today as well as an update stream with Spenser and myself that talked about the update to the rules. Both are available now on VOD on YouTube and Beacon, our newly launched membership service! 
TRAVIS: Oh man! 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: But in other Darrington Press news, before we jump in, we also released today For the Queen. 
TRAVIS: For the Queen. 
ASHLEY: For the Queen! 
MATT: By award winning game designer Alex Roberts. It is an incredible collaborative storytelling card game where you and your friends around the table each answer questions to weave a narrative of love, betrayal, doubt, and devotion towards the queen as your characters accompany her on her journey. It's like a creative writers room. Every time I play, it's so awesome. Find For the Queen right now at Critical Role online shops and other friendly local game stores. No seriously, if you've got narratively game inspired friends, check it out. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: I love it. Laura, you have a quick announcement to make as well. 
LAURA: That I do. Also available in the US Critical Role shop today, we just launched pre-orders for signed art prints of Bells Hells by Matteo Scalera--

LAURA: Pre-orders for this stunning Bells Hells art print-- 
MARISHA: (whispering) Stunning. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LAURA: -- end on May 31st. And hey, guess what?

MARISHA: Whoa. 
TRAVIS: Snap dragons. 
LIAM: Queen gets a discount? 
MARISHA: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: Sheesh. 
MARISHA: The Queen is the discount. 
MATT: Also, I'm going to point out real fast. You guys haven't seen, too. 
LAURA: You know I love me a deal.

We also have a special custom art of Queen by Midnight to use in here and for the Queen game as well. So check it out in our shops and grab yourself some of these exclusive art cards. ("German" accent) I'm done with that announcement and as such, I believe it's time for us to jump into the second episode of The Menagerie. I don't know why I'm in German, but oh well. 
TRAVIS: ("German" accent) I don't know. We don't have to do this. 
LIAM: When in doubt. 
MATT: When in doubt. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Roll with it. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: It's like we're doing it somewhere else during the day. 
MATT: Indeed. So friends. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's right, we go right in, we go right in. 

Part I[]
MATT: Here, we return to the realm of Lochspire, where we had left off. The Menagerie, this gathered crew of heroes from within the GrymmWardens faction and our protagonist party at this table-- Yah. 
MATT: -- had encountered fleeing fae protectors from a rapidly corrupting forest fane within the vast verdant space known as the Emerald Sky. Trekking towards the core of a location called the Velvet Grove. Warnings from various indigenous spirits of this forest begin to warn you of the spreading corruption from within as well as seeing more signs of other denizens of the forest growing dark and violent. Approaching this grove and witnessing signs of a variation to the legendary curse known as The Seep seemingly spreading from within, our heroes, you, managed to destroy the source of this corruption and cleansed Boko, the Guardian of the Grove, and also learning of a man who wandered through not long before these events, who is likely tied to the source of this recent Seep corruption within the woods. A man named Dyson Broshe, recognized only by Bunnie here as a conman and a patron commonly of her home venue known as the Lilly Locket Lounge in Luhlvale. So with this refreshed information, the possible seed of mystery and coming danger as to who this Dyson figure is and what he wants with spreading such terrible sickness across the realm. 
LAURA: I thought he wanted to suck up the sickness. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
MATT: Could be. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: I got it. (oohing) 
MATT: No name is safe, ladies and gentlemen. 
MARISHA: Wasn't it Dylan? Was it Dylan? 
TALIESIN: Dylan Dyson? 
TRAVIS: I think he knows his own name. (mumbles) 
MATT: I have my note. 
LAURA: It's Dylan? 
MATT: I don't-- on my sheet I wrote-- 
TRAVIS: Either one works. 
MATT: -- Dyson. 
ASHLEY: Listen. 
LIAM: Let's say Dyson. 
MARISHA: He was a pretty unforgettable person. 
TRAVIS: Big D in Luhlvale. 
LAURA: His name was definitely Dyson. 
MARISHA: You'll see-- (laughs) 
MATT: That's fine, Dylan now. 
MARISHA: Was it Dylan? 
LAURA: Dylan Dyson. 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
MARISHA: Dylan Dyson? 
MATT: Who's wrote-- Did you write down Dyson or Dylan in your notes? 
ASHLEY: I wrote down Dylan, but I feel like now that I'm looking at notes, it says Dyson? 
LAURA: Dyson. 
TRAVIS: It's either one. 
TALIESIN: It's Dylan Dyson. 
TRAVIS: Either one. 
LIAM: Berenstain. 
ASHLEY: Dyslan. 
LIAM: Berenstain. 
MARISHA: Berenstain. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Berenstein! 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: You guys, are we in a parallel universe? 
ASHLEY: What do they call it? 
LAURA: I'm sorry, Matt. 
MATT: It's okay. 
ASHLEY: The Mandela effect? 
MATT: This is how-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, it's fine. 
MATT: This is how professionals do this. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: As I quickly-- 
ASHLEY: You've only had-- 
MATT: -- go through-- 
ASHLEY: -- you know-- 
MATT: -- my notes here. 
ASHLEY: -- a million NPCs in your head from all different games. It's fine. 
MATT: It's fine, it's fine. We're just doing everything at once. Okay, so we'll go with that for now. But nevertheless, with this lead of information towards this darkening source of nature ravaging space. Okay, so Matt says Dylan, then we adjust everything to be Dyson because I think I misspoke last time. 
ASHLEY: Oh, that's fine. 
MATT: That was on me. 
TRAVIS: Fuck Dylan. 
MATT: So yeah, it's no Dylan, it's Dyson. 
ASHLEY: Who the fuck is Dylan? 
MATT: That's on me. Canonically, it's now Dyson. 
LAURA: It's Big D. 
TRAVIS: Dyson's the bomb. 
MARISHA: Big D! (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Dyson, Dyson wants to suck everything up. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: See, now I regret it. 
LAURA: Spread it around. No, but Dyson just spread everything around. 
LIAM: Apologies to all the Dylans out there. 
MATT: Sure, sure. 
TRAVIS: But the other Dylans are cool. 
TALIESIN: Regrets are for players, not for the DM. 
MATT: The GMs out there, you feel me. Nevertheless, leaving The Emerald Sky and trekking across the central continent of Lochspire to head towards the home abode of Bunnie, heading off towards Luhlvale. Pango splinters off towards his own Seep fallen subterranean home of Ubi, in search of possible information about the Seep's beginnings and see if there's a connection here. So sadly, bids you all adieu for the time being and will reconvene with you and you can hopefully put the information you've gathered together and have a stronger idea of what dangers beset this land. 
LAURA: I'll miss you, Pango. 
MATT: "I miss you, too." And he leaves. 
LIAM: Don't be a stranger, big man. 
ASHLEY: Poor Pango. (laughter) 
MATT: Now, you walk throughout the Atherlull Mountains. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: Pushing through the mist shrouded mountain passes that wind between the daunting peaks of the Atherlull. Numerous waterfalls carved down the sides of the range and pool and small ponds and lakes that dot throughout the craggy landscape. The occasional moss- covered cabin or crumbled wagon peeks from the mist beyond the well-worn roadway that you follow. But as the sun begins to set, a wooden sign comes into view with pointed markers labeled in different directions with different distances. One is the builder's bridge. Another says Sermon Terts. (laughter) 
MATT: The Crimson Mines. 
ASHLEY: Oh yes, I forgot about Sermon Terts. Yes. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) What? Ridiculous. 
MARISHA: What did we do? 
MATT: What every player does, have fun. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's what it's called. 
MATT: But along this sign you also see Luhlvale, two miles. So you continue to hike along this road as the sky darkens, small dots of glowing red peeking through the surrounding stone like tiny sparse lamps. You cross a creaky wooden bridge that crosses one of the smaller ravines to be revealed before you. A breathstaking-- breathstaking-- breathtaking view of a multi-leveled cliffside city enveloped in dusky red glow from hundreds of exposed red crystals and veins of crystal that emerge from the eroded gorge face entangled throughout the city streets. You see tumbling waterfalls framing the city, plunging into the ravine floor below while hanging colorful lanterns sway along the street arches and banners. You can hear the echo of mingling music filling the air as you approach the outskirts of the city just as the final light of day begins to fade. This is Luhlvale, the crimson city of sin. 
LAURA: (gasps) Honey, this is beautiful. 
MARISHA: Isn't it just the prettiest? Oh, I'm getting tingly in places being back home again. 
LIAM: Right, why is it called the city of sin? How'd they earn that one? 
MARISHA: Oh, well you see, I mean, Sir Dant√© can lay it out. 
TALIESIN: It's sort of a-- 
MARISHA: You know, you can really find anything anybody wants in there. 
MATT: "Yoo-hoo!" Right as you step within the first street, you can see up in this large balcony, there is an array of three beautiful people across the gender spectrum, well dressed in all beckoning down to you as you step in, "Travelers from afar, need a place to stay and need a body to keep warm?" and-- 
ASHLEY: Wow! I am cold. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Well, let's-- never stop at the first place that you come upon in Luhlvale. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you just keep going? 
MARISHA: You know, it's, yeah. 
ASHLEY: They were so friendly! 
TALIESIN: Do a round. At least a round. 
MARISHA: You can look around, you know, shop around, see what suits you. 
LIAM: Hello there, darling. Do you have any recommendations? 
MATT: "Well, it depends on how much you're paying." 
LIAM: Do we have any money? 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: I think we have a few handfuls of gold. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Do I recognize this woman? 
MATT: No, no, much to your specific, adage that you placed forward with your friend, you don't bother too much with the outskirts businesses as most of your life has grown up more towards the core of the city where the true beating heart of the vibrant city of sin resides. 
MARISHA: I just tell her: Buzz off, lady! 
MATT: (scoffs) Backs up off the side and you can see kicks a rock off the top. (light impacts) Taps along. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
LIAM: Ow! 
MATT: The city is beginning to bustle already. You can hear amongst various porches there are musicians out in front that are having jam sessions. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: You can see street performers that are beginning to gather their materials and head towards the central core of the city. This here, the base entry platform of the city here, you can see there are staircases that wind up to a secondary and then a third level up along the cliff face, it seems to wind up it as it goes. Everything giving this warm, vibrant crimson light throughout. 
ASHLEY: I've never seen such a beautiful place in my life. Wow. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It is definitely good to be back. Absolutely. 
MARISHA: I forgot what you sounded like. 
TALIESIN: I know. It's fun, isn't it? (laughter) 
LIAM: You've been quiet all day, so-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) Well, yeah, I'll give you a quick little tour. Let's start with the Lilly Locket Lounge. You got to see it. 
LAURA: Will they know about Dyson-- 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, he came in all the time. Do you remember that guy? He was such a little chode. 
TALIESIN: Oh, he sucked. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Such a creeper. 
TALIESIN: His name was Dyson. He sucked. 
MARISHA: (laughs) His name was Dyson. 
TALIESIN: He sucks. 
TRAVIS: That horse's dick. 
TALIESIN: Really? 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That's all. 
MARISHA: Five minutes in. 
MATT: We should've kept it Dylan. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Been there, done that. 
LAURA: Been there, done that. 
TRAVIS: Would you say this is a warm reception for you or did you leave on good terms or bad terms? 
MARISHA: Oh, no, no, no. We're good, we're good. You know, totally would recommend me for any of the jobs. Yeah, no, you see it, there's things started getting so weird with, you know, I don't know, maybe it's Seep related, but I don't know. 
TALIESIN: It could be. There was certainly some mist related issues. 
MARISHA: Yeah, it was getting all misty. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
LAURA: Maybe The Seep appears different ways everywhere that it is, you know-- 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Because Pango was saying that The Seep there was like watery and The Seep we saw was gooey. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was really gooey. 
LAURA: Maybe The Seep here is misty. 
MARISHA: Well, basically, what started happening is you see, well, there's all these beautiful red crystals and you know, just out of nowheres they started changing colors. 
ASHLEY: What? 
MARISHA: I know and it totally messes with the aesthetic. 
LAURA: Yeah, it changes the vibe for sure. What color did it change to? 
MARISHA: All kinds of weird colors, black and brown and blue and-- 
MARISHA: All kinds of weird colors, black and brown and blue and-- 
LIAM: That's three. 
TALIESIN: Mauve. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, it was all-- 
TALIESIN: Cute. 
MARISHA: It just wasn't, it clashed real bad. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, the red is a really nice tone. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It does. It's an aesthetic for sure. 
TALIESIN: And the risk can be-- 
MARISHA: Very dominating. 
TALIESIN: This were quite dangerous, if I recall. It was not, I mean, we certainly had some scuffling issues on the seaside, if I recall. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I rescued him. 
TALIESIN: It's true. 
LAURA: Oh really? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: That's how we met. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
ASHLEY: How? 
LAURA: Rescued him from what? 
TALIESIN: Well, the mist of the sea. Yes. 
MARISHA: The weird misty stuff. 
LAURA: Oh. 
TALIESIN: It's very difficult to fight a mist actually. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: It turns out. 
LAURA: Oh, you had-- It didn't change you or-- 
TALIESIN: No, just tried to drown me and slowly pressed me beneath the sea. 
ASHLEY: Wait, it was a fighting mist? 
TALIESIN: Well, I was fighting, it was more just doing its mist thing. 
MARISHA: (laughs) It's just a mist. 
LAURA: Are you sure you weren't drunk? 
TALIESIN: Oh yes. 
LIAM: That was in and around Luhlvale? 
MARISHA: Well, it was kind of on the outskirts. 
LIAM: Right. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: How long did you work here for? 
MARISHA: Oh, I've been here for so long. Basically, since I was a young little girl. 
LIAM: What was the name of that lass you said that you looked up to here? She still here? What's her name again? 
MARISHA: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Mafauna? Mafauna? 
MARISHA: Yeah, you're thinking of Mafauna. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: But she's, you know, she's-- 
LIAM: Your what now? 
MARISHA: Mafauna. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: (laughs) She's-- 
TALIESIN: Me mama and me father. 
MARISHA: But you know, she's real famous and you know, she got almost too famous for us. So she's going around, she's traveling, she's doing her thing. 
LIAM: What's she famous for? 
MARISHA: Taking her clothes off. 
LIAM: Oh, she's good at it, then? 
MARISHA: Oh yeah. 
LIAM: Oh. 
MARISHA: (accented) Oh yeah. 
LIAM: So like a mentor so to speak? 
MARISHA: Well, no, not really. Actually, you should come to the Lilly Locket, you'll meet my mentor. 
LIAM: All right. Oh, I'm getting people confused. Are there any food stalls on the streets-- 
MATT: There are. 
LIAM: -- as we go? 
MATT: Now, as the music begins to grow more vibrant, as you press around, you can see some of the stalls that have opened into the street. It looks like there is continuous buzzing of laughter and conversation. All manner of figures from all different types of scales of wealth are wandering through and clapping each other's backs and chuckling as they go from one establishment to the next. It very much has a perpetual, subtle Mardi Gras vibe to a lot of the central street here. Indeed, there are many of sidecarts and such. You can see immediately over to the right, there is this older rotund orcish man who has a heavy leather apron in front and a big table and has a bunch of different fish, of different sizes hanging from the top and is currently cleaning one and about a throw it on this massive ramshod grill that made off the side. It smells delicious. 
LIAM: Excuse me, grandfather. 
MATT: "Yeah." 
LIAM: You have any raw, you got any cooked fish or is it all raw here? 
MATT: "Give me about two minutes, it'll be cooked fish." 
LIAM: I'll have a little bit of cooked fish. You got any vegetables to go alongside that? 
MATT: Leans over and you can see where the cart to the right of them has this somewhat dreary-eyed looking, older halfling woman who is in the middle of a conversation with somebody, but looks to be about passing out and the orc reaches over and grabs a cabbage, crushes it in his hand and goes, "It's cooked now," throws it on the grill. 
LIAM: Great. Yeah, it's not for me, it's for these guys. There's two puppies poking out-- 
MARISHA: He still got the puppies. 
LIAM: -- on my shirt. Well, it's only a day later here or so, isn't it? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Isn't it? No, it's been a while. 
MATT: It's been a few days travel. 
LIAM: It's a few days. I didn't chuck them in the river the day after. (laughter) 
LIAM: Anyway, I'd like to keep them fed, you know, healthy food, raw sometimes, but cooked, you know, when they've been good boys and they're very good boys. 
ASHLEY: They're very, very good boys. 
MATT: Happily, for just a couple of quick coins, carves up the cooked fish within the required state for pups of their age and size, mingles it with some of the now withered, slightly charred cabbage and puts it into a makeshift it looks like a wicker bowl that can fall apart in any minute and pass it over and goes, "That'll do for you." 
LIAM: There we go, you are two good babbies, so you'll get Farmer's Dog. 
TALIESIN: Mm, oh, oh no. Oh. 
MARISHA: That's that good stuff. So expensive. 
TALIESIN: That cabbage is very-- It creates quite a bit of gas. I should warn you with it's a very gassy cabbage. 
LIAM: That's why I sleep outside. 
TALIESIN: Oh dear. 
MATT: Following Bunnie past the various buildings, and there are small spires and beautiful banners that are painted multitudes of colors. There are-- The word completely just left my brain. Massive art pieces that are painted across the outside of heavy wide walls. 
LAURA: Murals. 
ASHLEY: Murals. 
MATT: Murals, thank you. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: I got there eventually. 
ASHLEY: Sounds like. 
MATT: With your help. 
MARISHA: (laughs) It sounds like. 
MATT: It is definitely a city of art and expression in all of its forms. Following Bunnie's step, eventually you come upon a massive dark maroon-stained wood, multi-leveled decadent theater that you can see emblazoned on the outside across numerous entryways in a gilded cursive that drifts across in a beautiful, if rapid manner: The Lilly Locket Lounge. 
LIAM: Fuck me, that looks like a bit of the all right. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Well, come in, come in. Come on, go. 
TALIESIN: Oh, dear. 
MATT: Stepping within the chamber, immediately you're hit with the smells of, it could be old wines mixed with various perfumes that hit the stale air to not an unpleasant smell, but definitely a mishmash of people that have been coming and going, or have been moseying about for the time being. But the entryway as you step through has this beautiful wide arch that has these glowing magical lanterns that crackle on the sides as you step into the main foyer space, a high-domed ceiling that has clouds painted across it to feel like it's a midday bright sky above. From there, you can see all manner of marquees that set up all these different performers. You can see this amazing ribbet woman holding this massive inflated bubble that's guarding her naughty bits. You can see this incredibly muscular lithe trapeze artist, a human elf that is holding from this silk and it's this Adonis of a man. You can see all these various performers within the first, the front entryway, and not too far off the left, you can see a familiar looking figure, looks just like Bunnie on one of these. If you want to describe what your marquee image painted on this wall looks like. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
LAURA: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
MARISHA: Well, you see, you know. Yeah, because you know, my specialty is with the fans, you know? So you see just, you know it's me, but a little bit more scantily clad, you know, because I got to protect the bits. But you know, you see two big fans with two feathers, like what the show girls use, and they're all feathered, just perfectly covering her and she looks like too much glow, like they went in and fucked with the brightness and she is just-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Of the paint. 
LAURA, MARISHA, and ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Just glowing. 
MATT: Just as this is happening, a thick-- 
LAURA: Your fur is spotless. 
MATT and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. 
ASHLEY: So fluffy. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: A thick-torsoed chimpanzee simian steps up with this black coat on, the collar white, but it sticks out a little bit from the sides. He has a tie placed around. The front of his fur, it seems to be cultivated into this big bushy mustache that covers the top of the lip. He steps forward with a white rope and goes, "Hello, friends, yeah. Who would like to see some magic?" 
ASHLEY: I would, I would, I would, I would! 
MATT: Now watch this. 
MARISHA: Wait, do I know this guy? 
MATT: You do not know this figure. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: What is going on? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. 
MARISHA: They must have hired him after we left. 
LIAM: You're a big fan of closeup magic, aren't ya? 
TRAVIS: Not so much. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: Pulls a small blade from the pocket. "Ooh, dangerous." 
ASHLEY: Ooh, are you going to cut it? 
MATT: "Sharp. Yes." 
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MATT: "Two pieces of rope." 
ASHLEY: Two pieces of rope now. 
TALIESIN: I move out of melee range. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Tie them into a knot, like you see before you and--" pulls. It's a single piece of rope. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: How'd you do that? 
MATT: "Magic, my friend." 
ASHLEY: (awed) Oh! 
MATT: "(laughing) Magic." 
TRAVIS: Can I use Reveal to make a spellcast roll if anything is hidden within close range, that roll would succeed against it is no longer hidden? (laughter) 
MATT: Yes, you may. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: That's so mean. I love it! 
TALIESIN: And Travis wins the game. All go home now. 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: It's a total of 16, 17, 18, 19 with Hope. 
LAURA: Oh, yay. 
MATT: 19 with Hope, awesome. So take a Hope on that. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: "Thank you, thank you." As he's holding out his hat to take any sort of coinage or patronage, he leans forward and you see falling from the back of his hand, the two other pieces of rope (clatter) onto the ground. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you did cut it! 
MATT: "(bumbling)" Shovels it behind with his simian foot and grabs it and quickly shovels it into a pocket. "Ah, I have a meeting I need to get to." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "Have a good night," and darts off, kind of embarrassed. 
LAURA: Why would he cut the rope if he already had cut rope? 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You made him disappear. Well done. Very impressive. 
MARISHA: Ugh, we're not-- He's not on our payroll. That was a bad first impression. 
LAURA: Are you sure? 
ASHLEY: He's just like someone that comes to the bar and tries to do tricks inside-- 
MARISHA: Yes. Yes! 
ASHLEY: And you're like, (uncomfortable groans) I understand what's happening here. 
MARISHA: Don't take that as a representation. 
LIAM: I don't think I understood that you're a celebrity here. 
MARISHA: Oh. (giggles) 
LIAM: Well you're on the wall, you're on the marquee. 
MARISHA: No. ("humble" laugh) No. 
LIAM: Don't, stop! 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
ASHLEY: "No, no." 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MATT: "Bunnie, my dear," you hear as you spin and look. Speaking of bar, there is this majestic, multi-tiered, magically lit bar shelf with this massive beautiful dark mahogany polished bar with a brass edge to it, and you can see there's two bartenders running for some of the patrons that are starting to come up. People are really well dressed in this space. You can see it carries an air of definitely upper echelon aesthetic. But one figure turns from the bar. You see this older elf woman with her gray hair pulled up in victory curls at the top there. She has this very, a nicer version of the stepmother from-- 
MARISHA: Cinderella? 
MATT: Cinderella. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: (laughs) A high neck dress you could see with pointed shoulders that go out. But she has this warm smile about her, approaches. (dignified) "My dear, I wasn't certain if you were going to return to us." 
MARISHA: Of course I'd return. I love you so much. 
MATT: "Oh, you're so sweet, doll. (dignified chuckle) Who are your friends here, if I might ask?" 
MARISHA: Oh, you're going to love it. Everybody, this is the Matron Boa Adra. 
MATT: "At your service." 
ASHLEY: Boa Adra. 
MARISHA: Yes, she's the madam. She runs, this is her establishment. 
ASHLEY: Wow, it's beautiful. 
LAURA: Pleasure to make your acquaintance, madame. 
MATT: "Pleasure is mine. I prefer the term lording manager." 
ASHLEY: Lording manager. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
MATT: "Makes the men feel inferior." (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: "But, please, welcome. As friends of Bunnie, you're friends of ours." 
MARISHA: Yeah, these are-- We came up with a real nice name for ourselves. We're the Menagerie! 
MATT: "Ooh! Is this your performance troupe now? Are you looking for a contract?" 
MARISHA: Well, no. You still, you didn't cancel my contract, right? 
MATT: "No, but I also don't recall your contract allowing you to bring other performers in under it, so we'd have to renegotiate." 
ASHLEY: We can perform. 
MARISHA: Speaking of, you have an infestation of magicians. 
MATT: "I know, I'm working on it." 
MARISHA: You've got to get them out of heres. 
ASHLEY: And they're not very good. 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: "(sighs) We brought one fairly talented magician once and it just calls in all the riffraff. Nevertheless." 
LAURA: I liked him. 
MATT: "Welcome. If you'd like to stay for the show, you might. What--" 
LAURA: (gasps) Are you going to perform, Bunnie? 
MARISHA: Oh, no, no. I'm so rusty. (coquettish dismissal) 
LAURA: Bunnie! Bunnie! 
TRAVIS: Do it! 
LAURA, TRAVIS, and ASHLEY: Bunnie! Bunnie! Bunnie! 
MARISHA: No. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yes, and. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: No! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's not how it goes! 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughter) 
LIAM: What that Bunnie or Marisha? 
TRAVIS: ‚ô™ (driving drum beat) ‚ô™ 
MARISHA: I'm sure the perform-- I'm sure the set list is probably completely full, right? 
MATT: "Well, I mean, we could always make room if need be." 
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, yes! 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (beaming light) Spotlight. 
MATT: "To be honest, Lamont had to back out last minute due to an ankle injury." 
MARISHA: Really? What? 
MATT: "So there is a spot leading right up to our key performer. Mafauna has returned from tour." 
LAURA: (gasps) Mafauna? 
MARISHA: (gasps) She's here? 
MATT: "Yes." 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. Okay, you guys got to see this. 
LAURA: I've always wanted to see Mafauna. 
MARISHA: It's incredible. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
MARISHA: What happened? Where's Lamont? 
MATT: "I believe she's in her room recovering." 
MARISHA: All right. Can I go see her? 
MATT: "Of course you may." 
MARISHA: All right. Can I bring them backstage? 
LIAM: We're more like roadies than actual performers. 
TRAVIS: (insectile chittering) 
MATT: "Right." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: "Well, they're under your... They're under your employ for the time being, that means they're under your contract and they're your responsibility." 
MARISHA: Ah. 
TALIESIN: I'll wrangle a little bit. Good to see you again, my lady, as well. 
MARISHA: Wait, you-- 
MATT: "Pleasure, again." 
TALIESIN: As always. 
MARISHA: Will you save a seat for us in the front for my friends? 
MATT: "That could be done, yes." 
MARISHA: For my compatriots. 
MATT: "Don't worry, I'll see to it." 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Bunnie, my family's never put much stock in entertainment, but if you did want to perform, I'm sure we could give a higher quality addition to your performance than what these people are used to. 
MARISHA: Oh, my goodness. 
TRAVIS: We could really kick things up a notch. 
MARISHA: Would you? Would you really do that? Normally, I have a whole lighting set up and I have glitter and confetti, but I haven't had time. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: We could help out. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Power of sidekicks. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LIAM: Who knows how soon we're going to be back in Luhlvale. Am I saying that right? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Luhlvale. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you've got to let it all-- 
LIAM: So as long as we're here-- 
MARISHA: -- blur together, yeah. 
LIAM: We want to get to know you as best we can, so. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness, oh. 
TRAVIS: Luhlvale. 
LIAM: Put your best fur forward. 
MARISHA: (excited breath) Okay. 
TALIESIN: Let's go check to see if the dressing room hasn't been raided yet. 
MARISHA: Okay, I take them back to meet Lamont. 
MATT: Okay. So the lounge is gorgeous. It's definitely, you get the sense this is a world-renowned, and many of you have heard of it in some space, it's a world-renowned performance venue, burlesque and dance and performance art, even some vaudevillian sketch acts, though generally not as welcomed here in the city of Luhlvale. (laughter) 
MATT: And apparently now, magicians. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: I love magicians, I'm just-- 
MARISHA: Sorry, magicians. 
LIAM: (laughs) It's just a scrolling list. 
MARISHA: Sorry. Yeah, sorry, Dylans. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Sorry, magicians. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: We've had a list going for nine years. 
TALIESIN: Really are big fans of both. But yeah. 
LAURA: Sorry, old people. 
MARISHA: Sorry, Quebec. Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Sorry, magicians named Dylan. 
MATT: Indeed. 
LIAM: I want to go to there. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: But you get the sense that this is definitely an esteemed place, and the clientele, definitely looking amongst your ragtag troop, a few folks that wander through kind give you a bit of a stink eye or at least a sideways glance as you're eventually led to the backrooms where all the performers, who live on site here, they have a number of their side chambers that lead to the backroom area, the behind stage region. You head to Lamont's chamber door, and if you'd like to knock. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I take my acrylics and just-- (fingernails tapping) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: (Lamont) "What do you want?" 
MARISHA: (singsong) Lamont. 
MATT: "Bunnie?! Bunnie is 'at you?" (uneven assisted footsteps) You hear some kind of sound hits the floor hard and as the door opens, you can see this beautiful human elf with long, curly, blonde hair that goes past her shoulders. She has natural beauty that exudes from her, wearing this heavy, comfortable-looking robe that's wrapped around her and has a crutch under one arm and goes, "Hey, doll, it's so good to see you. I wasn't sure when you were coming back." 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! I missed you so much! You are just such a sight for sore eyes, even with your sore foot. 
MATT: "Oh, definitely sore, you got the sore right." 
MARISHA: What is that? 
MATT: "(sighs) I don't know. One of my shoes just, it just broke during one of the rehearsals." 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness gracious. 
MATT: "So I twisted my ankle. The doctor said it's not too bad, but enough to the point I'm probably going to be down for the week." 
MARISHA: What? 
LAURA: That's why you should always wear sensible shoes. 
MATT: "Thank you for the unrequested advice. Appreciate that. These friends of yours?" 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Look, they're new to the scene, all right? Be nice. 
TRAVIS: (gurgling) 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: "Color me surprised. Hmm." 
MARISHA: We call ourselves the Menagerie. 
MATT: "The Menagerie." 
MARISHA: The Menagerie. 
MATT: "Oh, but there's more than three of you." 
MARISHA: Well-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's not that kind of a men-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, I get it. 
MARISHA: That's-- 
MATT: "Oh, misunderstood. Sorry. (laughs) Well, welcome to my doorway, I suppose. Nice to meet you all. You're friends of Bunnie, that means that you're friends of ours, I guess, technically, by the way that we run this place." 
ASHLEY: Pleased to meet you. 
LAURA: Do you remember a man named Dyson? He was a conman. 
MATT: "Yeah, what about him?" 
LAURA: Did he like dark, gooey stuff? 
TALIESIN: (snickers) 
ASHLEY: I guess he's wanting to spread his Seep around. 
TRAVIS: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry. 
TRAVIS: I hope [JENGA] because it's not going to work. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm going to lose it. 
MARISHA: It's not going to work. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Cancel it, cancel everything. 
MATT: Oh no. (laughs) Pull the plug. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Key has been inserted. Lift the lid. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Finger hovers. 
MARISHA: No more Daggerheart, everybody. It's done. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Closed beta. 
MARISHA: (laughing) Closed beta. 
MATT: Close the beta, close it. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Close the beta. Close the beta. (laughter) (laughter continues) 
MATT: "Well, I haven't personally seen it, but if you've seen that happen, go ahead and let Larry know at the front. We'll make sure he never comes back. That's not allowed." 
MARISHA: Lamont, we're just wondering because remember how he used to be so weird and aloof and creepy. 
MATT: "Used to be?" 
MARISHA: Yeah, but has he been around? Because apparently he went up and he cursed a hill and the hill-- How do I explain this, you guys? 
LAURA: Wait, who was guy-- 
MARISHA: What did we see? 
LAURA: -- that we saw that was cut in half? That wasn't him. 
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. 
MARISHA: Well, no, that was the-- 
LIAM: That was Cullen. 
MARISHA: That was Cullen. 
LAURA: Right, right, right, right, right, right. 
MARISHA: But he was the guy, the magical hill man. He made a little illusion. 
MATT: "Well--" 
TRAVIS: [JENGA] 
MATT: "If you're looking for him, if he's not in the audience tonight, he's probably blowing his cash down at the casino or something." 
LAURA: Oh, he might be in town right now? 
MATT: "That's where a lot of lowlifes tend to spend their space." [JENGA] 
ASHLEY: He could be in town? 
MATT: "I mean, I've seen him recently." 
ASHLEY: Oh, really? 
LAURA: How recent? 
MATT: "Like two days ago, he came in here, was creeping around the ladies for a bit like he does. At a distance. Not enough to be able to report him, but enough to make us feel a little uncomfortable." 
LAURA: Oh, he was here while we were fighting. 
TALIESIN: It's both irritating and convenient. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Well-- 
TRAVIS: Ah-- 
MARISHA: Go ahead. 
TRAVIS: (gurgles) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (laughing) Were they wearing identifying clothing? 
MATT: What was that? Can I get that again, Travis? 
TRAVIS: Almost there. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Did you break yourself? That's embarrassing. 
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Any identifying clothing? (laughter) 
MATT: "I mean, I always wondered if he was a fisherman or something. He always wore this like, it's a heavy sort of fisherman's coat, big, big cuffs on the arms, a bit tattered at the bottom, collar folded, bit, I don't know, a bit moth-eaten it looks at times. I don't know." 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Fisherman's coat. 
TALIESIN: Moth-eaten. 
ASHLEY: Anything else you can tell us about him? I mean, I guess you-- 
LAURA: What color is his hair? 
MATT: "To be perfect-- Oh, what's left of it?" 
TRAVIS: Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go. 
MATT: "Like a little salt and pepper. I don't know if he colors it. Try to make a presentation. Be perfectly honest, I keep a distance anyway." 
LAURA: Does he smell? 
MATT: "He's a leerer. Likes to stare." 
MARISHA: Just a little unsettling, you know? 
TRAVIS: It's very impolite. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: It's rude. 
MARISHA: Well, hey, can I borrow one of your costumes? I'm taking your spot tonight. 
MATT: "For real?" 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Well, at least I'm glad it's you and not anyone else." 
MARISHA: I know. 
MATT: "Wouldn't trust it to anyone else." 
MARISHA: I would hate it if it was that bitch Candy. 
MATT: "(sighs)" 
LAURA: Fuck Candy. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: "She's a little misunderstood. She's young, she'll get there in time." 
LAURA: Candy's okay. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. 
MATT: "Did you hear who's performing tonight main stage?" 
MARISHA: I did. Oh my goodness. Why, you don't look pleased. 
MATT: "Why would I be pleased?" 
MARISHA: What's wrong with Mafauna? 
MATT: "It's nothing's wrong with her, she just overshadowed the rest of us, you know? She's been doing this for a while and a lot of other girls have come up and proven themselves and they all just can't seem to get out from under the space she occupies. Even when she's gone for over a year, everyone keeps coming and asking when she's coming back." 
MARISHA: Yeah, that looks bad. 
LAURA: Did you injure your foot before or after she came back? 
MATT: "That was just two nights ago." 
MARISHA: Do you think she got Nancy Kerriganed? (laughter) 
LAURA: Was she loose-- Did she-- 
MARISHA: You got Kerriganed! 
TRAVIS: Look her up, kids. 
LAURA: -- mess up your shoe? 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
MATT: "I don't particularly know." 
LIAM: That's deep Spireloch lore. 
ASHLEY: Do you have your shoe? 
MATT: "I have it, yeah." 
ASHLEY: Can I take a look at it? 
MATT: "Sure. You're adorable, by the way." 
ASHLEY: Thanks. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: My blue cheeks just go pink. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: They are at least saving her performance for the end of the night. No one has to go on after her I assume. 
MATT: "Oh, no--" 
TALIESIN: Big fan, by the way, but yes. 
MATT: "Oh. You're sweet. No, she'll be going on right around midnight, so it's a number of hours before she has to take the stage. Performances don't begin for a few more hours, anyway, so you got the time to relax. Enjoy yourself some drinks except for you, you should be sober on stage." 
MARISHA: Well, you know, just a little something to loosen up the gears. 
MATT: "Mafauna‚Ä¶" 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: "And to be honest, she kind of showed up... She's always been a bit snooty, but like--" 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "-- special kind of 'I've seen the world and I'm better than you' kind of energy." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: "She returned with an accent." 
MARISHA: (gasps) (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I hate it when people do that. It's awful. 
LAURA: (laughs). 
ASHLEY: Wait-- 
TALIESIN: Just the worst. 
MARISHA: Has anyone called her on it or is everyone just-- 
MATT: "No!" 
MARISHA: -- pretending like it's always been there? 
MATT: "She shows up and she's like, (snooty) 'Hello, everyone. I'm Mafauna,' and I'm like, 'Bitch, we know, we've seen you before. We grew up around you--'" 
MARISHA: Hey, she's a trash just like the rest-- 
MATT: "What the fuck is this?" 
MARISHA: -- of us. 
LIAM: So she doesn't speak normal like you used to. 
MARISHA: Yeah, no. Of course not. This is Luhlvale's natural accent. 
MATT: "Right?" 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
LIAM: Really confused. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: So many different kinds. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "It's really a cultural hub. This side of Lochspire, folks from all over come out." 
TALIESIN: It's a port town. 
ASHLEY: Well, let me see your shoe. 
MATT: She takes off. "Oh, the one that's--" 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: "-- that's busted." 
ASHLEY: The one that's broken. 
MATT: She goes and takes it. 
TALIESIN: Pulling a fast one. 
MATT: Yeah, sure enough like-- 
TALIESIN: Any of the it-- 
MATT: It is a tall heel-- 
TALIESIN: -- really. 
MATT: -- but it looks snapped at the base where it is and goes, "This is the one in question." 
ASHLEY: Whoa. Wow. 
LAURA: That's definitely been tampered with. 
ASHLEY: It's definitely that. I was thinking the same thing. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: "You think so?" 
ASHLEY: What are you going to do with this shoe? 
MATT: "Well, I was going to get it repaired, maybe." 
ASHLEY: Oh, you're going to keep it. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I was just thinking-- I could add it to my staff piece to make it a little taller. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Make a presence roll for me. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: I just fucking can't. [JENGA] 
TRAVIS: Adds a broken shoe-- 
LAURA: Would you add it-- 
TRAVIS: -- to your-- 
LAURA: -- to the bottom or the top? 
TRAVIS: -- sorcerer staff. 
ASHLEY: Yes. I don't know (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What am I doing? What am I rolling? What did you say? 
LAURA: Presence. 
ASHLEY: Presence. 
MATT: A presence, please. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay, so that is 23 with Fear. 
MATT: Okay. She takes the shoe looks at-- 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry that was wrong. With Hope. 
MATT: Oh, with Hope? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. She takes the shoe, looks it over. "To be perfectly honest, it's run its course with me. I'll just ask one of our patrons to maybe give me a new set. This is for you just because you're cute." 
ASHLEY: Thank you so much. I'm just going to wrap the ankle strap around the bottom of the cigarillo. 
MATT: (laughs) "Some really unique friends you make in these days, Bunnie. I like it." 
MARISHA: They're really good people. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's really good. Is it, what color is the shoe? Is it yellow? 
MATT: The shoe is a dark amber color with black bottoms to it. And what looks like this beautiful buckle with a pearl at the end. 
LAURA: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: Incredible. What an incredible thing. Thank you so much. 
MARISHA: Can I take a look at it, though? A little closer and see: Does it look like it could have been tampered with? 
TRAVIS: This is the new chair. This is the fucking chair. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm keeping this thing. 
MATT: Yes, you may. You make a knowledge roll for me, if you don't mind. 
ASHLEY: It's going to mean something later. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: For sure. 
MARISHA: Exactly. This is a straight roll. Probably not. Nine with Hope. 
MATT: Nine with Hope. Well, you get a Hope out of it. It looks like it definitely snapped. Looks like it broke. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Looks like it's probably why she hurt her ankle. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: (sighs) 
ASHLEY: There's something deeper here-- 
MATT: It's been a long day. 
ASHLEY: -- we're going to figure it out. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: We're going to figure it out. 
MARISHA: Well you know, who's to say? Maybe she was jealous of the up and comer, Lemon De Cello. 
MATT: "It's possible." 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: "Well, you know. I guess we'll just have to see how you one up her later tonight, right?" 
MARISHA: I mean, I can never follow in your footsteps. I'm just trying to keep up. 
MATT: "Oh. (laughs) You could now, but it'd be at a weird pace." 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: "I'm going to make some tea and relax. It's a pleasure to meet you all." 
LAURA: So nice meeting you. 
ASHLEY: Really nice to meet you, ma'am. 
TALIESIN: Big fan. 
MATT: "You you told me that already." 
TALIESIN: I know. 
MATT: "It's very sweet." 
TALIESIN: Still true. 
MATT: "Thank you. Still grateful." 
MARISHA: I'll be back. I'll be back in a bit to raid your wardrobe. 
MATT: "Of course, of course. No, relax amongst yourselves. A few hours to go before we get started. I'll probably see you in the audience, so bye." 
LAURA: Don't you still have a dressing room here? 
MARISHA: Well, yeah, but I had to pack so much stuff up when I was hitting in the road. 
LAURA: Right, right. 
TRAVIS: This is exciting. It's good to know that Dyson's here. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: If we've got a minute-- Well, I don't know. I know you have to get ready at some point, but if we have a minute there is a casino that he was seen at. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, we can pop over. 
ASHLEY: Do you know what time your curtain call is? 
MARISHA: Well, she said she was-- Mafauna's at midnight, so I imagine I should as long as I'm back by elevens. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Have I noticed any other fungrils in the area, or do they seem-- 
MATT: You haven't seen any within this establishment. You've seen a handful walking the streets to some other places. They're present within the city. In fact, the cultural melting pot of Luhlvale is extensive. There are people from all over Lochspire here, including a number of very unsavory looking types. 
TRAVIS: Mm. 
LAURA: Mm. 
MATT: But yeah, it's a wide array. 
ASHLEY: What time is it? 
MATT: It's just post sunset, so maybe it's like, at this time of year, 7:30. So the show starts at 10-ish. So you have a little bit of time if you want. 
TRAVIS: It's not exactly a hot trail, being it was two days ago, but we should check out the casino and see if we can get eyes on a balding fisherman, coat-wearing Dyson. 
LAURA: (gasps) What if-- Hold on. I'm going to squat down on the ground. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
LAURA: Wait, maybe I should go outside for this. 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's very normal here. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to go outside. As soon as we get outside, I'm going to do it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm going to find dirt. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Even better. 
LAURA: I'm going to squat down, and I'm going to put my fingers down on the ground and I'm going to hum. ‚ô™ (humming) I am looking for a creepy guy ‚ô™ ‚ô™ with salt and pepper balding head and a big coat ‚ô™ ‚ô™ and he stares ‚ô™ I'm going to-- (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm going to do an instinct roll to try to speak with any other fungril in the area that might have eyes on him. 
TRAVIS: Is that a thing? 
MARISHA: Yeah. So cool. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Fungril network. 
TALIESIN: Fungril network. 
MATT: Yeah. So yeah, make an instinct-- 
ASHLEY: Fun girl network. 
MATT: -- roll for me and I'll let you know what you can manage to ascertain. 
ASHLEY: Where my fun girls at? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: This town? 
LAURA: Instinct. 
TALIESIN: Everyone's a fun girl. 
LIAM: 1-900-FUNGRIL. [JENGA] 
LAURA: Instinct, instinct. That's a-- 
MARISHA: Fun girls. 
TALIESIN: Party line. 
LAURA: -- 13, 14, 15 with Hope. 
MATT: 15 with Hope, so you take the Hope on that. As you dig your fingers into the surrounding dirt and you extend your consciousness amongst the microscopic weave of plant and fungal matter that permeates the earth-covered shelves of this rocky, broken gorge. You feel yourself rapidly spreading out, and you tickle the feet of various other fungril that are amongst other business. But even at a quick passing through in this imaginary space, none of them seem to have eyes on where you are. You know what? I'm going to make a roll here. Natural 20, okay. So yeah, you find one fungril that is working, it seems like they're working security for a location here. You all of a sudden come into their consciousness briefly for a moment, like a ghosted visual perspective of the surroundings. You can see there's a card table to the right. As they glance around, acknowledging where you are, sharing this image in your mind into theirs, they give a glance over and point in one direction. You see the faint back, mostly balding head of a man in a strange looking heavy coat with a ruffled collar on top that looks loosely like what was described. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: She sees something. 
LAURA: That was the casino, right? There's a card table. 
MATT: Could be. There was a card table. 
LAURA: (gasps) There's a bouncer at a card table, and he saw him. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Oh, then let's go! That's wonderful. 
ASHLEY: As long as we're back here by elevens? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Is this going to distract you? Do you need to settle yourself for the performance? 
MARISHA: (scoffs) No. If you stay ready, you ain't got to get readies. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Dang. 
TALIESIN: Well put. 
ASHLEY: Whoa, I can't wait. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Is the casino far from where the Lilly Locket Lounge is? 
MATT: It's maybe a six to seven minute walk. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: A brisk walk. 
LAURA: Littler girls call it the ‚ô™ La la la ‚ô™ 
MATT: (laughs) The ‚ô™ Lll ‚ô™ 
ASHLEY: ‚ô™ La la la la ‚ô™ 
TALIESIN: The Luhlvale Lilly Locket Lounge. 
TRAVIS: What's in that drink? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: What's in that drink? 
LAURA: It's tea. 
TRAVIS: What's in there? (laughter) 
LIAM: Shrooms. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Psilocybin. 
ASHLEY: Shroom tea. 
MARISHA: ‚ô™ Trol-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ‚ô™ 
MATT: Following your guidance and heading through the boisterous nightlife of the center of Luhlvale, passing by other mid street jugglers and performers. You make eye contact with some of the other fungril that you had brushed by as they go, and they (discrete wave). One of them reaches over and grabs some sort of rotting plant on a window sill and crushes it and absorbs it. 
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: That's awesome. 
MARISHA: It's a power move. 
MATT: Yep. (laughter) 
LIAM: Never breaks eye contact. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Continuous. You think it has eyes. (laughter) 
MATT: But you lead them a little ways down the main central street and then off to the right, not too far from the Bank of Borneo, which you pass by this large stone column structure that has On the front: The Bank of Borneo. You can see there are folks mingling on the outside as well as the entryway, and individuals going in and coming out. You get the sense for a town that probably has a lot of really expensive entertainment and apparently a casino where there is likely gambling, a bank probably does pretty well here. But across from the Bank of Borneo, you can see this roaring structure. This wide, it looks almost like an arena. It is circular in shape, but it is built like walls with a roof on top that is open other than a cloth dome set across it that flows, so the air itself is-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, cool! 
MATT: It's an open air casino. 
TRAVIS: Sick. 
MATT: As the wind gusts through, you can see parts of the material flapping like the flags in the air. 
LAURA: That's cool, that's cool. 
ASHLEY: I want to go there. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Lit from underneath too, it lights them. So it looks like a golden sea that's slowly flowing with the wind. 
ASHLEY: Come on. That's so cool. 
LAURA: They could paint fish on it and it would look like an ocean. 
MARISHA: Like the ocean. 
ASHLEY: Wow. As we're walking through the streets, I'm just catching flies. (slurps) 
MATT: There are many. 
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Just throwing that out there. 
MATT: Most of them are mosquitoes, but you know, if you get four of them, it's like one fly. 
ASHLEY: Still tasty. 
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) This indeed, you can see the large sign out front: The Backs and Bones Casino. It has this very-- The letters are painted in gold against black so they're very bold, but the font that it's put in is very stark and intense, like: You are here! So while it has this beautiful outer aspect of it, once you step in the door, it is business. There's noise, there's music, there are performers on separate stages that mingle in the middle into some weird, jazz-like mixture. There are a number of card tables, dice tables. It is a bustling space. You also see there are suited figures wearing what you recognize to the fungril that you had contacted in this space, some sort of a guardian suit for those that keep eyes across the interior. There's a lot of them. Even just at a first glance glancing around, you see 10 individuals, various ancestries that are walking around, arms crossed, keeping the peace and holding an ominous presence amongst the rest of the revelry. 
ASHLEY: Hello. 
LIAM: Do we have some time? I've got the itch, baby! 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
LIAM: What games are there to play? 
MATT: Oh, there's all manner. Have you had-- Describe to me if you can, the extensive experience that you believe Xarlo has had with gambling. 
LIAM: Oh, I've had none, but I've heard about it. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LIAM: I'm here to lose money. So I don't understand cards, that's too much, but I do like dice a lot. So I'm going to gravitate towards any table that has dice on it and try to fake that I know what I'm doing and see how fast I can lose my money. 
MATT: Beautiful. As you come to the-- The first table you see with dice, there's four figures there. There's an older looking, an elderly ribbet that is hunched over the edge, the edge of the skin's graying a bit with a big, thick set of spectacles, who currently has a big old mitt filled with dice and looks over, "Oh hi there, sweet one. Are you're coming to join us at the table?" 
LIAM: Greetings, fellow gamblers. It is a night for the [JENGA]. I sit down on my monkey ass. 
MATT: You sit down. 
MARISHA: The Jake? 
LIAM: The J-- 
LIAM: The Jakes. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
ASHLEY: Jakes? [JENGA] 
MATT: You plop down, and-- 
LIAM: It's a gambling term. 
MATT: -- the other figures at the table all look at each other and smile and turn back to you. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: "Of course, please. Happy to have someone of esteemed experience at the table." She throws her lot of dice. You see six dice scatter across the table. Everyone looks in, does a count. 
LIAM: Oh, that's a good one. 
MATT: She goes, "No, that was quite bad, actually." She shuffles some of her coins away and the rest of the folks take from the pot. It is interesting. Everyone's playing for fun. It isn't like it's high stakes, necessarily, but they're definitely going to test you. Go ahead and roll six d6s for me, if you don't mind. 
LIAM: Do I have to put anything on the table? 
MATT: I was about to ask you, how much do you want to put down? 
TRAVIS: Your tail. 
LIAM: I take one of the puppies. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: No! 
MATT and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TALIESIN: Get a little gassy-- 
LAURA: Use my cloak and I scoop up the puppy. 
TALIESIN: -- as you squeeze it. 
TRAVIS: This is what you kept them for. 
LAURA: I hold on to the puppy. 
LIAM: I pull out the second dog, and I place-- All right. 
LAURA: Scoop up the puppy. 
LIAM: I have some gold. Hold onto them for me, will you darling? 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That's a good boy! 
LIAM: So I put half a handful of gold-- 
MATT: Half a handful of gold. 
LIAM: -- on the table. Right. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Do I need dice, right? 
TALIESIN: 6d6. 
TRAVIS: 6d6. 
LIAM: 6d6. 
ASHLEY: (grunting) 
LIAM: I'll take those because you got them ready. 
TALIESIN: Four right there. 
ASHLEY: They're so cute! 
LIAM: Thanks, Half Shell. 
MATT: The key here is everyone is taking turns of rolling six dice. Any doubles they get add together and they roll that many dice again until there's no more doubles. The final number is the winner. 
LIAM: So I'm looking for doubles. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want-- 
LIAM: That's two. 
TRAVIS: -- the highest number possible. 
LIAM: All right. Here we go. 
TRAVIS: Oh damn! What about triples, baby? 
LIAM: Triple twos. 
MATT: Triple twos, all right. So you add those twos together-- 
LIAM: That's-- 
MATT: That's six. 
LIAM: Simian luck, you fuckers. 
MATT: That's six, now roll those three dice once more. 
LIAM: These three that were-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
LIAM: Two threes. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MATT: All right, so that brings it to 12-- 
LIAM: Right. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll those two threes again. 
LIAM: Well, I have to get doubles again? 
MATT: To continue, yeah. 
LIAM: That's fecking impossible. 
TALIESIN: You're doing fine. 
LIAM: It's a five and four. 
MATT: Okay, so 12 is your number. The elderly ribbet at the table rolls. That is one, two, three. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: And three and three. 
LIAM, ASHLEY, and LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: So that's going to be nine. 
LIAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: These five again. 
LAURA: You're going to lose your handful. 
LIAM: It's just half a handful. 
MATT: That is nine plus eight. That is-- 
ASHLEY: 17. 
MATT: That's going to be 17. Roll these two again. 
TRAVIS: Two ones. 
MATT: Two fives again. 
ALL: Oh! 
MATT: You lose your half your handful. (laughs) 
LIAM: So what that tells me is that I need to try again. So I put the other half. 
TRAVIS: Oh no! (laughter) 
LAURA: That was a really fun game, though! 
MARISHA: Did you just make this up? 
MATT: I literally just made it up right now. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: It's really good! 
ASHLEY: I want to play! 
MARISHA: It's really good. 
TALIESIN: I was trying to figure out where that came from! 
LAURA: I want to play it, too! 
MATT: In the chaos of trying to prepare for this session, I built a casino and didn't-- 
TRAVIS: No, no. 
MATT: -- think to add games. I've done that a thousand times in the past, I'm like, "They're not going to gamble, of course, they're going to go for the story!" 
TALIESIN: Of course we're going to gamble! 
MATT: I should know better! 
LIAM: Let's go, grandma. I'm feeling lucky. 
LAURA: Wait, I'm going to do it, too! 
MATT: All right, you go first. 
LIAM: Are you putting some money down? 
ASHLEY: Wait, how much are you putting in? 
LAURA: Just half a handful. 
MATT: Welcome to two and a half hours of us gambling, folks. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Daggerheart! 
MARISHA: We've shown off nothing on these character sheets! 
LIAM: I scoop the puppies back up and I put them in my shirt kiss one on the head. 
LAURA: Wait, I got one in my sleeve already okay, that's right. 
LIAM: Well, I got one out. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
LIAM: All right. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. Let's go. 
LIAM: Ready. What'd I get? What'd I get? 
LAURA: Oh, oh. 
LIAM: Oh. Four, four-- 
LAURA: 12. 
LIAM: Five and five. So that means 18, is that what that is? 
TALIESIN: 18. 
MATT: Correct, and you get to roll those four again. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: 12 on the second. 
LAURA: 12 and four is-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: 16. 
TRAVIS: 14 
LAURA: 12 and four, 16. 
TRAVIS: Oh the 12 and four, yeah. 
MATT: 12 over here-- 
LIAM: I'm at 18, here we go. (groans) I'm out! 
LAURA: Oh, me too. 
LIAM: Oh, wiped out. 
MATT: 12 
LAURA: 16. 
LIAM: 18. 
MATT: 18, you-- 
LIAM: Took all our money. 
MATT: -- win the pot. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LIAM: The pot? 
MATT: Aye. 
LIAM: So I got a half a handful. Here's your half a handful back. 
MATT: You get two handfuls total from the table, including what you put in there, what you put in there, and the two others that had put in the space there. 
LAURA: Whoa! 
LIAM: Forget all the plot hooks, we're staying here for the next three hours. 
TRAVIS: I grab both their collars and pull them away. 
LIAM: Ah! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I want to play a card game! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: More games! 
TRAVIS: I start dragging them. 
MATT: You want to play? 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
TALIESIN: Thank you, Kexon. 
MATT: It's only fair. They got to play a couple rounds. You want to go in? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to do one. 
MATT: All right, all right. Well, how much are you putting on the table? 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
LAURA: It's really fun! 
MATT: That's okay! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to do half a handful! 
MARISHA: -- we lose Oppy! 
MATT: Gonna put a handful down? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, how many are we rolling, six? 
LAURA: Six. 
MATT: Six. Six d6s. 
TALIESIN: I'll take those back, if you're done with them. 
LIAM: 15 minutes later-- 
ASHLEY: Shit! 
LIAM: -- puts the cigarillo down on the table. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: All right, all right. 
LAURA: That's good, that's good. 
ASHLEY: Well, okay. So six, nine. 
MATT: Okay, so hold onto that number. 
ASHLEY: So two threes and three ones. 
LIAM: How is Matt so good at it? 
MATT: So you roll those five. That's 18. 
TALIESIN: House wins. 
MARISHA: House always wins. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! Two six-- 
MATT: Ooh! 18 plus eight, 26. 
LAURA: Whoa. 
ASHLEY: What did I have before? 
LAURA: You had nine. 
ASHLEY: Nine plus four, 13, plus 12. 
LAURA: 25. 
MATT: So that's 25. 
ASHLEY: 25. 
MATT: 26 so far. Roll whatever got double this time. 
LIAM: Let's go, Betabean! 
ASHLEY: Oh oh, oh, oh, oh! Plus an eight. What was I at? 
LAURA: You were at 25. 
ASHLEY: 25 plus eight. 
LAURA: Plus eight. You win! 
ASHLEY: I won. 
MATT: You won this round. 
LAURA: Yay! 
ASHLEY: Oh, I love this game! 
MATT: You get three handfuls. 
ASHLEY: I'm stopping right there. 
LAURA: You got three handfuls of gold?! 
MATT: Yep, three handfuls of gold in that one. The rest of the folks at the table go, (grumbles), and they get up frustrated and walk away. 
ASHLEY: Beginners luck, beginners luck. 
MATT: The old woman goes, "It's been a fine time playing you strangers. I'll see you around. Next time brings some real fucking money to the table." She gets up and wanders off in a huff. 
TRAVIS: Pissed off the boss. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
LAURA: I want to go home and play this all the time. 
ASHLEY: Hot table, hot table. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: That was fun. 
LAURA: Oh, this would have been a really good one. 
ASHLEY: Wow, no wonder people like gambling! 
TRAVIS: I just want to wander away from-- 
LAURA: Right? 
TRAVIS: -- the table and start looking around the casino for anything that resembles-- 
LAURA: Oh right, we forgot! 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, we came here for a job. 
TRAVIS: -- a fisherman's coat or balding, salt and pepper hair. 
TALIESIN: I'm assisting as well. I'm trying to cover-- 
LAURA: I forgot. 
TALIESIN: Wherever your back is I'm-- 
MATT: Okay. So do you want to make an instinct roll? Are you're trying to help him? 
TALIESIN: I'm trying to help, yes. 
MATT: So spend a Hope and you can roll a d6 to add to his roll. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Right. (blows raspberry) 
TRAVIS: (grimaces) Oh, that's not bad. Nine, 10, 11, 12, 13 with Fear. 
TALIESIN: 14 with Fear. 
TRAVIS: Thank you. 
MATT: 14 with Fear. For my GM move, I will take a Fear. All right, so glancing around it takes a minute. You're hearing your friends laugh and cheer and make a scene in their first few minutes into this casino. Aside from setting off your nerves a little bit, it takes a moment for you to find your concentration. The two of you put your heads together and glance around the table. You can see there is one card game on the far off end of the space where there are five figures in intense gambling, speechless card checking and putting money across the table. One of them you see is this small, deflated looking man in his late 50s, maybe, it's hard to tell his age. Thinning hair, sunken jowls. He has this big navy coat that looks a bit tattered at the edges. You see him holding his cards in his hand, his eyes peeking off at the other ones, like he's trying to put on a poker face but he's awful at it and you can see him-- (shaky breathing) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: (laughs) That's how I would play cards. 
MATT: "Fold." 
TALIESIN: I think we found our rotted fish. 
LAURA: Is that him, does it look like him? 
ASHLEY: What was that voice? 
MATT: It looks pretty close to-- 
MARISHA: Would I recognize him? 
MATT: Indeed, you do recognize this as Dyson-Dylan. 
MARISHA: Dylan-Dyson. 
LAURA: Dyson-Dylan 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That's him. 
TALIESIN: The Luhlvale Dysons. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: What do we do, what do we do? What do you do in this situation? Do we go over there? 
LAURA: Do we arrest him? 
ASHLEY: Do we get to kill him? 
MARISHA: You know, I'm not entirely sure. 
LIAM: In the name of the GrymmWardens? 
TRAVIS: Does he know you? 
MARISHA: Yeah, he would know me. You know, maybe I could get his attention, make him think I'm flirting with hims a little bit, and then we could hit him with the hard truths! 
LIAM: Do we want to get him off on his own? 
TALIESIN: Probably want to get him off on his own. 
LIAM: Maybe he'll have to take a pee break or go to the bar. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Is there a little hallway or something that I can slink behind, that we can hide? 
MATT: From where he's sitting, no. His back's to the wall, and he seems like the kind of person that would gamble with his back to the wall. Sorry, Laura. 
LAURA: (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah? You do see there are a few alcoves off the side. There are a couple of water closets set to each end of the room as well as some elements of the outer walls that have alcoves with benches to sit in. You can see people having some drinks and folks are having conversations. Most look like they're deep in business conversation in the shadows off to the side. There is a lot of color and joviality to the space here, but there's also, into the bit of the shadows, that sense of a lot of seedy business being conducted on the outskirts. So there are places to dip off to if you wanted. 
MARISHA: Why don't you all slink over there in front of the loo and I'll bring him over. 
TRAVIS: But we'll spread out. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Then we won't look like such a concentrated group. 
LAURA: Yeah, sure. 
ASHLEY: This area looks empty behind this door that says WC. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Winston Churchill? 
LIAM: I'll stay stationed at the dice table. 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's the loo. Just hang out over there. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Why doesn't it say L? 
LAURA: I'm going to-- Is there an area that I could hide in? 
LIAM: Like a potted plant? 
LAURA: No, just a corner or behind a pillar or something that I could like-- 
MATT: There are some central pillars. The place is well lit, especially in the places of gambling out in the open. So most of the spaces that are shaded would be more on the outer edges of this main casino, unless you're looking for a larger figure to duck behind, or under a table, if you want to somehow try for that. 
LAURA: Hmm, what about in the areas that Bunnie would be bringing him? 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: If she can. 
MATT: You can see there are four main alcoves that have the bench seats and some small side tables where people have cocktails off to the side for conversing. They are all currently occupied. You can see at the edges of each one there are two stationed similar suited bouncers essentially, that keep an eye not too far off looking for any sort of either dangerous activity, any sort of violence, or any sort of cheating in this area of the casino. So they're all fairly busy at the moment. 
LIAM: Is the security big lasses and fellas, or--? 
MATT: Well, you see one squat looking fungril who, as they sit there, they don't look particularly dangerous at first glance. They're thick, almost barrel-like with a cap that comes at an angle. What you do notice is there are multiple eyes all across the cap and you see them twitching and moving around and looking in the vicinity. 
TRAVIS: Sweet. That's awesome. 
MATT: So they have their specialty. You do see, whereas earlier there was the chimpanzee coated simiah, you can see there is one massive, gorilla-looking figure, silverback with this massive long hair that poofs out the collar. Jacket's a little bit too tight and they're like the bouncer of "Roger Rabbit," they're just sitting there in the corner like, (gruff huffing). 
LIAM: Oh, that thick lump is yoked. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: So there is a spectrum of power figures around here. Once again, looking through, there are 30 or more of these bouncers scattered throughout this area, some wandering on the outskirts, outside of the building and coming back in. This is a very well protected space. 
LIAM: So this place is huge if there's 30 bouncers moving. 
MATT: Oh yeah, there's probably close to 140 people in here. There are upper, higher areas, balconies where people are currently eating or dining or conversing business as well. You can climb a ladder if you want to try and get to those, but those also look very busy as well. 
TALIESIN: Do we want to try and get him outside, perhaps? 
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, if anything goes wrong and there's a fight inside, then all those bouncers are going to come piling on top of us. 
LIAM: Right. I wonder if we could lure him outside somehow to get away from the action here. 
MARISHA: Oh, I can lure him outside no problem. But if you guys want to wait outside, wherever we want to wait. 
LIAM: Makes sense to me. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TRAVIS: Or if you wanted a private conversation, if he doesn't want to head all the way outside, you could get him alone in the water closet? I could make sure that no one bothers you. 
TALIESIN: That's a-- 
LAURA: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: There's a lot of people watching everything that down here, and I think you bringing such a clearly despicable person into a water closet is, for some nefarious purpose one way or another, be it violence or otherwise. I mean, look at him. I want to rob him right now. He's just awful. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Damn! Sir Terrapin! 
LIAM: By the way, are you recognized in here? Because your face is at the other place. So people in town know you, right? 
TRAVIS: Are people clocking Bunnie in the casino? 
MARISHA: Guess I'm not that famous. 
MATT: Glancing around, most folks are very focused in either the tables that they're currently running or they're focused in conversation. If you take a minute to look, every now and then you do see a face be like-- There's a recognition, but they can't quite place it. Nobody has quite clocked or is coming up with fan energy yet. 
TRAVIS: The ones out a little bit of money and enjoying their bottomless well drinks. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: You got to remember, you know, I've been on the road for some time, too. It's been a while, people don't remember my beautiful face. 
TRAVIS: Well, make a move. 
ASHLEY: They will again. 
TRAVIS: We'll cover you. 
MARISHA: All right. Water closet? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MARISHA: All right. 
TALIESIN: Give it a roll. 
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to sashay over to him. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: I'm going to, as he's focused, I'm going to do a little-- 
MATT: "(shudders uncomfortably) Oh, oh, hi there. I didn't see. Is that Miss Bunnie?" 
MARISHA: Oh hello, Big D. 
MATT: "Oh goodness. Miss--" 
MARISHA: It's been so long. 
MATT: "Miss Bunnie, what-- H-h-how you doing, Miss Bunnie?" 
MARISHA: What brings you back to Luhlvale? 
MATT: "Well, I-I-I've been here." 
MARISHA: You know, I've been thinking about you so much. 
MATT: The other people around the table that are in the process of finishing their hand of cards all: (scoff and chuckle) Laugh a little bit. "R-Really? 
MARISHA: Yeah, of course. 
MATT: "Why?" 
MARISHA: Here, why don't, um, you know. It's rude to keep a lady waiting. Why don't you meet me in the water closet. I'm going to cast Enrapture on him. 
MATT: Okay, make a spellcast roll. 
TRAVIS: There we go. There we go. 
MATT: Is that what-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Going full Looney Tunes. 
MARISHA: Can I spend a Hope to use an experience? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Which is Weaponizing the Male Gaze. 
MATT: I mean, that is specifically this type of circumstance. 
MATT: So yes, you may. 
ASHLEY: This is the moment. 
TALIESIN: I don't see how this applies to this. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Get it. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, I'm glad I used that. 11, 12, 13, 18 with Hope. 
MATT: 18 with Hope, okay. You take a Hope. So you walk over towards the water closet. 
MARISHA: I just, my magic-- Remember Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy in "Batman and Robin" and she had that compact. 
TRAVIS: We all do. Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Yeah, and she was like, (blows). 
TALIESIN: I do. 
MARISHA: It's like that. You see a little pink dust trail behind me. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: He's like, "Uh, I fold." Puts the cards down and gets up and full-on Pep√© Le Pew, is being dragged across. 
LAURA: Is the bouncer seeing it? Are the bouncers seeing any of this? 
MATT: I mean, they're, this isn't-- 
LAURA: Rare? This isn't bad. 
MATT: Well, it also isn't covert. You know, there's bouncers nearby that watch as they go by. You head over to the water closet. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm a few steps ahead of him, you know, just keep peering over my shoulder as I-- It's a little game of cat and mouse. 
MATT: He follows along. 
ASHLEY: Should we go in the water closet? 
LIAM: Are his feet two inches off the ground? 
MATT: Pretty much, tip toes as he goes. He's trying to-- He looks confused and enraptured and is just, right now he's overtaken with the magic that you've wrestled into his mind and his attentiveness. What are you doing? 
MARISHA: Slip into the water closet. 
MATT: Okay, you open the door, "It's occupied!" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: You open the door-- 
MARISHA: Wait, what? Ah! 
MATT: You see this-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's right. 
MATT: -- grunty looking, panther-like katari who's in there. Covers his lap and goes like, (frantic) "It's occupied!" (laughter) 
MATT: You slam the door and turn around and he's right there in front of you. "What do you need?" 
TRAVIS: There's two of them. 
LIAM: Litter box taken. 
MARISHA: Sorry. (panicked mumbling) Over here. I'm going to go into the other one. 
MATT: Okay, open up. "Um, it's occupied." 
MARISHA: Ah! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Shit. 
MARISHA: Should've thought about this! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Nobody checked. (laughs) 
LAURA: Nobody checked. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, no one checked. 
MARISHA: Uh, um-- 
LAURA: Maybe you can just wait. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Oh god. 
MARISHA: (laughs nervously) Guess I'm just going to have to be patient. (flirtatious laugh) 
MATT: "I know about patience. What, what, what-- Hi." 
MARISHA: Hi, I was just-- (knocking impatiently) 
MATT: "Just a second, come on!" (laughter) 
MARISHA: You know, I just, I've been a little curious, you know. I've been on the road here latelies, and I hear you may have been on the road, too. I want to hear all about your adventures. 
MATT: What does Enrapture do specifically for how long? 
MARISHA: It keeps his focus, his attention on me, narrowing his field of view. 
MATT: You got it. Okay. "I, I don't know what you're talking about. I've been here the whole time." 
MARISHA: Oh, that can't be true. I'm certain-- You know. You just look like such a traveled, worldly gentleman. 
MATT: "I've, I've been here whole time, I haven't been anywhere." You see his eyes getting a little nervous. He's still focused on you, but he's-- 
MARISHA: Oh, you're so silly. 
MATT: "(nervous noises)" 
MARISHA: Little chin scratches. (fist pounding) 
MATT: "We're out of paper, can you give me some--" (laughter) 
MARISHA: Open the door. 
MATT: Make a presence roll for me. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to go get some napkins. 
MARISHA: Yeah, thank you. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's also going to be awesome going in there right afterwards. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: So romantic. 
MARISHA: A presence roll. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Okay, plus three. Okay, so 14 with Fear. 
MATT: 14 with Fear, okay. "Fine, I'll get done!" The door opens up and you see this male goblin comes up pulling his pants up and he looks over you and goes-- 
ASHLEY: Here you go. 
MATT: "Hmph." 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
MATT: Stuffs it in the back and then walks off. (laughter) 
LAURA: Gross. 
TALIESIN: They're cloth napkins. 
MARISHA: I take my hoof and I kick the door open and grab them and yank him into the bathroom. 
MATT: Okay. "(yelps)" Pulled in, the door closes. 
MARISHA: I look over at Kexon to make sure he's, sorry, got my back. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do a very sly walk over once the door's closed and I'll cast Runic Lock on the door. 
MARISHA: Fuck yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: From the Book of Vargas Grimoire. 
MATT: All right. Do you have to make a spellcast roll for that? 
TRAVIS: I don't. 
MATT: Yeah, so. 
TRAVIS: But anybody that I want can open the door, anyone that I don't has to be broken with magic if they spend an hour of time to study it. 
MATT: Got it, cool. 
ASHLEY: Well, she can't go in there alone with him! 
LAURA: Yeah, we should go in-- 
ASHLEY: Someone should go in there, are we goin' there? 
LAURA: We should go in there or we should play some more dice. Which one should we do? 
ASHLEY: Oh, should we go play more dice? She'll be fine. 
MARISHA: Should we help or should we gamble? 
LIAM: She looked like she had it well in hand, I say we go back to the dice table. 
TRAVIS: You can all go in, but yeah, just make your choices. 
LAURA: Okay, I have a question. 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: Are they perfectly sealed or is there a little crack under the door? 
MATT: I mean, you said you closed it behind you and you locked it magically. So I'd say the door is closed pretty solid. There is a small gap under the door. 
LAURA: Can we, you know, get down on the ground and look underneath? 
MATT: You can, yeah. 
TRAVIS: You can go in. 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. 
TRAVIS: Anyone I choose can go in. 
LAURA: Oh, okay. 
TRAVIS: It locks it behind you. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to stand by the door. Put an ear to it, not that I have an ear, but you know, I can hear. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: But I'm going to hear if there's trouble, try and take it in. 
LAURA: Bunnie, do you want any company? 
MARISHA: I imagine all that Sweetpea hears on the other side is me taking Dyson, slamming him up against the door. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MARISHA: I'm going to take out my whip and wrap it around him so that he's pinned. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
MATT: Okay. "(muffled struggling)" 
LIAM: Still going well for him. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh, what's the matter? I thought you were into that kiki shit. 
TALIESIN: Kiki? 
MATT: "Yeah, keep going." 
MARISHA: Kinky. (laughter) 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Kiki shit. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: The realms are bleeding over. 
MARISHA: You know-- (laughter) 
MATT: He seems kind of into it. 
TRAVIS: [JENGA] 
MARISHA: Now, I think we should play a little game of Truth or Dare. 
MATT: "Okay." 
MARISHA: Were you up in The Emerald Sky? 
MATT: His expression drops immediately. "I have to go." 
MARISHA: No, you don't. 
MATT: "I have to go. (nervous bumbling) I'm sorry. I like you, but I have to go." 
MARISHA: I'm not letting go of him. Hypnotic Shimmer. 
MATT: Hypnotic Shimmer. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. Is it a spellcast roll for you? 
MARISHA: Yes, it is. 
MATT: All righty. 
MARISHA: [JENGA] 
TRAVIS: Let's go! 
MARISHA: (grunts) Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 15 with Hope. 
MATT: 15 with Hope. All right. So you take a Hope. His eyes glaze over and they go wide. 
MARISHA: He's stunned, so he can't move. 
MATT: Indeed. 
MARISHA: He can't-- 
MATT: Any sort of resistance has fallen. He's just like-- Just staring at you now, open wide. 
MARISHA: Truth or dare? You're not going to like the dare, so you might as well tell me the truth. (chuckles) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Are you trying to intimidate him then? 
MARISHA: Probably. 
MATT: Go ahead and make a presence roll for me, please. 
LAURA: You can do it! 
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. 
MARISHA: Oh my gosh. 
LIAM: Work that dish. 
MARISHA: Okay. Ooh, that's real good! Okay. So, 19, 20, 21, 22 with Fear, but barely. 
MATT: Got you. Okay, cool. So he goes, "(nervous stutters)." The shimmer begins to wear off a little bit, as you get in his face about it. The stun fades, but he's not fighting your grasp now that you've pushed your presence upon him. He, "I-I-I--" 
MARISHA: Just tell me what you were doing in Emerald Sky. It's not that hard, my guy. 
MATT: "I was just hired to deposit a package. That's all it was. I--" 
MARISHA: Hired to deposit a package. 
MATT: "Look, I--" 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm? 
MATT: "I got, I got a lot of debt, and I got a lot of debt I built up all time, and I had to pay it off, and I was just paid to carry the satchel and bury it in The Emerald Sky. It was enough money to clear the debt and then someone-- I-I-I don't even know who it was!" 
MARISHA: Barry, hang on. I'm just-- 
MATT: The rest of you notice that two of the bouncers are looking towards the door and in the direction of where you're all holding it, and the two of them are like-- 
LAURA: Which bouncers? 
MATT: One of them is the large gorilla-looking figure. 
LIAM: Oh jeez. 
MATT: You can see them glancing off and making eyes over to one of the ones across the way who makes eyes. You can see they glance over to this really well dressed, even partially armored-looking, muscular ribbet that looks over, gives a hand sign. 
LAURA: I'm going to knock on the door. (knocks) Bunnie? 
MARISHA: I'm working here. 
LAURA: The people are coming over here. 
MARISHA: Distract them. Who, who hired you? 
MATT: "(nervous whimpering) He'll kill me if I say." 
MARISHA: No, sweetie. I promise, if you behave, you won't even remember this. You'll have plausible deniabilities. Come on. 
MATT: "It was, it was Croatona. Croatona, they've given me so much money over time. I-I didn't know how to get out of it. They said--" 
MARISHA: Wait, the mafia family? 
MATT: "Yeah." 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. 
MATT: "They said I do this, they wipe the debt clean, and pay me a little more on top of that. I don't know. was just trying to get by. Please don't tell anyone." 
MARISHA: Who specifically-- 
MATT: "They'll kill me." 
MARISHA: -- from the Croatona family? Come on. I'll give you a little kiss if you're a good boy. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: "I'm so conflicted." (laughter) 
MARISHA: Come on. You would never lie to a lady. 
MATT: Do you give him a little kiss? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: On the nose or where? 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cute. That's just demeaning enough. 
MATT: There we go. 
MARISHA: Just a little-- 
MATT: He goes, "Mortimer." 
MARISHA: What? What? 
MATT: "Mortimer." 
MARISHA: Morima? 
MATT: Mortimer. 
MARISHA: Mortimer. 
LAURA: Mortimer. 
TALIESIN: Bunnie, it's time to let the fisherman off the hook. 
MARISHA: Mortimer. Almost. Did he tell you anything else? 
TALIESIN: (impatient sigh) 
MATT: "That's all I know. That's all he told me. That's all I wanted to know. Like you said, plausible deniability. You're so pretty." 
MARISHA: (giggles) I knee him in the junk. 
MATT: "(pained grunts)" 
MARISHA: This is for all the other ladies at the Lilly Locket. Maybe you don't hang around. You make them nervous. 
MATT: "(whimpers pitifully) Understood." 
MARISHA: All right? I'm going to cast Recant on him. I'm going to spend a Hope. 
LIAM: You're unloading on this guy. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: I am. 
ASHLEY: This is cool. 
MARISHA: The target-- Okay, "Recant. Use an action to spend a Hope and make a target roll a reaction roll of 15." 
MATT: You got it. Okay. 
MARISHA: So what is-- So you roll. Okay. 
MATT: I roll for him. Yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh, "Make a target roll a reaction roll." 
MATT: Correct. No. 
MARISHA: Got it. 
MATT: Failed on a 10. 
MARISHA: Okay. He forgets the last minute of this conversation. 
LAURA: Yes! 
LIAM and ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: So he's like, "(winces) (grunts) I think I fell." 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: "Oh. (stammers) It's going to take me a week to find that again. Oh. (fortifying breath)" 
MARISHA: You've been just down in your drink. You shouldn't drink so much. 
MATT: "I don't even--" 
MARISHA: Do you even remember our lovely time together? 
MATT: "What?" 
MARISHA: I shove him out the bathroom. I come out. 
MATT: "(grunts)" 
MARISHA: I mess up my hair a little bit. 
MATT: At this point, you can see three of the bouncers have been approaching the rest of you along with the massive gorilla, simian figure. (intentional walk) 
ASHLEY: I start pee dancing. Finally! 
LAURA: I know. Do you guys know, are there any other bathrooms in the casino? Because these ones are taken. I think somebody's taking a poop. 
MATT: (simiah guard) "That one. That one, that one." 
LAURA: Oh, I didn't-- There are so many more. 
ASHLEY: I didn't know there was another. 
LAURA: There are so many more. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, we didn't know there was another one. 
LAURA: Sorry about that. 
LAURA: Thank you so much. 
LAURA: Excuse me, I'm going to-- Pardon me. 
MATT: You push past and you see he looks by. The door flies open, and you watch as Dyson is shoved out, "(pathetic grunt)" at which point the gorilla claps his shoulder and pulls him in. Looks at you. 
MARISHA: Oh my, you weren't supposed to catch me in this moment of shame. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh. 
MATT: (heavy thud) Puts his arm around Dyson, and begins walking him away from the bathroom. 
ASHLEY: Excuse me! This restroom is out of cloths. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MATT: "Then find another." 
ASHLEY: Well, no, you should really have your establishment stocked up. I think that's why it's taking everybody so long. 
MATT: At which point you see-- (laughter) 
MATT: You see this small, faerie woman (fluttering) flitter up with a handful of cloths and wrapped papers, and is like, (flitting) "So sorry. (hurried panting)" Sets them up inside and loses the door behind. You can hear her stocking up the interior. 
ASHLEY: I thought that was going to distract him. 
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: But now those three bouncers are walking off with Dyson, and you can see some are still making eye contact throughout the room. What are you doing? 
TRAVIS: We good? 
MARISHA: Yeah. Got him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: We should get out of here then, yeah? 
MARISHA: I don't want to share any information here. 
TALIESIN: You got a show to do as well. 
ASHLEY: I feel like they [JENGA] 
TRAVIS: Somebody stand between-- 
LAURA: Maybe. 
TRAVIS: -- Xarlo and the tables, and let's get out of here. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's scram. 
LAURA: Xarlo. 
LIAM: What? 
LAURA: Let's go. 
LIAM: I haven't lost all my money yet. 
LAURA: Stop gambling. 
ASHLEY: Have you made any more or have you lost it all? 
LIAM: No, I don't have anything. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You're missing part of your clothes. 
LIAM: I'm feeling good. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Do you still have your puppies? 
LAURA: The dogs are done. 
LIAM: I still have the dogs. 
MATT: Shoes are gone. 
LIAM: I don't have my pants. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Didn't you say you were going to quit while you were behind? 
LIAM: I said, no one can quit on me behind. Let's go. (laughter) 
MATT: So you all exit the casino? 
TALIESIN: When you quit, we get to see your behind. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
MATT: All right. So you scatter out. Whereabouts are you heading to next? 
MARISHA: All right, once we get out of earshot-- 
LIAM: It's close to 11:00. 
MARISHA: -- I pull everybody aside. Oh my goodness, you guys, that was so exhilarating. 
LAURA: Sounded rough. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: That was very impressive. 
MARISHA: All right, so yeah, I think I got all the information I could out of him. Apparently, he's working for the Cro-- the Croatones. 
LIAM: Croatones. 
TRAVIS: Croatones, Cronotowa? 
ASHLEY: Cromatona? 
MARISHA: Cromatones? 
MATT: Croatona. 
LAURA and TRAVIS: Croatona. 
ASHLEY: All wrong. 
LIAM: What does that mean? 
MARISHA: Croatona. All right. 
LIAM: What's that? 
LAURA: Who are the Croatona? 
MARISHA: So the Croatones, they're this mafia family here in Luhlvale. They actually run the casino. 
TRAVIS: How the fuck do you spell that? 
LAURA: They what? 
MARISHA: They own the casino. 
LAURA: Oh, so that's why they were so interested in him. 
MARISHA: I think so. 
LAURA: They know that he gave his secrets away. 
MARISHA: Yeah, but it's okay. I wiped his memory. So even if they interrogates him, he's not going to know. He's not going to say shit. 
TRAVIS: Being a Loreborne, I have advantage on any rolls that would make me deal with the history, culture, or politics of a prominent person or place. Do I know about the Croatonas? 
MATT: You'd know a little bit about them. 
TALIESIN: Croatowas. 
TRAVIS: Croatowa. 
MATT: You haven't traveled-- 
MARISHA: No, Croatona. 
MATT: -- too much. You know the various factional politics of the city. There's the Camarilla, which is the ruling female alliance of business owners, the Eshter Mining Company, the matron of the lounge that you met earlier, the mayor of the city. They all control the entirety of Luhlvale politically. What you do know is the Croatona family is said to be a business family. Came up in some of the subtler guilds and ended up moving into the city about three, four years ago and has been slowly expanding its influence. But most folks think that they're probably, they probably have their fingers in a lot of unsavory businesses out beyond the city, and definitely trying to build up their base of operations within Luhlvale. 
MARISHA: He said someone named Mortimer paid him because he was swimming in debt. So they paid him off. Said they'd erase his debt if he went to Emerald Sky and planted a package. 
LAURA: Oh, that was the little baggie that was buried? 
MARISHA: Yeah. That's all he knew. He said he didn't know anything else. So, I'm afraid we're going to be getting involved with the mafia. 
TALIESIN: Are we being tailed? 
MATT: Go ahead and make an instinct roll for me if you don't mind. 
LAURA: Hmm, Mortimer. 
TALIESIN: 14 with Fear. 
MATT: 14 with Fear. You glance over your shoulder, and the first thing you see is a group of about four to five figures that are starting to head in your direction from the casino, looking like they're well dressed in a similar familiar coat. The immediate sight of this shocks you, so you take a stress. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: But you see five immediately, one of them being the wide, burly type. 
TALIESIN: We've got a problem. They pegged us. 
ASHLEY: What do we do? 
LAURA: "What do we do?" 
MARISHA: Let's just tell them the truth. 
LAURA: Which is what? 
MARISHA: Very limited truth. That he's been creeping around the Lilly Locket and I had to threaten him, tell him to never come by again. 
TRAVIS: How many of them are there? 
LIAM: Five, it was. 
MATT: You see five, and then you see the other four-- 
MARISHA: Oh jeez. 
MATT: -- that were hiding behind the larger gorilla figure. It looks to be a total of nine of them are all moving. You can see them starting to spread around. Some of them are starting to vanish out of sight around the other side of the building that you're up against, the side alley. 
LIAM: Are we on a side street or are we on the main thoroughfare? 
MATT: You said you got out of earshot. The main road is off the way. You guys are in a small little side neighborhood, with some alleys and stuff nearby. 
LAURA: Are we moving? 
ASHLEY: Should we get-- 
LIAM: Do we even have a chance-- 
TALIESIN: I don't think they're interested in talking. 
LIAM: -- to get out of here? 
TRAVIS: Well, a side street might do us some favors in case it gets nasty. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: With nine of them? 
MARISHA: I mean, we can certainly try. 
LAURA: (nervous laugh) 
ASHLEY: Try what? Fighting them? 
MARISHA: No, talking. Talking to them first. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Let's maybe-- 
LAURA: Go somewhere to hide? 
LIAM: How far off are they, Matt? 
MATT: They're about two blocks off. They're not sprinting towards you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: They're walking with intent, and you can see them starting to fan out and a few are starting to disappear around one of the far side of the building where you are. 
LAURA: We might be able to lose them. 
TALIESIN: I don't remember our way around. Is there-- 
LIAM: I think they're working the neighborhood. 
TALIESIN: Is there a place we can turn sharp and turn sharp again? 
MARISHA: Does it look like they're trying to flank us, Matt? 
MATT: It looks like some of them might be trying to, yeah. 
LAURA: You know your way around the city. Let's move. 
MARISHA: All right. I'll try and see if I can duck down some side streets. So, see if we can lose them. 
MATT: Okay. So for this, I'm going to ask for a leader to be chosen to do a group action roll. 
LAURA: Oh! 
MATT: To try and avoid being seen. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm-- 
LAURA: I'm good at stealth. Wait. Let me see. (rapidly reading character sheet) 
LIAM: I'm not. 
LAURA: Yeah, I can try to make us be better at stealthy stuff. But it can be anybody really that's doing it. 
LIAM: Why don't you? 
TRAVIS: That's finesse, right? 
LIAM: How about you do it? 
LAURA: Well, I can do it. If you roll with Fear, I'll help you. 
MARISHA: Here, I'll tell you where to go and you try and find all the shady spots. 
LAURA: Okay. I'll try to be sneaky. Can I use my hiding advantage? 
MARISHA: You're just a sneaky little mushroom. 
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So you can make yourself the leader if anyone wants to nominate you as the leader of this action. 
TRAVIS: Nominated, seconded. 
MARISHA: Nominated! 
LIAM: Yep. 
MATT: All right. So all other participants in this, which is all of you, I believe in this. 
LIAM: Right. 
MATT: All of you get to make a reaction roll, a finesse reaction roll. So roll the dice. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: It doesn't matter. You don't get a Hope if you roll a Hope on this. This is just to see what number you get for your finesse. 
TRAVIS: (sputters) 
MARISHA: Ooh! Ah damn, that was-- Damn. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Wait, wait. I was thinking of something else. What do you roll? 
TRAVIS: Five. 
MATT: Five. All right. 
TALIESIN: Finesse reaction. 
MARISHA: Finesse. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: 15. 
MATT: 15. 
ASHLEY: 20. 
MATT: 20. Okay. 
LIAM: Does Hope, Fear matter on this one? 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: 19. 
MATT: 19. Okay. 
MARISHA: 24. 
MATT: 24. All right. So that's two minus one penalties, and three, plus one bonuses. So you make the final finesse roll here. 
LAURA: Okay. I can do it with my hide move? 
MATT: Yes, you roll your finesse roll and then if you have advantage because of your ability there. 
LAURA: Why did I think I did, but I don't know if I do. Hold on. "Pay attention with the dangerous area. If you roll with Fear, you can always mark a stress to change it to a Hope." Okay, so I'll do that. Okay, so I roll with a plus-- What'd you say? 
MATT: Plus one. 
LAURA: Plus one plus my finesse? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: Okay. Oh. Oh, that's really good. Okay. That's 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. No, I did that wrong. (chuckles) 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Still good. 22 with Hope. 
MATT: With Hope. Okay, so take a Hope. Utilizing your knowledge of the city and your being a sneaky lil guy, begin to find the parts of the city where most of the street lighter than glowing crystals are sparse. Utilizing that, as well as some of the trees that have been grown here on the various city ledges, you begin to dart into side alleys and behind buildings, and through some uncomfortable bushes to get to the other side of a small park that's been built into a part of it. You begin to see the figures spread out. Some of them are keeping pace, and then some of them begin to splinter off. You then see three following, and then all of a sudden there's just one following, and then eventually, there's none following. You feel fairly confident that you've lost them. 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: That was incredible. 
TALIESIN: Let's hope that they didn't recognize you at the very least, or else they'll know where we're heading eventually. 
MARISHA: Well, you know, it just means it's going to be a full house later on. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
LIAM: Where the fuck are we? 
TALIESIN: Where the fuck are we? 
MARISHA: If we loop around, we can get back to the Lilly Locket. 
MATT: Okay. You went a little off path to even get away from this. And the neighborhood you're in right now, you're not entirely certain you've been here before. It's a little the rundown outskirts of the bottom plate of the three elements of Luhlvale. But it takes you a good 15 minutes or so to eventually get to the main street. With that, you can guide yourself for the direct roll to the Lilly Locket lounge. 
MARISHA: All right. What time is it? 
MATT: It's about an hour and a half, two hours til showtime. 
MARISHA: 'Til my showtime or as the show-- 
MATT: To yours would be about three hours. It starts at 10. 
MARISHA: Oh. Okay. 
MATT: So you have a little bit before you even need to be called backstage. 
LAURA: Sheesh, what are we going to do? 
MARISHA: Gee whiz, I don't know. 
LAURA: Should we learn about Mortimer? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Croatona Mortimer? 
LIAM: So he's part of mafia, right? 
TALIESIN: Mortimer Croatona. 
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe somebody's heard of him. 
MARISHA: Well, yeah. Mortimer? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Would I know of Mortimer? 
MATT: You've heard of the Croatona family. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Go ahead and make-- 
TRAVIS: Croatona. He put a fucking N in it. 
MATT: -- a knowledge check for me, if you don't mind. 
MARISHA: Croatona. Well, I had-- 
LAURA: What-- 
MARISHA: You wrote it down as Croatona, right? 
LIAM: It's Dyson. 
MARISHA: Is it-- 
MATT: Croatona, yeah. 
MARISHA: Tona. 
MATT: Croatona. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Tona. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you're right. 
MATT: T-O-N-A. 
MARISHA: What am I doing? I'm rolling what? 
MATT: A knowledge check to see if you can recall information about-- 
MARISHA: 14 with Fear. 
LAURA: Oh, I could've used my experience points. Gosh, darn it. 
MATT: You do have that. 14 with Fear. 
TRAVIS: Do better. 
LAURA: Do better. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Taking a Fear token there. You feel the night air grow slightly more ominous as you sit here on the outskirts of the lounge itself, trying to recall anything about this. You know of the family, you know its business spreads in some spaces, but you're not entirely well versed in the inner workings of the city's underground mercantile. There probably are people of the Lounge, people you would trust that might know more. But definitely you get the sense you just barely escaped brushing with some possible violence. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Gee, I don't know. I mean, we can try and keep investigatings until the showtime, but we might get into a little bit of fisticuffs. 
ASHLEY: That's all right. 
TALIESIN: I've got the cuffs, huh. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Ready. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: But we've got time, and if the Croatona are at the casino, maybe they have an office or somewhere where they're meeting, something we could listen in on or try and sneak into? 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's a good idea. 
LIAM: Well, hold on a second. I want to have a little conversation with the divines. Give a moment. I'm going to sit on the floor, curl my tail around my bum. Sneaky little mushroom. Hold me two dogs in me lap and I'm going to use one of my prayer dice to up my Hope, which is a little low, to three. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: So that I can spend three Hope and use Divination. Once per long rest, I can spend three Hope to reach out to the forces beyond and ask one question about an event, a person, a place, or situation in the near future. So I'm going to do that, I'm going to say: I'm going to reach out to Ondra beyond the veil and say: Who is this Mortimer fecker? 
MATT: As you close your eyes and release this question, you feel the warm winds of the core of the Emerald Sky blow through you. You feel and sense yourself sitting at the base of these 100-foot tall trees that represent the core of her essence there in the manner of this wood. You feel that breath that she exhales through the land flow through your clothes. In the space, you're given a vision, a vision of a tense looking corpulent toad-like figure, a ribbet larger than any you've encountered in your time. Hunched over what looks to be a somewhat splintered wooden chair in some subterranean space in the process of barking orders to two figures wearing a similar coat as to the ones that followed you. As they get up and leave, you see it reach over and grab this thick cigar and take a giant hit from it, and blow smoke outward before putting it out into the back of another servant, you can see his face down on their knees and they have the (sizzles). Shouts out a couple more orders and chucks it across the room, grabs another cigar and lights it on a nearby brazier. 
LIAM: So he's ribbet kingpin? 
MATT: Seems to be. 
LIAM: All right. (laughter) 
LIAM: So I have a visual on the feller and he was in a cave system underground, a basement? 
MATT: It looked more like a basement than a cave system. 
TRAVIS: Then just to ask, the jacket that Dyson was wearing is not the same kind of coat that the bouncers and stuff have. 
MATT: No, no. 
TRAVIS: Not part of some fisherman. Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. That was just his own secret thing. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 
MATT: All the other ones you see have these dark gray. They look formal, like suit jackets. 
TRAVIS: Like pea coats or something? 
MATT: Kind of. Like heavy pea coats that have the sleeves rolled up to the middle of the forearm and they have almost bolo ties within that hang in the center. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: It's like there's general uniform where you can see who to go to if you have a problem at the casino are the folks that are keeping watch in the area. 
LIAM: I come out of it. Let the group know: I-- I just got a vision from the lady beyond. This Mortimer's a great big ribbet bastard. If I had to guess, he's maybe under the casino because he seemed to be in a basement 
TRAVIS: Under? 
MARISHA: Ah. Well, all of the Crystal City of Sin, it's all built into this cliff face so you know. There's actually a lot of layers to the city. 
LIAM: Was the casino, when we saw, is it against any of that cliff face or is it on its own? 
MATT: From when you approached it, you could see there was a part of the cliff face almost like this pillar. It's built near it, but not against it. 
LIAM: Well, he could be anywhere, but if we're going back into the casino, I'd keep an eye out for, I don't know, keep your eye on the security. See if anybody-- 
LAURA: Goes down. 
LIAM: -- goes down anywhere? 
TALIESIN: I imagine they're going to be looking for us, regardless. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Unless there's sewers in the city? 
LIAM: Are there sewers in the city? 
ASHLEY: No. 
TALIESIN: One would hope. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I imagine, right? You said imagine it's like-- 
MATT: There are sewers built throughout the subterranean rock and there's a drain, a central drain that leads past the ravine. The very base of this gorge, there is a ravine where it goes into and people forget about it. Sure, that won't be a problem a few hundred years down the road. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Nah. 
MARISHA: Well, yeah, you know, I'm following yous guys. Do we want to go back into the casino? Do we want to try and case the joint? 
LAURA: Gosh, we just left. 
TRAVIS: Back in the-- Yeah. It feels like we need to try and get under. 
LIAM: Dangerous. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Or over. 
LAURA: We look for an outside back entrance or something. 
TRAVIS: When we were inside the casino with the open air tarp and everything, were there second or third floor offices? 
LAURA: What? 
TRAVIS: The blinks. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Sweetpea blinks. 
TRAVIS: (pings) 
MARISHA: (laughs) They're so sleepy. 
TRAVIS: Are there any offices or higher tiered areas that look like they might be VIP or ownership or anything like that? 
MATT: You saw a few upper balcony sitting areas that were ladder or stair climb up at the top. They were kept within the exterior wall. It was still in kind of an open air space. So nothing that matches a subterranean descriptive. 
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. Maybe we should try and get underneath the city. 
MARISHA: All right. Yeah. Can we go to that sewer drain or whatever? 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Nearby. 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. There are openings to it. There's the central drain that comes out from the bottom and it is a massive drain. People don't go over there for a reason. 
TRAVIS: Putrid. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (gags) 
MATT: Yeah, you know where there are a number of entrances here. There are some large drains when it rains heavy to where parts of the city, the streets are all guided to make sure that it doesn't flood heavily and it drains down there. There's one that could fit pretty much all of you. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that one. 
ASHLEY: Let's do it. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I mean, they're going to smell us coming. 
MARISHA: I'm going to have to take a shower before the show. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. That's for sure. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Unless it's different kind of show. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can clean this up with some simple-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: -- stuff. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Wet wipes. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Right. 
MARISHA: (accented) Wet wipes. 
TRAVIS: Water-based. 
MATT: All right, so waiting for the right time when no one's really paying attention or guarding for each other. One by one you begin to dive into this street side open grate, water spill off into the subterranean sewage system. (water splashes) You all land into it. 
TALIESIN: Cowabunga. 
MATT: Your first worry is that this is sewage. It looks like it's part of a river runoff. It doesn't have a pleasant smell in there, but it looks like this part of the drainage isn't directly piping in the worst that the city has to offer in these tunnels. 
ASHLEY: It's just water, kind of. (laughter) 
LIAM: Mostly. 
LAURA: Can you still not swim? 
TALIESIN: This feels very derivative. 
TRAVIS: Stop it! (laughs) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: What am I supposed to do with this? 
TRAVIS: Who's down here? 
TALIESIN: God, I hope not. 
TRAVIS: Secret of the universe. 
TALIESIN: I don't want to know the secret of the universe. 
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Had enough of that already. God. 
MARISHA: So drunk Nutella? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can't swim because I'm absolutely heavy. 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is it super dark in here? 
ASHLEY: Look at me. 
MATT: It's near pitch black. 
TRAVIS: I'll use Prestidigitation to create a little light coming off of my pincers, my little. 
MATT: Illuminates this space around here. Not a lot, but a low torch light that at least gives you some atmosphere. You can see the walls themselves are half cylindrical in shape around the edges and most of the water gathers to the bottom and there is that wet central river that's rushing by you can hear as continues by. You get a sense and you saw a little bit of the weather as you were approaching. There was a recent rain. It's been about a day without water, but there's still enough of the gorge and above mountain's runoff that's filling these spaces and keeping the water flowing through. 
LIAM: Are we ankle deep in that water or are we lucky enough to have walkways on the side of it? 
MATT: There are walkways on the side, but when you all came through, many of you landed in that water and  had to adjust yourself. 
LIAM: Oh, river runs poo it. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: How deep is it? 
TALIESIN: That's mice. 
MATT: In the core? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: It's probably about foot? 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: Not terribly deep. 
ASHLEY: I'm okay. Okay, okay. I'm okay, I was just swimming. 
LAURA: So it's up to your chest. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: [JENGA] 
ASHLEY: A little high. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Maybe the sneaky folks move back towards where the casino was and see if we find something? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: All right, so what's the plan? You're trying to maneuver the subterranean sewers in the direction of the casino? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: It's a cracker jack plan. Let me tell you. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Where do we go? 
MARISHA: I don't know. I didn't spend a lot of time in the sewers. 
LAURA: Are we good with directions? Who's good with directions? 
LIAM: That would be-- 
TALIESIN: Instinct, I imagine. 
MATT: You tell me. (laughs) 
MATT: I mean, navigation-- 
TRAVIS: I would recall. 
MATT: -- would be instinct. 
MARISHA: Would be instinct. 
MATT: So it would be a lower DC for anyone who's familiar with the town, but a higher instinct would also help. So it's up to you guys who wants to try and guide this path. 
MARISHA: We all know generally the vicinity. 
MATT: General direction, but even the entryway to here is a number of-- 
ASHLEY: Instinct? 
MATT: -- blocks away. 
TALIESIN: I don't think sneaky is necessarily what we need right now. 
LAURA: Yeah, we don't need to be super stinky-- Sneaky. Yeah, you're pretty-- 
TRAVIS: I'm good. 
LAURA: You got good instincts. 
ASHLEY: I do. I have a really great direction sense. Should I give it a go? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Oppy, come on. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Go ahead and roll-- 
TRAVIS: Just start our lives-- 
MATT: -- instinct for me, Oppy. 
TRAVIS: -- in here, man. 
ASHLEY: All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: It's like when we had to leave town, we had to spend some time in the sewers that one time. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. But we knew exactly where to go. 
LAURA: Exactly. 
ASHLEY: No problem. 
LAURA: Just yeah, go towards the stink. 
ASHLEY: Yep. Good to go. We got-- 15 with Hope. 
LAURA: It's an 11-- 
ASHLEY: 18 total. 
MATT: So 18 with Hope. All right. 
ASHLEY: 18 total with Hope. 
MATT: Go ahead and take the Hope. 
ASHLEY: That was a good roll. 
MATT: Following the flow of water and where it conjoins further than the path. Remembering where you walked from and trying to gauge the directions of the various roads on the above street. You begin to lead the rest of the crew along having to keep away from the water. 
ASHLEY: Follow me. 
MATT: There are meeting flows of water and some of them, especially the converging cross section of the heavier stream in the direction that you were thinking is the right way to go does not smell as good as the one that you just arrived from. 
ASHLEY: I'm just ducking in the water and just putting my eyes out. 
ALL: Ew. 
LAURA: Oppy. 
TALIESIN: The rest of us are just walking on the side. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: So we don't actually have to be in the water at all. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Still staying in. 
MATT: Yeah, respect. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Keep your mouth closed. 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
TALIESIN: They're committing to the bit. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You can't argue with the bit. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh, what's all this-- 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
ASHLEY: -- shit in here. (laughter) 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: What's all this literal shit in here? (laughs) In your face. 
TALIESIN: Bless you. 
LAURA: It's true. Wouldn't there be more shit towards the casino? 
TALIESIN: Never stopping. 
ASHLEY: Probably. 
LAURA: Because there's so many-- 
ASHLEY: Probably. 
LAURA: -- people in there. 
ASHLEY: That's why I know where to go. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Because all the shit's coming from there. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Feeling confident that you're heading in the right direction. 
ASHLEY: I know where we're going. (laughter) 
MATT: You do notice-- Your first worry is going to be a barricade, but what you do see to be an iron grate that blocks off. The tunnel funnels in for a second. There is an iron grate about eight-foot by eight-foot that blocks the path, the rest of the water and sewage flowing in the current. 
ASHLEY: Bingo! 
MATT: The bars are about three inches across from each other on each side. So it's a bit tight for any of you to fit through, unfortunately. 
LAURA: How do we get through? 
TALIESIN: What part of this is bingo? 
ASHLEY: Ah, I'm saying this is where we're supposed to go. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
LIAM: So we just have to get on the other side of that? 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
ASHLEY: Let's see. 
LAURA: Can anybody-- 
TALIESIN: Sure is. 
TRAVIS: I will take a look with my lit up pincers. 
TRAVIS: I will take a look with my lit up pincers. Does there seem to be a mechanism on the other side of this grate, or does it looks like it continues on past here, that this is a barrier? 
MATT: If you want to, you can make a knowledge roll to take a look at the full design of its construction to get a vibe on it. 
TRAVIS: 17 with Hope? 
MATT: 17 with Hope. Take Hope. Glancing at it, it is pretty solidly in place. This is designed to be more or less a half sluice barrier for heavy rains to ensure that I can keep it at bay to a certain point and to catch any sort of either people or anything that falls, and instead of being carried out into the eventual exit, it'll stop them at this point. Unfortunately, you're on the wrong side of the flow. 
ASHLEY: I can get some of us over there. 
LAURA: I can get myself over there. 
ASHLEY: You can? 
TRAVIS: I can, too. 
ASHLEY: Okay, well, I can take the rest of us. 
TRAVIS: You can take the rest? 
LAURA: You can take three other people with you? 
ASHLEY: If I spend three Hope. 
LAURA: Sweet! 
TRAVIS: Let's do it! Flex it out. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TALIESIN: How does this work? 
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know. I've never done it. I'm going to try it, though. I think this shoe on the bottom of my staff is really-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Amazing. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Take inspiration where you can get it. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, so-- 
LIAM: Is this a loud thing you're about to do, or a quiet thing? 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no. It's going to be quiet. 
LIAM: All right. 
ASHLEY: It's going to be quiet. 
LIAM: Incidentally, can I hear anything down here with us over the sound of the trickle of poo water? 
MATT: Sure, make an instinct roll to see if you can take in any surrounding senses. 
LIAM: That is a 16. What is this, instinct? 
MATT: Instinct, yeah. 
LIAM: 18 with Fear. 
MATT: 18 with Fear. Listening over it, you can hear distant scratching sounds up ahead. 
LIAM: Past this grate? 
MATT: Way past this grate. You can hear the occasional slight screech or scratching noise, like a heavy movement, and you almost hear a chittering noise. 
LIAM: That's not the sound of shit water. 
MATT: Just the-- 
ASHLEY: Speak for yourself. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow. 
TALIESIN: Oh no! Oh no! (laughter) 
LIAM: You rock tumbling out of you. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
MATT: As you're listening to this, it gets louder and there's multiple of them. These squeaking screeches and the rushing of water gets louder. 
LAURA: Is it coming toward on that side or this side? 
LIAM: It's up ahead. 
MATT: Right as you point up there, you can see there's a backflow, a small wave of fresh-- (water rushing) 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: -- water rushing past. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
MATT: What looks to be a few dozen rats carried at the front of it that have been swept up by it. (rats squeaking) 
TRAVIS: Oh jeez! 
MATT: As it rushes towards you-- 
LAURA: Oh no, Oppy! 
MATT: -- into your space, what are you doing? 
LAURA: Oppy, get out of the water! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use-- 
ASHLEY: All right. 
TALIESIN: -- my grapple to grab onto the grate and then try and steady myself and grab anybody else we can to the rope. 
MARISHA: (dramatic moan) 
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check for me. What are the rest of you doing? 
LIAM: I'm going to climb up to the top of the grate and hang because I'm a monkey. 
MATT: Which you can do. (climbing) So you get to what you hope to be just above the water level. 
TALIESIN: Strength check. 
TALIESIN: This is-- Okay, strength. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to climb to the top of the grate, too, and just hold on. 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: I don't-- So this is not a shot to use the grappler-- 
LAURA: Can I hang on to you when you fly up? 
TALIESIN: -- it's just holding on with the grappler? 
TRAVIS: (rapid fluttering) 
MATT: Are you holding on with your hand or are you holding on-- 
TALIESIN: Well, the grappler is I can pull things back to it. So I assume it's attached at some level, or I don't know. 
MATT: Sure, if you wanted to be that way. But you're at the grate, so holding onto it would be the same as throwing your grappler four inches and holding onto it. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: So it's right there. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. All right. Just going to go for it. 
MATT: Okay. So you'll-- 
MARISHA: He's holding me. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. Do you want to help with a Hope-- 
TALIESIN: Please. 
MATT: -- or let him roll? 
MARISHA: Yeah. You're so strong, Sir Dant√©! I give you a Hope. 
LIAM: I can see the cover of the romance novel. 
TALIESIN: Thank you for the Hope. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Well, you spend a Hope and then roll a d6 to add to his roll. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: Roll a d6. 
MARISHA: Oh I do it? 
TALIESIN: You roll the d-- 
MARISHA: Or he does it? 
TALIESIN: Traditionally, you roll the d6. 
MATT: You do. 
MARISHA: I do it? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Traditionally? 
TALIESIN: Traditionally. 
MATT: Well, you're helping. It doesn't matter whoever rolls, but it's more fun if you're the one contributing. 
LAURA: Open beta! 
TRAVIS: One. (laughs) 
MARISHA: One. 
TALIESIN: All right. 18 with Fear. 
MARISHA: It's more for the aesthetic. 
MATT: 18 with Fear. Okay. (forceful impact) The blast hits and you hold onto it. The impact of the water, the rats, (successive thuds) you feel them coming through. Some of them hit the grate and probably don't make it at impact. Other ones brush past you as you clutch on, holding Bunnie at your side. What were the rest of you doing? 
LAURA: I was holding onto-- 
TRAVIS: We kicked my wings out and (rapid fluttering) flew up to the top. 
MATT: Okay, there is enough height where you can get above it. The rest of you climbing to the very, very top of the grate. The water does hit you halfway at the bottom. You do still make strength rolls for me-- 
LIAM: Right. 
MATT: -- to see if you can hold onto it for the rush that hits. 
LAURA: Us too, or we're fine? 
MATT: No. You guys managed to get high enough above it. 
LIAM: Can I add Look Ma, No Hands for my climby climb stuff? 
MATT: This is gripping as hard as you can. I would say you probably want your tail and your hands on this to try and hold onto it. 
LIAM: All right, all right. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: So sorry, which roll do we-- 
MATT: Strength, please. 
TRAVIS: Strength. 
LIAM: Strength, okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Oh, that's not bad. 
ASHLEY: That is-- 
MARISHA: So close. 
ASHLEY: -- a 12 for me with Hope. 
MATT: 12 with Hope. So you take a Hope. 
LIAM: 20 with Fear. 
MATT: 20 with Fear. I'll take a Fear on that one. 
LIAM: I have a gameplay question for you, Matthew. 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: So as we fail at roughing people up in toilets and climbing through sewers and we get Fear, you can murder us with that Fear later? 
MATT: I can choose when that happens to either gain a Fear or deal a stress or change circumstances in the story to complicate it. Like you being noticed by the bouncers was a consequence of a Fear roll from a player. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: So some things will succeed, some things will succeed with Fear and it'll just add a complication to it. Some of the things I just keep in the back of my head for later. 
LIAM: So a Fear that I punt to you at the beginning of the game as I fuck up in the casino could lead to something strangling me later in the night? 
MATT: Possibly. 
LIAM: All right. 
TRAVIS: Just like in real life. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Are you going to strangle me in real life? 
MATT: Keep above. You're holding on tight-- 
TALIESIN: If you play your cards right. 
LIAM: Tighter. 
MATT: -- pressing on as it goes. You, Oppy, as it hits, your nightmare as a wave of water far larger than you-- 
LAURA: Oh no! 
LIAM: Poo water. 
MATT: -- pulls you free of the grate. 
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no! 
MATT: You find yourself plunging it into the water-- 
ASHLEY: (gargling) 
MATT: -- and being rushed away. 
LAURA: He can't swim! 
TRAVIS: Can I use-- 
MARISHA: That makes no sense. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to try something crazy. 
ASHLEY: It makes no sense. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Why would you do-- 
TRAVIS: Seeing Oppy move in this huge column of water, can I cast Time Lock on this column of water? 
MARISHA: Oh! Cool. 
TRAVIS: Which is targeting a non-living object within far range. The object stops in time and space exactly for the number-- 
MATT: The water wouldn't be an object, unfortunately. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: It's an element. But if you have an object that you want to try and throw and lock, you can try and do that. 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's interesting. 
LAURA: A piece of poo! 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oppy's staff? 
LAURA: Ah. 
TRAVIS: Well, what do you have? 
MATT: What do you have? 
TRAVIS: I have-- 
MATT: Well, Oppy's staff is also an object. 
MARISHA: Huh? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll do it on Oppy's staff. Yeah, that's great. 
MATT: Okay, so roll for spellcast. 
ASHLEY: (gurgling and spluttering) 
MARISHA: Yeah, but this is cooler. 
TALIESIN: This is cool. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: So roll for spellcast. 
TRAVIS: Oh me! Yes. Yeah, that's right. 
MATT: I believe that's what it says, right? Or does it just happen? 
TRAVIS: "If a creature tries to move it, make a spellcast roll against them to maintain the spell." No, it just happens. 
MATT: Okay, so it just happens. 
TRAVIS: But it's equal to the minutes number of my level, so-- 
MATT: Got it, so you concentrate on Oppy's staff. Oppy's staff holds and you clutch onto it. I'm going to roll for the force of the water to see-- 
TRAVIS: Got it. Okay. 
MATT: -- if it moves the staff here. 
ASHLEY: I can breathe underwater, I just can't swim. 
MATT: So it's against your spellcast roll, right? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: That's nine, 13-- 
MARISHA: I have so many questions. 
TRAVIS: 16. 
ASHLEY: I don't know. 
MATT: 16. I rolled a four. 
LAURA: Oh no, he can't-- I mean, he's okay, but-- 
MATT: So Oppy, as you're floating away, your staff all of a sudden (halts) locks in place and you wrap your arms around with the water rushing by. As you clutch, you feel like it's not shifting. It's all of a sudden a single point in space that cannot be shifted. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: The water eventually, this burst of water calms down and you get the sense that a separate sluice somewhere in the sewer was set to drain probably another basin or some other water source, and that's why there's a sudden burst that came through. But eventually it comes to calm and rests now into a gentle trickle as you are now hanging from the air from your locked in place staff. 
TRAVIS: (clicking and chittering) 
ASHLEY: W-w-what do I do? 
MARISHA: (clapping) 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: (powering down) 
ASHLEY: (sigh of relief) 
MATT: (clattering) 
TRAVIS: (clattering) (splat) 
ASHLEY: Thank you so much. 
LAURA: You guys have so much poo on you. 
MARISHA: (whimpers) 
TRAVIS: We should get to the other side of this grate before another one comes. 
ASHLEY: Let's get to the other side and let's go. All right. 
TRAVIS: Rock it, Oppy. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to spend an additional Hope each to bring them with me. So I'm going to spend three Hope, because you guys are going on your own? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm spending three Hope and I'm going to cast Blink Out. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
ASHLEY: So make spellcast roll. On a success, spend a Hope, which I have an extra. 
LAURA: Yeah, you have-- 
ASHLEY: Oh I got to add another one because I did a thing before all this. I guess I'm going to erase it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. So. Shit. Okay. So, that's all right. 15 with Fear. 
MATT: 15 with Fear. Okay. So the spell does complete, I believe. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Right? Based on the difficulty of it? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Well, yes. 
MATT: Yeah. So you grab the rest of this troop here and clutching your now freshly freed staff, describe to me how the staff alights and how the magic grabs you and your allies to project them through. 
ASHLEY: Yes, so when I get it to work, for some reason, I have to puff up at top of it. And so I (puffs air) and it starts to flame up at the bottom. and it starts to flame up at the bottom. Now the shoe that's on the bottom of it is starting to sparkle as well-- 
LAURA and MARISHA: (awed gasps) 
ASHLEY: -- because it's glittery and it starts to, a little bit of the smoke is billowing out. 
TRAVIS: It's an arcane focus. 
LAURA: From the toe. 
ASHLEY: From the toe. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Out of the toe. I don't even know what this is and how it works. 
LIAM: How do you puff it up? Do you have to take it by the other end and blow into it or do you go (puffs) in the air? 
ASHLEY: I grab it and get on my tippies-- 
LIAM: Right. 
ASHLEY: -- and (soft puffs). 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Just like that. 
LIAM: Well, that clears that up. 
ASHLEY: And it starts to go. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why this is what it is. 
LIAM: (sudden whoosh) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Then we go. 
TRAVIS: [JENGA] (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Because I don't know it's a cigarillo. 
MATT: So-- (laughter) 
MATT: As you ignite and the spell completes, it glows and you watch as this swirl of arcane energy dissipates out from the staff, from the new shoe you've attached to it-- 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MATT: -- and wraps around your friends, and you all (dissipate) are scattered to glitter. You watch as they rocket through the individual holes of this grate, like they're bits of dust in the wind, before-- 
TALIESIN: Weird! 
MATT: -- reforming across the way, of which you (plops) right into a very, very deep part of this cross section part of the sewer. (plunges) Deep underneath. 
LAURA: Oh no. I can't swim! 
MATT: You begin to just panic inside. I'll say-- 
LIAM: We're all under poo water right now? 
MATT: No, just you. The rest of you catch up on the side, but you plunge into it. Go ahead and-- 
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: -- shuffle the cards in your loadout for me if you don't mind. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
LIAM: Oh dear. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Qua? 
ASHLEY: Oh, you're going to take one. 
MATT: I'm going to take one. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Oh! (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh, that's just mean! 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. What if it's a really good one? 
TRAVIS: Put them up, put them up, put them up. 
LIAM: Nah. 
LAURA: Are you going to get it back ever? 
MATT: (laughs) Don't try and pull-- (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: What'd you get? What you take? 
MATT: So, Unleash Chaos-- 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: So Unleash Chaos goes into your vault. 
ASHLEY: Goes under my vault. Okay. 
MATT: You can recall it for a stress cost. 
ASHLEY: Sure. Okay. 
MATT: But momentarily, the panic of this causes you to-- 
LAURA: Cool. 
ASHLEY: (panicked scream) 
MATT: -- forget one of your incantations. You're like, "(panicked gasping) What was that? What was that spell?" So. 
TRAVIS: Wicked. 
ASHLEY: I forgot stuff. I forgot stuff! 
LIAM: That card is not in Daggerheart anymore. 
ASHLEY: It's not in the game. It's gone. 
MARISHA: It's out of beta. 
ASHLEY: It's out of it. 
MARISHA: It's closed. 
TALIESIN: Berenstein. 
MATT: Closed beta. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Berenstein. 
MATT: You do manage to pull yourself out of the water and catch yourself. 
ASHLEY: (exhausted sigh) Sorry, I haven't done that before. That was hard. 
TALIESIN: (sarcastic huff) 
MARISHA: You were magnificent. 
ASHLEY: Thank you so much. 
MARISHA: Ugh. No notes. 
TRAVIS: We'll jump across as well. Arcane Door. Don't you have one to do as well? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You doing all right? 
LAURA: No. 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
LAURA: I'm looking for some shadows. 
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. 
LAURA: Are there shadows? 
ASHLEY: You okay? 
MATT: There are plenty of shadows down here. 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to step into one. 
MATT: Especially if he jumps across. There are nothing but shadow around you. 
LAURA: Oh, it's really creepy. 
MATT and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: 16. I just needed a spellcast roll of 13 for Arcane Door, and I just (teleports). 
MATT: You appear next to your friends across the way. What color does your flashy arrival present? 
TRAVIS: A purple and blues with a finish of pink. 
MARISHA: Ooh. 
MATT: Love it. 
TRAVIS: (stylishly apparates) 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: I'm going to step back into shadow. I'm going to spend a stress and then I'm going to appear behind Sir Dant√©. 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
LAURA: (laughs) Capital. Mm, well done. (laughs nervously) 
TRAVIS: You're humming as you come out of the shadows like a creepy fuck? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Just a sneaky lil mushroom! 
TRAVIS: It was. 
TALIESIN: So sneaky. 
MARISHA: Such a sneaky lil mushroom. 
TALIESIN: Such a sneaky mushroom. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Kexon, if you would-- Well, we'll wait 'til we're-- Is there as a way to un-- 
TRAVIS: Absolutely. 
TALIESIN: When to the end. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yes, Thank you. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Should I do another check to see where we're going? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: You still have a strong idea of where you're going. 
ASHLEY: I know where-- 
MATT: Continue with that roll there. 
ASHLEY: Actually, I got this. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Now I'm worried. 
MATT: But following your direction sense previously, keeping this in mind along with the help of discussing this with Bunnie, you follow the winding maze of sewers. At this point, now the water level far more reduced since whatever gate existed before had been alleviated of the pressure from behind. You come upon where you're pretty sure is near the base of the casino, but where that tunnel would go, it is bricked up. 
LAURA: Oh. (gasps) Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Shoot. 
MARISHA: I think this is it, though. 
LAURA: How do I get through the bricks? 
MARISHA: Yeah, it smells of gin and sadness. 
ASHLEY: Oh, wow. 
LIAM: Who's Jen? 
MARISHA: You'll meet her someday, she's-- 
TRAVIS: I'll look at the wall and again, I'll use Reveal to see anything that is hidden on this wall. 
ASHLEY: Nice. 
MATT: Okay. Roll for that. 
ASHLEY: Can we tap on it? 
LAURA: That's really smart of you. 
ASHLEY: ‚ô™ (jaunty flute tune) ‚ô™ 
TRAVIS: 16. Yeah, 16. 
MATT: 16. With? 
LIAM: Let's go [JENGA] 
TRAVIS: With Hope. 
MATT: With Hope, okay, so you take a Hope. As you're all looking at this wall, you concentrate and let the strands of magic fall from your fingertips and begin to touch across and dance across the tops of these bricks. As they do, you see a section of brick that begins to give a faint silver gossamer sheen to it. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
MATT: A pretty wide set of bricks, about maybe six, seven foot on each side and about seven to eight feet tall. 
TRAVIS: Sir Dant√©, those bricks there seem a little different than the rest. 
TALIESIN: Do they? Hmm. 
LIAM: You're our sewer expert. 
TALIESIN: (exasperated sigh) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Sorry, that took me a minute. 
TALIESIN: Just because I have-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: -- the sword and the hat and the-- Fine. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Do you have any pizza? I'm so hungry. 
TRAVIS: Distinctly different. It's unique. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Very, very unique. 
TRAVIS: 100% 
ASHLEY: V V unique. 
TALIESIN: Bitchin'. And I-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my sword to tap one of the unusual bricks to see what happens. 
MATT: Okay. (tink) It hits a brick. 
TRAVIS: It is brick. 
TALIESIN: Nothing unusual at all? 
MATT: It responds. Your sword bows a little bit the impact. It is hard brick. 
LIAM: Are there any funny stones-- 
LAURA: How many of those were there? 
LIAM: -- that look out of place? 
TALIESIN: I'm going to start tapping. 
TRAVIS: I'm picturing five or six bricks. 
MATT: Make an instinct check. 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: Well, actually, this would be instinct or knowledge, your choice. 
TALIESIN: I'm just tapping. Listening. 
LIAM: I'll make it instinct. So I'm looking for-- 
LAURA: Friend! 
LIAM: -- any funny stones. Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Aw. 
TRAVIS: Yes? 
LIAM: That's a 10 with Fear. 
MATT: 10 with Fear. You're knocking on them. 
TALIESIN: (knuckles tapping) 
MATT: You go over and knock on it for a second, listen, and you hear (deeper taps) and you're like, "Oh, something's knocking back," before (rapidly opening bricks) the bricks swing wide open-- 
LIAM: Oh, for fuck's sake. 
MATT: -- pushing you all back, knocking you back onto your ass. As it swings open, you see a false door in the brick wall that is shoved open. You see backlit this dark shape. It looks like a partially armored dwarf is standing there with a massive club in one hand. Now it's like, "Who goes there?" You see the flickering of light behind and the familiar interior of a basement. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LAURA: We found it. 
MARISHA: We found it. 
MATT: As a voice goes, "Whoever it is, deal with them." 
LIAM: Sorry, Department of Power and Water? 
LAURA: I'm going to hide. I'm hiding. 
MATT: We're going to go to break. (exclaiming) 
TRAVIS: Trust the DWP! 
LIAM: DP! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh shit! We found him. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Mortimer! 
LAURA: ‚ô™ (trumpeting) ‚ô™ 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: All righty. So we'll come back to this here in just a moment. We'll see you folks here in a few minutes. Let's take a break. 
TRAVIS: It's a live break! 
MATT: We'll pick up-- 
MARISHA: Live break! 
LIAM: This isn't live, is it? 
TRAVIS: It's a live break! 
MARISHA: Live break! 
MATT: It's live. We're back to live. 
ASHLEY: We've been live the whole time? 
TRAVIS: We got to go! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: It's a live break! 
MATT: All right, see you guys in a minute.

Part II[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: So, here at the moment that this hidden brick door slams open, the subterranean sewers under the base plate of Luhlvale. You find yourselves suddenly caught off guard. I'm going to pull out a map because here's where we're at! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, no talking, no hiding, no nothing! 
LAURA: ‚ô™ Dun dun dun da dun ‚ô™ 
TRAVIS: Oh god, oh god, oh god! 
ASHLEY: ‚ô™ ("Mission Impossible" theme) ‚ô™ 
TRAVIS: Oh god, oh god. 
LAURA, MARISHA, TRAVIS, and TALIESIN: ‚ô™ ("Mission Impossible" theme) ‚ô™ 
ASHLEY: Oh my god, it's green on the bottom! 
LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Nice! 
LIAM: Oh! 
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
LAURA: That's cool! 
MATT: Here's the doorway that you discovered here. Seeing as how you were both-- 
ASHLEY: Oh boy! 
MATT: -- knocking on the door. 
MARISHA: Wait. Is that Mortimer? 
LIAM: Got to be. 
LAURA: The big one's Mortimer? 
LIAM: Got to be! 
TRAVIS: That's Francis. 
ASHLEY: That is a lot of people in there. 
LAURA: Zoinks! I just didn't-- 
MATT: Both of you got knocked back as the door-- 
TALIESIN: Oh! 
MATT: -- pushes you open. 
TRAVIS: Those minis are dope, y'all! 
MATT: Where are the rest of you, by the way? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just in the middle. Back. Yeah. Because I had used the (magical hum). 
MATT: Right. 
LAURA: I was standing in a corner, I think. 
TALIESIN: We're so cute! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you came out of the shadow. 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Sweetpea and I are maybe over there. 
MATT: Over here? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You are so cute! 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I'd probably be over here, next to Sir Dant√©. Me. 
MATT: Oh, you? 
LIAM: You're so evocative! 
LAURA: I am! 
MATT: Are you in the water? (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe just out. Yeah. 
MATT: You're over here, you said? 
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd be behind Sir Dant√©. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Is she like "The Flying Nun," with a strong gust of wind? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Well, with the Action Tracker down, my Fear at my disposal-- 
TALIESIN: Sally Field. 
MATT: I'm going to begin this by spending-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
LIAM: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Here comes the real flood! (laughs) 
MATT: I'm going to spend one Fear to throw two tokens in the Action Tracker. I'm going to open here, since the failure on that one. Immediately, I'm going to activate these two bodyguards. 
MARISHA: Oh jeez! Oh boy. 
MATT: That go rushing out at the command of this large, swollen ribbet figure. They go darting out into this alley here and beyond to the two of the fallen comrades, and they're both going to be, these two mob bodyguards going to be attacking each of you once. 
LIAM: The [JENGA] is over. 
MATT: They both have heavy war hammers up close that you see beyond the shadow. 
LAURA: (groans) 
TALIESIN: Hmm! 
TRAVIS: War hammers! 
MATT: One that's going to be striking you, Sir Dant√©. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Ooh! That's going to be an 18 to hit. That beat your Evasion? 
TALIESIN: That does beat my Evasion. 
LIAM: Oh geez! 
MATT: All right. So you take-- 
LIAM: Oh jeez! 
MATT: (groans) 
LAURA: Oh jeez! 
MATT: 20 points of physical damage. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to use Arcane Deflection. "Once per long rest, spend a Hope to completely negate any incoming damage from a single attack on you or an ally very close to you." 
MATT: (whooshes) As the war hammer comes down-- (growls) 
MARISHA: Hell yeah! 
MATT: -- to strike, this (whooshes) sudden shield of arcane energy (whooshes) deflects it off of the side of the war hammer. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
MATT: Scrapes off and slams into the side of the brick, causing parts of it to splinter and flake off to the side. Looks back, confused, up at you (growls) and holds still. 
TRAVIS: (taunting chitters) 
MATT: The one that's striking towards you, Xarlo, that's going to be a 13 to hit. 
LIAM: Oh, it hits me! 
MATT: It hits you? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: All right. That war hammer is going to-- 
LIAM: My Evasion's 10. 
MATT: Got you. That'll be 14 points of physical damage. 
LIAM: Oh, for fuck's sake! That hits. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: That's major damage to me! 
MATT: All right. 
LAURA: Can you lower it with your armor? 
LIAM: I could. Hmm. Yeah, so if the total roll-- 
MARISHA and LAURA: Totoro? 
LIAM: (accented) Total roll. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Totoro. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: No, I mean that's way above my major damage threshold. 
TRAVIS: It is, your gap between your minor and major-- 
LIAM: It's huge! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's big. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So two hit points to you, then. All right. 
TRAVIS: I got you. 
MATT: So I've taken my activation. Who wants to jump in? 
MARISHA: Oh, real quick. I'm going to jump in and say: All right, guys. Let's make this a good dress rehearsal! I'm going to Rally. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. 
MARISHA: So yeah. You know what they say about bad dress rehearsals! We're not going to have them! I rally-- (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Is that the saying? 
MARISHA: That's what they say! 
MATT: That is the saying. 
TRAVIS: That's what they say about those equity playoffs. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughter) 
MATT: Welcome to Luhlvale, man! They got them quotes! (laughter) 
MARISHA: Everybody, including myself, gets 1d6 Rally die. 
LAURA: Woo! 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MARISHA: "That you can spend it to add to the result of an action roll, a reaction roll, a damage roll, or clearing stress equal to the rally die result." 
TRAVIS: Yo! 
MARISHA: So basically, however you want use it. You have a d6 on standby. 
MATT: So all of you set aside a d6 that you have at the ready if you need it. 
ASHLEY: Right. 
MATT: All right, so with the rallying shout of the classic Luhlvale rehearsal rallying phrase echoing through these (laughs) sewer halls. 
MARISHA: Now break their legs! 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
MARISHA: Nailed it! 
TALIESIN: -- hop up, 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: -- pull the sword-- 
LIAM: That old rally call. 
TALIESIN: -- do a nice sweep against both of them, trying to cut them both off at the heel. 
MATT: All right. So are you doing a Whirlwind? 
TALIESIN: My rapier has "mark a stress to target an additional target in range." 
MATT: Oh, that's true! All right, so mark that stress. Go ahead and roll for an attack against each of them. 
TALIESIN: All right! Marking that stress. First attack is this plus presence, if I recall. Yes. That's five, six, seven, eight, nine. That's 12 to hit with Hope. 
MATT: 12 to hit with Hope. Just misses. 
ALL: Ooh! 
MATT: So you take a Hope, but you try and swing wide and they pull up their shield and (clangs) deflect it off to the end. 
TALIESIN: Is that both of them or just one? 
MATT: Both of them. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
MATT: Because it's a single roll against both of them. So no go on that one. If you want to follow it up real fast, you can if you'd like. 
TALIESIN: Yes. I think I'm going to-- 
MATT: It's his second token for him taking his followup attack [JENGA]. 
TALIESIN: That's not a successful. Let me see. What am I going to do? (sighs) Actually, I'm going to swing around. I'm going to attempt to... Actually, no, I'm going to hold. Somebody else can go. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: As soon as one of the dwarves raises up their shield to stop Sir Dant√©'s attack, I'm going to throw out my axe like a Frisbee using my Spirit Weapon ability. "When you have a melee weapon equipped, it can fly from your hand to strike an enemy in close range, and return to me." I can mark a stress, which I will, to target an additional target in range with the same attack. 
MATT: Correct, so you can mark a stress and attack them both. 
LIAM: Hit both of them. That axe, my silvered axe. 
TRAVIS: Nice! 
MATT: (swirling whooshes) 
LIAM: Through the air. 
MATT: (clangs) Want to roll for the attack? 
LIAM: Oh, that's a critical! 
MATT: Oh! Nice! 
MARISHA: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby! Double fours! 
LIAM: Double fours. 
MATT: Great! So you get a Hope and clear a stress. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: The stress you just spent. And roll max damage plus the damage die roll of your weapon. 
LIAM: Max damage. Oh boy! It's been a while since I hit something. 
TRAVIS: ‚ô™ It's been a while! ‚ô™ 
LIAM: Max damage. (laughter) 
LIAM: So it's two of those. So that's a da-da- da-da-da-da 2d10. Okay. Okay. 
MATT: So that's 20. Add plus 2d10. 
LIAM: Seven. That's nine. For a critical, I add what now? 
MATT: You add max damage on the weapon dice. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: So 2d10, that'd be 20 plus whatever you roll. 
LIAM: So 29 total. 
MATT: 29 in total! 
LIAM: To both of them? 
MATT: That is severe damage to each of them. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
LIAM: (clangs) 
LAURA: Nice! 
LIAM: Fuck me! (laughter) 
MATT: So (clangs) it hits them both. (grunts) One of them falls to one knee and looks like he's about to vomit on the ground, like caught him in the stomach. The other one tries to deflect it with the war hammer and instead it goes (slices) across his face. He's like, (screams) cut through the nose. 
MARISHA: (gasps) 
MATT: (laughs) (shouts) God! (shouts) 
LIAM: Hey, I'm the healer. 
MATT: (laughs) All righty. So that's your go. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Anybody else want to jump in here? 
ASHLEY: All right. Were you guys going to jump in? 
TRAVIS: Do it! 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: Go, go, go, go, go. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to cast Cinder Grasp, and I also am going to spend a stress so that it hits the additional target as well. And-- 
MATT: Is that within melee? 
ASHLEY: That is... Yes. So can I move? 
LAURA: Scooching up. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to scooch up. 
MATT: You can try and scooch up here, if you want to. To hit them both, you might have to adjust-- 
ASHLEY: Wiggle around? 
MATT: -- in here. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Which can be done. They're all clumped in there. So I'll let you-- 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah, so make the attack roll for Cinder Grasp. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. Hang on. Okay, great! That is... Oh! That's a 12. 
MATT: That's a 12. 
ASHLEY: So, and I know that doesn't-- 
MATT: No, that's a failure. 
ASHLEY: But can I roll my extra-- 
LAURA: Oh, that d6! 
TRAVIS: Reassurance! 
MATT: If you want to-- 
MARISHA: You can add that-- 
TRAVIS: Reassurance. "Once per short rest before an ally attempts an action, roll a (babbles)." You can do it, Oppy! Reroll your die! 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
MATT: So you get to reroll. 
TRAVIS: (gargles) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Shit! Okay, wait! Okay, wait! That's a 10 but can I roll my-- 
MATT: You can. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Do you add anything? 
ASHLEY: Oh damn! 
ASHLEY: Okay, that's great. 
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 
ASHLEY: So this is with Hope. So I take a Hope, and then-- 
LAURA: Do you add anything to it? 
MATT: You add your spell cast modifier. 
ASHLEY: Yes, which is... I'm so sorry. 
LAURA: Instinct or-- 
ASHLEY: Where's my? 
MATT: It's on your subclass. 
ASHLEY: Where's my subclass card? Which is right here. 
LAURA: Instinct. 
ASHLEY: Instinct. Instinct. 
LAURA: Add three! 
ASHLEY: Plus three! Oh, oh, great! Okay, so-- 
LAURA: 18! 
ASHLEY: Thank you! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Look at these friends! 
ASHLEY: A d20! 
MATT: It's a team effort here! The two family members. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So-- 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Great. That is a success. 
ASHLEY: Oh. How do I not have a... Oh, they're right here. Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: So that will be... Oh! 
LAURA: (groans) 
ASHLEY: I rolled a 20 and I rolled a one! So they each take one point of damage. "Dealing 1d20 magic damage and temporarily catching them on fire." So anytime they try to act, they take an additional 2d6 magic damage if they're still on fire at the end their action. 
MATT: Currently in flames, but they both take, how much magic damage, you said? 
ASHLEY: One. 
MATT: One? All righty. 
ASHLEY: Not to brag! 
TRAVIS: They're just on flames in front of the door? 
MATT: Now, mind you, their minor is one so they both still take one hit point of damage. They're both looking pretty wrecked. 
ASHLEY: Magic damage. 
MATT: They're on flames, going (screams) "Are you sure?" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness! 
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm putting this away. 
MATT: That was with Hope you said, right? 
ASHLEY: That was with Hope. 
MATT: All right. So who else wants to get in here? 
LAURA: I said I hid as soon as the door opened. Did that count? 
MATT: As soon as the door opened, I'll say if you want to roll a hide that was outside of that as your prep. We can do that, and then we can go ahead and take your action, if you want to. 
LAURA: Okay, I don't have to roll, I just have to mark a stress. Oh wait. No, I do. Yeah, and then any rolls against me are at disadvantage. 
MATT: Yeah, there you go. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah, you (whooshes) off to the side. 
LAURA: Okay. In that case, if I'm hidden, targets can't see me, even if they move into line of sight. 
MATT: Yep, so (whoosh) hide in the shadows as the door creaks open. All this happens in front of you and you're just-- 
LAURA: But I had also said, I don't know if it matters, I had said I was standing in the corner. 
MATT: Oh yeah! Okay, I misunderstood. So yeah, you're right over there at the side, watching them both in flames, going (screams) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: (wails) I'm going to hit him. 
MATT: The one that's closest to you? 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MATT: Go for it. All right, roll the attack on that. 
LAURA: Okay, so I roll. Add a d6 to my damage roll. I have an advantage on an attack. Okay, so that means I roll and I add a d6. 
MATT: Add a d6, yep. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
LAURA: Woo! Critical! 
MATT: Well, there you go! (cheering) 
MATT: Dang! All right! 
LAURA: Two 11s, so that means I get a Hope and I lose a stress? 
MATT: You get a Hope and you clear a stress, yep. 
LAURA: Yeah! 
MATT: That's an automatic success. 
LAURA: Sweet! 
MATT: For a damaging attack, you do max damage and then add the dice on top of it. 
LAURA: Okay. So 23 is max damage? So 23 is max damage? 
MATT: 23 is the max damage. 
LAURA: Is max damage, and then I add what on top of it? 
MATT: Add a dice roll. 
LAURA: Oh, and then I would also add my d6. 
MATT: For Sneak Attack, yeah. 
LAURA: Oh wait. I have to spend a Hope before the attack roll. So I didn't do that. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
LAURA: So that's fine. 
MATT: Well, you get it automatically and you can spend more to do it. 
LAURA: A six! 
MATT: A six? All righty! 
LAURA: So 29 points of damage! 
MATT: 29 points of damage. 
MARISHA: Oh! That's awesome! 
TRAVIS: Fuck. 
MATT: All right. So this guy here's all in flames. He goes (screams) turns to you. 
LAURA: (screams) (clangs) (laughter) 
MATT: Well, he stopped screaming, so that's good. 
LAURA: Oh, we killed him. 
TRAVIS: First kill. 
ASHLEY: Nice! 
MATT: He's now on the ground, (crackling whooshes) smoldering. 
TRAVIS: He had some welcome pamphlets that fell out. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
LAURA: Bunnie, are these bad guys? 
TALIESIN: "Take care of him," could have meant anything, really, the more you think about it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Was this an underground gambling club and we just went ham for no reason? 
LAURA: Oh, we're so fucked! You're not going to be able to come back to the city. 
MARISHA: No, I think these are the baddies! 
TALIESIN: It could have been a spa. "Take care of them." 
MARISHA: This could have a spa! Okay, so wait. There's still a dude right in front of us? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yep. 
MARISHA: Oh my gosh! I'll move up and I'll do a rapier attack. 
MATT: Okay, so you're going to shift through your friend. 
MARISHA: Yeah, as a fawn, I can do a leap. So I *parkour** off of the wall and then like-- 
MATT: Boof! 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: Go for it. 
MARISHA: Do a little deer leap. 
MATT: Landing Strike. Come for it. 
MARISHA: Then, I'm going to come down with my bladed fan. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah! 
MARISHA: What is this? Presence. So plus three. (babbles) Ooh! That is so bad! 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
LIAM: It's pretty bad. 
MARISHA: That's real bad. So that would be seven with Fear. 
MATT: Seven with Fear. 
MARISHA: It's not even worth adding my Rally die. 
MATT: All righty. You go to strike him. Right as he begins to dart backwards into the room, (screams) trying to put the flames out, you go and swing wide with your rapier and strike it into the stone where he was standing, and your blade gets stuck there for a second. 
MARISHA: (grunts) 
TALIESIN: Before he moves, I'm going to use an attack of opportunity, if that's all right. 
MATT: Well, first-- 
TALIESIN: First. Yeah, sorry. 
MATT: Because she failed, it's now come to the GM move. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: So the attack of opportunity-- 
TALIESIN: It was, "An adversary attempts to leave your melee range." 
MATT: Okay. Yeah, cool. So we'll get into that here when it comes in at this point. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: So I'm going to go ahead and-- 
TRAVIS: You don't want to do that. You don't do that! 
MATT: I'm going to spend these four action tokens-- 
TALIESIN: Four! 
MATT: -- to activate these over here. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: They're going to dart over this way. 
TALIESIN: I don't like that. 
LIAM: Where's he going? 
MATT: One's going to go-- 
ASHLEY: What are they going over there for? 
MATT: "Go away! Come on, let's get over to a safer place!" And pulls off into this area. You don't know where they are. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh, look at him. 
TRAVIS: ‚ô™ Take me to a safer place ‚ô™ 
MATT: This one's got-- "Brother, I'm coming!" This other smaller ribbet darts over, frog leaps off to this side. 
ASHLEY: Brother, I'm coming? 
LAURA: They're all family! 
MATT: This one's going to try and run out to join them. 
ASHLEY: Takes 2d6 damage. Doing an action? 
MATT: Well, as far as activation, his action is to put out the flame so he doesn't do any attacks, but he's going to move as part of that. Putting him aside there, you do get your opportunity attack against him. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so it's an agility reaction. 
MATT: He's like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh!" Pounding out the flames, the war hammer inside of his belt as he goes to turn to run. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: "Oh, thank god! The flames are out." 
MARISHA: You still have your Rally dice. 
TALIESIN: 14 with Fear? 
MATT: 14 with Fear does hit. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Just barely. 
ASHLEY: Lot of Fear. Lot of Fear. 
TALIESIN: So I'm going to do primary weapon damage right now. I'm not going to do anything fancy. 
TRAVIS: Why not? 
TALIESIN: Because hopefully, I'm going to try and end it. 
MARISHA: End it. 
LIAM: I like turtles. 
TALIESIN: 10? 10 points of damage. 
MATT: (whooshes) He goes down on the ground. He just put the flames out and is like, "Oh, thank god! (gasps)" (laughter) 
MATT: It's like two steps and then hits the ground. 
TRAVIS: (low honking moan) 
MATT: You can barely see across the way, the other smaller female ribbet clutching this weird scepter at the side, hiding off the edge. As you finish your strike, as they dart off to the side, she's going to activate. She's going to spend Stay Back. I'm going to spend a Fear. She goes, "Stay back, you all!" You watch as she pulls her scepter out and points it, this weird globule of what looks like a thick water appears in this space here, before splashing. 
MARISHA: Ooh! 
MATT: This weird glue-like, substance just (splashing) scatters in that area. 
ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: She has to make-- 
LAURA: It's The Seep! 
MATT: She has to make a roll on all five of you right there. 
MARISHA: No! 
MATT: That'll be-- Oh, that's not good. That's a 10. 
TRAVIS: But I'm clear in the back? 
MATT: You're clear. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: So it's a 10. Who in this group does it hit? 
MARISHA: My Evasion is a 10. 
MATT: Is a 10, so that does get you. 
LAURA: Oh, my Evasion is 13! 
MARISHA: It does? 
MATT: It misses you. 
TALIESIN: 13. 
MATT: Misses you. 
ASHLEY: 11? 
MATT: Misses you. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Xarlo, what's your-- 
LIAM: It's 10. 
MATT: 10, so both of you become restrained. Ah, here it goes. So that's Xarlo. 
LIAM: In the glue? 
MATT: Yeah, the glue (splatter) holds you to the ground. You're both unable to move at the moment as you're bolted to the ground. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: You are currently restrained until you spend two Hope to break free. 
MARISHA: (gasps) Icky! 
LIAM: Two Hope? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Two Hope. 
MATT: That's going to finish my activation on that. Who wants to go? 
TRAVIS: I will use Arcane Door to bamf through everybody and get into the room. 
MARISHA: I can give you some. Do you need some? 
TRAVIS: Gosh, I gained a Hope because I rolled a nine again because of Strange Patterns. That's fucking awesome! 
MATT: Yep. Wizards, man. 
TRAVIS: That's an 11 plus. It's 14, which beats the spellcast roll of 13. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: And I spend a Hope to disappear where I was, so I gained one and I spent one. 
MATT: Is that with Hope or Fear? 
TRAVIS: That is with Hope. 
MATT: Okay, so you gained Hope from that as well. 
TRAVIS: I gain it back! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I gained one, I spent one, I gained it back! 
MATT: That's how it works. It's a fluid resource, man. 
TRAVIS: I'll-- 
MATT: Where you want to land? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, right on that platform. 
MATT: Right there? 
TRAVIS: Shoomp! 
MATT: Boof! 
TRAVIS: Can I see anyone else in the room? 
MATT: Indeed. You see the massive one right there, you see one bodyguard off that end, and you see another bodyguard that's rushing in from this room that has joined his side. 
TRAVIS: Does it look like they are trying to escape or that they are just taking cover and are looking at me aggressively? 
MATT: At a quick glance, they're looking at you pretty aggressively. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. Cool, fun, awesome, yeah. Hey, there's a lot of people in here! 
LAURA: I saw him bamf out and I'm going to do the same. 
MATT: Action token for that. 
LAURA: I'm going to peek around and I'm going to step into a shadow and I'm going to bamf all the way across into the corner on the opposite side, yeah. 
MATT: Over here? All righty. (whoosh) You appear, you do not think they've seen you as they're all focused currently on your friend Kexon over there. 
TRAVIS: (snarls) 
MATT: You want to follow that up with something? 
LAURA: Oh, I mark a stress to do that. No-- (indecisive noises) They're going to see me if I do anything, right? 
TRAVIS: I would follow it up with something. 
LAURA: Okay. Is there anybody, can I look around? Is there anybody behind big old ribbet? 
MATT: Currently, at a glance in here, you don't see anybody. Do you want to take a moment to really inspect the room while you're hiding? 
LAURA: I'm going to look for anybody that could see me if I go behind him. 
MATT: Okay, so make an instinct roll for me. 
TRAVIS: Just for us, we've got to try and talk to Mortimer, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. (laughs) Before we mow them all down. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: 13 with Hope. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Or get mowed down. 
MATT: 13 with Hope, okay. So you gain a Hope. Looking through, there is some good light in that area. The only one that was behind that you can tell or hear or perceive was the other bodyguard that rushed in from the other room. There is nobody currently behind in that walkway. 
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to step back into the shadow and I'm going to pop out in shadow under that pillar behind him. 
MATT: Over here? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. So you're going to dart over here? 
LAURA: Yeah, I feel like I've done a lot, at this point. 
MATT: That's two quick stress and a roll. So you've set yourself up at that point. All right, we can come back to you if you want to, but who wants to jump in here? 
MARISHA: I'm going to turn over to, what the fuck is your name? To Xarlo. (laughter) 
MATT: "Excuse me, what the fuck is your name?" 
MARISHA: I know, "What the fuck?" I'm going to go: ‚ô™ Shoo doop, shoe glue. Boo! ‚ô™ Then I'm going to do Inspirational Words and you gain a Hope. 
LIAM: I gain a Hope? 
MARISHA: Yeah, and then-- 
TRAVIS: You take damage. 
MARISHA: I will take the two and that goes on your Action Tracker, apparently. I don't fully understand what that means, but you do. 
MATT: So when you use it, it goes on my Action Tracker, which I can expend. I add one over here for you. 
MARISHA: Oh, okay. 
TRAVIS: Keep an amber to yourself. 
MARISHA: Then I'll spend two Hope to get out of this glue. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Can I follow that up by using two Hope, one that you just gave me, to pull my furry bottom up out of the glue? 
MATT: Yes, you may. 
LIAM: Then I'm going to grab Bunnie by the forearms and say: Turnabout's fair play. I close my eyes and a surge of divine energy charges up your arms as I use my four I rolled on a prayer die to give you four Hope. 
MARISHA: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Whoa. 
MATT: Slick. All right, four Hope on you, Bunnie. 
TRAVIS: Just has to be a shadow big enough. [JENGA] 
MARISHA: Cool. 
LIAM: Now I skitter in. 
MATT: You skitter in? All right. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- 
MATT: Up there is about as far as you can get. 
TALIESIN: -- run in and take cover right behind the wall just in case. 
MATT: Right here? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, back against the wall waiting for something to happen. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: I am going to blink out. (whoosh) Show, sorry, come back in right behind Kexon on his left. 
MATT: Over here? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: All right, so roll to blink out. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Ooh, yes. Okay, so that's a 16 with Hope. 
MATT: 16 with Hope, you take a Hope and (whoosh) appear right next to him. (poof) 
LIAM: These minis are so fun. 
LAURA: Yeah, they are. 
MARISHA: I know. 
LAURA: They're so colorful. 
MARISHA: They're colorful. They're so bright. 
ASHLEY: And... Is that all I can do or can I do another thing? 
MATT: No, you can do something. 
ASHLEY: I can keep going? Okay. Then I am going to use my staff to shoot out some magical smoke to the bodyguard that is to the left of Mortimer. 
MATT: Left of Mortimer there? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Okay, go for it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: What are you doing with this one, this is? 
ASHLEY: I'm using my staff. 
MATT: Oh, you're using your staff to attack him? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: Roll for the attack. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Action tracker for that. 
TALIESIN: No. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what am I at? 
MATT: It should say, yeah, on the staff there. 
TRAVIS: (like Pango) Everyone's lost but me. 
MATT: The attribute you add to it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Which I think it's instinct, it says. 
ASHLEY: It is, but is it just-- Am I-- I'm just, okay and then adding that. Oh dang it, that's pretty low. 
MARISHA: I like the card. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
ASHLEY: It is with Hope, but-- 
LAURA: Can you add anything? 
ASHLEY: 10. 
MATT: 10, unfortunately, does not succeed. 
ASHLEY: Dang it, all right. 
MATT: You (whoosh) let loose with your staff and it careens off and hits one of the sides of the entry chamber, (crackles) sparking off and disseminating. You gain a Hope from it. That does bring it back to me, though, for the failure, though. I'm going to, first, I'm going to have Mortimer. 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
MATT: He's going to-- I'm going to spend a Fear and activate him. 
LAURA: Ugh. 
MATT: To use Watch 'Em Fall. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: He lumbers forward (stomps) and is going to you see-- 
TRAVIS: Hello? 
MATT: What you didn't notice off the side of his body is this cane that he holds that he (swoosh) unsheathes this long cane blade and (swoosh) does a double strike that arcs out and attacks everything within a very close range. 
TRAVIS: Oh crap. 
MATT: Which from standing right there, would be all four of you right there. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh. 
MATT: (whoosh) So for that, it's going to be, okay, that's going to be a 13 to hit. 
LIAM and TALIESIN: Oh. 
TALIESIN: So can I use I See It Coming here since "when you are targeted by an attack coming from beyond melee range, mark a stress to roll a d4 and increase your evasion against the attack by its value?" 
MATT: It is beyond melee range for you, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right. 
MATT: Because he gets to do this to everything in very close, which you all are. 
TALIESIN: That's what I needed a d4 for. I knew there was something. Where are my d4s? There we are. So yeah, 19 is my evasion. 
MATT: Yeah, you totally dodge that one. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
MATT: Woof. Out of the way. 
ASHLEY: Hits. 
MATT: That hits you? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, for anybody that it hits-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: That's going to be d12-- 18 points of physical damage. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: (slices) Just slices through you all with a quick snicker-snack. 
LAURA: Snicker-snack. 
TRAVIS: Snicker-snack. (laughs) 
MATT: Bringing in my "Jabberwocky" here. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Humdinger. 
TRAVIS: You said 18 points of damage? 
MATT: 18 points of physical damage, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Clearing those markers. So now I can either take that as hit points hurt or I can mark off armor slots, correct? 
MATT: You can take off armor slots to reduce it by your armor score. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm going to take off one armor slot and reduce it from severe down into major. 
LIAM: So what was that roll then, Matthew? 
MATT: 18. 
LIAM: 18. 
LAURA: I have a question. 
MATT: Mm-hmm? 
LAURA: Is Mortimer considered about our size or is he bigger? 
MATT: He's a little bigger. 
LAURA: Than our size? 
MATT: He's a little bigger. 
TRAVIS: Take two hit points, oof (warbling gibberish). 
MARISHA: I'm going to skitter around just to where I can see Mortimer (soft skitters), and I'm going to project, throw my voice a little bit to where it's a soft whisper right in his ear and I'm going to be like: (whispers) Okay, thank you for joining me on Bunnie's ASMR. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Let me just brush your hair back. Does that sound nice? [nails clicking on mug] 
LIAM: I've seen her YouTube channel, it's great. 
MARISHA: (whispers) Yeah. 
TRAVIS: It's all about the ASMR. 
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Slumber on Mortimer. Try and put him to sleep. 
MATT: Okay. Please read out what the Slumber card entails. 
MARISHA: "Make a spellcast roll against a very close target." Is he close? 
MATT: Very close, you'd have to move about there. Then you'd be very close, yeah. 
MARISHA: (whispers) As I'm just whispering. "On a success, they fall into a deep sleep until they take damage or the GM spends a Fear to awaken them." 
MATT: Okay. So roll to see if you target him. 
MARISHA: I can add, I can spend this after I roll my die, my Rally die, if I need to? 
MATT: Unless it says otherwise. 
MARISHA: "Anyone with a Rally die can spend it to a roll, adding the result to an action roll." Okay, so let me see how this is. Ooh, it was almost a crit. So okay, hang on. That's going to put me, my brain, at a 14, I am going to add my Rally die. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MARISHA: That is a six. So that is going to put me at 20 total. 
MATT: That succeeds. 
TRAVIS: Yo, that Rally die's clutch. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So with that, Mortimer, who is holding the cane blade in his hand, you can see now that you're close behind him, there is a chain necklace that hangs around his neck with this vibrant, deep, deep violet gem that hangs there and as he falls asleep in front of you, it dangles there in front. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
MARISHA: (whispers) Thank you so much. We got a six-month subscriber. 
MATT: That was with Fear? 
MARISHA: Thank you for your sub. Yes, that was with Fear. 
MATT: Okay, great. So at that point-- 
LIAM: That was asleep until someone does damage, correct? 
MARISHA: Or he has to spend Fear to awaken him. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: So yes, he is asleep until someone hits him, unless someone can do something else while he's asleep. 
LAURA: Can I-- 
TALIESIN: Get the fucking-- Get the necklace? 
LAURA: Yeah, can I use? 
MATT: Well, I get to go first because she rolled with Fear. 
LAURA: Sorry. 
MATT: It's okay. I'm going to spend two of these to activate-- 
TRAVIS: Marisha! 
MATT: -- two of these figures. 
MARISHA: (laughs) (nervous noises) 
MATT: The other ribbet, the sister figure to Mortimer that you saw dart past darts out of the way and is going to use the scepter to strike over in your direction for, oh, it's going to be 13 to hit. I rolled 13s back-to-back. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that definitely hits. 
MATT: Okay, so you take 11 points of magic damage from her. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: And (whoosh) flings it off to the side and this sparkling orb of energy (sizzles) bank-shots around Mortimer and hits you in the shoulder and with that, one of these other bodyguards is going to move in and close this gap. 
LAURA: How many bodyguards are there? 
MATT: There's just two you see out. Two: The other ribbet and then Mortimer himself. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to burn two more armor slots so that it doesn't cause any damage. 
MATT: Great, yeah, negate that damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: All right. That's my player's turn. 
LIAM: I'm going to climb up Mortimer. 
MATT: Climb up Mortimer? All right. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: He's sleeping. 
MATT: (skitters) 
LIAM: Right? 
MATT: Up on top, yeah. 
LIAM: Try to lift that necklace off without disturbing him from his slumber. 
MATT: All right, make a, make this a finesse roll. 
LIAM: Finesse roll? 
MARISHA: Yes. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. 
ASHLEY: Can I assist by using an experience? 
LIAM: I do. 
MATT: You can. Well, you can assist him by-- 
ASHLEY: Giving him some Hope? 
MATT: By spending a Hope and rolling a d6 to add to his. If you want to do it yourself, you can use an experience to apply to that. 
LIAM: Okay, that's pretty good. With the rally die, that's an 18 with Fear. 
MATT: 18 with Fear, are you helping? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm helping. 
MATT: Okay, so spend a Hope-- 
LAURA: So add a d6? 
MATT: -- and you get to roll a d6 to add to that. 
LIAM: Another d6? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: All right. That's another three. So it's 21. 
MATT: 21. 
MARISHA: Nice. 
MATT: You needed a 20. (clamoring) 
MARISHA: What's up? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
LIAM: Hold still, you fucking bollocks, ye. 
MATT: You slip it off his throat and hold the chain and as you hold it, you can feel in your grasp there is a force behind it and it's drawing-- It's beautiful and it's drawing your attention towards it and your focus begins to-- 
LIAM: I've got to put that down on the tables at the casino. 
MATT: -- to directly focus deeply on that. 
LIAM: Turn it over. 
LAURA: Ruh-roh. 
MATT: You guys see up on top, balancing, lower hands grabbing onto the sides of a slumbering Mortimer that's teetering in the middle of the space. 
LIAM: Plus tail, like a tripod. 
MATT: You see Xarlo pulls off this necklace and now starts-- 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
MATT: -- cradling it like the One Ring. 
LIAM: It baited me? 
ASHLEY: Oh boy. 
LIAM: And snatched it up. 
MATT: However, because that was with Fear, it comes back to me. I'm going to spend two of these to activate both of the bodyguards on the side. 
LIAM: Damn it, I keep [JENGA]. 
MATT: One of them is going to elbow Mortimer really hard in the side and go "Boss, get up!" and knock him conscious. "(woozy groan) What's going on?" You see him look up and this fury come across the face of Mortimer as also his other hand feels the absence of the amulet. 
TRAVIS: Uh-oh. 
MATT: But both of the, that's one of them, the other bodyguard is going to rush up here and is going to take a swipe at you again because you're sitting right there in the front. 
TRAVIS: Jesus. (laughs) 
MATT: That's going to be a five to hit. 
TRAVIS: (elated screams) 
ASHLEY: Yay! 
MATT: You dodge out of the way. That's going to finish the GM move. Who wants to go next? 
LAURA: I do, I want to-- 
MATT: Go for it. 
LAURA: -- bamf forward. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
LAURA: Spend another stress to get right behind Mortimer. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: (whooshes) I imagine he casts a shadow? 
MATT: Well, from the light sources here, also, he's lit well from this area. There's a lot of light in these areas. 
TALIESIN: No, I'm good, I just need stress healing. 
LAURA: Then I'll just run up. 
MATT: Okay, you can do that. 
LAURA: I'll run up to him and I'll take that stress away and I will cast Shadow Bind on him. 
MATT: Shadow Bind, okay, he definitely casts a shadow. 
LAURA: Oh, and "within any enemies at very close range." 
MATT: Yeah, so you can Shadow Bind the two bodyguards as well. 
LAURA: Great, I will do that. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
TRAVIS: We are the definition of clumped up. 
LAURA: I am making a spellcast roll. 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, do you want to Tag Team this really quickly? 
LAURA: What, how? 
TALIESIN: While you're doing the Shadow Bind-- Yeah, I'm going to help you as I'm going to flash and do a very, very big, big movement with the sword and-- 
LAURA: Try to knock him over? 
TALIESIN: Bring it up and around and try and stab right where it is to back him up right into you. 
MARISHA: (triumphant grunt) 
TALIESIN: Because I see you setting up. 
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh. 
MATT: No. 
LIAM: Everybody take six Hope. 
MARISHA: (spirited growl) 
MATT: I take three stress. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Do what you were doing. 
TALIESIN: I don't have enough Hope for that, never mind, carry on. 
LAURA: You don't have enough Hope? 
MATT: Do what you're doing. 
LAURA: I'm going to add my Rally dice to make it work better. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: I'm going to rally. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Ooh, ooh! (laughter) 
LAURA: 16, 17, 18, 19. Wait, what am I adding? Wait, wait, wait. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, with Hope. 
MATT: 21 With Hope. So you get Hope. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: That is a success, so-- 
ASHLEY: Success! 
MATT: All three of them then become bound to the ground. They are restrained currently, correct? Because their shadows are stuck to the-- 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Basically like Peter Pan stapled them. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Very cool. 
LAURA: (stapling) 
MATT: Continue to use this for that. Putting you back up where you belong here alongside the wall, and then you're still on it. 
LAURA: Do I have any movement left? 
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you only moved maybe halfway through close range. So you can move another half. 
LAURA: Then I'll back up so they can't get me. 
MATT: Okay, so three squares to there is about far as you can get. Okay, you can go further if you want to, but it's an agility roll if you want to try and get fully out of there. 
LAURA: No, I'm good where I am. 
TRAVIS: Because I've been getting wrecked so bad, can I please use Mysterious Mist as an action to spend a Hope and cast "a temporary thick fog that circles a stationary up to very close range, anyone that is within the fog is hidden to anyone outside the fog" and then can I move backwards as fast as I can? 
LAURA: That's the icing-filled one. 
MATT: Yes, you may. 
MARISHA: Share it? 
TRAVIS: So I'll spend that Hope. 
LAURA: You can't share an icing-filled one, just take it. 
MARISHA: I'll take a bite and then you can have the rest. 
LAURA: I'll take this one. 
MATT: How far back do you go? 
TRAVIS: I'm going to go back all the way to the wall actually, yeah. 
MATT: All the way to the wall. So you slam into his small, his large throne. 
TRAVIS: My wings go (flutters) and just (swoosh). 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: If it's all right, I'm going to use that mist to turn around and circle around that minion so I can get a shot at him and his boss. 
MATT: You can do that. 
TALIESIN: With my rapier. 
LIAM: Xarlo is benched mentally, right? 
TALIESIN: No, he's back up. 
MATT: Xarlo, you can still take, if you want to try and take actions, you can try. 
LIAM: Oh, okay, cool. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: You're at disadvantage on any of your rolls, essentially. 
LIAM: Oh, I see. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you-- 
MATT: Because you're distracted by its presence. 
TALIESIN: -- another action tracker. You're going to get an additional one because I'm going to do Slow and Sturdy to get advantage on this attack for the two of them. 
LIAM: He's awake, right? 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm taking advantage, which means you get a-- 
MATT: I get an action tracker on top of that. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: Great, that's two. I'll take two tokens. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another stress because that's hilarious. So I have just pooled four stress, that's fun. All right, here we go. Come on, don't be a jerk. Hmm. 14? 
MATT: 14 on both of them? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: 14 does hit the bodyguard, does not hit Mortimer. 
TALIESIN: That means weirdly, if I fail with Fear, I get a Hope. So I'm going to take that one Hope. 
TRAVIS: "Weirdly." 
MATT: Cool. 
TALIESIN: Thank god. 
MATT: But it's still with Fear, right? 
TALIESIN: But still with Fear. So I'm going to roll that damage. 
MATT: I'll take a Fear on that. 
LAURA: Oh god, he's getting a lot of-- 
ASHLEY: [JENGA] 
TALIESIN: It's just, okay, so I missed on the big guy. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's nice! 18 points of damage. 
MATT: 18 points of damage. Ooh, that's going to be a major. So that's two hit points on him. (slash) (gurgles) Takes the hit, still standing. 
TALIESIN: Am I in the mist, out of curiosity? 
MATT: No, the mist is in the back of the room right now. 
TALIESIN: Oh damn it, okay. That's fine. 
MATT: It's all good? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm good. 
MATT: All right. Who wants to go next? 
LIAM: Go for it. 
MARISHA: I'm going to back up a little bit. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: I take a little bit of glitter and I throw it around me-- I split the difference. 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: I'm going to do a Rune Circle. So I have "a temporary magic circle on the ground around me. Any creatures in melee range or who enter melee range of the circle take 2d12 magic damage and then are pushed out." 
MATT: Okay, let's mark this as your magic circle. 
MARISHA: At the end. Go ahead. 
LIAM: Oh, well while I'm staring at this-- 
MATT: Do you have to roll for that or you just spend stress? 
MARISHA: I mark a stress to do it. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Necklace, I can feel the big fella moving underneath me. So I figure I better do this and I go whomp with my axe right down onto his head. 
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack with disadvantage. 
LIAM: Yeah, so that, oh jeez, disadvantage means-- 
MATT: You minus a d6. 
LIAM: Minus a d6, that's not very nice, though. I rolled a six on the disadvantage die. Oh, that's nothing. (laughter) 
LIAM: That's absolutely nothing. That is a three with Fear. 
LAURA: Oh no! 
MATT: Three with Fear. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: So. 
LAURA and LIAM: (laugh) 
MATT: You go and swing the axe down and as you go to strike it into it, suddenly, your axe stops about inches from the face and as you focus in on the other hand from the one that's holding the amulet, you can see that Mortimer's massive, frog-like fist is wrapped around your hand. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
MATT: At which point, he lifts you up from the top of his head. 
LIAM: Right. 
MATT: Is going to attempt to throw you-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- off, while also grabbing for the amulet that's in your hand. 
LAURA: Oh god. 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: So I'll activate him. I'm going to-- This is going to be a roll against your Evasion. I will-- 
LIAM: Can I focus more on holding onto this necklace in my hand because it's so pretty? 
MATT: You can. 
LIAM: Right then. 
MATT: So the specifics of this is you are vulnerable while holding it. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Which means all attacks against you have advantage. All rolls that you make are at disadvantage. So he's going to roll against you and add a d6 to it. That is a 14 plus three plus, that's going to be an 18. I need you to make a strength check for me. 
LIAM: Sure. 
MATT: See if you can beat an 18. 
MARISHA: Ooh, whoa. 
LIAM: I have to beat an 18? All right. 
MATT: This is just a reaction, so you don't get to add any Hope or anything. The Hope and Fear don't matter. 
LIAM: That is an 18 with Hope. 
MATT: That is an 18. The Hope doesn't matter, but you manage to hold onto it as he throws you off his head. 
TRAVIS: Wow, right on. 
LIAM: What? 
MARISHA: Amazing. 
MATT: As you get slammed into the back wall and barely catch onto your feet. 
LIAM: Do I get a Hope on that? That's a reaction, so no Hope? 
MATT: No, reactions, you don't get hope. 
LIAM: Got it, understand, understood. 
MATT: He goes to try and give chase and is like (grunt). 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Is unable to move from his spot. 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to Cinder Grasp Mortimer. 
LIAM: Because he's Shadow Bound, right? 
MATT: Go for it. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. His shadow is stapled to the ground right now. He's unable to move. 
ASHLEY: Okay. That is a 16 with Fear. (laughs) 
MATT: That hits Mortimer. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so. Fucking bitch. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I rolled a one again. 
MARISHA: No! 
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Sorry. 
MATT: It's all good. 
LAURA: Don't use that 20 anymore. 
ASHLEY: But that's usually the one that does so good. 
LAURA: No. Really? 
TRAVIS: It does so good. 
ASHLEY: So good! 
MATT: So Mortimer takes-- That hits his minor, so he takes one hit point. 
ASHLEY: He takes one hit point. 
MATT: But he is still in flames, correct? 
ASHLEY: He's still in flames, he remains in flames and "anytime the creature tries to act while on fire, it must take, *must** take an additional 2d6 magic damage if it's still on fire at the end of each action, at the end of its action," so sorry. 
MATT: Right, and he uses an activation to get rid of it. Is that what it says? 
ASHLEY: It doesn't say that. It doesn't say it. 
MATT: Let me see the card real fast. 
TRAVIS: ‚ô™ It doesn't say it ‚ô™ 
MARISHA: It doesn't say it. 
ASHLEY: It doesn't say it, unless I'm missing it and it's right in front of my damn face. 
MATT: Oh, temporarily, so yeah. I can spend an activation to drop it. 
ASHLEY: I understand what you're saying. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: That makes sense more what you're saying. [JENGA] No, you remain on fire the whole time. 
LAURA: Forever. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Okay. However, that was with Fear, you said, right? 
LAURA: Was that with Fear? 
MATT: Ashley, that was with Fear? 
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry, yes. 
MATT: All right. I'm going to activate all three. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: Down in the front. 
MARISHA: Damn. 
ASHLEY: Shit. 
LIAM: Hi, ho. 
MATT: So all three there, I'm going to have-- 
LIAM: Aur naur. 
MARISHA: Aur naur. 
ASHLEY: Aur naur. 
MATT: I'm going to spend a Fear to get rid of Mortimer's-- 
LAURA: Restrained? 
MATT: -- restrained. He's still in flames. He's going to do a Powerful Leap. 
LAURA: (gasp) Oh no. 
LIAM: Oh! 
MATT: He (whoosh) leaps in the air. 
LAURA: Oh no, he doesn't like you. 
TALIESIN: I don't suppose I get a-- I don't suppose I get an attack of opportunity on that? 
MATT: If he leaves your melee range, which he was in-- then yeah, you can do that. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: But he still completes his leap. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MATT: And takes 2d6 magic damage. Go ahead and roll that. 
TALIESIN: Well, I can keep them from moving as an option. 
MATT: Can you? 
TALIESIN: I can. 
MATT: How? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: No, read the ability for me. 
TALIESIN: "If an adversary attempts to leave your melee range, make an agility reaction roll against their difficulty. On a successful roll, choose one effect out of two." 
MATT: Okay, gotcha. 
TALIESIN: I'm not going to stop him because I cannot actually think of a way that makes any sense and also that terrifies me. 
MATT: You can if you want to try, if you want to make an agility roll. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and take a slice. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: I'm not crazy. 
MARISHA: Slice his Achilles tendons. 
MATT: How much damage? 
ASHLEY: Seven. 
MATT: Seven damage? 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs) 
MATT: All right. That's another hit point off of him. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it a roll, let's see what I get. 
MARISHA: Come on, turtle. Give us a slice. 
TALIESIN: 21 with Fear. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Although it's a reaction, so. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Wait, 21 with Fear-- 
MATT: Fear doesn't matter. 
TALIESIN: Would be 24, yeah. Okay, 24 is my reaction roll. 
MATT: Okay, that definitely succeeds. 
TALIESIN: Then that's, (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I don't know what the fuck we're talking about. 11, 15 points of damage. 
MATT: 15 points of damage. 
ASHLEY: Slice those off. 
MATT: All right, that's going to be two more hit points off of him. 
MARISHA: Slice those off. 
MATT: Yeah, man. 
TALIESIN: I should have attacked with Deadly Focus, fuck my life. 
LAURA: Do you want that pink one? 
MATT: That's all right. 
TALIESIN: What? 
MATT: So he lands after the Deadly Leap. 
LAURA: You want that pink donut, Taliesin? 
MATT: He's going to try and wrestle that from you again. 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: So he's going to roll. 
LIAM: Jeez, in my way. 
MATT: That's going to be 16. Go ahead and make another strength-- 
LIAM: Strength? 
MATT: -- reaction roll for me. 
LIAM: Okay, hold on, I want to read about my prayer die real quick here. "You can spend one or more of these dice at any time on yourself." Okay, so a strength roll? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Here we go. That is 10, that is 13 and I'm going to add my last prayer die to get me up to 15. 
MATT: 15, all right. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Can I help him, can I aid him with a Hope? 
MATT: In this instance, he doesn't need to. 
MARISHA: Oh, great! 
MATT: Since it was a 15, is what I said. 
TRAVIS: 15. 
MATT: Yeah, 15. Yeah, so you just-- 
LIAM: Oh, I just barely did it? 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Then I want to scramble under his legs because he's so big and I'm so small and I'm going to run by Bunnie in her magic circle. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: All righty, about here, or--? 
MARISHA: Oh hi, you need something? 
LIAM: Help, help, help, help, help. 
MARISHA: Let go. 
LIAM: Oh, that's not really an option here. 
MARISHA: You'll get your brain back, I'll give it back to ya's. 
LIAM: Eh, I am not letting go of it. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Well, what the fuck d'ya come over here for? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Can you not let go of it? You're not letting go of it. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Yes? 
TALIESIN: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I look at him. 
LAURA: Liam is Liam-ing. 
MARISHA: Liam is Liam-ing. 
MATT: By the nature of the enchantment, he's following the narrative. 
MARISHA: Xarlo, you can be a real pain in the ass sometimes, you know that? I'm going to give him another Inspirational Words for him to heal a hit point because: You look like shit. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: I feel like shit, too. 
MATT: All right, so I'll add an action tracker for that. All righty, who hasn't gone here in a minute? I know you haven't gone in a minute, Sweetpea. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: You created the fog and that's about it and you, Oppy, haven't done, oh no, no, sorry. 
ASHLEY: I did. 
MATT: You just did Cinder Grasp, so. 
MARISHA: Real quick before you go, I am going to pull out my fans and I'm going to start spinning them and I'm going to "play an epic song to make a close target temporarily vulnerable." I'm going to make it big fatty over there. 
MATT: He is in flames and he is vulnerable. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: So with that, all attacks against him have advantage and all of his attacks have disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Ooh, yeah! 
LAURA: I'm going to run forward and as I run towards the wall near me, I'm going to bamf into the shadows and bamf out right behind the big Mortimer. 
MATT: (whoosh) 
LAURA: Can I be behind him? 
MATT: You can bamf underneath this table here, which has shadow. 
LAURA: Sweet. 
MATT: Because there's a light right here. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You can then leap out. 
LAURA: Sorry, I can't see. 
MATT: That's okay, and you can get right behind him there. 
LAURA: Great. 
MATT: So you spend a stress to do that and (whoosh). 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: You run around the side, vanish, and then appear at a table across the way. 
LAURA: Yeah, and I'm going to Shadow Bind him again. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Try to stick him back into place right there. 
MATT: All right, so roll for that. 
LIAM: ‚ô™ I love it when they call me Big Hoppa ‚ô™ 
LAURA: That was not, I didn't roll my actual dice there. 
MATT: Roll your duality dice. 
LAURA: Okay. That is 16, 17, 18, 19 plus, no, 19 with Fear. 
MATT: 19 with Fear. 
LAURA: So I have to stop doing what I was going to do. 
MATT: He is-- I'm putting all of the marks on him. He is now on fire. (laughter) 
MATT: He is vulnerable, and he is bound to the ground as his shadow once again is now pulling him to the ground. The tiny dark elements of the lightless space beneath him is pulling his legs to the ground right now. 
LAURA: Then I'm going to pull a Bellatrix Lestrange and slide back under the table. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Oh, neat. 
MATT: (whooshes) 
MATT: As you go back underneath there. That was with Fear, you said? 
LAURA: That was Fear. 
MATT: That was Fear. As you're pulling away, he is going to angrily spin to strike at you in a vengeful sweep with his cane sword. Oh, that's going to be a 21 to hit. 
LAURA: Oh, that hits. 
ASHLEY: Does he take 2d6 fire damage because he did an action? 
MATT: Oh yeah, he does. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: That's good. 
MATT: So roll for that. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. Nine. 
MATT: Nine. 
MARISHA: Nein! 
MATT: That is one hit point on him as the flames, he's shrugging off and keeps pushing. That's going to be 19 points of physical damage against you. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LAURA: Oh! Okay. That's still major, not severe, thankfully. 
MATT: That's good. 
LAURA: I can't, I would have to use all my armor to bring that down, 19. 
TALIESIN: Take two I guess. 
LAURA: 17. 
MATT: I'm going to spend this one to activate, her back here. Is going to go, "Mortimer, how you doing?" He's going to run past, like, "Not so good." He's looking, blood's pouring out his mouth. The flames are on him, but he's just focused now over back on that amulet that you're holding. She's going to go ahead and strike with the scepter from afar. I think she sees the amulet in your hand and is going to go for you, Xarlo. That's going to be-- 
LIAM: She, who, where, which one? 
MATT: Over here. 
TRAVIS: We got to talk to him. 
LAURA: I know, we got to talk to him or just try to take the amulet and run. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: 12 to hit? 
LIAM: Yeah, that'll hit. 
MATT: All right. So as she takes her scepter out, sees it in the hand and goes, "We got to get it" (swoosh) and unleashes in your direction. You take-- 
LIAM: Right, right. 
MATT: 10 points of magic damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Wait, where's Xarlo? 
LIAM: I'm hiding by Bunnie. 
MARISHA: He's hiding behind Bunnie. 
LIAM: So I'll use an armor point. I'll use two armor points so that it just tears into me clothes. 
ASHLEY: An armor pint. 
LIAM: And not meself. 
MATT: Okay. Yep. 
LIAM: Right? That's an option, isn't it? Okay. I am going to, in that moment, a little dazed, clutch my token of Ondra, and hold my hand out towards the sneaky little, no, I can't do that, she's too far away. "Target a creature other than yourself." 
ASHLEY: You aiming for us? 
LIAM: "Make a spellcast roll," yeah. Do I have to have hands on for Healing Hands? "Make a spellcast roll and target a creature other than yourself in melee," I have to be close. 
MATT: Yes, you can rush up and do it, if you want to. 
LIAM: That's a little hairy in there. Eh. Instead, I'm going to run out the door-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
LIAM: -- and I'm going to hide behind that wall right there. 
MATT: Right there? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: Laura, is that you up in front right there? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: All the way up towards the end. 
TALIESIN: Who's that with the little green-- Oh, that's, okay. 
ASHLEY: That's me. 
MATT and TALIESIN: That's Oppy. 
MATT: Do you want to go? 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, Oppy, do you want to do something terrible to this weird scepter-- Is it a frog, it's another frog? 
MATT: It's another frog, just a smaller one. 
TALIESIN: Do you want to mess with the scepter frog? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Ribbet. 
TALIESIN: All right, with the ribbet. 
ASHLEY: Let's do it. Ribbet. 
TALIESIN: All right, I am going to sweep around, pull back the sword and say: Let's see what you can do when you can't see and can't walk, for we're having frog's legs tonight! I'm going to take a swing. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: You heard me. It's all power. No offense! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to add a: No offense! I'm just trying to do a thing. 
MATT: You take a stress from that. 
TALIESIN: I am definitely not getting Dramatic Flair for that, I'm well aware. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Do you know what happens to a frog when it's struck by lightning? 
TALIESIN: I'm doing my best! It was terrible. 
MATT: You have frog legs tonight. 
TALIESIN: I was not built for this one, the rules. I'm going to use the Tactician version of that so that it's three Hope to do the Tag Team roll. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: I get to use the d20 for my Hope. 
MATT: Correct. So you roll a d12 Fear die, a d20 Hope die. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: You get to roll both your duality dice and whoever has the higher roll, you both get. 
ASHLEY: Am I adding anything? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Hmm? 
ASHLEY: Am I adding or just the duality dice? 
MATT: Just the dice and then you add whatever your attack or spell is that you're using for this. 
ASHLEY: Okay, got it, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: I can't even remember what you said, it was so weird. 
MATT: It was perfect. 
MARISHA: It was such a long walk. 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
TRAVIS: It had multiple phases. 
TALIESIN: What's yours? 
ASHLEY: Nine. Nine with Hope. 
TALIESIN: 18 with Fear. 
TRAVIS: Boo. 
MATT: 18 with Fear? 
TALIESIN: So you still get the Hope, though. 
ASHLEY: I still get the Hope? 
MATT: 18 with Fear? 
MATT: You still get the Hope. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Well no, if you both take the roll-- 
LIAM: I brought them to this party. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, do we not? 
TALIESIN: I thought the one who-- Okay. 
MATT: You choose which to take. 
ASHLEY: Do I still take it even, though? Yeah. So I wouldn't get it. 
MATT: You choose which to take. Do you take the nine or the? 
TALIESIN: We'll take the 18. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, so it's an 18, that does hit, but it does revert to me. 
TALIESIN: Okay, but we do get to do our damage, then? 
MATT: You do. 
TALIESIN: All right. Still remembering how Tag Team works. 
MARISHA: Yipee kai yai yay-- 
TALIESIN: So I'm going to go try and sweep-- 
MARISHA: -- he's a horse and I'm a cowboy. 
TALIESIN: -- against the legs and if you're going to attack the head, if that works. (laughter) 
MARISHA: How can you make quippy one-liners longer? [JENGA] 
TALIESIN: So we both get to roll damage and add it together. 
TRAVIS: Oh, nice. 
ASHLEY: We both roll damage? 
TALIESIN: Yes. And add it together. 
ASHLEY: Okay, d20? 
TALIESIN: No, whatever your damage. Yeah, whatever because I don't know your attack. I'm just adding mine. 
ASHLEY: My attack from-- Okay. 
TALIESIN: My damage, anyway. 
ASHLEY: My staff, 12. 
MATT: Yeah, whatever your staff damage is. 
ASHLEY: Great, okay, so eight. That's good. 
LAURA: 11 is good. 
ASHLEY: It'll be 11, 11. 
MATT: 11 plus? 
TALIESIN: 23 is what the total is. 
MATT: 23 is the total of both together? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: 23 points of damage to her. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: She's going to use You Wouldn't! as a reaction. She gets to mark a stress and reduce the damage by a d6, by one. All right, so she still takes a major damage. She's like "(pained yell)", takes the hit from both of you, pulls away. (pants) "Mortimer, we got to get out of here." That was with Fear? 
TALIESIN: That was with Fear. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: (unhappy noises) 
MATT: Two rolls there. 
TALIESIN: I rolled a seven on my d20. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Does anyone want to stop and talk or-or-or are we going to keep going? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm going out on a limb here. 
MATT: All right, so I'm activating and then we can come to your roll here to try and do that. 
ASHLEY: Fair. 
MATT: No, but as you're shouting this, I'm activating both. She's going to go ahead and-- 
LAURA: Run. 
MATT: Try and run up the stairs over here. 
MARISHA: Oh no, there's stairs?! 
LIAM: I didn't even see the stairs over here. 
MATT: Neither of these can go anywhere. 
MARISHA: I forgot about that. 
MATT: So he's going to swing towards you since you're shouting. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LAURA: Does anyone want to t-- (whoom) (laughter) 
MATT: That's a natural 20. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: So we're toying with some critical rolls here. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: So-- 
TRAVIS: All bad. 
MATT: He's going to swing here. 
LIAM: [JENGA] 
TRAVIS: I don't think we've ever said that before. 
MARISHA: It's true. I know. 
TRAVIS: "Toying with some critical roles here." 
MATT: I know. (laughs) 
MARISHA: We say everything else but the name of our company. 
MATT: It's going to be 31 points of physical damage. 
LIAM: We said "shiver and queef" 73,000 times. 
ASHLEY: Okay. So, okay. That's a lot. 
TRAVIS: How many points? 
MATT: 31. 
ASHLEY: 31. 
LAURA: Points of damage? 
TRAVIS: How many armor slots you got? 
ASHLEY: I have lots. So I'm going to use those. 
LAURA: Good, but it's small armor. 
ASHLEY: So-so-so I'm going to use those is what I'm going to do right now and I'm going to do-- 
MARISHA: How far off are you from--? 
ASHLEY: I have six armor slots to spend left and I have four. 
TRAVIS: But it's only two per armor slot. 
ASHLEY: Two per, yeah. So-- 
LAURA: (chuckles) 
MARISHA: (nervous noise) 
MARISHA: Can you even get to your next threshold? 
ASHLEY: Let me see if I can get down to two. Yeah. So if I use that, then it's-- Jeez Louise. It's two per armor slot? 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: That's your armor score, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, six times two, so 12 would be-- If you used all of them, you could take 12 off. 
LAURA: You could bamf it down. Could you bring it down to major? 
ASHLEY: So I want to use them all? 
LAURA: Could you bring it down to major? 
ASHLEY and LAURA: I don't know. 
MARISHA: ‚ô™ I can also heal you ‚ô™ 
ASHLEY: You can? So should I just take it? 
LAURA: Yeah, it's not going to drop it. 
MARISHA: Because it's three hit points, right? 
TRAVIS: Choices. 
MATT: I know. 
ASHLEY: I know! I don't like it. 
TRAVIS: If you can make it. 
MARISHA: I can-- 
MATT: What's your severe threshold? 
ASHLEY: Because that's going to take-- 18, so. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: 18? Okay. 
ASHLEY: That takes it down. 
MATT: It's not quite double your severe damage. 
ASHLEY: No, no, no. I'm going to take it. I'm going to take it. 
TRAVIS: It's not far off, Matthew. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Five away. 
MATT: Double the severe would be four hit points. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, take the three. 
MATT: Okay. A heavy-- 
ASHLEY: Ow! 
MATT: -- backhand to Oppy. So now, as they're unable to run, you now have your opportunity to try and shout them down. So what are you doing? 
ASHLEY: Take it easy! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
ASHLEY: Take it easy. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's it? That's the whole thing? 
ASHLEY: Wait. Since he took an action, he's going to take some fire damage? Did he do that yet? 
MATT: That was the guy over here. 
ASHLEY: Shit. Never mind. 
MATT: That's okay. 
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. We can keep going. 
LAURA: Are we talking? 
ASHLEY: I don't know! 
MARISHA: I'm going to jump in and help Oppy. Can I do that? 
MATT: Yeah. Okay. So you're trying to diffuse the situation here. 
ASHLEY: I'm trying to diffuse the situation. 
LAURA: You've killed some people. 
MARISHA: Yeah, come on, Mr. Frog Man. We just came here to try to have a civil conversation with you. Then I'm going to once again try and use Recant. So I'm going to spend a Hope and see if I can make frog man forget the last minute when he lost his pretty little necklace. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: Okay. So roll your spell. Spellcast roll against Mortimer. 
ASHLEY: Wait. Mortimer's not the one that did the 31 points of damage. 
MATT: No, it was one of the bodyguards over there. 
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought it was him. 
MATT: He got real lucky on that hit. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. 
MARISHA: Since I'm acting and this was a dress rehearsal, can I spend another Hope to add The Show Must Go On to this? 
MATT: I'll allow it. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. Come on. 
MATT: The Show Must Go On would go for a presence roll in this scenario. Because this is a spellcast roll, this is about casting a spell to affect his mind. I don't think it would apply to this in particular. 
MARISHA: My spellcasting is presence. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: Okay. That's a valid point. You know what? I'll allow it, I'll allow it. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to spend a Hope. 
MARISHA: To help me? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. Okay. So that's that, plus three and plus four so, seven and five, 12, 14, 16. Then your-- 
LAURA: Plus whatever you add. 
MARISHA: Adding your d6, right? 
ASHLEY: Yes. Sorry. Three. 
MARISHA: Okay, so 19-- 
LAURA: Watching your hand for that was amazing. 
MATT: So you shout this out and Mortimer, who's on fire and stapled to the ground goes-- 
LIAM: (laughs) 
MATT: "(huffs) What's going on over here? "(confused groans)" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: Suddenly doesn't know why he's on fire. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh no! How'd you catch on fire? 
ASHLEY: Oh! What happened to you? Oh my god! 
MARISHA: I'm assuming you heard me say-- I'm going to telepathically real quick, I'm going to open a line of mental communication to Xarlo and say: The big fucker doesn't know that you stole his necklace. 
LIAM: That's totally cool. He says as he continues to inch down the hallway with the necklace. 
MATT: So he's on fire right now. (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Did you roll with Hope or Fear? 
MARISHA: With Fear. 
MATT: With Fear. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: I have not had a Hope roll. I think I've had one this whole time. It's been terrible. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to hock up some spit to try to help him put the fire out. I know it's not going to do anything, I'm just going to spit at it. 
MATT: This one-- 
TRAVIS: (groans) Fuck. 
MATT: -- is up the stairs. 
ASHLEY: I know, she's going away. 
LIAM and LAURA: (groans) 
ASHLEY: She's going to get help. 
LAURA: She got away? 
MATT: This one over here-- 
LAURA: Did I see that happen? 
LIAM: What did we say? 50 security guards upstairs. 
MATT: You don't, because you hid under here. 
LAURA: I didn't quite get there before he hit me. Did I make it all the way under the table when he hit me? 
MATT: You said you still went under the table after he hit you. Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay. 
ASHLEY: Wait, but I did see her go. 
MATT: You did. What's your preference here? Chasing her or trying to continue this charade? 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll stay. I'll stay. I'll stay. 
MATT: Okay. I'll hold onto this other one here for now. 
ASHLEY: I don't know if I like that. 
MATT: All right, so right now, he's on fire. You said you wanted to hock up a loogie to try and put out the flames? 
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Okay. All right. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Is he looking rough? 
MATT: I mean, he's looking hurt. 
TRAVIS: Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: I mean, I know it's not going to do anything. It is an effort to try to be like-- 
MATT: To deceive that you're on his side. 
ASHLEY: We're trying to help you. 
MATT: Yeah. So make a presence roll for me, please. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: This is to perform being an ally in this moment. 
ASHLEY: That would be a 12 with Fear. 
MATT: 12 with Fear. Okay. 
ASHLEY: (groans) Why did I do this? 
MATT: I'm going to take a Fear on that one. 
ASHLEY: Why did I do this? I'm just going to shut up. 
MATT: As you try and run up to him-- (hocks a loogie) 
ASHLEY: Sorry, that wasn't helpful. 
MATT: (spit sizzles) The flames are still on him. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
MATT: Mind you, it's still your spell. If you wanted to cancel the flames from the spell, I'd allow you to do that if you wanted to. 
LAURA: Oh, to make it look like you did it? 
MARISHA: Make it look-- Yeah. 
TRAVIS: You could-- Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes. 
MATT: Okay. So you-- 
ASHLEY: I'll cancel it with the spit and then-- 
MATT: You spit on there. (sizzling) Looks down, looks at you incredulously and the flames vanish. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. 
MATT: Glances around, turns around, "Gamma!" and is looking for somebody in the room while the two other guards over there are still Shadowbound to the ground. 
TRAVIS: Can I? 
TRAVIS: Yes, you may. 
TRAVIS: Can I turn to Mortimer and say: I can't believe your men would betray you like this. I will reach out a hand and cast Wall of Flame across the two guards. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
TRAVIS: (flames roar) Just lighting them up. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: (flames roaring) Like a row of napalm. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yes! 
MATT: (flames roar) 
LIAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (screams) (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. Roll for attack on both of them. 
TRAVIS: I'll mark a stress. Mark a stress, create a temporary wall of flame between two points within far range. Anything that passes through it takes 4d10 magic damage. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TRAVIS: That's a fucking lot of-- That's a lot of damage. 12, 21, 24, 25 points of damage. 
MATT: 25 points of damage. Did you roll for a spell? 
TRAVIS: It doesn't-- 
MATT: Oh, it just costs two-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just a cost of stress to cast. 
MATT: Costs a stress to cast it, yeah. 
LAURA: Sheesh. 
LIAM: Sheesh! 
MATT: All right. (laughs) 
LAURA: (screams) 
MATT: I think it's this one, just (fire roars) burns and ignites in the room and is left screaming until he's quiet. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: The other one is still like, "(panicked scream)" 
TRAVIS: After the spell, can I move up onto the daises again? Just away from Mortimer a little bit. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Damn it, she got away. 
LAURA: Who? 
TALIESIN: I don't know, the frog. 
MATT: All right. At this point now, the other guard that's over there is going to try and turn and start shouting as it's trying to pull itself free. 
TALIESIN: Which one? 
MATT: What are you guys doing? 
TALIESIN: Which one? 
LAURA: Can I-- 
MATT: The other one that's still standing in the flames. 
TRAVIS: (flame storm) 
TALIESIN: Oh, no you don't! I'm going to-- Yeah, I think I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: You could kick the wall and it would-- 
LAURA: Kick him into the wall. 
TRAVIS: -- re-trigger the same damage. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm going to give him a good shove. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
TRAVIS: This is Sparta. 
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll. Go ahead and roll a strength check. 
TALIESIN: Actually, honestly, it's easier if I just use my sword, at this point. Because my strength is not nearly as good as my sword. 
TRAVIS: I mean, if you wanted to hit him with your shell... 
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and ASHLEY: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Shell shock. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: That's not an experience. I'm out of Hope. All out of Hope. Okay, there we are. So yeah, I'm just going to-- 
ASHLEY: Stop and spin into the shell. 
TALIESIN: -- use the grapple, I think, instead of the sword to just slap him. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: See if I can throw him into the fire, actually. All right. That's finesse. Actually no, I'll use the sword because it's just better. 
MARISHA: Aw! 
TALIESIN: Six-- 
MARISHA: So close. 
TALIESIN: -- seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 to hit? 
MATT: 14 to hit. Just hits. 
TALIESIN: Hey! 
TRAVIS and LAURA: Ooh! 
TALIESIN: With Hope, I might add. 
LAURA: With Hope, finally. 
MATT: So you take that. 
TALIESIN: Thank god. Then let's do some damage. Let's see what happens. 16 points of damage. 
MATT: 16 points of damage. 
MARISHA: Do you push him into the fire? Or it doesn't matter? 
TALIESIN: Don't have to, yeah. 
MARISHA: Doesn't matter. 
TALIESIN: (grunts) 
MATT: You strike with the rapier, they fall back into the flames with their dying breath and are also consumed. 
LIAM: That's turtle power. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Tell me she's got it. [JENGA] 
TRAVIS: We turn in unison. ‚ô™ (action movie rhythm) ‚ô™ Look at Mortimer. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: Mortimer, cane blade out in one hand, looks all intensely and goes, "(gasps)." 
TALIESIN: Put it away. 
MATT: "Where is it?" 
LIAM: Meanwhile-- 
ASHLEY: What's wrong? 
LIAM: -- out in the sewer, I think by now, I've held it so long, I'm like: Oh, this is very nice. And I put it over my neck. 
MATT: Feels very nice. 
LIAM: Just cradle it there. 
MARISHA: It's what Kexon said, your men, they betrayed you. They must have stolen your necklace and they also were up there blabbing their mouths, just like, yap, yap, yap, yap. 
MATT: "Who? Gamma! Gamma!" 
LAURA: Yeah, that was the one. 
ASHLEY: That was the one. 
MATT: Make a presence roll for me. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: Me? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) You? 
LAURA: Why did I do that? 
MATT: You could spend a Hope to help if you want. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to spend a Hope to help you since I jumped in on it. 
TRAVIS: I'm just an honest lil mushroom. 
LAURA: I'm a Sneaky Lil Mushroom. Does that count? Can I use a Hope to-- Because I lied a lot in our village-- 
MATT: There's a difference between sneaky and being good at lying. 
LAURA: (resigned noise) 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: That's fine. What's a-- What am I adding to it? 
ASHLEY: Four. 
LAURA: Okay. 14, 18, 19 with Hope. 
MATT: 19 with Hope. See him fall back a bit. "(grunts) They're always betraying me, always. I can't trust anyone. Who are you? Who's putting this fire out?" 
TRAVIS: I can drop the fire. 
LAURA: Are you sure? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll drop the fire. 
MATT: Fire drops. 
MATT: "(grunts) I'm going to get her." Begins to lumber over to push past you, but can't because of the Shadowbind. 
MARISHA: Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, just relax a little. Just calm down. 
MATT: "I'm not going to relax. I need to get that back." 
MARISHA: What's so important? 
LAURA: Why? 
ASHLEY: How come? 
MATT: "Who are you? Who the fuck are you, anyway?" 
LAURA: We're here to help, obviously. We're just big helpers. 
MATT: "That doesn't answer the question." 
TRAVIS: We're reinforcements from the Croatonas. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: "*I'm** the Croatonas." 
LAURA: Yeah, you're our distant relatives. 
ASHLEY: We were-- Yeah. (laughter) 
MATT: Looks confused. 
TALIESIN: Forgive them, they're hired hands, I can explain this very clearly. There has been a string of mysterious jewel robberies all across town. We were hired as out of towners, special contractors so that they knew we couldn't actually have any ties to anyone here. We were in, we followed you in here. We had no idea what we were walking into. Please, we are very good at what we do. 
MATT: Make a presence roll. 
TALIESIN: I'm adding Hottie in a Halfshell because I'm trying to smolder. 
TRAVIS: Hottie in a Halfshell! 
MATT: I'll allow it. 
ASHLEY: ‚ô™ Hottie in a Halfshell! ‚ô™ 
LAURA: ‚ô™ Turtle power ‚ô™ 
TALIESIN: That's just straight presence. There's nothing else I can do with that, is there? There's no advantage. I think. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to spend a Hope because that was great. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: Because I want to. 
TALIESIN: I will take that d6. 
ASHLEY: Oh, you're full up! 
TRAVIS: There we go. 
LAURA: I know. 
LAURA: I should use it. 
TALIESIN: Please. 
ASHLEY: Add a six. 
TALIESIN: Oh, add a six. 
LAURA: I can't add once she's added. 
ASHLEY: Add six. 
TALIESIN: Okay, thanks. 
ASHLEY: I can't add. 
MATT: I mean, you can. You both roll and take the higher. 
TALIESIN: There's no higher than that, though. 
MARISHA: Oh wait, is that a damage? 
TALIESIN: No. Oh, I rolled the wrong dice. Thank you. I was about to panic. 
MARISHA: It was about to be really bad. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was about to be bad. 
MATT: Make sure you roll there properly. 
TALIESIN: That's better. Let's see. Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 22 with Fear. 
TALIESIN: 22 with Fear. That's with your-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's with the d6. 
MATT: Oh, with the d6? Yeah. "(grunts) (resigned sigh) All right. You get that back for me and I'll pay you real well." 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We will discuss what "real well" means at a later date. 
LAURA: Wait. What is it? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, what's it do? Just in case we need to be aware of-- 
MATT: "You don't got to know. Just get it back." 
LAURA: Okay. 
LAURA: Should we ask about the Seep? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah. Maybe, in exchange, if we return your pretty necklace, you could just give us a little bit of information, too, about some other going ons that we're trying to investigate. 
MATT: "So you're investigators." 
LAURA: And jewel thief stoppers. 
TALIESIN: We're professionally paid to be professional. 
LAURA: Yeah. From your distance relatives, obviously. (clears throat) 
MATT: "Right. (croaks)" Sits back in his chair, leans back. "All right, investigators, what is it you need?" 
TRAVIS: You ask. I'll go check out the upstairs. And I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: I'll join you. 
MATT: As soon as you head up the stairs, the door opens, and you see Gamma, this other ribbet comes rushing down. "Brother!" What are you doing? 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
LAURA: Can you do a fireball? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) Fireball. The person, do they have any objects on them? 
MATT: They have a scepter. 
TRAVIS: A scepter? Yeah. I will cast Time Lock on the scepter. 
MATT: Okay. "(grunts)" And pulls back. She's going to try and strength pull it out of the air. All right. See if you can beat a 12 on your spellcast roll. 
LIAM: Come on, buddy. 
TRAVIS: It's critical. Awesome. That's 16, 17, 18, 19. 
MATT: That'll do it. She gets held back and you see behind her, there are multiple bouncers that are following. There's like, she went and gathered the troops. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my grapple to grab her, 
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my grapple to grab her, pull her through, and shut the door behind us, unless you stop me. So (whooshes) and then shutting the door. 
MATT: All right. Yeah. Right now, Mortimer's like, "Who's that? Was that Gamma? Is that that demon bitch?" Stands up as you go charging towards the door. Go ahead and make an attack with the grapple 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Here we are. I really hope that this works. Oh. That's a terrible roll. Is there anything I can do about that? Oh, I hate it. I miss. 
LAURA: Can I help you in some way? 
TALIESIN: I don't think there's anything that can be done about it. 
TRAVIS: I will use Luck Bender. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: "Once per session, after you and an ally in close range makes an action roll, you can spend three Hope to reroll the duality die." 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
MATT: You are by the door you said, so. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I will try and make it worthwhile. 
LIAM: Luck is stupid. 
TALIESIN: So let's see. 
LAURA: Come on, Sir Dant√©. 
TALIESIN: It's slightly better. 10 with Hope? 
MATT: 10 with Hope will not succeed. (groaning) 
MARISHA: Damn, damn. 
MATT: You gain a Hope-- 
TALIESIN: Can I spend a Hope to get advantage on that or no? 
MATT: No, you can't. 
TALIESIN: I was just trying to figure out something. 
MATT: No worries. I understand. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take the Hope. 
MATT: You fling the grapple and she knocks it out of the way, pushes past you and you can see now there's a wave of bouncers rushing past. What are you all doing? 
LAURA: Oh no! There's a wave of bouncers? 
MATT: You hear footsteps going down as Gamma rushes out and goes, "Brother, brother. Stop them. They tried to kill us." "Brother, brother. Stop them. They tried to kill us." 
TRAVIS: We should get the fuck out of here. 
MARISHA: We'll get your necklace. Don't worry. We'll be back, mister. 
TRAVIS: Actually, Sir Dant√© and I are heading down the stairs and out of the room, I would try to recast Wall of Flame in front of the doorway, just (fire roaring). 
MATT: Give it a shot. 
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll take another stress. (nervous noises) It instantly right across the doorway. So both of those openings are covered by flame. 
MATT: Engulfed and everyone like, you hear voice going, "Hey. Where they go? Hey, hey. This way. Oh shit!" They all pull back as the flames engulf the space. 
TRAVIS: You won't be sorry. We'll live up to your needs. We should get the fuck out of here. 
MARISHA: (nervous running) [device squeaking] 
LIAM: Oh no! 
ASHLEY: What was that? 
LIAM: Don't worry about it. 
TALIESIN: Just don't worry about it. Yeah, okay. 
MARISHA: All right, yeah, let's go, let's go. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: I follow out towards Xarlo. 
MATT: Wall of Flame vanishes. 
LAURA: (gasps) That fast? 
MATT: I can spend a Fear to do that. 
LAURA: (squeals) 
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. 
MATT: You put it up there, it helps you for a moment as you all go charging out into the middle of the sewer and begin sprinting behind. But you hear heavy footfalls giving chase and you also can hear the (huge crashing footsteps), of the massive form of Mortimer following behind you all. What are you doing? 
LAURA: Did he have to use an activation to get rid of my Shadowbind? Because I never dropped it. 
MATT: We'll say we're out of the combat scenario here. 
LAURA: Okay, can we run, can we run all the way to the-- 
LIAM: Towards the grate? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah, towards the grate, can we get-- 
LIAM: Do we have the means to get past the gate? 
LAURA: Do you have enough? 
ASHLEY: I have one Hope left to spend so I can only get one other person through-- 
LAURA: I can't help you out with that. I can't give you Hope to help you out on that? There's no, there's nothing. 
MATT: Unless you have a specific ability to give help. 
TRAVIS: If we came up this way, then that grate screws us so we could go this way. We just don't don't know where it goes. 
ASHLEY: We just don't know where it goes. 
MARISHA: I run up to Oppy. I know you've got this, I believe in you and I fully use my last Inspirational Words to give you a Hope. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay. So I can get two, I can get two additional people out. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you should-- 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
ASHLEY: I can also-- 
MARISHA: You should take the monkey. 
ASHLEY: I can take us out to a very far range so I can get us really far, if I need to. 
LAURA: But this one person will get left behind. 
ASHLEY: I know. 
LIAM: We could try the other direction. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, just run the other way. We can't get through. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LAURA: Run the other way. 
MARISHA: All right. 
MATT: Okay, so you charge the other direction, Running blind in the opposite way, you come to a T-intersection. It goes right or left. What do you do? 
TRAVIS: Definitely right. 
LAURA: Definitely right. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: You know what I'm going to do? 
MATT: What? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to Channel Raw Power and I'm going to take one of my domain cards and from my Loadout into my Vault so I can gain an extra Hope. 
LAURA: You can do that? 
ASHLEY: Yes, I can. 
LAURA: So we turn back around. 
ASHLEY: So now I have-- 
MATT: You turn one way, you go-- 
ASHLEY: Oh! Never mind. 
MATT: You turn back around and right as you turn the other direction, you run past this entrance once more. Right as you can see the people rushing through and Mortimer's there as you go by, Mortimer is going to angrily make a... 
ASHLEY: You guys can get out? 
MATT: He's going to make a powerful leap action because he can. So as you turn around, he's going to go, (intense whoosh), and land in front of you all. "All right, who's telling the truth? I'm so confused." (laughter) 
MATT: What do you do? 
ASHLEY: All right, I am-- 
LAURA: Shadowbind. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab-- 
MATT: Roll for an attack. 
LIAM: He's having a bad day. 
LAURA: Oh! Critical. 
ASHLEY: Whoa. (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Double 12s! 
LIAM: The best you could get. 
MATT: You watch as a bunch of bouncers leap out and surround him and that hits, how many in a... 
LAURA: That's everybody that's close to me. Anybody that's close, it's very explosive. 
MATT: (air whooshing) They all get bound in that space and none of the rest can get through and they're all like, "(grunts)" 
LAURA: Run, run, run, run, run. 
ASHLEY: Run, run, run. 
TALIESIN: Don't you worry, sir. Animal Instinct is on the job. Animal Instinct! And running. 
MARISHA: Animal Instinct, that's our new name. 
LAURA: That's our fake name. 
TALIESIN: Only for the next 30 seconds. Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Instinct with a K, yeah. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: All right, so you all now, the three of them, and you (boom) on the opposite side of that grate. 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: All right, so the three of you and Oppy all (boof) appear on the opposite side of the grate. 
LIAM: Thank you. 
LAURA: (whooshes) Shadow! Shadow. 
MATT: Shadow through and you're going to attempt to-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll spend a Hope and Arcane Door through it. 
MATT: All right. (whooshing) You all manage to get past, whereas you hear echoing behind you-- Oh, if he even succeeds. 
TRAVIS: We're okay. 
LAURA: Okay, okay. 
MATT: With Fear or Hope? 
TRAVIS: That's Fear. 
MATT: With Fear. Okay. The Shadowbind-- 
ASHLEY: It's a spellcast roll. Shit. 
LAURA: Oh god! What if you don't succeed? 
ASHLEY: Make a spellcast roll on a success spend a Hope. So I would have to spend a Hope. So that might not give me enough Hope. 
LAURA: What? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, make a spellcast roll, okay, hold on. 
TALIESIN: I'm also-- 
LAURA: But it's adding enough. That's what the whole point is. You can spend more Hope to get everybody-- 
ASHLEY: Get a Hope. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to, I was going to, well, assist, but... 
LAURA: Can I help? 
TALIESIN: I was going to assist. 
ASHLEY: You were going to assist. 
LAURA: Can I help you? 
TALIESIN: I was going to assist. 
MATT: How? How do you help her with the spellcasting? 
TALIESIN: I was going to pick her up to carry her so that she can steady herself with the cane a little better as we're running towards-- 
LAURA: Oh, so she can like go, (puffing). 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: As you carry her. 
TALIESIN: Just so it's not trying to bounce. 
MATT: Okay, don't say what you rolled. 
TALIESIN: Holding crate and holding cradle. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Sure, go ahead and spend a Hope. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: Roll a d6. 
TALIESIN: Why not? Why not? 
MATT: Why not? This is "Looney Tunes." I love it. 
ASHLEY: (quick puffing) My lips are wet. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Three? 
TALIESIN: What do we add it? What do we get? 
ASHLEY: So we're at-- 
TALIESIN: Worth it. 
LAURA: Wait, so that takes you up to-- 
ASHLEY: No. It's 10, which doesn't make the 12. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: Oh no. 
MATT: So as you all rush up-- 
LAURA: Do you still have a Rally dice? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: (impact) You all get stuck on the opposite side. Right, and that was with, Hope or Fear? 
ASHLEY: That was with Hope. 
MATT: With Hope. 
ASHLEY: So I get a Hope. 
MATT: Okay, so-- 
ASHLEY: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. 
MATT: You all reached the edge there at the grate and the spell fails. 
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh! 
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. 
MATT: You hear, "Oh, this is the worst birthday ever." 
LAURA: Oh. 
MARISHA: It's his birthday. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh no. (exclaiming) 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
LAURA: What did we do? 
MARISHA: You got through? No, you didn't. 
TRAVIS: No, none of y'all are through. 
LAURA: You three-- 
TRAVIS: You four. 
LAURA: -- and Oppy are stuck. Can't you take anybody else with Arcane Door? 
LIAM: I'm going to quickly give Oppy a hug and say: I'm so sorry, and you're going to feel, "once per long rest, use an action and touch a creature to clear two hit points." So, you're really fucked up, you look-- 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LIAM: -- then I'm going to turn around and start whaling on this fucking grate with my axe, my holy axe. 
MATT: Okay. Okay. Are you attempting to just muscle it or you're attempting to strike it with enough damage? 
LIAM: What's the difference? I'm trying to break through it. 
LAURA: Can I also look at it and see, are there any hinges or any... 
MATT: You've already glanced at it. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Gave it a pretty solid look. It looks like it's old, it's rusted, but it's still pretty strong. 
LIAM: I'll start striking the stone where the metal bars are going into the stone. 
MATT: Okay. I would like you to make a strength roll for me. This is a very high DC. 
TRAVIS: I'm also making a reveal roll just in case there's something that is-- 
TALIESIN: There's also a group action roll that we can attempt. a group action roll right now. 
LAURA: Can all of us roll at the same time? 
TALIESIN: "Nominate the leader of the action, all of the participants in the group action make reaction rolls. Any success gives a leader a plus one modifier." 
MATT: You can give it a shot, if you want. 
TALIESIN: We want to go? 
LIAM: I already rolled, so I'll hold, if this turns into a group thing. 
LAURA: Do the bars actually go into the wall or-- 
MATT: They go into the stone. 
LAURA: Oh fuck. 
MARISHA: There's no way. 
TRAVIS: 17 with Hope, just to see if there was anything that reveal would show. 
MATT: Nothing seems to reveal around it. You do get a Hope on that though, but-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that or a Tag Team roll because that does a super amount of damage. But I don't think this is a damage roll. 
TRAVIS: This is iron and stone. 
TALIESIN: Group action roll is anybody who succeeds is a plus one to the roll. Anyone who fails is a negative one. But... 
MARISHA: How many more Hope do you need, Ashley? To try again? You have one. 
ASHLEY: Two, I have one more Hope so I need two. 
LIAM: It seems like the group thing is not happening. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: So I'll just declare what I rolled, that's 12, which I'm sure-- 
MATT: That does not succeed. 
ASHLEY: Oh shit. Sorry guys. 
MARISHA: I can give you one more Hope if you want to try again and take these two. 
ASHLEY: No. 
MARISHA: I might be the better one to leave. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: No! 
TRAVIS: That's what I-- 
MARISHA: But you should get-- 
TRAVIS: -- either way, I think. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That was with Hope? 
ASHLEY: Ugh. 
LIAM: Oh, yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: It was. Oh, sorry. 
MARISHA: You got to take him. He's got the necklace. You got to get him out of here. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. 
ASHLEY: Well. Okay, you can't stay alone. 
LAURA: I'll go back to Bunnie. 
ASHLEY: You'll go back to Bunnie? 
LAURA: We got to run the other direction. 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. I'm going to roll again and try to Blink Out. I'm taking Sir Dant√© and Xarlo? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I will play a heartbreaking song as I caress your little froggy face. You got this. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MARISHA: You get a Hope. 
ASHLEY: I'm going to try. Come on. Okay. That's good. That's with Hope. 15, that worked, that works. I had to beat 12. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right, all right. Okay. 
MATT: So you take-- 
ASHLEY: Let's go. So I'm taking Sir Dant√© and Xarlo. 
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) You both apparate on the opposite side. 
LIAM: You stayed behind? 
LAURA: I'm going to bamf over back to the other side. 
MARISHA: I'm going with Sweetpea. 
LAURA: We're going to try to run the other way. 
MARISHA: So, okay, there's a bunch of guards and... 
LAURA: They're stuck right now. 
MARISHA: They're stuck? 
LAURA: So just keep running. 
MARISHA: So, (laughs). 
MATT: As far as you know, you just hear them up the way. 
TRAVIS: That's some "Keystone Cops" shit. We came out, we ran this way, ran this way. 
MATT: Yep. 
TRAVIS: And the two of them went back that way. 
LAURA: How deep is the sludgy water? 
MATT: Right now? It's about maybe just under a foot. 
LAURA: Under a foot. 
MARISHA: As we walk back, as we start getting closer. Do you have a good runway walk? 
LAURA: Mm, mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: All right. I'm just going to need you to work it, okay? 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Work that runway. I'm going to do Hypnotic Shimmer and all the lights in the sewer go dark. Then, but at the top-- 
MATT: There are no lights in the sewer. But magically you create lights. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you see like, (small booms) a roll of spotlights. 
ASHLEY: Awesome. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: Then there's a backlight and I have like a RuPaul figure and we walk down the runway and anyone in front of me is Stunned. They are Stunned, they are gagged. 
MATT: Okay. So I've spent a few of these action tokens from your activities you've been taking to use enough Fear to break a number of these Shadowbinds. So as you turn around, there are a number of guards coming your way, including Mortimer and whoever else is at his side. You cast the spell down that runway and it is a thin space. I need you to roll against-- 
LAURA: Can I help? Can I help? 
MARISHA: "Make a spellcast roll against enemies in front of you within close range." So I would wait till we get close enough. 
LIAM: Work it, Shroomie. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: If you want to spend a Hope and describe how you help her cast this spell. 
LAURA: I help her by taking my core staff and I'm spinning it like a baton and doing a shimmy. 
MATT: (laughs) I love it. 
LAURA: Behind her. 
MATT: Okay, so spend your Hope. 
MARISHA: For some reason there's a wind machine in front of us now and my hair's going crazy. 
LAURA: My cap is just-- 
MARISHA: Your cap is just. (laughs) 
LIAM: It's like Farrah Fawcett. 
MATT: Yep. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a Hope. 
MATT: I should put them up here. 
MARISHA: I'm going to add-- 
MATT: So was that with Hope, you said? 
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a Hope to add... Are these all men? 
MATT: No. 
MARISHA: There aren't-- 
MATT: They are a spread of genders. 
MARISHA: Can I add my experience Face Beat, Body Snatched? 
MARISHA: Can I add my experience Face Beat, Body Snatched? 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: As I have my little runway moment? 
MATT: Sure. 
MARISHA: Okay. (laughter) 
MARISHA: People are like, they're literally stunned. You're helping me? 
LAURA: Uh-huh. 
MARISHA: Okay. Do you roll that or she rolls that? 
MATT: I mean, either can, but I think it's more fun if the player that's helping gets to roll the die. You feel more involved. 
MARISHA: So nervous. So this is going to be plus four. (cries) 
LAURA: Oh no. Is it really bad? 
MARISHA: (screams) Yes, it is. 
LIAM: *It's real bad**. 
MARISHA: It's really bad. 
LIAM: It's Hope. 
MARISHA: I don't think I can do anything about that. Three plus four, seven. Seven. 
LAURA: Plus three. 10. 
MARISHA: 10. 
ASHLEY: Can I also spend a Hope? 
MARISHA: Fear. 
MATT: No, you are way aways. 
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know. 
MATT: So, friends. 
LIAM: Oh boy. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. Goddamn it. 
MATT: The four of you free yourselves from the sewers top side. 
MATT: The four of you free yourselves from the sewers top side. Fingers crossed that your friends will meet you somewhere soon, and safe. Laying low and thinking of the best places to meet, for after all, there's supposed to be a show tonight, a performance. 
MARISHA: I'm going to blow my shit. 
LAURA: Did we Stun them? 
MATT: Meanwhile. 
MARISHA: I don't know if Bunnie would know. She would still just be like. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Ooh, where are they? it's almost elevens. 
MATT: It takes a moment for you to rouse to consciousness. Both of you finding yourselves tied to adjacent chairs-- 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: -- and surrounded by members of the Croatona mafia family, as you are now both prisoners of them. Here in this familiar room where chaos and flame has nearly torn them asunder, you can see amongst the rest of these varying hulking, angry, stoic bodyguards, the massive swollen ribbet arms of Mortimer push past as he sits before the two of you. "All right, now let's start talking truth, why don't we?" That's where we're going to end tonight's episode. (shouting) 
MARISHA, LAURA, and ASHLEY: No! 
MATT: We're going to pick up there next time with the two of you captured. (groaning) 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
LIAM: We never got to see her set! (laughter) 
LIAM: No! 
LAURA: What have we done? 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: That's how it goes. That's how the dice go. 
LIAM: [JENGA] sewer. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Sometimes, you got to do it. Got to do it, though. 
MATT: There's a lot of fun little bits and pieces that can still get weird in here. The night's not over and we'll see where it takes us next time. I also love when shit goes wrong. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: It's to complicate-- 
MARISHA: I love the idea of Matt being like, "I'll play a nice little condensed one-shot." Cut to-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: Fuck it up. 
MATT: That's how it goes, man. That's how it goes. Some sound tactics, some fun weird tactics, and some rough dice rolls, and some interesting moments here. 
TRAVIS: Props on the impromptu dice game. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was fun! 
MATT: I'm going to-- 
TALIESIN: I just want to play the hell out of that. 
MATT: I'm going to mess with that a little bit. I don't know where that came from, but I like it. You're welcome to, if you're watching. 
LAURA: I want to play it. 
MATT: It's so simple and so silly. But nevertheless, that was a lot of fun, guys. I'm excited to jump into wherever this takes us in the future, possibly. So we'll see wherever that leads us next time. But I believe that concludes our Menagerie game for tonight. Thank you all so much for joining us. 
TRAVIS: Live.
