Pre-Show[]
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. (screaming) (clamoring) Shee-- Okay! I guess people are ready to go. (laughter) Well, before we jump into our session for tonight, we do have some announcements to get through, beginning with tonight's sponsor, which is a familiar one, NordVPN. Sam, take it away. 
LAURA: Wait, what? 
SAM: This ad is kind of historical, everybody. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
SAM: NordVPN started sponsoring us almost exactly five years ago tonight. 
TRAVIS: Wow. Oh. 
ASHLEY: Wow. 
SAM: The longest of any sponsor. And when we shot the first ad in 2019, I buried a time capsule to commemorate it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: There's so much dirt on it. 
SAM: So tonight, I'm going to open it up and remember all those NordVPN years we've had. (laughter) Okay. Wow, look at all this stuff. It's my tickets to "Avengers: Endgame." 
TRAVIS: Oh, it does say "Avengers"! 
SAM: Coachella, where Beyoncé performed. The Fyre Festival. The Fyre Festival, I had the best food ever there, guys. (laughter) This is my Hot Girl summer poster. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You spent $5,000 there? 
SAM: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
SAM: The food was so good. 
MATT: Oh my-- 
SAM: Let's see here. 
LIAM: And you were ripped at that moment. 
SAM: I know. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
SAM: It was 2019. Oh god! This, my signed copy of the movie musical "Cats." (laughter) Signed by Taylor Swift. (laughter) Let's see here. Oh, yep, yep. Here's my fraudulent USC college application, and my diploma. I paid $50,000 just to get in. (clamoring) 
TRAVIS: Were you on the rowing team? 
SAM: No, the feds didn't catch me. Okay, so it's all good. It's my bottle cap from the bottle cap challenge. I shot the bottle cap challenge, too. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Wait, on VHS? 
MARISHA: Oh wow, VHS. 
LIAM: You shot it on VHS. 
SAM: It was 2019, guys. (laughter) Check out this cast photo of us from 2019. 
LAURA: Wow. 
ALL: Oh. (laughter) 
LAURA: Is that "Friends"? 
MARISHA: Yes. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Wait. Why does the--? (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wait. It's all Sam? 
LAURA: Everybody on there? 
ASHLEY: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: No. 
TALIESIN: No. 
LAURA: Wait. Who's who? 
LIAM: Am I just a disembodied head floating--? 
TALIESIN: No, no, no. There's a thing there. 
MATT: That is terrifying. 
SAM: Robbie, you have a line. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: No, I don't! Wow! You guys looked crazy young in 2019. (laughter) 
SAM: And we still do, Robbie. We still do. (laughter) Oh, here's my-- This is my travel itinerary. My travel itinerary for that big Asia trip I was going to take in March of 2020. 
MARISHA: Oh. 
SAM: Didn't work out. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, you know. 
SAM: Oh, somebody's keys? 
TALIESIN: Oh, oh, oh, those are mine. Those are mine. I can finally stop blocking those spaces in the parking lot. 
SAM: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
ASHLEY: This is so detailed-- 
TRAVIS: It says Vietnam. 
ASHLEY: -- you guys. (laughter) 
SAM: Oh, and it looks-- I think I left a meatball sub? 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MARISHA: Oh. (horrified yelling) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: No, no, no. Don't. 
LAURA: That's disgusting! (screaming) (clamoring) 
ASHLEY: What are you doing? 
TALIESIN, ROBBIE, and TRAVIS: No! 
SAM: (mouth full) It's pretty good. 
LAURA: No, gross! 
SAM: It's not bad. It's not bad. Oh, here's what I was looking for. It's the ad I wrote for NordVPN. 
LAURA: That's gross. 
MATT: I hate it. 
LAURA: Gross. 
ASHLEY: That makes me want to throw up. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: My stomach hurt. 
SAM: I have to drink now so I can do the ad. Actually, somebody else read it. (chuckling) 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
LIAM: Here's what Sam was looking for. 
LAURA: What? No, wait. 
ASHLEY: "It's the ad that I wrote for NordVPN." 
LAURA: He already said that part. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
TRAVIS: Just in case you didn't renew your sponsorship-- 
LAURA: "I, Sam Riegel--" 
TRAVIS: -- with us in five full years. 
LAURA: "-- predict that NordVPN will still be our sponsor in 2024. That they'll be the fastest VPN on the planet. Offering amazing features like scanning dark websites, giving users--" 
SAM: Giving users advanced notice of dangers so they can secure valuable accounts. 
MARISHA: Vulnerable accounts. 
SAM: Vulnerable accounts. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
SAM: (coughs) 
TALIESIN: I can smell your breath. 
TRAVIS: "And most important, NordVPN will be able to foil scams and malware with threat protection, providing internet connection wherever you travel and save you money on roaming fees." He's dying. "I predict that you'll be able to grant the exclusive NordVPN deal at nordvpn.com/criticalrole and get four extra months." 
SAM: Try it with a 30-day money back guarantee. 
LIAM: So glad you're still not dead. You predicted all that in 2019? 
SAM: Yeah, I also predicted that Drake will beat Kendrick in a bitter rap battle. I got that one wrong. 
MARISHA: Wow. 
SAM: Matt, hack to you. 
MATT: Yeah, pretty extensively. 
SAM: (coughing) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: God! You didn't even-- This is fucking-- 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: Instantaneous karma. 
ASHLEY: Get that out of here. 
SAM: This'll help. 
ALL: (yelling) No! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Leave it alone! 
TALIESIN: Drop it. Drop it. 
TRAVIS: Oh, it smells. 
TALIESIN: No, not in there. We're going to make that go entirely away. 
MARISHA: It's making your lips blue. He took the-- aw. 
TALIESIN: Oh god. 
MARISHA: Why're your hands blue? 
LIAM: You survived everything-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: You have no-- 
TRAVIS: (shrieks) You drank out of the airplane toilet. 
LAURA: Oh! Get it out! No. Your mouth is turning blue. 
MARISHA: Your mouth is-- 
MATT: All right. 
MARISHA: How much-- 
MATT: So-- (chuckles) 
LIAM: He survived everything he did this year, only for the sponsors to take him out. 
ASHLEY: Gross. 
MARISHA: Did-- Did they just put pure blue food coloring on there without diluting it? 
SAM: Possibly. 
MARISHA: I think that's what happened. 
MATT: Hey, Laura, you got some announcements. 
LAURA: I do. 
TRAVIS: At least it's not that red dye 40. 
LAURA: Speaking of Critmas--? 
ASHLEY: Did we-- 
LAURA: Did we talk about it? 
ASHLEY: I don't know. (laughter) 
LAURA: Our annual Critmas sale is happening right now! (cheering) 
LAURA: In all of our Crit Role online shops, through December 9th-uh. Get awesome deals on apparel, game accessories, and stocking stuffers for all your holiday shopping, or even for your own wishlist. While you're shopping, don't forget to check out our new cozy merch like this, (snaps) Lavish Chateau bathrobe. 
TRAVIS: Good snap. Good snap. 
ASHLEY: Okay, it's so soft. 
LAURA: It's so soft. Look, look at this. 
MATT: I want this so bad. 
MARISHA: Oh, this supposed to be like a hotel-- 
LAURA: It's a hotel bathrobe from the Lavish Chateau. It's got this amazing-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, look at it. 
LAURA: -- artwork here by Jordyn Torrence. 
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. 
TRAVIS: Where's the embroidery? What does it say? 
LAURA: It's right there. It's so great. 
MATT: That's super cute. 
SAM: What does it say? 
LAURA: You can just live out your Lavish Chateau dreams. It says "The Lavish Chateau Inn and Entertainment, Nicodranas, Exandria." And we're not showing it, but we also have pajamas that match the bathrobe. So go check it out. 
ASHLEY: This is so cozy. 
LAURA: Plus! Oh my god, there's so many things I get to say today. Plus, it's a fantasy come true. (Jester) On July 21st, 2025, you'll finally be able to read-- 
LIAM: (trumpet fanfare) 
LAURA: -- "Tusk Love." (laughter) 
LAURA: Which is being published by our friends at Penguin Random House in print, digital, and audio formats. Oh my gosh, who's going to read this? 
LIAM: Give me that good, good smut. 
TRAVIS: There can only be one. 
ROBBIE: No! (laughter) Anything but that! 
LAURA: This steamy novel is written by Thea Guanzon and the covers illustrated by Erion Makuo. I'm very excited about it. Learn more and pre-order your copy at criticalrolebooks.com. 
ASHLEY: That better be smutty. 
LIAM: Smut alert. 
LAURA: Oh, Oskar. 
ASHLEY: It's got pockets! 
MATT: It is the scariest-- 
LAURA: Yeah. It's got pockets! 
MATT: -- example of manifestation. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: You did this. 
ASHLEY: This is so comfortable. 
LIAM: As it should be. 
MARISHA: As it should be. 
LIAM: We're clear. We're not making enough smut, if I'm being honest. We'll get to work on that. 
ASHLEY: I concur with you. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. Here, here. 
ASHLEY: As a smut lover-- 
LAURA: Agreed. 
ASHLEY: We need more. 
MATT: 2025. Make more smut. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Marisha, you got some announcements. 
MARISHA: You guys-- 
TALIESIN: Smut. 
MARISHA: Smut. (laughter) 
LIAM: That's it. 
MARISHA: You might be able to see something smutty at one of our live shows. (cheering) 
MARISHA: Tickets are on sale right now for all five of our 10-year anniversary live shows. We're going to be back in Chicago in April, then Sydney and Melbourne in June, Indianapolis once again in August, and then rounding out the year in New York City in October, for Fjord and Jester's wedding, which will surely be a smutty time. 
LAURA: (Jester) It will be so smutty, you just wait. 
TRAVIS: If we survive. 
LAURA: I know! Seriously, what are we going to do if we die? 
TRAVIS: I don't know, but it'll be funny. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: Well-- 
MARISHA: That's something I've mentioned. 
MATT: It'll be a very short wedding. 
MARISHA: For tickets. 
TALIESIN: "Wedding at Bernie's." 
LIAM: Wedding or funeral? 
TALIESIN: "Wedding at Bernie's." There we go. 
MATT: "Wedding at Bernie's." (laughter) 
LIAM: I do. 
MARISHA: For tickets and all the details, head over to critrole.com/events. 
MATT: The prequel wedding. It happened right before the events at the end of Campaign 3. 
LIAM: Can Caduceus Animate Dead? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: There we go. (laughter) 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Also, on the Darrington-- 
MARISHA: Speaking of Critmas-- 
MATT: Speaking of Critmas-- (laughter) 
MATT: I want you all-- (laughter) 
MATT: Behold, "Queen by Midnight: Quarter Past." (cheering) 
MATT: Our wonderful producer and friend, Kyle Shire's latest Darrington Press creation. It is a standalone expansion to "Queen by Midnight." (cheering) 
MATT: There he is! There he is! (cheering) 
MATT: You gorgeous man! 
LAURA: Yaas, Queen. 
ASHLEY: Yaas, "Queen by Midnight." 
MATT: This is a standalone expansion for "Queen by Midnight" with new two-player rules, tons of new bizarre cards, and four new princesses with a unique strategies. 
SAM: Stragedies. 
MATT: Sorry. It could be tragic tradegies, you don't know, such as the Diva of the 12 Tides, Elise LeKraken, who wantonly banishes cards to her glorious grotto, growing and hoarding its power before unleashing it upon all of her foes. 
ASHLEY: LeKraken? 
MATT: She's a badass. 
ASHLEY: That's so good. 
MATT: You can buy "Queen by Midnight: Quarter Past" now at your friendly local game stores, Darrington Press Guild stores, where you'll find foil versions of all these four princesses' ultimate cards, and select Critical Role shops. I believe that concludes our announcements. 
MARISHA: Yes! 
MATT: So if Sam is still alive from his choking over there from-- 
SAM: We're good. 
TRAVIS: We'll get the defibrillator out. 
MATT: We'll make it work. I believe it's time to jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role. (cheering)

Part I[]
MATT: And welcome back. So last we left off, the Mighty Nein and Bells Hells had trekked to Ruidus and had set up themselves at the point of plan divergence towards the core and the Weave Mind. Meanwhile, we came back to Vox Machina that were helming the assault on the Malleus Key itself, and as such, drawing attention away from their more subtle plan within the depths of the red, ruddy moon. They gathered their forces, found old friends who are now centaurs, then prepared themselves in Vasselheim, gathered allies, bolstered themselves, and joining a number of other skyships that descended after the initial beginnings of the assault, landed within the middle of the Tishtan Excavation site, the massive, ancient stronghold now risen through the psychic powers of the Weave Mind broken and standing frightening. They battled their way through the core of where they had landed, heading towards where the Malleus Key currently stood. We left off just as they began to find the core of their goal. Everybody, if you'd like to come back to the table, please. 
TRAVIS: No thanks! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm cool. 
SAM: Ooh, la la. Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh, it's there! 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
TRAVIS: It's there, it's there, it's there! 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: We're danger close. We're danger close. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MARISHA: What? 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Wow! 
TRAVIS: Wow, Matt. What the hell, dude? 
LAURA: Oh man, oh man. 
SAM: Speaking of Critmas-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
TALIESIN: You know-- 
MATT: So-- 
TALIESIN: What a place to TPK. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
MATT: This was the site that you had gained eyes on as you began to approach on that far end. 
LAURA: Oh, there it is. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: So you haven't engaged yet. 
TRAVIS: This is dope. 
MATT: But you are on the cusp of it. 
SAM: Where are we? 
ASHLEY: We're over there? 
TRAVIS: Right here. 
SAM: Here? 
TALIESIN: We're over here. 
TALIESIN: Look at us. We're adorable. 
MATT: So that all being the case-- 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: -- Vox Machina, what would you like to do? 
LIAM: I'm going to jump in here, and seeing how close we are as a player and as Lieve'tel, she, right where she is is going to draw a blade and drag it through her hand and blood is going to start to drip down from on top of this giant white raven she's riding on. It falls three or four feet down and evaporates back up to her hand and a gout of black shadow expands out in every direction as she casts the spell Holy Aura. 
SAM: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Ooh. 
TRAVIS: Start things off with a bang. 
LIAM: Which is real good for us, but I don't have my shit open. 
MATT: Is it concentration? 
LIAM: Yes, Bless drops on-- 
MATT: Okay, the Bless has faded. 
LIAM: -- Keyleth. 
MATT: Taliesin, if you could take the Bless off of that there, thank you. 
ROBBIE: That looks difficult. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, it's got a little, she's got a little thing. Hold on. 
LAURA: Ah! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, hilarious. Carry on. 
MATT: No worries. 
LIAM: So, Holy Aura. "Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 30-foot radius," so that should hit Vex'ahlia a little higher and everyone down below. 
LAURA: Down below. 
LIAM: "Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast a spell, shed dim light in a five-foot radius. You have advantage on all saving throws and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until this spell ends." 
SAM: How long does it-- 
LIAM: One minute. 
SAM: Oh shit! Okay, we don't have time to do anything. 
MATT: You also now are each individually glowing, so any sense of subtlety-- 
SAM: I just said I was going to-- (laughs) 
MATT: You're a cluster of candles at the moment. But in this moment, while you cast that spell, what's everyone else doing? 
MARISHA: Sorry, it gives attack, it gives advantage on what? 
MATT: All of your saving throws. 
LIAM: All saving throws and-- 
MATT: Attacks against you have disadvantage. 
MARISHA: Okay. Saving-- 
TRAVIS: Attacks against us have disadvantage. 
MARISHA: -- throws. 
LAURA: Then, do we have to stay within 30 feet of you or it's constant now that-- 
LIAM: No, it's constant. 
LAURA: -- we were in its cast? 
LIAM: But DM, if another player, if I, in my nerves stepped over Sam talking-- 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: -- I'll hold off on that. 
MATT: Okay, that's okay. 
LIAM: I don't want to want to step on his roleplaying. 
SAM: No, the only thing I was going to do is I was going to see if there's any place for us to duck in for a second and figure out what the fuck we're doing before just running in. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, surveil. 
SAM: Yeah, are we near anything that's hideable? 
MATT: I mean, there are broken bits of ruins. All around you, there are this massive wall there you could try and duck behind. 
MARISHA: This situation? 
MATT: Correct. There are other soldiers and sounds of battle happening on all sides so you're not certain if any hiding's going to last for a prolonged period of time. 
SAM: Sure. 
LIAM: Did we run-- 
TRAVIS: But out to each edge you can hear and see skirmishes in 360 degrees? 
MATT: Oh, entirely, and the massive dust storm that has consumed the sky pretty much above and past this height area, you can still see shadows shifting and flying through above where you can't quite make out the shape, but moving by quickly. 
LIAM: I'm sorry, would you say, this isn't the exact position, then, where we finished and everyone caught up to it on the last map, in the last game. Did we traverse some ground to get here? 
MATT: A very brief bit of ground. You'd be a little bit further off that way. For the sake of not connecting them directly, there's another 30 or 40 feet, and if the people who are ahead, which would've been you-- 
LIAM: Keyleth. 
MATT: -- Keyleth, Grog, and with the speed of the broom, probably Vex'ahlia, you could either have gone on ahead or you would've waited for the rest of the group to catch up to you. That's a choice I'll allow you to decide right now. 
LIAM: Sorry, Sam, I just assumed because we were, that's what I thought we were in the same place and just people were-- 
SAM: Sure, sure, sure. 
LIAM: -- blasting us. So I didn't feel like we were-- But I want Sam to have that roleplay. 
MATT: That's okay. Your intent is to cast that when the time happens. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So the folks that are ahead, are you waiting for the rest of the group, or are you gaining the-- utilizing the momentum to come forward? Up to you. 
LIAM: I think it would rely on if I could tell in this moment with my perception check of a natural 20-- 
SAM: (laughs) 
LIAM: -- if-- 
ROBBIE and LAURA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: So casually said. 
LIAM: -- if Lieve'tel can tell if they are noticed already in the open hovering in space, or if it's so chaotic that that's not knowable. 
MATT: Perception 20. I mean, you all have definitely made a splash when you landed. Most of the combatants that have taken notice of you are currently engaged in other skirmishes, so you're not unknown, but the people that have seen you at the moment are currently engaged elsewhere. You're not sure for how long. 
LIAM: That was natural 20 boosted to 30 with her stats. 
SAM: Jesus. 
MATT: Right. 
LIAM: Says that it's not clear. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You are not stealthed. You are not unnoticed. 
LIAM: Right, it's just for-- 
MATT: You have a, yeah. The people that are around your target location have not yet noticed you. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Others that have, are currently engaged, your uncertain for how long. So you have a moment or a few. 
LAURA: It's a fucking battle. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You're in the middle of a field and you have a brief breath in the middle of the massive fight is where you're at. 
LIAM: So then we're rewinding even five seconds earlier, I would say that Lieve'tel, knowing that she wanted to do this getting here, would wait for people to catch up. 
MATT: Okay, so Lieve'tel's waiting. 
LAURA: That tracks. 
SAM: That tracks. 
MATT: Vex'ahlia, are you waiting or are you moving ahead? 
LAURA: I would've pulled up, Lieve'tel was ahead of me, I would've pulled up if I saw her stopping and tried to look ahead and see if I can spot the orb. 
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check for me. 
LAURA: I don't have as good of perception. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. 
LAURA: 23. 
MATT: 23 isn't bad. I mean, the Malleus Key in itself, which this is the first time that you've seen it outside of scrying rituals that have helped you try and for the brief time before they got dispelled, try and scope out the location. This massive, ancient construct that has been retrofitted with all manner of modern mage tech. At a glance, you do not see an orb. All you see is the extremely bright, almost eye-harming red glow at the top where the Bloody Bridge itself is currently firing up to the red moon, and you can see the glowing specter of shapes descending, who knows what distance along that beam atop. 
LAURA: Coming down? 
MATT: Seems that way. From where you stand right now, you cannot see an orb, but you can see there are all manner of magitech bits of glowing around its base. There are veins carved through it, almost like arcane circuitry that pulse and glow and move around. Arcana is not your specialty, so at the moment you cannot see, but you get the sense that if it exists in there, it's probably connected in some way to the rest of this. 
LAURA: Okay. 
LIAM: The only one of us who's seen this before is Keyleth. 
MATT: That is correct. 
LAURA: Then I would pull up and wait for Keyleth. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I am so nervous. 
MATT: So Vex is waiting. Keyleth, Grog, what are you doing while the rest catch up? 
TRAVIS: (panting and grunting) Let's fucking do this! 
MARISHA: Hang on, wait, wait, wait, wait. We should probably chat about this really quick. 
TRAVIS: Chat? 
MATT: You say gravelly as your earth elemental form. 
MARISHA: (gravelly) We should probably chat about this. (laughter) 
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (knowing grunts) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: You're right, hold on. I've been doing this thing all normal-sized. (huffs and licks) (moans) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (slams) I'll slam my giant stone knuckles together and cast Enlarge. 
MATT: Okay, you got it. So hand me Grog's mini there. 
TRAVIS: I didn't do that the whole last fight. 
MATT: Replace him with this boy. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! (awed noises) 
ASHLEY: Big boy! 
TRAVIS: (thud) Oh sorry. Damn, that's a beefy model! 
MATT: That's Enlarge, baby. 
TRAVIS: I'll put my back up against the building. 
MATT: Up against the building. 
TRAVIS: (chuckling) What are we waiting for? Oh, the others. This is strategy. 
MARISHA: We should wait for all the others. 
TALIESIN: A bit of a conversation. 
MARISHA: Would I remember and have knowledge of where the Vax orb is? 
TRAVIS: ♪ Do you remember ♪ 
MARISHA: Is he-- (laughter) 
MARISHA: Would it be hidden in that tower, or has it since moved? Have they built around it? 
TRAVIS: When you were getting throttled by Otohan Thull? 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: That's the thing. 
LAURA: That's true. 
MATT: You were carved within an inch of your life. I would say-- 
TRAVIS: Thanksgiving turkey. 
MATT: I would say make a perception check with disadvantage to see if you are able to notice it in the moment to recall it now. 
MARISHA: Okay. Disadvantage? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: You said a perception check. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: 16. 
MATT: 16. You know that it exists higher up on the tower, but you're not certain of the specific location. Also, do recall, you were given some instruction as the order of operations to free him, meaning-- 
MARISHA: I remember that. What was I told? 
MATT: There was something else that needed to be removed first. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: The bacon. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: The strange arcane relic. 
MARISHA: The strange arcane relic. 
LAURA: The beacon. 
MARISHA: The beacon. 
LAURA: The beacon had to be removed. 
MARISHA: The beacon has to be removed. 
TRAVIS: Also known as the bacon. 
LAURA: I see. 
TALIESIN: The Sard. 
LAURA: I was thinking pocket bacon, like Beau's bacon. 
MATT: This was discussed last time, so I just want to make sure you were reminded. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
SAM: We know that, Matt. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Of course we know. 
MATT: You knew this. 
TRAVIS: We would never do anything out of order. 
LAURA: We would not forget that. 
MATT: Of course. 
TRAVIS: Or suffer the consequences for doing so. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: I'm going to write it down. 
LIAM: Piggybacking on their-- 
LAURA: Remove beacon. 
LIAM: -- perception checks, did they see anything glowy, like bacon? 
MATT: Huh? Based on the perception checks, you are too far to have acknowledged anything specific. 
LAURA: We're too far! 
LIAM: Understood. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: So this is the best you can ascertain from this distance and with your capability. 
MARISHA: I'm wondering-- 
LAURA: We have to move quickly before more of these Ruidus-- 
MATT: (soaring whoosh) Something heavy and dark seems to cruise through the sky, this loud, impossibly bassy buzzing sound this loud, impossibly bassy buzzing sound (bass tone resonating) arcs through the dust above you and then out of sight and out of earshot. 
SAM: Have the others, have we all caught up at this point, or are we still-- 
MATT: At this point, the slowest amongst you being probably Pike on foot-- 
ASHLEY: Hey! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Most careful. 
MATT: Of course, of course. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah, Percy and Pike being the slowest of the crew, based on the fact that you are both elemental and can glide or cruise along in your flame form. But you all essentially gather up in that moment and you have a beat before-- 
SAM: (coconuts clacking) 
MATT: -- you're fairly certain whatever's nearby is going to begin to descend upon you. 
SAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Well wait, could we see what's-- What do you mean? The (buzzing)? 
MATT: No, that-- 
LAURA: We're freaking out. 
MATT: That was just (arcing whoosh). It went off in the storm. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: That's just a comet. Has nothing to do with anything. 
ROBBIE: Atmosphere, atmosphere. 
MARISHA: I know. 
ROBBIE: It's not going to get ya. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: (explosion launching) 
TALIESIN: Do we have a-- Oh. 
MATT: A flash of light of some arcane bolt seems to streak through and blast something just beyond the exterior, the perimeter of the cloud and you see a (exploding) and you hear the crashing of something heavy in the distance. 
MARISHA: I'm wondering if we should have a stealth team or a team that tries to go straight to dislodge the beacon, while-- 
SAM: While another team stealths around, a distraction team and a-- 
MARISHA: Like a distraction team and an infiltration team. 
SAM: -- infiltration team? 
MATT: That tower begins to light up. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MATT: Pulse with white and then-- 
LAURA: Why is that lighting up? 
MATT: -- fires off a-- 
SAM: Who's on which? 
MATT: -- bursting a wave of translucent white light, not unlike the dispel towers that you had disabled before. 
TRAVIS: I call dibs on team distraction. 
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, probably the elemental, too, yeah. 
MARISHA: Well, I can Earth Glide underneath all of this and make a beeline straight for the tower. 
SAM: I could Dimension Door to it. 
LAURA: All right. 
TALIESIN: I could create some chaos in general, and I don't need to be anywhere near it. 
SAM: So-- 
LIAM: I'm going to come with you two. 
LAURA: You two infiltrate. 
MARISHA: Come with us. 
SAM: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Hey, wait, wait. Before we go. Hey, guys, we're saving the world again. 
SAM: We are. 
TRAVIS: What would they do without us? 
SAM: I don't know. 
MARISHA: Honestly, I don't know. 
SAM: We're the best. 
TALIESIN: I'm so tired. 
ASHLEY: Let's do it again. 
MARISHA: Feels good. Okay. 
SAM: Before we go, I'm going to turn to Keyleth and say: Real quick, I know this is unanswerable, but if it comes down to it and there's a choice between leaving Vax like this or destroying him, which would you rather have him be? 
TRAVIS: Whoa, heavy shit, man. 
LAURA: Leave him like this. 
TALIESIN: Leave him like this-- We could find a way to-- 
TALIESIN: -- because we can figure it the fuck out. 
LAURA: -- save him afterwards. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Don't destroy him. 
TALIESIN: We're clever. 
SAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: We'll figure it out. Put him in the fridge box. 
LAURA: Keyleth? 
TRAVIS: Oh, I do have it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I hate the idea of him being stuck like that. 
SAM: You want him back, right? 
MARISHA: Of course. 
TALIESIN: Worst case, we'll fix it. 
MARISHA: I'm not hoping on it, though. 
SAM: Sure. 
MARISHA: I've written that off. But if it's possible-- 
MATT: (whooshes) Two flashes arrive and you watch as two more-- 
TALIESIN: It might be time to move. 
LAURA: Shit, go. 
SAM: All right, let's move. 
MARISHA: Okay, so it's me, Scanlan, and Lieve'tel trying to get to the beacon? 
LIAM: It won't last, I mean, if we're stealthing, that's going to be longer than a-- 
LAURA: But can you do it to some of us and then the stealth team goes without the light on them? 
SAM: Oh, we have to stay together for you thing to work? 
TALIESIN: Also, can we take a second to place ourselves before initiative or no? 
LIAM: Sorry. 
MATT: You're essentially in that corner. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so there's no sneaking around beforehand. 
MATT: If you want to try and continue around this path and then those who are moving will make a communal stealth check, yes. 
TALIESIN: We are-- 
MARISHA: Sneaking over there? It's not that far. 
TALIESIN: We're earring locked, anyway, if I recall, or no? Okay, good. 
MARISHA: That's not going to be 10 rounds to get over there. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to start making my way unless anyone has an objection. 
MATT: ♪ Makin' my ♪ 
TRAVIS: No objections, I'm just going to start skipping. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to wait 'til anybody other than Grog has an objection. 
MARISHA: No. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
SAM: (like Phoenix Wright) No objection! 
MARISHA: Did you cast the thing? 
MATT: Grog skips out into the open to the field-- 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
MATT: Which will require an initiative roll. 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go. 
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. They were going to do the stealth stuff. Do your stealth stuff. 
TALIESIN: I'm just trying to get here. 
MATT: All right, I'd like for you to make a stealth check. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LIAM: Before anyone moves, I will do the whole malarkey that I said earlier. 
MATT: The Holy Aura. 
LIAM: It's dim light, it's not bright light, so we are not shining like-- 
MATT: Right. 
LIAM: -- flashlights. 
MATT: Right, but-- 
LIAM: Well, we're in a war zone, like lasers are firing around us, right? 
MATT: Right, yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: You're not blazing beacons, but you are walking candles, which means shadowy alcoves, you're going to be like a bunch of lanterns walking along. 
LAURA: Got it. 
TALIESIN: 21. 
SAM: Can you turn invisible? Can I turn invisible still? Will it show through that? 
LIAM: If you're invisible, you'll be invisible. 
SAM: Okay, good, good, good. 
MARISHA: I am going to cast Freedom of Movement. 
TALIESIN: Perfect. 
MARISHA: On both myself and Scanlan. 
SAM: Whoa, excuse me. 
LAURA: Nice. 
MARISHA: So-- 
SAM: (gravelly) Freedom of Movement. 
MARISHA: You're unaffected by difficult terrain, you can't be paralyzed or restrained. 
SAM: Amazing. 
LIAM: Everybody, that was advantage on all saves and disadvantage from enemies attacking, they have disadvantage attacking you. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: Wow. 
TALIESIN: Then before initiative starts, I've got one action, but I'm waiting until it seems like everything is starting. 
MATT: Well, you rolled your stealth check. Anybody else stealthing up at Percy, or--? 
TALIESIN: Anybody else? Anybody else? 
TRAVIS: Is anybody else stealthing with Percy? 
TALIESIN: Children? 
MARISHA: I'll come around with Percy. 
MATT: Make a stealth check using the physical attributes of your earth elemental. 
MARISHA: Well, I wanted-- Can I dip down and earth glide-- 
LIAM: I'm following to the tower. 
MARISHA: -- to where he is? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: And popped back up? 
MATT: You can, but it's still a stealth check to pop back up without drawing attention with the noise and movement. 
MARISHA: Okay. What am I-- Just a stealth check? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: It's okay, 13. 
MATT: 13, got it. Go ahead and hand me the earth element right there and set it next to these rocks there in that corner. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, Tiny. 
MATT: There we go. All righty. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Anybody else heading off in that direction? 
LIAM: I'm going on Team Malleus Key, so me riding this raven is gliding down. 
TRAVIS: Team going to lose. Ha! 
MATT: Around that way? 
LIAM: Yeah, and I think that-- 
MARISHA: We're on the same team, Grog. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, it's not a competition, you're right. 
LIAM: I will step off-- 
MARISHA: We're working together; it's a co-op game. 
LIAM: -- the giant three- headed raven and follow on foot. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: We're adventurers. 
LIAM: I won't tell it to leave. It does what it wants. 
MATT: Could you hand me leave Lieve'tel and the platform there? Thank you. 
LAURA: Oh yeah. I'm lit up with a bright light, anyway. I can't go stealth, so I'm-- I've got the love of the Dawnfather on me. 
MATT: So Lieve'tel has-- 
TRAVIS: The love of the Dawnfather. 
MATT: -- behind as your summoned ally. 
TALIESIN: I want to be as far as--. 
MATT: Wonderful little Marge hair I take off there remains for the moment. 
LIAM: I got a 17 on stealth. 
MATT: 17 on stealth, all right. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to I guess since we're forced-- 
MATT: Before we get to you-- 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I know. Sorry. 
MATT: I know you're eager. 
TRAVIS: Percy's going to work solo. This motherfucker. I love it. 
MATT: I'm making sure everyone else has-- 
TALIESIN: Has a turn, yeah. 
MATT: Anybody else coming up on the front or is everyone staying off that side there? 
TRAVIS: What're you doing, Tiny? 
ASHLEY: I know. We're both lit up. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Right? 
LAURA: Yeah, I'm-- 
MATT: You're all lit up. 
TALIESIN: We're all lit up. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: You all-- 
LAURA: No, but I'm in lit up with a bright light. 
TRAVIS: I'm pretty lit. 
MATT: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, because you have the-- 
MATT: You are a fiery beacon because of your blessing-- 
LAURA: Of the Dawnfather. 
MATT: -- of the Dawnfather. 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I'm not going stealth. I'm just going to try to distract-- 
MATT: The minute you to move out from cover there, you're likely going to be noticed. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I got no guards to hold me down. ♪ 
TALIESIN: Wow. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
SAM: I'm going to, instead of stealthing slowly across the battlefield, I'm going to Dimension Door right back behind that tent. 
MATT: Over here? 
TRAVIS: Next to him? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: On the backside of it? 
SAM: On the back side of it. 
MATT: Get me the Centaurlan-- 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
MATT: If you don't mind. Scantar, whatever you want to call it. 
SAM: (neighs) 
MATT: All right, and you are in the back over there. 
MARISHA: Look at this giant Grog. It's so cool. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: From where I am, can I see this guy over here? 
MATT: Here? Yeah, you can. 
LAURA: Yeah, now with Sharpshooter, I don't have long distance disadvantage and my Fenthras bow can shoot 600 feet. 
MATT: Then yeah, that would do it. 
ASHLEY: Jeez! 
MARISHA and ROBBIE: 600? 
SAM: One, two, three, four, five. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Hmm, yep. 
SAM: Six, seven, eight, nine, 10. 
TALIESIN: We have a lot of range, the two of us. 
TRAVIS: How many yards is 600 feet. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: (wheezes) 
LIAM: Can you sing, though? 
MARISHA: Well, divide it by three. 
SAM: 200. 
TRAVIS: Two football fields. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Two football fields. 
MATT: Yeah, without disadvantage, I love it. 
TALIESIN: Bad News is 800. 
MATT: Hey, to be fair, you also just grew to the size of a massive ogre. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
LAURA: It's Like my thing. 
MATT: Exactly. 
LAURA: It's what I can do. 
MATT: Yeah, you got that. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: In fact, in that case, I'm going to aim right in the middle of all these fuckers right here. 
TALIESIN: (gasps) Oh, I know what you're going to do. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to load my bow up with an explosive arrow. 
MARISHA: Let's go. 
MARISHA: All right, so you pull one of-- 
LAURA: Thank you, darling. 
MATT: One of the Percy specials. 
MARISHA: Boom, boom. 
MATT: Go ahead and pull back the arrow. 
LAURA: As soon as I see them moving-- (arrow loosing) 
MATT: Okay, so you release the arrow simultaneously with Keyleth being noticed from this Thought Eater right here that is stationed perimeter to this. So you and the Thought Eater will both have an action simultaneously and then we'll roll initiative. 
LAURA: Okay, I'm aiming at this guy next to the stair, one of the ones that just came down. 
MATT: Right there? 
LAURA: The one on the other side so that I can hopefully get this guy, too. It's 15-feet radius. 
MATT: Okay, it's a 15-foot radius. Yes. 
LAURA: So-- I'm going to light up the blazing bowstring. 
MATT: (crackling) All right, let's go, and Grog? 
TRAVIS: If I see Vex getting ready to kick things off, then can I begin my jaunty skip? 
MATT: You can indeed. 
TALIESIN: I would love to let go of one of my toys that's been wound four times for 60 feet. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: What toy are you dropping? 
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm dropping a little windup toy that weirdly looks like Professor Anders, if you remember him. It's like a little ball and there's a body of Professor Anders on it trying to hold a big test tube of green liquid. 
TRAVIS: I love that. 
SAM: How big is this? 
TALIESIN: It's about that big. 
LAURA: I'm loading myself up with a-- 
SAM: It's sort of waddling? 
TALIESIN: He's holding, going-- (grunting) 
TRAVIS: Green liquid. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, and he moves forward a little robotic-- 
SAM: Does he have a catchphrase he says as he moves? 
TALIESIN: It's a windup toy, man. 
MATT: Great, I'll use this as your windup toy. Which direction are you placing it? 
TALIESIN: Okay, that or I have a bead, too. 
MATT: This one actually looks like a little piece of-- 
TALIESIN: I'm heading right into that group that's right over there, right in front of those. 
MATT: You're setting it right there? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Going this way? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, and it should take 15 feet and it's-- 
TRAVIS: Does it have a windup mechanism? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: I'm loading myself up-- 
TRAVIS: Metal or wood? 
LAURA: -- with Hail of Thorns as well. 
TALIESIN: Metal. 
LAURA: Because that's a bonus action. 
MATT: You what? 
LAURA: Hail of Thorns I'm also casting on myself for this. 
MATT: You got it. All right. I'm setting this is as the direction it's traveling. 
TALIESIN: Awesome. 
MATT: So it'll continue that way. All right. 
ASHLEY: I am going to use my Blessing of Everlight and I'm going to (wings whooshing). 
LAURA: That's a 3rd-level, though. 
ASHLEY: Wings sprout out. 
MATT: You got it. Your wings emerge, beautiful, golden. Your feathers expand this angelic figure that is Pike Trickfoot. 
TRAVIS: Get ya some! 
ASHLEY: Ooh, stretch them out, stretch them out. 
MARISHA: Matt? 
MATT: Yes. 
MARISHA: At the end of last game, I had Call Lightning up, which lasts for 10 minutes. 
MATT: Yeah, you still have it up. 
MARISHA: So it would still be up. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Now, you have concentration on. 
MATT: Everyone with concentration-- 
MARISHA: I do. 
MATT: -- when you take damage, help me remember to-- 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: See if that arrives or not. 
MARISHA: I'm a War Caster, but yes. 
MATT: Yeah, no worries. 
TALIESIN: Oh no. 
MATT: All right, so starting this off. Simultaneous runs here, you charge out, making yourself a big target, shooting gallery style. Vex. 
LAURA: Hail of Thorns not happening. Nothing's within five feet of that guy and I would see that, right? 
MATT: Correct. Yeah, they're all about ten feet. 
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going with the explosive. 
MATT: All right, cool. So you blazing bowstring fire up on your bow and release the explosive arrow. (arrow whooshing) 
LAURA: (whispers) 20. Nat 20. (cheering) 
MATT: Natural 20? 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: I love that she whispered it, too. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Oh, I just got goosebumps. 
TALIESIN: This is how you begin. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Come on. 
TALIESIN: Oh. 
MATT: All right. Well, that definitely hits. So roll the damage for the arrow and the bowstring, which is-- 
ASHLEY: Come on, baby. 
MATT: -- the dice are doubled on those first. 
LAURA: Plus a sneak attack. 
MATT: Technically, yeah. Because he wasn't aware you were there. So yeah, let's go. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Take your time. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
LAURA: Okay. Okay, wait. 
MARISHA: Have to name that arrow-- 
LAURA: Let me figure out what I'm doing. 
MARISHA: -- "How We Do It." 
LAURA: That's-- 
MARISHA: ♪ This is how we do it ♪ 
LAURA: One, two, three. 
MATT: How do you do it? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Then this is for the explosive. 
ASHLEY: ♪ How dee dur dee der dis ♪ 
LAURA: Okay, so that's nine, 12 for the explosive. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Doubled. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: So 24. 
MATT: Right. 
LAURA: Then 4d6 for the sneak attack. 
LIAM: Let's go, Rogue. 
LIAM: Ooh. 
LAURA: Ooh! 
LIAM: Good rolls. 
LAURA: 11- 
ASHLEY: That was a good roll. 
LAURA: 15, 18. Doubled. 
MATT: So 18 doubled. 
LIAM: 36. 
MATT: Yep, 36. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: 36 plus 24? 
LAURA: Then regular damage. 
MARISHA: Kill 'em all. 
TALIESIN: So delightfully gross. 
LAURA: There's a d10, then 1d8. Okay, six. 
TRAVIS: Rangers, man. OP, OP. (laughter) 
SAM: Said no one ever. (laughter) 
LAURA: Oh, six plus, hold on, there's another die. 
TALIESIN: I can't believe it took me a beat. 
LIAM: I think it's just this ranger. 
LAURA: So eight plus nine. 
MATT: Eight plus nine. Okay. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
LAURA: I don't know what that totaled. 
LIAM: It's like a thousand. 
LAURA: So it's basically a thousand. 
MATT: All right, so that's on this-- 
ASHLEY: We won. 
MATT: -- this Reiloran right there. 
LAURA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: 60 plus 17? 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
MATT: He's going to go ahead again. 
TRAVIS: 24 plus 26 plus 18. 
ASHLEY: We won! (laughter) 
MATT: So this guy just takes the arrow. (arrow whooshing) And is about to lean forward before (explosion booming) It detonates from within. He is taken out. Before it catches him, 15-foot radius from him is going to catch the guy across the way, though, he's going to take-- 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
MATT: He does get advantage or bonus to his-- 
LAURA: Because he's behind the thing, yeah. 
MATT: Because he's half cover. The other two are also going to make their saves as well. That is a 15 on this guy. 
LAURA: That's a save. 
MATT: That's a save, so he takes half damage, which it was 12, right? 
LAURA: Yes, doubled. 
MATT: 12 fire damage. Well, the crit is against the target. The fire itself doesn't double against the other people. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So he takes six there. The other guy over there, the remaining Reiloran troop takes-- It's going to be 13. 
LAURA: Fail. So 12. 
MATT: Yeah, so he takes 12. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: You made it. 
MATT: (explosion booming) He is destroyed from that shock. 
TRAVIS: Let's go. 
MATT: Sent off the way. 
TALIESIN: Weird question. Did the little balls take damage or no? 
SAM: They always do. 
MATT: Not from fire. 
TALIESIN: Okay, fair. Good to know. 
TRAVIS: Not from fire. 
MARISHA: Not from-- 
MATT: It flicks around this one and doesn't seem to impact it at all. Not from what you can tell. However, the sound of the detonation (booming) all eyes on the battlefield shift over in that direction and then see this broom riding, glowing symbol of hope, getting ready to notch another arrow back into it. Simultaneously, while you're set your toy in the ground that begins to wander out, Grog begins to spring along. 
TRAVIS: ♪ I've got a lovely bunch ♪ ♪ of coconuts, deedly dee ♪ 
MATT: Scanlan teleports to here as this Thought Eater shifts over at glance, noticing some movement and it's going to, from this distance, it's going to attempt to Mind Ravage you, Keyleth. 
LAURA: Did I hit any of the other guys that were there? 
MATT: You did. You hit both of them. 
LAURA: Both of them? Okay. That guy's not-- 
MATT: That guy also actually because he got-- However, he rolled really low, so even the bonus he got didn't matter. So he also takes 12. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Who's mind fucking me? 
TRAVIS: Isn't that always the question? 
MATT: This Thought Eater up here. 
SAM: Do I see that happen? 
MATT: No, because you were down below. 
SAM: Mm. 
MATT: He does have disadvantage on the attack against you, though, because of your Holy Aura. 
TRAVIS: Lieve'tel stuff. 
MATT: That is going to be at disadvantage. Hmm, that's bad. Oh, double fours, 14. Does 14 hit you? 
MARISHA: Negative. 
MATT: What's your AC for your earth elemental form? 
MARISHA: Oh right. It is my earth ellie form. No, 17. 
MATT: 17. (whooshing) Does not impact on you with that. 
TRAVIS: Oh man. 
MATT: However, we are now in initiative. (clamoring) 
TRAVIS: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Ooh. 
MATT: Your initiative for me. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby. Come get some. End of the world. (chuckles) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: Final chapter. Somebody's going down. 
MARISHA: Oh wow. Oh wow. Why? 
SAM: Oh shit. I'm supposed to read this. I'll read it later. 
MATT: Okay, well, 25 to 20? 
MARISHA: 22 with a natural 20. 
TALIESIN: 29. 
LAURA: 23. 
MARISHA: 29! 
TRAVIS: Okay, hold on. Percy, Vex, Keyleth. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
SAM: Oh boy, guys. 
MARISHA: Of all the times to get a nat 20. 
LIAM: I am nervous. 
ROBBIE: This is just your first one. 
MATT: 20 to 15. 
LIAM: 19. 
MATT: 19. 
TRAVIS: Lieve. There are a bunch of Es and Vs in there, somewhere. 
SAM: There's too many Es. 
ASHLEY: Lieve Schreiber. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: Please no. 
ROBBIE: It was raining right down me. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: (raspy) I talk like this. 
ASHLEY: So Lieve'tel. 
LIAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Who's after Lieve'tel? 
TRAVIS: Percy, Vex, Keyleth, Lieve'tel. That was it so far. 
MATT: Okay, 15 to 10. 
TRAVIS: 14. 
ROBBIE: 10. 
ASHLEY: 10 here, too. 
SAM: 12 here. 
MARISHA: Grog, Scanlan. 
ASHLEY: Scanlan. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Dex, who has a higher dex between-- 
ROBBIE: I have plus two for 14. What do you have? 
ASHLEY: (mumbled) I have a 15. 
ROBBIE: There you go. 
TALIESIN: So Grog, Pike-- 
TRAVIS: Why'd you say it like it was a bad thing? 
MARISHA: Grog, Scanlan, Pike. 
ASHLEY: Because I'm guessing because the D&D Beyond went down. 
TRAVIS: Oh okay. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: What?! 
ASHLEY: I'm pretty sure, I talked it over with Dani. 
MATT: So it's Cerkonos then Pike? 
ROBBIE: No. 
MARISHA: Pike then Cerkonos, we think. (chuckling) 
MATT: That's okay. 
ASHLEY: I'm going off to memory, which as we know-- 
MATT: 10 to five. 
SAM: Is there music playing? 
TRAVIS: Oh, that should be. That's from everybody. 
LAURA: That's everybody. 
ASHLEY: Okay, wait. 
TRAVIS: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. 
SAM: There's eight of us at this table. 
TRAVIS: They are eight of us. Oh Jesus. 
SAM: Big table. 
ROBBIE: Where's Scanlan? 
SAM: We should really-- 
LIAM: Scale back. 
SAM: We should thin it out. 
ASHLEY: Wait, dex, did you say? 
TRAVIS: Think that'll take of itself. 
ASHLEY: I'm 12. 
LAURA: Oh, so it is Cerkonos. 
ASHLEY: Cerkonos is going, I-- 
SAM: Oh Jesus, I wrote it down. 
LAURA: Robbie, you're going before Pike. 
MARISHA: Aw! 
ROBBIE: What? 
ASHLEY: I misremembered, which is-- 
TRAVIS: Pike's a liar. 
ASHLEY: -- not a shocker. 
ROBBIE: Skip me. 
MARISHA: So Scanlan, Cerkonos, Pike. 
ASHLEY: Numbers. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Cerkonos. 
TRAVIS: Percy, Vex, Keyleth, Lieve'tel, Grog, Scanlan, Cerkonos, Pike. 
LAURA: 29 initiative. That's insane. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TALIESIN: 17 plus. 
SAM: He's good at one thing. 
TALIESIN: I'm double checking, but I also, my-- 
MATT: Percy? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Surprise, surprise. You're up first, Vex on deck. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Okay. 
TRAVIS: No mercy. No mercy! 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, I know. So I'm going to-- I don't like that guy up there. So I'm going to take Bad News, I'm going to burn for a Dead Eye shot to get advantage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm also going to add, I'm going to take negative five to hit for the plus 10 damage on that one. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So I'm going to take my first shot. (mumbling) There we are. So shot number one. Thank god. There we are. That's 26 to hit. 
MATT: 26 definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's-- I wish I could reroll ones. That sucks. 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 28 points of damage. 
MARISHA: Do you have to read the thing? 
SAM: I will. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: All righty. (gun blasting) Gun goes off, blasts the Reiloran Thought Eater. You see as it blast impacts, it puts its hand up and this psychic shield and absorbs the entirety of the blast. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
MATT: It doesn't even hit the Reiloran. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: But you do see the psychic shield (cracking) almost crack a bit before fading from view. 
TRAVIS: Is that Bad News, too? 
TALIESIN: Oh, bullshit. I'm going to take another shot. 
MATT: (chuckles) 
SAM: Oh shit. 
TALIESIN: So I am not going to take Dead Eye for this one, 
TALIESIN: So I am not going to take Dead Eye for this one, but I am going to do the negative five for plus 10. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: So no advantage for me. 
TRAVIS: Oh, what's that one called? Sharpshooter? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, wait. Oh shit, hold on. 
MARISHA: Well. 
TALIESIN: That might be bad. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Where's my-- 
TRAVIS: You break your rifle-- 
MATT: Is this Bad News? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: The second shot, dude. 
MATT: That's a misfire. 
TALIESIN: That's a misfire. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
TALIESIN: So since I can do that, I can use my bonus action to try and fix it really quickly. 
MATT: You can. 
TALIESIN: Because fuck my life. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Repair is eight plus-- So misfire, so it's 11. So let's see, I roll at, what is it? Eight plus-- 11 is the DC, and I'm rolling tinker, which is six, I believe. It's just my proficiency bonus, right? 
MATT: Proficiency and your dex. 
TALIESIN: Okay, excellent. 
LIAM: (Irish) We're making a Tinker roll. 
TALIESIN: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, I'm good. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. So you repair Bad News. So first attack hits, second attack misses with a misfire. You bonus action to repair it. You have two more attacks. 
TALIESIN: Ah. 
TRAVIS: Those are blanks, hey, Percy. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I turn to Grog for my next attack. 
TRAVIS: (screams) You got four or five kids. It was a joke! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: You have less to live for now. It'll be fine. That is much better. That's 24 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TALIESIN: All right, and that's going to be, or actually that's 24, 17 to hit, excuse me. 
MATT: Oh, because it's minus five, 17 still hits? 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Or minus five, it'll be a 19. 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MATT: But still hits. 
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm doing so much. I'm good at math. 
MATT: That's okay, man. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. All right, here we go. That's again, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 28 points of damage again. 
MATT: 28 points of damage. All righty. 
MARISHA: If that was Daggerheart, you would've crit. 
TALIESIN: I thought about it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Pisses me off. 
MATT: All right. The second blast, that shield shatters and takes it in the shoulder and (snarls) looks back in your direction. 
MARISHA: Shield down? 
MATT: Some psychic shield seems to have blasted apart from the impact and you hear in your head, (spectral whisper) "I'll devour your ego." 
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh, ooh. 
TALIESIN: Heard that before. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: 30 feet in that direction. 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: Please. 
LIAM: What was your target on the map? 
LAURA: The Thought Eater up there. 
TALIESIN: Up top. Yeah, that one up top. 
LIAM: That Thought right there? 
TRAVIS: This map is fucking dope, dude. 
MATT: That's the end of your turn. 
TALIESIN: That's the end of my turn. 
MATT: All right. I reloaded Bad News. 
MATT: All right. Vex, you're up, with Keyleth on deck. 
LAURA: Oh shit! Oh shit! All right, in that case-- 
MATT: Oh shit! 
LAURA: -- I'm going to attack the person that my husband's attacking. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: I am going to-- 
TALIESIN: They're floaters, too. 
LIAM: ♪ (battle music) ♪ 
TALIESIN: I think they're floaters. 
MARISHA: I think they're floaters. 
TALIESIN: Fuck a duck. 
MARISHA: I don't know if-- 
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark them. 
MARISHA: -- they are fully. 
LAURA: No, I can't. That's only 90 feet. I can't do that. I'm not close enough. 
MATT: You can move in to do it. 
LAURA: I don't want to move in to do it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got all this staying away stuff. 
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to stay away because I can stay away. 
TALIESIN: That would've been 15 feet. 
LAURA: I am going to-- 
MATT: 15 feet? 
LAURA: (mumbling rapidly) 
TALIESIN: Thank you. 
ASHLEY: (mumbles like Laura) 
LAURA: Fuck me running. I'm sorry. I'm going to Lightning Bolt, Lightning Arrow. Is that me? Lightning Arrow myself. 
MATT: Okay. (unsheathing arrow) (electric sparking) 
LAURA: Is that what I want to do? 
LIAM: Shoot it at yourself. 
LAURA: No. Wait. (anxious mumbling) 
TRAVIS: If only you had more time to prepare. 
LAURA: Shut up. (laughter) 
LAURA: Okay. No. Yeah, this is great. Okay. 
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (laugh) 
TRAVIS: Okay, everybody quit it. 
LAURA: Okay, shut up. Okay. I'm going to do the Sharpshooter and I'm going to take minus five for the plus 10. 
MATT: Go for it. Against which one? 
LAURA: The Thought Eater up there. 
MATT: Thought Eater up here? Okay, go for it. 
MARISHA: Oh, I meant to put on more deodorant before this. Fuck. 
LAURA: That is… Oh, I don't know if that's going to hit. That is 20-- 
MARISHA: No, don't. 
LAURA: That's 16. 
MATT: 16 just hits. 
LIAM: Ooh! 
LAURA: Oh, phew! Okay. Okay, cool. 
MARISHA: What, we're hitting the Thought Eater? 
TALIESIN: 16 to hit. 
LIAM: Yeah, but she took a dip in the attack roll so she could hit harder. 
LAURA: Yeah. So that's good. I just made it. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Okay, so that's 1d8 plus 1d10. 17, 17 and then-- Oh, plus four. Hold on. Just kidding. 
MATT: 21. 
LAURA: I'm nervous. 
LIAM: I'll get it for you. 
MATT: It's okay. 
LAURA: Where's a four? There? No. 
MATT: Oh, plus a d4. Got you. 
LIAM: Here's this die. 
LAURA: Shut up. Plus three. 
MATT: So that was 17 plus three, so 20. 
LAURA: Yes, 20. Then make-- 
MATT: Dexterity save for Lightning Arrow? 
LAURA: My math is dumb. Wait, let me start over. 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) 
LAURA: Three plus three is six, plus nine is 15, plus 10 is 25 for the Sharp Shooter. is 15, plus 10 is 25 for the Sharp Shooter. So 25. 
MATT: Okay. Right. 
LAURA: Now a dex save. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: For the lightning. 
MATT: All right. Sharpshooter was minus five from that whole attack too, right? 
LAURA: Correct. 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So dex save on that is going to be 16. 
LAURA: So that will fail! 
MATT: Okay, let's go and do some damage. 
LAURA: Okay. So that's 4d8. 
MATT: Knocking the rest out. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know this is so many things happening-- 
MATT: That's okay. 
LAURA: -- and a lot of other people have to go. 
MATT: I know. Keyleth, you're up next. 
LAURA: I'm real sorry. 
LIAM: Level 20. Fate of the world. 
LAURA: 16 plus eight is 24. 
MATT: All righty. 
LAURA: Lightning damage. 
MATT: The arrow hits. (electric sparking) As the arrow impacts and blasts, these arcs of lightning spin around it, hitting all the different metallic parts of the top of this wall area and the Thought Eater gets knocked back and has to catch its arm on the side of the tower there. Glances up and looks, and you see the orb up here beginning to-- (pulsing) 
LAURA: Oh shit. 
MATT: -- glow as well. 
LAURA: Oh shit. (gasps) Oh, I'm close to another one. 
MATT: Many of the other orbs are starting to also-- (pulsing) 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. I'm going to move away from that one. 
MATT: Where are you moving? 
TRAVIS: Are those little mini orbs also glowing? 
MATT: Not yet. 
TRAVIS: Okay. We saw the corners. 
SAM: Not yet. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay, okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: You beautiful bastard. 
LAURA: I'm going to move out that way. 
TRAVIS: There's also this-- 
MATT: That way? How far? 
TRAVIS: -- side extension. 
MATT: 60 feet? 
SAM: What if they're not orbs? 
LAURA: Yeah. Away from the orb. 
SAM: What if they're eggs? 
MATT: You could move-- 
ASHLEY: Over there? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you see? 
MATT: Vex will be pretty much, set her right next to the-- 
TALIESIN: We're a little tight. 
MATT: -- the summoned-- 
SAM: I can't see anything. 
MATT: Great. That's perfect. 
LAURA: Are there monsters over there? 
TALIESIN: No. Just us. 
MARISHA: No. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: But we're a little clumped, but just us. 
LAURA: But I'm up, I'm up 60 feet. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: That's where we get flanked from later. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LAURA: Did I go the wrong way? 
SAM: No, you didn't. 
TALIESIN: There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's. 
MATT: That finishes your turn? 
SAM: I think we were supposed to be stealthing over there. 
MATT: Yeah? Okay. Keyleth, you're up. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Yes. 
LAURA: Well, I'm distracting because I'm glowing above you. 
MATT: Yeah 
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah. 
LAURA: So I'll pull the eye line up. 
SAM: Great. 
MARISHA: I'm going to be underground, which is what I'm going to do. I was debating if I do something, but I think it's most important if I start heading towards where Scanlan is. So I'm going to dip down, and I'm going to-- 
TRAVIS: ♪ When I dip, you dip, we dip ♪ 
MARISHA: -- sprint. I'm going to dash 30 feet. Or sorry, it would be 60 feet total. 
MATT: You're moving twice? 
MARISHA: Moving twice. 
TALIESIN: Your speed is 35. 
MARISHA: Not as an earth elemental. 
TALIESIN: Oh nevermind. Sorry. 
MATT: So 30 will put you about-- Yep, that would be about there. 
TALIESIN: Trying to math this shit. 
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to stay under the ground. I hope that that's not a mistake. 
LIAM: So that was-- You went that far beneath? 
MATT: You are currently underground right there. 
LAURA: Good job. 
SAM: This is great. 
MARISHA: I don't disturb the ground, so no one should know I'm there. 
MATT: Yeah, no worries. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: That doesn't make a tunnel that others can follow, right? 
MARISHA: It's Earth Glide, so I'm-- 
LIAM: So you're just smooshing through. 
LAURA: One with the earth. 
MARISHA: I'm one with the earth. 
TALIESIN: Liquid. 
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn? 
TALIESIN: Liquid or mud? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: All right. End of your turn. (buzzing intensifies) That heavy buzzing sound gets louder and louder-- 
LAURA: Oh, shit, shit. 
MATT: -- and that shadow seems to emerge out of the dust. You see the numerous claws of a vidulch, but a vidulch from above, and of a size you've not encountered. 
TRAVIS: What? 
MATT: As it descends down and crashes into this piece of rock, smashing it to pieces. 
ROBBIE: Don't you reach back there. 
TRAVIS: (panicked stammering) 
LAURA: How big is this thing? 
MARISHA: What's he doing? What's he about to do? [rocks clatter] 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah! 
ALL: (exclaiming) 
TRAVIS: He just Salt Baed that shit! (laughter) (screaming) 
TRAVIS: What the fuck!? We definitely killed that guy! 
MATT: This guy-- 
TRAVIS: We definitely killed him! 
MATT: -- is still beneath it. 
TRAVIS: Oh my god! 
MATT: But it is large enough that it was not crushed. 
LAURA: Oh! 
TRAVIS: That's how Red Lobster went out of business. 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
ASHLEY: That is huge! 
MATT: That's it. Leave it there! 
SAM: I'm just-- 
LAURA: Leave it. Leave it! 
TALIESIN: I think my windup thing is underneath it. 
MATT: Huh? 
TALIESIN: I think my little toy is underneath it. Okay. 
MATT: It's underneath it. Yeah. So keep that in mind. 
TALIESIN: I will. 
MATT: (crash) It impacts. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! That's huge. 
LAURA: And it flies. 
MATT: From your perspective, those who aren't on the ground next to it, it would be Vex'ahlia and Grog atop it. You notice that it has a massive bit of barding and a saddle-- 
TRAVIS: Oh! There's a fucking-- 
MATT: -- affixed to the top of it. 
LIAM: It's the dude! 
MATT: Where on top, you see a massive-- 
LIAM: The dude that we were warned-- 
MATT: -- armored Reiloran juggernaut figure-- 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: -- with spiked armor clutching onto the front of it with a gnarly hook looking mace that hangs from one side of his armored belt and a massive barbed glass blade that emerges from the other hand as he stands up. This psychic chatter blasts out in the radius, filling all of your minds. 
LAURA: Oh no. 
MATT: "(sinister laugh) Children, it's feast time." 
SAM: Oh Jesus. 
MARISHA: Oh! 
MATT: "Scrag--" 
SAM: Scrag? 
MATT: "-- show them a welcoming." 
LIAM: Scrag. At which point-- 
SAM: Scrag! 
MATT: (heavy scuttling) (insectoid shriek) - it shrieks. You watch as its armored plates open out and multiple different tones, like a discordant harmony of various screeches emerge from the-- It's the core of this vidulch. 
TRAVIS: What?! 
MATT: It's going to take its turn. 
TRAVIS: What?! 
LAURA: (like Jester) We are we going to die! 
MATT: So Scrag-- 
MARISHA: Oh boy. 
LAURA and MARISHA: Scrag. 
LAURA: Scrag comes after Keyleth. 
SAM: Do you think it has some legendary resistances? 
TALIESIN: I would say-- 
MARISHA: ♪ I don't want no Scrags ♪ 
LIAM: Advantage on saves, enemies against all of us are at disadvantage. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Correct. Scrag is going to spin first and it's going to take of its-- 
SAM: DisadScragage. It's going to take a-- 
TRAVIS: Five attacks?! 
MATT: Yeah. Mandible strike against-- Actually, going to do a couple of scythe claw attacks against you first, Percy. 
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. 
MATT: At disadvantage. 
LAURA: Oh no, Percy! 
TRAVIS: They're human? 
MATT: Oh, that disadvantage saved you from a natural 20. 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
TRAVIS: (insane laugh) (unhinged laugh) Five?! 
MATT: That's going to be an 11 to hit. 
TALIESIN: No. 
TALIESIN: Oh no! 
MATT: Sorry, sorry. That was 11. Sorry. 21. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. I did the math wrong. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: It's plus 13. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
MARISHA: Plus 13! 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MATT: All right, so the scythe claw attacked the first one. 
MARISHA: I do want some Cheddar Bay biscuits, though. 
TRAVIS: Scythe claw. 
MARISHA: (laughs) No, that scythe claw. 
ROBBIE: Don't worry about that. 
LIAM: It's got-- 
SAM: Scrag. 
LIAM: -- armor on its big pincer. 
TRAVIS: Armor. 
TALIESIN: Don't even. 
MATT: That is 28 points-- 
LAURA: That's so cool. Scrag is everything. 
MATT: -- of slashing damage against you. 
TALIESIN: Ow. 
TRAVIS: 28. 
MATT: Another strike against you, Percy. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MATT: That's going to be a 27 to hit. 
TALIESIN: That hits. 
MATT: All right, you take-- 
MARISHA: These are all at disadvantage? 
MATT: -- 17-- Yes. 
ASHLEY: She went under. 
LAURA: You better have-- 
LIAM: It's got a major bonus. 
MATT: -- points of damage to you. 
LAURA: -- so many Revivifies. 
MARISHA: Yeah, plus 13 he said. 
MATT: Third scythe claw attack against you. 
LAURA: Everybody's going to die. 
ASHLEY: Everybody's going to die. 
MATT: That's going to be 17. 
TALIESIN: Misses. 
MATT: Misses. 
TALIESIN: (anxious groan) 
MATT: The second…its fourth attack is going to go against you as well. 
LAURA: I'm freaking out. 
MATT: That's going to be even less. So four of the attacks miss on you. It gets frustrated, turns, it's going to do its mandible attack on you, Lieve'tel, since you're the one that's right there. That is going to be a 20 to hit. 
LIAM: Sure. 
MATT: Okay. So the 20, the razor mandibles come at you for 21 points of piercing damage. 
LIAM: Okay, cool. 
MATT: As well as… 
MARISHA: You're still over here-- 
MATT: -- 18 points of acid damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So I need you to make a concentration saving throw. 
MARISHA: You're there with Pike. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah. We fucked up, yeah. (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Matt, what did you do? What did you do? 
LIAM: 22. 
MATT: 22? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So you do manage to maintain your concentration. 
LIAM: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Okay. That's great. 
TRAVIS: Who needs a tarrasque fight? 
ASHLEY: That's good. That's so good. 
TRAVIS: This is fucking crazy. 
MARISHA: You beat me to it. 
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah! 
MATT: Just barely, too. 
MARISHA: Is this our tarrasque? 
TRAVIS: Massive. 
MARISHA: What if tarrasque meets aliens? 
MATT: Hey, you know-- 
TRAVIS: With wings! 
MATT: The genetic alteration program of the Weave Mind can create some pretty amazing entities. 
MARISHA: When the cockroach begins to fly. 
TALIESIN: I'm mildly fucked. 
LIAM: Lieve gave herself 120-- 
LAURA: You what? 
ASHLEY: I do have Revivify. 
LIAM: -- temporary hit points. 
LAURA: Well, that's good. 
LIAM: They're gone. 
MARISHA: All of them? 
LIAM: Gone at the top of this fight. 
MATT: It is also now going to finish off with a corroding spray. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: That's a 60-foot cone. 
TALIESIN: That's a good topper. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Holy-- 
MATT: It's going to rear back, (claws slice) bites Lieve'tel, rears back, (ejects acid) and emits this massive spray of acid outward. I need Vex, your summoned planetar, and you, Lieve'tel, to make dexterity saving throws. 
LIAM: But we're still stealthed, right? 
LAURA: At advantage. We get advantage. 
LIAM: Yes. Everyone's at advantage. 
MATT: Unfortunately, the thing you were hiding behind is gone. 
MATT and TRAVIS: (laugh) 
LIAM: That was a dumb move. 
MATT: I know. 
TALIESIN: Hi! (laughs) Oh shit. 
LIAM: Okay, great. 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
LIAM: This is a dex save? 
MATT: Dex save, yeah. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay. 
TRAVIS: That changes what I was going to do. 
TALIESIN: God, I hope it takes a reaction. 
MARISHA: I know, it's-- 
TRAVIS: I mean, of course it changes what we were going to do. 
MARISHA: We're still going for it, right? 
TRAVIS: It just dropped fucking-- 
MATT: All right, so? 
MARISHA: We're still going for it, right? 
LAURA: 19? Is that enough? 
MATT: 19. 
SAM: What are we going for? 
MARISHA: The beacon. 
TALIESIN: You got to go for it. 
LAURA: Oh! Oh! 
MATT: 19? 
LAURA: Wait, wait. What were you going to say? 
MATT: You have advantage on your saving throws, remember? Because of the spell. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Yeah. 19 unfortunately just fails. 
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm a rogue! Does that do anything? 
MATT: It means if you fail, you take half damage and if you succeed you take none. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: So you still take half damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So half damage for that half would be 19. Take 19 points of acid damage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: And Lieve'tel? 
LIAM: 21 for both my Planar Ally, the deva-- 
MATT: And you? 
LIAM: -- and Lieve. 
MATT: So 19 points of acid damage to each of you. Make another concentration. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
MATT: Constitution saving throw. 
LIAM: Just an 8th-level spell, guys. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: That's good. That's better than it was the first time. You definitely saved on that. 
LIAM: That's, yeah, that's 23. 
MATT: Okay. You're fine. 
ASHLEY: I'm scared. 
MATT: All right. That's going to-- 
LIAM: Sorry. How much damage did you give me before that concentration check? 
TRAVIS: 19. 
LIAM: 19? 
MATT: 19, yes. All right, that's going to finish Scrag's turn. 
LAURA: You can just do damage and it'll-- 
MATT: It is now-- 
LAURA: -- take away the temps. 
MATT: -- the 20th count of the initiative. 
SAM: What? 
ASHLEY: What does that mean? 
LAURA: What does that mean? 
ASHLEY: What does that mean? 
SAM: The 20th count? 
MARISHA: Something else bad is about to happen. 
LAURA: 20th count of the initiative? We're on the 20th count? 
MATT: Double ones. Cool. 
TRAVIS: Double ones. 
MATT: Double ones. 
TRAVIS and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
ROBBIE: It sounded cool at first. 
MATT: A singular Reiloran troop lands from the Bloody Bridge. 
TALIESIN: Okay, we definitely-- 
MATT: There's more on the way. 
TALIESIN: -- need that shit down. 
MARISHA: So they're going to keep-- 
LAURA: We got to take out he bridge. 
MARISHA: They're going to keep popping through. Okay. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Okay. Okay. 
MATT: I mean, the army is coming. 
LAURA: We've got to stop the bridge. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MARISHA: Does-- (hums suggestively) 
SAM: Does the beacon also turn off the bridge? 
MARISHA: I assume so. 
LAURA: Yeah, I think the beacon would disarm the bridge. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: The towers-- Actually, someone roll a d20 for me. 
TRAVIS: I got it. 
ASHLEY: I have an idea. 
SAM: Garbage. 
TRAVIS: Fucking crap. 
SAM: Garbage cocked. 
TRAVIS: 12. 
MATT: 12? Okay. Okay. 
LIAM: Save us, Cerkonos. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LAURA: You got this, right? 
ROBBIE: I'm in the corner. I'm not even on the map, baby. Me and Pike are having a latte. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I can't believe they ran in there! 
ASHLEY: This shit's crazy, right? (laughter) 
MATT: These various towers are beginning to glow brighter and brighter. They're not quite at full brightness, but you can see the ghostly images of these heavily armored ancient Reiloran starting to appear and conjure from them. These are just beginning to light up here. As they're glowing and lighting up, you see them all gathering to a center point, where (vibrating) is beginning to burble up. 
LAURA: Jesus H. 
MATT: But that's it for that count. Lieve'tel, you're up. 
LIAM: I didn't roll for the Planar Ally. The last time we said it would go at the same time as me? 
MATT: Yeah, we're going to go with you. It's easiest to keep track of. 
LIAM: Great. So Lieve is going to turn to the Harbinger and say: Harbinger, get me to the Malleus Key. She is going to cast Freedom of Movement on herself, which is not concentration so it does not conflict with Holy Aura. 
MATT: Correct. 
LIAM: We haven't taken enough damage for me to start doing all of that stuff and then I wait to be-- 
MATT: Carried? 
LIAM: -- carried. 
MATT: Okay. All right. That finishes your turn. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's it. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: I assume I'm in its-- If I were to take 10 steps, I would get smacked, so. 
MATT: You get the sense based on the length of each of its scythe claws being about 30 to 40 feet. of each of its scythe claws being about 30 to 40 feet. You're in its reach. (laughs) 
LIAM: So I'll wait. 
MATT: Then so you're now-- 
LIAM: I'm waiting to be picked up. 
MATT: Correct, but they go at the end of your turn. 
LIAM: Right. So the Harbinger will scoop her, if possible. 
MATT: Of course. Yeah. 
LIAM: And fly low along the ground towards the base of the Key towards where Scanlan was talking about being to try to get to the rear there. A deva's movement flying is 90 feet. 
SAM: Is fierce! 
MATT: 90 feet. So yeah, it can fly easily over in this direction. 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: All right. As it leaves the attack radius of Scrag, (whoosh) it's going to go razor mandibles. 
LIAM: Disadvantage. 
MATT: It's fun. It is at disadvantage. Correct. Well, it's at your planetar. Did you cast your Holy Aura on them as well? 
LIAM: Well, it was within 30 feet of me when I-- 
MATT: That's true. Is there a maximum number of targets or any creatures? 
LIAM: I'll double check. I don't think so. I think it's just creatures I choose, but let me double check. 
MATT: Yeah. Creatures of your choice. You're right. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So yeah. Disadvantage. All right, so Scrag's striking that. That's going to be at disadvantage is 20? 
LIAM: Hits. 
MATT: It hits? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay, so with its razor mandibles. That's 3d12. That's not a great roll. 21 points of piercing damage. 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: To your planetar plus-- That's a rougher roll. 24 points of acid damage. 
LIAM: Oof. The three-headed white raven is looking pretty fucked up. 
MATT: Okay. All right. So that finishes your planetar shifting over there. Planetar, its movement is 90? 
LIAM: Its flying speed is 90 feet. 
MATT: So it moved. It still has an action. 
LIAM: I will let it carry me to the rear of the Key, if possible. 
MATT: The rear of the Key? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so it's going to shift over into this area here. 
LIAM: Immediately try to spot this beacon. 
MATT: Okay. We'll get to that on your next turn. 
LIAM: Got it. 
MATT: Because that was your action just getting over there. 
LIAM: Yeah. Great. Yessir. 
MATT: Finishing your turn, Lieve'tel. It's now the shrikes' go. 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
LAURA: Where are the shrikes? 
MATT: So from here. There's one there, one there, and there's one under here. This shrike is going to go ahead and-- Hmm. Speed of 50. This one's going to charge up to Percival. 
LAURA: Why? 
MATT: To there. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: This one here is going to leap. Then rush off of this direction to go after Grog. This one here is going to shift and this one here as well. 
LAURA: We're so spread out. 
MATT: It's going to hold its action. 
LIAM: That's right. 
TALIESIN: Hold its action? I hate that. 
MATT: All right, finishing the Shrike's go, Grog, you're up with Scanlan on deck. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, so when I ran out here, I used my action, my bonus action, and my bonus action with my Boots of Feral Leaping. 
MATT: Right. To leap. 
TRAVIS: I'll use them again. I'm going to try and leap up onto this platform. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: And say: Yoo-hoo, over here! So can I prop up here? 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: We'll say I'm up there. 
LIAM: Yes. 
TRAVIS: Because I don't have any of the putty. 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to take two attacks against this column knowing that the Titanstone Knuckles do siege damage. 
MATT: Yeah, you do. (oohing) 
MATT: Okay, let's go. 
LIAM: That giant miniature makes me so happy. 
ASHLEY: Me too. 
TRAVIS: 18… 
ASHLEY: He's such a big boy. 
TRAVIS: A 30 to hit? 
MATT: That definitely hits. You can roll damage. 
ASHLEY: Goosh! 
TRAVIS: The second one is 28 to hit. 
MATT: 28 hits, yeah. 
ASHLEY: Goosh! (laughter) 
MATT: You're still raging from the previous battle? 
TRAVIS: Yes, indeed. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Not frenzied or anything. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Just 12… 
LAURA: Is that me? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: Who's going bling-bling? 
LAURA: It's me, but I've turned my phone off twice. 
TALIESIN: There's a little side button. 
TRAVIS: That's 27 points of damage on the first one. 
MATT: Double for siege. 
MARISHA: I also have Earthquake. 
TRAVIS: Sorry, 54? 
MATT: All right. (intense slam) Heavy impact, the whole pillar (crackling) cracks and spider up the front. 
TRAVIS: Love that part. 
MARISHA: Shake it down. 
TRAVIS: Kickass, 11, 21. 28. 
ASHLEY: That was the first hit? 
TRAVIS: 56 on the second one. 
ASHLEY: Jeez. 
MATT: (crumbling) 
TRAVIS: Timber! 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go. 
MATT: This entire pillar is destroyed with you on it. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check for me. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 
ASHLEY: Big boy! 
TRAVIS: Just got to land the dismount. 
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Three point. 
LIAM: Oh, look at that. 
TRAVIS: 21. 
MATT: 21? Okay. So you manage to catch yourself. 
ASHLEY: Corn Pops! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: One for the spectacle. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Without taking any bludgeoning damage. You pop an ankle a little bit. It's going to hurt in the morning, but you're okay. 
TRAVIS: Nice. I will use-- That was my attack and my bonus action for the boots and-- 
MATT: I'll say 20 feet of movement to climb up the pillar to hit it. 
TRAVIS: Great. I'll do 25 feet just to see if I can see if there's anybody in this tent that's going to make my life miserable. 
MATT: Sure. 
TRAVIS: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25. Can I see in? 
MATT: You glance inside and you see two Vanguard soldiers who are cowering in the corner. They're both holding shields, they have them at the ready and their weapons, and they're both hiding in the corner, and they see you and go (startled gasps). 
TRAVIS: If you don't want this, stay inside. 
MATT: They just nod. They look young. (awwing) 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Let's kill them. 
TRAVIS: That's my turn. 
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. All right, Grog's done. Scanlan, you're up. 
SAM: Can I see the beacon? 
MATT: From under here? 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Make a perception check. 
TRAVIS: ♪ The beacon ♪ 
LAURA: ♪ The beacon ♪ 
SAM: 15 plus two. 
MATT: Not from where you currently are, unfortunately. 
TRAVIS: (shouts) Goddamn it! 
SAM: Do I get any advantage or something from all the shit we have? 
TRAVIS: You're a horse! What about horse eyes? 
LAURA: What do your horse eyes see, Scanlan? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: What do your whore's eyes see, Scanlan? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Your manwhore's eyes. 
MARISHA: It's because you can only see one side at a time because you've got prey eyes. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter) 
SAM: I can't see it, but it was described to me by someone. Keyleth? 
LAURA: Yeah, we described it. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: The higher ups. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: It was described to-- yeah. 
SAM: Was it described as being high up in the tower, mid-tower, low-tower? 
MATT: Yeah, it was placed higher up in the tower. Keyleth, you mostly watched it happen. 
SAM: Punch the tower, I guess, right? 
LAURA: We might just do that. 
MARISHA: Remember, you have Freedom of Movement, so if we make rough terrain, you're good. 
SAM: Great, great. All right. 
TRAVIS: If we make rough terrain. 
SAM: I'm going to start punching the tower, then, right? Because we've got to get-- 
TRAVIS: You mean horse kicking. 
LAURA: You're going to punch the tower? 
SAM: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: With your hand? 
SAM: With my hand. With ♪ Scanlan's hand! ♪ 
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby. 
SAM: I'm going to cast Scanlan's Hand at 6th-level. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I'm going to punch the tower. 
MATT: You're going to punch the tower. 
TRAVIS: Punch the tower. The time has come to-- 
LAURA: But we need to make sure to take the beacon before we destroy the tower. 
TRAVIS: -- punch the tower. 
LAURA: Right? 
SAM: Take it? 
TALIESIN: If we get the beacon-- 
SAM: I don't know where it is. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, we haven't seen it yet. 
TALIESIN: If we start destroying the tower, we'll figure out where the beacon is. I assume. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: No sense waiting. 
TRAVIS: I think last time, Ludinus was damn near near the top or at least three quarters up. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Where the stairs went to, which they fell last time too. He was floating, which was why he was able to put it in. 
MATT: I apologize. I think my Scanlan's hand mini that I made all those years ago is somewhere in the other room. So I will use this temporary one. 
SAM: Ashley, you have a little rubber hand somewhere, don't you? 
ASHLEY: Uh-huh. 
MATT: You can use this one. 
SAM: Okay, that'll work, that'll work. 
ASHLEY: Wait, no, don't you have the foot and the dice? 
MATT: It's fine. All right, so where do you conjure it? 
MARISHA: It's fine. 
SAM: Huh? 
MATT: Where do you conjure it? 
SAM: Yeah, up at the same level as that Reiloran who just stepped off. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: I can't punch the Reiloran and the tower, right? I've got to pick one. 
MATT: How many attacks does your-- 
SAM: One. 
MATT: One? No, you can't do both. 
TALIESIN: I have a plan. 
SAM: Okay, I'm going to punch the tower. 
MATT: All right. Roll an attack for Scanlan's hand. 
SAM: Oh god. 
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe you can reveal it. Maybe if you start chipping away at it. 
SAM: Maybe. Okay. To hit. Fuck, I've never done this (laughs) in so many years. Melee spell attack, okay. That's a 16 to hit the tower? 
MATT: 16. It hits the tower (thuds). It impacts it, and as the mass of your arcane fist slams into it, you see the tower (slight bump) whatever impact is there, the Bloody Bridge flickers for a minute, but then holds it steady. It looks like it wasn't quite enough to leave a heavy impact. 
SAM: (whispers) Oh no. It has a higher AC than my punch did. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Oh god. 
SAM: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: How much did you hit it? What was the damage? 
SAM: There was no damage. 
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
LAURA: None. 
SAM: Because it has a higher AC than my fist. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
SAM: I rolled really bad. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Okay, that's it. I guess. 
MATT: That's your action. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: A move or? 
SAM: If I move, I'll be out in the open, though. 
MATT: That's true. 
SAM: I don't want people to see me. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Hold on. Do I have any bonus actions? I must. I have Healing Word. I will Healing Word myself. Oh, wait, that's a spell. Can't do it. 
MATT: Can't do it. 
TALIESIN: Go to, yeah. 
LAURA: You're invisible? 
SAM: No, I'm hiding. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: He's just a centaur. 
LAURA: He's just a centaur. 
SAM: I'm just a sweet, little centaur. 
LAURA: Didn't Scanlan do a bunch of shit? 
SAM: I can Inspire but I don't-- Yeah, I know. (laughter) 
SAM: I can inspire, but there's no one around me to inspire. I'm good, that's it. 
MARISHA: Level 20, baby. 
MATT: All right. 
ASHLEY: Yes! Level 20. 
MARISHA: Level 20! 
MATT: Here we go. 
LAURA: We are on it. 
MATT: All right. Finishing Scanlan's turn, it is now the Sunder King Ozo Cruth's turn. 
TALIESIN: Boo. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
MATT: Ozo, glancing around from on top his mount, lets go of the front of the saddle-like throne that's built onto the back of Scrag, his vidulch. He leans on it on one side and he glances around, and first is going to go ahead and he sees that Percy's engaged there. Let's see, Lieve'tel flew over there. 
LIAM: I am behind. 
MATT: Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, he sees you, Vex, up in the air, and he goes (grunts) and take his glass sword and will release it, and it (magical warbles) and hovers in the air and he goes (air whooshes) and it (quick slashes) fires off to you 60 foot-- 
TRAVIS: Interesting. 
MATT: -- in length. You are in range. So he's going to attack you with disadvantage. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Over here. 
TRAVIS: Come on. Low whammies. 
MATT: With Carnage. 
TRAVIS: Carnage. 
LAURA: Carnage, what? 
MATT: It's the name of his glass sword. 
LAURA: Oh, that's the name of his sword? Okay. 
MATT: Oh, natural 20, and it's disadvantage, so it's only going to be a 22 to hit? 
LAURA: That hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: But! I think the Dawnfather would consider him an enemy. 
SAM: Oh, excuse me. 
MATT: Yeah? 
LAURA: So if he hits me, he is going to take 4d6 radiant damage and be knocked prone. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: All right. Is it melee or is it any attack? 
LAURA: Any attack or spell. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: That hits me. 
MATT: All right. So, he strikes you with this. You take-- 
TRAVIS: Is that a oner? 
MATT: 24 points of piercing damage as it (impactful whoosh) and it stabs you in the side. As it sticks in, you can feel the barbed edge of it hook into your flesh through the armor. 
LAURA: (grunts) 
MATT: But you blast him. 
LAURA: (grunts) All right, so he takes 4d6 radiant damage. 
MATT: All righty. 
LIAM: Also, Matt? 
MATT: Mm-hmm? 
LIAM: I don't think we should retcon backward, but any attack against someone with Holy Aura on them, the attacker must succeed on a con save or be blinded until the spell ends. 
MATT: Well, that's good to know. 
LIAM: So go forward with that. 
MATT: We'll go forward with that from now. 
LIAM: From Vex forward. 
MATT: Correct. 
TRAVIS: Does that just apply to her? 
LIAM: Everyone got hit with Holy Aura. So, 'ura. 
ASHLEY: 'Ura. 
LIAM: Any time any of you successfully get hit by an enemy, the enemy has to make a con save versus blindness. 
MATT: Blindness, which would give them disadvantage on attack rolls, which they already have, against targets with it on there. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: So it wouldn't have made that much of a difference given the circumstances. 
LIAM: It would be funny to watch you make them blind, though. 
MATT: It would be, though. Maybe that'll happen. So how much damage is that again? That was? 
LAURA: 17 radiant damage. 
MATT: All right, 17 radiant damage, and he gets (thuds) blasted back onto his saddle. He spends half of his movement to get back up into it. Now, the blade is stuck in your side, and he goes (slicing rips) and pulls the blade and you with it. (screaming) (oohing) 
TRAVIS: Shit! He went fishing. 
MATT: (whooshes) You are dragged into melee with him. 
ASHLEY: Take his mount, take his mount. 
MARISHA: Get over here. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
SAM: Don't worry. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Pulls it out as he drags you up into his face, you can see now the massive size of him. He almost encompasses the entirety of your perspective, just blades and armor. From beneath the massive war helmet, you see his jaw (growls) drip with saliva. In your head, you hear, "I want to feast too." 
TRAVIS: Oh jeez. 
MATT: He's going to continue his action. 
LAURA: Feast on what? 
MATT: He's going to take, that's one attack. 
ASHLEY: I have some leftover bacon in my bag. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah. 
MATT: You know what, actually, as he pulls the blade back, he reaches and pulls out his mace that's all nasty and barbed, Bone Graver. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, he does look horrible-looking, Vex. 
MATT: And is going to attack you three times with the mace. 
LIAM: Jeez. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: That's going to be a 21 to hit. 
LAURA: Disadvantage? 
MATT: With disadvantage, yeah. 
LAURA: That hits. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: That's going to be a 19 to hit? 
LAURA: That misses. 
MATT: Okay, so second one misses. And, oh, a two and a three. That's going to be a 16 to hit. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So one hit with Bone Graver on you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Bone Graver? 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Bone Graver. 
MATT: 17 points of bludgeoning damage on you. 
LAURA: 17, okay. 
MATT: It's one heavy hit cracks down on your head and shoulders. (cracks) The other one comes at you and (vibrating whoosh) you pull back. The instinctual need to get away from danger. 
LAURA: He takes 11 radiant damage from that. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And is knocked prone. 
MATT: Is it every time he gets a hit? 
LAURA: Every time I get hit. 
MATT: Yeah, let's go. (short blast) Gets knocked down again, gets back up, with the rest of his movement, and continues with the next two attacks that miss you. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All righty. That is going to finish his turn. 
LIAM: Does he need to make con saves for every successful hit? 
MATT: Huh? 
LIAM: I want him to act blind if he's blind. 
MATT: Yeah, that's right. Con save, that's going to be 23. 
LIAM: That's a save. 
MATT: And 20. 
LIAM: That's a save. 
MATT: Okay. You see, he hits back, he finishes the last couple of attacks on you and goes (chuckles). (guttural screams) When he starts screaming, you see, much like his vidulch, the armored flaps on his neck streak outward and this loud noise, shrill, pierces outward. The ground begins to (intensifying rumble). You hear in your heads once more, "Join, join the dinnertime." The ground over by Grog (rumbles) (explosion) bursts out, and you watch as this massive, strange invertebrate worm armored creature with spines along its body burst out of the ground-- 
MARISHA: What is happening? 
MATT: -- and look down. 
SAM: Oh god. (screaming) 
LIAM: Oh, that is horrific. Those black spine-- 
TRAVIS: What the shit? 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: This is "Clash of the Titans". 
ROBBIE: Wow. 
MATT: "Vorak, take your pick." 
TRAVIS: (shrilly) Vorak? 
SAM: Vorak? 
MATT: As the creature turns its head down in your direction, Grog, you can see its mouth opens wide, and there are dozens of smaller arm-like tendrils like (wet flutters) reaching out from inside. 
ASHLEY: (screams) 
TRAVIS: No, no, no. 
MATT: It's going to take its action on you. 
ALL: No! 
LAURA: I think you think we're better than we are, Matt. (laughter) 
LIAM: That's what the nuns told me sex was like. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Wow. 
TALIESIN: How did they know? Jesus. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: While you were not present, this is roughly the size of the tunnel that you guys had walked through on Ruidus. (knowing ooh) 
ROBBIE: Ah. 
LAURA: Shit. 
MATT: So it's going to go ahead. Yeah, Vorak, Ozo's bane worm, is going to make two strikes on you, Grog. 
TRAVIS: Jeez. 
SAM: Dildo nightmares. (laughter) 
MATT: First attack on you, with disadvantage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MARISHA: I know (laughs). 
MATT: Is going to be 19 to hit? 
TRAVIS: Oh, that's my AC. 
MATT: Yeah, so that hits you. You take-- 
ASHLEY: Oh, the gold. That is so gross. 
MATT: Oh, that's kind of a shitty roll. That's 29 points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Reduced to half because you're raging. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: So that'll be-- 
TRAVIS: 18? 
MATT: No, it'd be 14. 
TRAVIS: 14, sorry. 
MATT: 14 points to you. 
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. 
MATT: Succeed on a dexterity save for me, if you don't mind. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 18. 
MATT: 18? 
TRAVIS: 18. 
MATT: As it smashes towards you and the hands reach for you, you can feel the ends of these weird finger tendrils that come out of its mouth are all serrated and dragging across your flesh, which is where all the piercing damage comes from, and its mouth begins to close around you, but in that moment where the darkness almost swallows you whole, you pull out of the way and manage to avoid being consumed. 
TRAVIS: Holy shit. 
LIAM: Wow. An Enlarged Grog almost get swallowed. 
TRAVIS: Is he within five feet of me or does he have this crazy 15-foot like? 
MATT: I mean, he emerged, you know, right next to you. 
TRAVIS: Can I use my reaction to use a retaliation strike against him to fight off this crazy-ass beastie? 
MATT: Yes, you can. 
TRAVIS: 16, that's 22. 26 to hit? 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Okay, great. It's just one. So that is, oh yeah, 11, so 21. 27 plus four, 31 points of damage with four points of necrotic damage. 
MATT: Nice. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: Heavy strike carves through and parts of its exposed body (flesh squelching) send off this really thick, almost maple syrup-consistency ichor that (squelching) scatters across the sand and darkens it immediately on contact. 
TRAVIS: He's coming back for more. 
MATT: At that point, it's going to use its second attack to use bane spines. All of its armored body pulls in tight and contracts before releasing and you watch as a number of its exterior spines shoot off in a 15-foot radius. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god. 
MATT: Since you're the only one within that 15-foot radius, make another dexterity save for me. 
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 
LIAM: Did the little baddies on the other side of it get pincushioned? 
MATT: You know what? That guy is-- 
TALIESIN: Tough call. 
MATT: Oh, he's just out of it. He's about 20 feet away, yeah. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
MATT: 19 succeeds, so you only take half damage and are not poisoned. 
LIAM: The flaccid wrinkles on this side of the worm are nauseating. 
TRAVIS: Flaccid! 
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. 
MATT: I know. 
LIAM: (raspberries) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: 23, reduced to half because you succeeded, would be 11, reduced to half because you are raging, so you take five points of piercing damage. That's going to finish off Vorak's turn. Cerkonos, you're up with Pike on deck. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: Let's go, Cerkonos. 
TRAVIS: With a little espresso. 
ROBBIE: Sure, sure! 
LIAM: Let's go! 
TRAVIS: A little espresso. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, it's all over. 
TRAVIS: My Americano! 
LIAM: Is it me now? 
ROBBIE: If I could use my movement to-- Can I mantle this wall and try to climb up here? 
MATT: As a fire elemental? Yeah. You (fire whooshing). 
TRAVIS: What's a mantle? 
ROBBIE: (laughs) Two meanings as a fire-- 
MARISHA: Wait, where do you want to go? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Basically right up there, yeah, yeah. So it looks like that wall is on fire as it lands up on there. 
MATT: Awesome. 
ROBBIE: I'd like to try to get within maybe 15 feet of him, sort of? 
MATT: You probably get right at the edge of there. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, face to face. Then he's going to raise his big fire arms out and you see these little sparks (popping) and five little fireballs shoot up, and as you see it, it materializes because I'm going to cast at level five Conjure Animals. 
TRAVIS: Huh? 
TALIESIN: Oh no. They take the form of these little peregrine falcons. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Fastest bird on the planet! 
LAURA: Fastest bird! 
ROBBIE: 246 miles per hour, baby, I looked it up! (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah. Let's get more things on the board. Let me see-- 
ROBBIE: I can theater of mind this if you need it. 
MATT: No, no, no. It's all good, let's go, I can make this work. 
TRAVIS: They designed the SR-71 Blackbird intake turbines after the peregrine falcon's nostril holes. 
SAM: Wow. 
MATT: That makes sense. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that's pretty sweet. 
TALIESIN: Nerd! 
MARISHA: Nerd. 
ASHLEY: Nerd! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: If a human traveled-- 
TRAVIS: Military fact check. Yeah! 
LAURA: -- at that speed, the flesh would rip off of its body. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MARISHA: Wow, wow. 
TALIESIN: That's not a military fact. That's a bird fact. 
MATT: Here we go. We'll use all of these little guys here. 
ROBBIE: Sure, sure, they're my little homies. 
TALIESIN: Cat facts. 
ROBBIE: If I move on my turn while I cast it, I can send them out up to 30 feet? 
MATT: Are they going up to here? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, I'm going to send them-- 
SAM: You've shown me nothing. 
ROBBIE: With Vex there it's tough, but I want to try to send them bombing in a line right like that. 
TRAVIS: Yes. 
ROBBIE: So where they're going to avoid hitting Vex but potentially have to make the Sunder King and his mount do a dex save. 
MATT: Sure, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. So, it would be when they come within 10 feet of them, it's 19 dex. 
MATT: All right. 
ROBBIE: For both of them. 
MATT: He's going to go ahead and take his. For each one of them? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, I think so. Let me double check. 
LIAM: How do they behave? Do they behave like familiars? Can they do the help action? 
ROBBIE: It's basically I can move them, and then they take X amount of damage basing what level I set them on. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: So whenever your pack moves within 10 feet of a creature you can see, of a creature. I wonder if that's one or, yeah. 
MATT: Of a creature, any creature that moves through it, yeah. 
ROBBIE: A creature. I'll pick the Sunder King for sure. 
MATT: Well, it's whenever it moves within of a creature, meaning if it moves through multiple-- 
ROBBIE: It's all. 
MATT: That makes sense to me. 
ROBBIE: Okay, yeah, cool. All right. 
MATT: All right, so the Sunder King we'll do first. 
ROBBIE: 19 dex save. 
MATT: 19 dex save, I'll roll five dice for him right now. Okay, the ones that look viable are going to be a 20 and a 22. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah, they both saved. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: The others are going to be the highest is a 15. 
ROBBIE: That one does not. 
MATT: Yeah. So three of them go through. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: How much damage is that to him? 
ROBBIE: Oh for-- 
ASHLEY: Wait. 
ROBBIE: Oh, wait. I think it's one total for the whole pack. 
MATT: Oh, okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, it's one dex save for the whole pack. 
MATT: Got it, okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: That's going to be an eight. 
ROBBIE: Okay, yeah. So that one fails. 
MATT: Yup. 
ROBBIE: So then it's 5d10. 
MATT: Roll 5d10 fire damage. 
TALIESIN: Bless you. 
MATT: And then I'll roll for the-- Oh, it's a natural two for Scrag. So both of them take the fire damage. 
ROBBIE: Eight, six, 14, 19, 23. 24, it's actually technically-- (nerdy voice) Technically-- (laughter) I think it's slashing-- 
MATT: Oh, is it slashing damage? 
ROBBIE: Slashing damage, yeah. 
MATT: Okay, that's fine. They both take slashing damage. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: (falcons scratching) As they all arc by, the bladed movement of these incredibly fast creatures that you summoned (falcons whooshing) arcing past and through and are floating now around the wings, these strange veined wings of Scrag that are (flutters) as it's not currently flying at the moment. The blading streaks by and Ozo (grunts) looks up and sees you. It doesn't seem to pay mind other than the wounds it took. It has one eye on you before the other begins to shift back towards Vex'ahlia with his mace in his right hand. He gives you a little bit with his bladed arm a come hither hand motion. 
LAURA: Can I ask you before you move on? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: The blade that's through me right now. 
MATT: He pulled it free from you. 
LAURA: Thank you. 
MATT: Yeah. He essentially, when he dragged you in psychically pulling the blade back-- 
LAURA: Pulled it out? - and pulling you with it, he pulled it out as you arrived and then hit you with the mace. 
LAURA: Got it, thank you. 
MATT: Yeah, all right. So that's going to finish that action. That's your turn? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that ends it for me. 
MATT: All right, great. Finishing your up, Pike, you're up. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: So, what I would like to do-- 
SAM: By Ashley Johnson. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All right. I'm over here, okay. I would like to-- 
SAM: You going to walk in? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I want to stay tucked. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
ASHLEY: But I want to do a Sunburst on the Malleus Key. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Okay. What's the range on that? 
ASHLEY: It is 150 feet, but it's a 60-foot radius. 
MATT: Okay. It's 150 feet. This is 85. You'd have to get a little bit closer to hit that range. 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll get within range. 
MATT: It'll be 20 feet this way to get in range, and you'll be just out of the combat range of the vidulch. 
ASHLEY: I'll do it, I'll do it. 
MATT: All right. Marisha, if you could help move Pike four spaces this way at an angle. 
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, like that? 
MATT: One more. 
ASHLEY: I have 40 feet of movement with the wings. 
MATT: Correct. Do you want to keep moving or do you want to stay put? 
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll stay there. 
MATT: Up to you. Okay. 
ASHLEY: So where's Team Malleus Key around there? 
MATT: From what you can see, the only one that you see is flying on this side. You see the conjured three-headed raven of Lieve'tel currently flying up on this side of the tower. 
ASHLEY: Okay, because if there's some way I can do this without hitting everybody and just focusing on the Malleus Key, I would like to try. 
MATT: Okay. So you are focusing in this area? It's a 60-foot radius, you said? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so you want to flash out from the top outward. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: And get all those fucks. 
ASHLEY: Flash out from the top. 
MATT: Okay, it's a 60-foot radius. 
TALIESIN: All those fucks you can get. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
ROBBIE: Sweet. 
MATT: -- probably right there. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: In which case, you're missing Lieve'tel and her conjuration, but you're hitting everything else in this area. 
SAM: Damn. 
TALIESIN: Woo! 
MATT: Including not Ozo, but you are getting his Scrag. 
TRAVIS: Scrag! 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LIAM: Scrag's ass. 
TALIESIN: Fucking badass. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
LAURA: Are you hitting? What are you hitting? 
ASHLEY: Okay, help me with some math. 
TRAVIS: I got you. 
MARISHA: What spell is it? 
SAM: I don't know if you're-- 
ASHLEY: It's 12d6 radiant damage. 
SAM: -- the best person for that job. (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Fuck. 
MARISHA: Cool. 
TRAVIS: That's right. 
TALIESIN: Okay, okay. 
TRAVIS: A minus. Triangle. 
LAURA: ♪ Radiant damage ♪ 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: The Everlight bless us on this day. 
ASHLEY: Well, what balls rolls. 
TRAVIS and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
ASHLEY: Aw, okay. So we got. 
TRAVIS: Nine, 19. What are those fucking tiny-ass-- 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I know. 
TRAVIS: 22. Okay, 28. 
SAM: While they're adding, this combat is brought to you by WizKids and their Bells Hells box set. Available now. Enhance your home games with "Critical Role" minis by WizKids, available at wizkids.io/crminis and your local game store. 
ASHLEY: All right, that's 32 points of radiant damage. 
MATT: 32 points of radiant damage. All right, let's go ahead and roll for everybody that's in that radius. So we'll start with Scrag over here. 
LIAM: Take that, Scragisil. 
MATT: 32, you said? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Natural one. 
ASHLEY: Yay. 
TALIESIN: Ooh. 
MATT: Scrag takes 32 points-- 
ROBBIE: Ooh! 
SAM: What's the save? 
MATT: -- of radiant damage. 
ASHLEY: Constitution 19. 
MATT: This guy up here in the front. That's going to be a 19. 
ASHLEY: That just makes it. 
MATT: So 19 is your spell DC? 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So he takes half damage. He's looking pretty hurt. All right. This guy over here. That's going to be an 18. 18 fails. 
ASHLEY: Fails. 
MATT: All right, so he took some fire damage. He gets blasted into ash from that. Gets scattered aside. This guy over here. He fails as well. It's 32, right? 
ASHLEY: 32. 
SAM: Six? 32. 
MATT: Was it 36? 
TRAVIS: 32. 
MATT: 32, yeah. He takes 32 points of radiant damage. He is singed badly by it. Over there, that fellow is going to be a natural 20. So he takes half of that. He takes 16 on that end but is still injured by it. This guy back here on that side. He fails and he takes-- He is hurt pretty bad. The guy at the top there. He's going to fail as well. So he takes 32. 
LIAM: Have you taken any damage? 
SAM: No. 
TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: All righty, so that blasts that. That light (exploding) burst of light-- 
ASHLEY: Does the Key take any damage at all? 
MATT: Hmm? 
ASHLEY: Does the Key, because I was also trying to just-- 
SAM: The tower? 
ASHLEY: The tower, sorry. 
MATT: The tower? It is a sunburst of radiant energy. Here's what I'll say. It does not damage the tower. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: But what it does is it is a very bright burst of light, which lights up all the nooks and crannies of its odd, maze-like construction. So I'll say for the next round, anybody who wants to inspect the tower gets to do so at advantage because of your burst. 
SAM: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Cool, okay. 
MATT: So that's what I'll say, because I'll say the tower probably would not be subjected to the radiant damage of the Sunburst. 
SAM: It's okay. 
MATT: However, the effect of Sunburst is on a failed save, they are blinded for one minute, right? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: So for that-- 
LIAM: It's a DC 19. 
LAURA: Scrag is blinded? 
MATT: Scrag is blinded. 
LIAM: (monster screech) 
MATT: Blinded. 
TRAVIS: ♪ Blinded by the light ♪ 
MARISHA: ♪ Revved up like a douche ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ In the middle of the night ♪ 
MATT: Blinded. 
SAM: Scrag didn't have any sort of legendary reaction to that, did it? 
LAURA: Yeah, it did. Scrag fucking did a poison cone and also-- 
SAM: No, but legendary-- 
MATT: That was the end of its action. 
LAURA: Oh. 
SAM: Legendary save. 
MATT: All right, Pike, does that finish your turn? 
ASHLEY: Yes. 
LAURA: Don't say that. 
ASHLEY: That finishes my turn. 
SAM: No, no, no, I want to know that. 
MATT: All right, end of your turn Ozo is going to go ahead and use his legendary action. 
SAM: What? 
TRAVIS: I don't understand. 
LAURA: Ozo is the guy on Scrag? 
MATT: Mm-hmm. Is going to use-- 
LIAM: Ozo and his mount are-- 
LAURA: Ozo is, when was his turn? Was it after-- 
SAM: Special agent Ozo? 
MATT: Ozo was after Scanlan. He spends all three of his legendary actions on-- 
LAURA: All three? 
MATT: "Feast, my pets." Both Scrag and Vorak both get to make an immediate melee attack. 
LAURA and ROBBIE: (groan) 
MATT: So, Vorak is going to spin around this way. 
LIAM: Jeez. (grunts and groans) That is the deluxe monster for any toy in the '80s. 
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ASHLEY: It's so cool. 
LAURA: It's amazing. 
MATT: Making up for all the toys my parents couldn't afford when I was a kid. 
LIAM: Aw. (laughter) 
MATT: He's going to turn and going to go try and take a mandible bite on you, Percy. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: It has disadvantage. It is blinded. However, it does have blindsight. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: But he's still at disadvantage anyway. 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Well. 
TALIESIN: I thought it might. 
MATT: So, against you, that's going to be-- 
LIAM: If Lieve gets clocked really hard, we'll be glad people are blind. 
MATT: -- 19 to hit? 
TALIESIN: Fuck a duck. 
MATT: Does that hit? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Just barely. 
MATT: That's all right. 
TALIESIN: Bring it. 
MATT: From its mandibles… Ooh. 34 points of piercing damage. 
TALIESIN: Ew. 
MATT: Along with-- 
TALIESIN: Along with? 
MATT: Oh, that's a bad roll. 13 points of acid damage. 
TALIESIN: Okay. I hate that. That's awful. 
MATT: I need you to make a strength saving throw for me. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Strength saving throw, at advantage. 
MARISHA: You have advantage. 
TALIESIN: No, please, thank you. 
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and ROBBIE: (mumbling) Advantage! 
MARISHA: Don't die! 
TALIESIN: Oh thank god, because I rolled a one. 19? 
MATT: 19 succeeds. You are not pulled into its mandibles and restrained. 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Cool. 
MARISHA: I think that's a seven. I think you actually rolled a seven. 
TALIESIN: No-- 
SAM: But it doesn't matter. He rolled higher on the other dice. 
MARISHA: It doesn't matter, he rolled higher. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Well, that's okay. Yeah, thank you. Again, yeah, thank you. This is where I'm at. 
MATT: All righty. Finishing that go, Vorak is going to make another attack on you, Grog, with disadvantage. 
SAM: Okay, okay. 
MATT: Disadvantage, it's going to be a 20? 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: Hits, okay. So with that, another grasping bite on you. 
TRAVIS: (yells) 
SAM: Four points of damage. 
MATT: 28 points of piercing damage. 
SAM: Halved, halved, halved, halved. 
MATT: So 28 points of piercing damage reduced to 14. So you take 14 points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: Nice. 
MATT: I need you to make another strength saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Sorry, dexterity saving throw. 
TRAVIS: Dexterity saving. 
MATT: Which you have advantage on, because you are a barbarian. 
TRAVIS: Oh, not good. 
MATT: Did you roll with advantage? 
TRAVIS: Yup. A four and a three. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That's a six. 
SAM and LAURA: (groan) 
MATT: As Grog is slamming his axe into this creature, feasting time indeed has begun as Vorak (jaws chomp) bites down on Grog and pulls back and Grog is nowhere in sight. 
LAURA: No! 
ASHLEY: No! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: Get me closer. (laughter) 
LIAM: That's a first. 
ROBBIE: As close as you can get. 
MATT: That is all of the Sunder King's legendary actions to do that. 
MARISHA: I don't think he's ever fought anything big enough to eat him. 
MATT: The Vanguard that are blind, this one's going to rush off in this direction. He did not see Grog get eaten, so he's going to run over this way and dash to try and get to where he is, but he doesn't know where Grog is. This gentleman here is going to rush over this way to join the fray and then trip and fall and then dash over and that's his turn. 
LIAM: One of these guys just ran into a rock. 
MATT: He's "(yells)." 
MARISHA: Imagine for Keyleth this sounds like living on the bottom floor of an apartment complex that's like. 
MATT: This one here is going to put its back against the side, put its shield up, and get out of any eyesight and is holding down to defend the stairs. 
LIAM: This thing went past you. 
MATT: This one here is going to move over to here because it sees Lieve'tel currently flying up in the air by the front there, and is going to attempt to shoot a jagged dart at you, two jagged darts. 
LIAM: Great. 
MATT: Disadvantage of each. First one is going to be-- You guys have avoided some natural 20s because of that disadvantage. It's good. 
LAURA: That's good. 
MATT: 22 to hit? 
LIAM: Yes, hits. 
MATT: You take eight points of piercing damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw. The second one is a 14 to hit. 
LIAM: Misses. That's really high. That is a 21. 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. The one up top here can't quite get to you, but it's going to go ahead and-- Actually, it's on top and it's blind at the moment, and it knows it's the top of the stairs. 
SAM: Is it going to try? 
TRAVIS: Is he going to feel around with his foot. 
MATT: It's going to try and-- 
TRAVIS: Should've put handrails. (laughter) 
MATT: Here's what I'm going to say. Because this is fun because you guys put this on here. Since you're the one that cast it to make them blind-- No, the blindsight is you from the-- 
LAURA: Oh, that's true. 
MATT: So roll 2d20s for me. You're rolling perception with disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: On them. So roll and add three with disadvantage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 12. 
MATT: 12. Takes a few steps here and then (shouts) (plummets) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TALIESIN: Oh, it's the little things. 
MATT: For another six points-- 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
MATT: -- six points of bludgeoning damage. Crack! Hits it and is like-- 
TRAVIS: Thank you! 
MATT: It is really hurt, and prone. That's its turn. (laughs) All right, that finishes their go. Now the Thought Eater's go. 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
LIAM: Jesus! 
MATT: So this Thought Eater, let's put him on this side. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, don't worry. Round one's over soon. 
MATT: I know. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Is this all happening after Pike? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, still round one. 
LAURA and ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Okay, so I'm going to put: Pike, a bunch of stuff. 
TRAVIS: All bad. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Actually, that's a bunch of-- 
LAURA: But it was because Ozo took his legendary actions, three legendary actions at the end of Pike's turn. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: This one here-- 
MARISHA: Ozo Cruth? 
MATT: -- is going to focus in the center of the beam where it's crackling upward. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: It's going to channel its attention through that focal point to give it an extended range on what it's doing. 
LAURA: That's a cool thought. 
MATT: To that point, it's going to-- 
MARISHA: Wait, through one of the little ballies? 
LAURA: Through all of them combined. He's using it to amplify his spells. 
MARISHA: That's really cool. 
MATT: It's going to attempt to Mind Ravage Pike, since Pike's the one that blasted out the thing. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: Its range is absurd, so you are definitely in the way. It has disadvantage to strike you, though. Fucking-- You guys, there's so many natural 20s that have been ignored because of this. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: Holy shit! It's still a 21 to hit. 
ASHLEY: Nope. 
MATT: Nope! 
ROBBIE: What? 
MATT: So its first Mind Ravage misses. It's going to go for a second one, angrily. 
ASHLEY: (wails) 
MATT: You glance over in the direction. You see glowing and this weird pulsing, almost like an extension of a shock wave (rapidly approaching strike) heading towards you. It gleans off your armor and hits the ground. A second one's coming towards you. That one is going to be a 23? 
ASHLEY: That just hits. 
MATT: Oh! Okay. It gets you once. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That Mind Ravage is going to hit you for 22 points of psychic damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: And you cannot take reactions until the end of its next turn. 
ASHLEY: Boo! 
MATT: As your brain is (electric sparks) suddenly blasted with angry psychic energy. 
ASHLEY: Ow, ow, ow! 
MATT: All righty. This one over here is, since it's only within range of you, Lieve'tel. You rushed to the key, man. They're all right there. 
LIAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
MATT: It's going to attempt to Psychic Slam you off of your mount. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
LIAM: Baja Blast, here it comes. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MATT: Ooh, another natural 20, and then followed by 16. 
MARISHA: What the what? 
MATT: Plus 10. So 26 to hit. 
LIAM: Definitely hits. 
MATT: All right. So you take-- 
MARISHA: How are you feeling? 
LIAM: I'm feeling it. 
MATT: 12 points of psychic damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: I need you to make a-- No, you're just moving 15 feet of its choice. 
LIAM: Again, I gave myself 120-- 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
LIAM: -- temporary hit points that are gone, and I've dipped below. 
TRAVIS: Lieve'tel usually survives. 
MATT: So you get-- 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: -- yanked off of your mount and you plummet to the ground. Make an acrobatics check for me. 
TALIESIN: He Wile E. Coyote-d you. 
LAURA: You got this. 
LIAM: What was the damage for the psychic? It was 12, you said? 
MATT: Yes. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay. This is a save? 
MATT: This is an acrobatics check. 
LIAM: Acrobatics check. 
SAM: Don't we have potions? We have potions. 
LIAM: Oh, that's not great. 
LAURA: Do we? 
LIAM: That's an eight. 
SAM: Oh, wait. Was that Bells Hells? 
MATT: An eight? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Shit! 
MATT: You take three points of bludgeoning damage from the impact and you do land prone. 
LIAM: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: From there, with its secondary attack, it's going to lean over and it's going to attempt to Psychic Ravage you while you're on the ground with disadvantage on that. That's going to be-- Yeah, that's 11. 20? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: 20 hits you? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So your mind is suddenly assaulted by its psychic capabilities tearing into you for-- 
SAM: Wait, this is the second attack against her? 
MATT: 15 points of psychic damage. Yes. And you cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: Did I see or hear that second attack? 
LIAM: I'm crashing to the ground in front of your location. 
MATT: You watch Lieve'tel (impact) slam into the ground, bounce on the ground, and then hit, and then suddenly clutch her head. You do not see anything else coming for her. 
SAM: So I can't Counterspell the attack, since I don't see where it's coming from. 
MATT: You cannot see anything. You're hiding in the corner, which makes you-- 
SAM: Can I-- I can't Cutting Words it because I can't see the attacker. Okay, great. 
MATT: Unfortunately, yeah. 
SAM: I should get out in the open now. 
MATT: But I need you to make two constitution saving throws. Technically three, because you were hit three times. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LIAM: Okay, I save on the first. Well, I don't know. It's a 19 on the first. 
MATT: All the damage was low enough where you just need to roll a 10 or higher. 
LIAM: Okay. All right. 
TALIESIN: One round. I love it. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Like so, so close. 
LIAM: Second one is a fail. 
MATT: Really? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. Holy Aura drops. 
LIAM: 8th-level spell, guys. 
TRAVIS: On all of us? 
SAM: Oh no! 
LIAM: Yup. 
ASHLEY: Shit! 
ROBBIE: No! Oh! 
MATT: You all feel the protection of the aura fade from you as a little candle light-- 
LAURA: Fuck. Things aren't at disadvantage anymore. 
LIAM: I am full of benefits for you. Don't-- 
MARISHA: You dropped? You dropped? 
SAM: We're not going to let you die! 
TALIESIN: No. 
TRAVIS: Where are you? 
LIAM: This time. 
TRAVIS: You're right at the thing? 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm at the base of the-- 
MATT: Right at the base. 
TRAVIS: How'd you get up there so close to all the bad stuff? 
ROBBIE: Chetney? 
TRAVIS: Why am I out here? 
SAM: You flew. 
ROBBIE: Aren't you on the moon? 
MARISHA: So wait, your Holy Aura-- 
MATT: Chetney is a little further. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! (laughs) 
MARISHA: Because you lost concentration? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MARISHA: Fuck! 
LIAM: Yes. 
ROBBIE: (sighs) 
ASHLEY: ♪ This time I'm making it ♪ 
ROBBIE: We only had it for a minute. 
MATT: That's going to finish their turn. Back at the top. Percy, you're up with Vex on deck. 
MARISHA: Six seconds. 
ROBBIE: That's right, six seconds. 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! This is-- 
LAURA: Fuck! 
ASHLEY: This is taking a turn here. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so-- 
MARISHA: Yeah, each round is six seconds. 
SAM: You know, it's a rollercoaster. 
TALIESIN: So if I have Quick Study, can I use a bonus action to take a look and study, or am I too far away to take a good look at that? 
MATT: Because of her spell, it is, based on a-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: It's from the best-- 
MATT: So are you trying to inspect its construction, make? What are you looking for? 
TALIESIN: I'm looking for-- 
MATT: That'll change the roll. 
TALIESIN: I'm looking for weaknesses. I'm looking for objects that clearly can be-- I have a sense of we're supposed to remove some sort of source. 
MATT: Okay, perception or investigation check. Your call. 
TALIESIN: That would be-- 
MATT: You have an advantage on this because of your Sunburst last round. 
TALIESIN: That would be investigation. Yes, that would be investigation. 
MATT: All right, roll an investigation check with advantage. 
TALIESIN: Come on, Percy. Do what you do. Yeah, it's not bad. Investigation. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: 19, 20, 28. 
MATT: 28. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: You glance over and see, as the glow is dissipating from that Sunburst, you can see throughout all the spider webbing network of arcane runes that weave through it, all them seem to push to two certain points on the tower. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: There's one right over here, and there's one right below where the glow of the Bloody Bridge is. So you know these two points here are important, right here and right here. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: That's what you're able to ascertain from your distance. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay. Just making a point. 
SAM: Stick to the plan. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LAURA: Those are the points. 
TALIESIN: So that's perception. Do I still have my whole turn or did that burn something? Up to you. 
SAM: What else would we do? 
TALIESIN: Up to you. 
MATT: You glance over, it's glowing, you take it in there. I'll say it'll burn a bonus action. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: I'll allow that. 
TALIESIN: That's fine. 
MATT: You're level 20. You can glance at things and pick it up pretty quickly. You're Percy fucking de Rolo. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, technically, yeah, Quick Study is a bonus action. So that would make sense. 
MATT: Oh yeah! Quick Study. Yeah, you're fine. 
TALIESIN: All right. I've got that fucker. Oh, and also, where's my toy? Where's-- 
TRAVIS: Underneath the lobsters. 
SAM: Oh, that's right! 
TALIESIN: Where's Anders? Can I see him between the legs, or no? 
MATT: You can see him, he's like-- (clacking) 
TALIESIN: So how far away is that toy from me right now? I'm so sorry to ask you that. 
MATT: From you? It's about-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to see where it's sitting. 
MATT: It's about 20 feet from you. Here, I'll put it right there. 
TALIESIN: All right, so about 20 feet from me? 
SAM: Hello, I am Stephen Root. 
TALIESIN: I call it 20. All right. 
SAM: Hello, I am Stephen Root. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: These guys, how fearsome do these guys look, and did it look like he's looking rough, or is he fine up there? 
MATT: He's looking pretty rough. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Vex fucked him up at the very beginning. 
LAURA: Also, Vex forgot to take her second shot at him on that first round. 
TALIESIN: I can hear all this. 
SAM: Don't worry, Vex. 
MATT: It's fine. We'll get the-- 
LAURA: So he would be fucking dead, probably, and then Lieve'tel would be fine. 
MATT: This guy is very blind and stumbling. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: That Shrike is dangerous. You see a Reiloran rushing towards you-- 
SAM: Why do you seem so angry at us-- 
MATT: -- surrounded in serrated in serrated bladed chains. 
SAM: -- for your mistakes? 
MATT: It's moving quickly, and it looks like it's whirling the chain around it psychically while having arm blades, like Predator, out at the ready. 
TALIESIN: (joyless chuckle) All right. I suppose we're doing this. I'm going to step a little bit around. I'm not leave leaving his-- Yeah, I'm going right there, so that-- 
MATT: Right here? 
TALIESIN: Yep. Right there. 
MATT: So you're up right next to both of them. 
TALIESIN: Hopping in, I am pulling out my walking stick. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Giving a little tap, suddenly-- 
SAM: Is that what you call it? 
TALIESIN: -- about 60-- Actually, it has a name. 
TRAVIS: You didn't want to introduce us to it? (laughter) 
TALIESIN: No, we're going. I pull out my Graythorn stick, give it a little tap, about-- 
MARISHA: That's a good one. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: -- 100 little tiny razor blades pop out. I look for a soft point, and I'm going to take a slashing attack. 
MATT: Okay, at which one? The blind one or the-- 
TALIESIN: No, the one right-- 
MATT: The Shrike. Okay, go for it. 
TALIESIN: The Shrike. 
LIAM: Graythorn, so the curtains match the drapes? 
TALIESIN: No advantage on this, I assume. 
MATT: Not against the Shrike, no. 
TALIESIN: Not against the Shrike. Okay. Let's see what happens. 19? 19? Oh, wait. 13, 17. 
MATT: 17? Just misses. 
TALIESIN: All right. That's one attack. 
MATT: It's quick. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another attack. That hits. 17, 27, 30. 
MATT: Yeah, that hits. 
TALIESIN: All right, so that's 1d8. New toy. That's just going to be-- 
MATT: Vex, then Keyleth coming up next. 
TALIESIN: 10 points of damage. 
MATT: All right, 10 points damage to it. (slices) Takes the hit. 
TALIESIN: I'm then going to fencing stab it forward and pull a little hidden trigger. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: I am going to shoot him with the gray thorn stick. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a point for Forceful Shot. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Burning a point of grit. Please, man, don't fuck this up. That's 15, 23? 
MATT: 23 hits. 
TALIESIN: All right. He has to make a con save against 20. 
MATT: Fail! 
TALIESIN: I'm sorry. Yeah. 
MATT: Big fail. 
TALIESIN: Okay, he fails. Yeah. Con save against 20. Or I'm sorry, strength save against 20. 
MATT: Same. Fail. 
TALIESIN: Okay. So that's-- 
MATT: One less. 
TALIESIN: He takes-- 
MATT: These guys are quick but not very strong. 
TALIESIN: Boo! That's bullshit. 
MARISHA: (laughs) Boo. 
TALIESIN: He takes eight points of damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: He's pushed 15 feet back. 
MATT: All right, so he's blasted back underneath, which by the way, Scrag is so big that you can move underneath it. 
SAM: Cool. 
TALIESIN: I was trying to shoot him directly towards my toy, if that's okay. 
MATT: Yeah. How far does it shoot him? 
TALIESIN: 15 feet. 
MATT: 15 feet would be five, 10, 15. So he is right next to it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: It doesn't impact it. 
TALIESIN: Perfect. All right. So that's been spent until I reload it. Now, I'm going to put that away, pull out Animus, and take a shot at my toy. and take a shot at my toy. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: With my fourth attack. 
MATT: You got it. 
LIAM: Where on the field is that toy? 
MATT: Right underneath Scrag, right there. 
TALIESIN: That's 17, which-- 
MATT: You definitely strike it. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: You don't have to roll damage. 
TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: You set off the small windup Anders. 
TALIESIN: (boof) Anders does-- 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Anders! 
TALIESIN: Professor Anders does-- 
SAM: I'm Mr. Groot. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: The glass beaker breaks and it's filled with a deadly toxin, which a 15 feet cloud. It's a DC 15 con save. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: For anything within 15-- 
MATT: Correct. So that would be the shrike and Scrag. 
TALIESIN: Awesome! 
MATT: So, Reiloran. It's going to be a 12. It fails. 
SAM: Hey, that's great! 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Scrag is going to be 13. 
SAM: Hey! 
MATT: So both fail. 
TALIESIN: Eight points of poison damage. 
MATT: All righty. Go ahead and roll-- 
TALIESIN: They are poisoned until the end of my next turn. 
MATT: That's eight points. 
SAM: Hey! That's good! 
TRAVIS: Points every round? 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: All right. 
TALIESIN: They're poisoned. Yeah, they're poisoned through until my turn's over. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: It takes, and they are both poisoned. 
TALIESIN: Not quite done. They're poisoned. They're not dead, though. 
MATT: No. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Of course not. 
MATT: As the toxin spills, Scrag (sputtering coughs) and this thick, darkened slime start spitting from it. It is actually poisoned until the next round. 
TALIESIN: Awesome! I'm going to… 
LIAM: Shrike survived? 
MATT: The Shrike survived, but it's hurt. 
LIAM: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I can walk away from him. Yeah, I'm going to back up. That guy's blind, right? So he has disadvantage if he takes a reaction to hit me. 
MATT: Yep. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up. Let's back up 30. Yeah. 
MATT: That'll get you there. All right, he's going to swipe towards you with a disadvantage. Double 19s. 
TALIESIN: He hits. Holy shit! 
MATT: So I'm going to say, yeah, he hits you. 
TALIESIN: I should have fucked with him. I feel bad. 
MATT: It's okay. Although, it does three points of slashing damage. 
TALIESIN: Ow! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: API! 
MATT: "I got something! I got something!" 
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck sakes! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: All right, that's my turn. 
MATT: All right, Percy's done. Vex is up, Keyleth on deck. 
LAURA: Sorry, my-- 
TRAVIS: We might need physical character sheets because D&D Beyond-- 
MARISHA: We have a-- 
LAURA: Yeah, D&D Beyond is-- 
TRAVIS: API check. 
LAURA: -- pooped out. It keeps giving us The Beholder. 
MATT: Oh boy! 
LAURA: Yeah, but-- 
TALIESIN: I'm dropping-- 
ASHLEY: Great timing. Great timing. 
MARISHA: Kyle! I'll Slack him. 
LAURA: Let's see. Wait. It's loading now. See if it loads up. 
TRAVIS: I haven't been able to get mine for the last half hour. 
TALIESIN: Oh, and while they're doing this, I'm going to let everyone know: there's weak points in the tower, approximately five feet down-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: -- from the circle, on the right, facing forward, and then another five feet clockwise around the corner. 
ASHLEY: Got it! 
LAURA: Got-- 
SAM: That was very clear. We understood. 
TALIESIN: Five feet down, five feet from the right from the center, you idiots! 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Broken up with the sounds of slashing and gun bursts. 
LAURA: (metal clanging) 
SAM: Five feet down, five feet down, five feet down. Got it. 
LAURA: Five feet, five feet, five feet. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. 
MATT: Yes. 
SAM: By Ashley Johnson. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Pixy Sticks, all of you. 
LAURA: I'm going to hold onto my necklace-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: -- and say: It's time for a little protection, buddy. I'm going to bamf Trinket out with my free action to where he's directly behind Ozo. 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MARISHA: Oh! 
SAM: We're safe. We're saved. 
LAURA: I want him to clutch onto Ozo. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LIAM: Help action. 
LAURA: Listen. 
TRAVIS: Oh man! Look at that bear. 
LAURA: Then bonus action. 
MATT: (growls) 
ASHLEY: Biggy! 
LAURA: I'm going to disengage. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And I'm going to fly off of the fucking thing. 
MATT: (whooshes) All righty. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to fly. 
MATT: To where? 
LAURA: This way. 
MATT: 60 feet is your fly speed, right? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: If I can be, I want to be keeping a distance from that Thought Eater. 
MATT: Okay, so over this way? 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: You can get about there, is where you're going. 
LAURA: Okay. Okay. 60 feet from the saddle and then I am going to Sharpshooter Ozo. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Because Trinket's there, I get Sneak Attack on him now. 
MATT: Correct, you do. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to declare this. I don't know if it's on here. I'm going to do my Bramble Shot from Fenthras. 
MATT: Let's go! 
LAURA: So this is. Okay. Minus five. I don't know what it is. I think that's a 19 to hit. 
MATT: A 19 total? 
LAURA: Total. 
MATT: That misses, unfortunately. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try again. That definitely hits. That's 19 plus. 
MATT: Yeah, that hits. 
LAURA: Okay. So that is a 1d8. Seven plus nine is 16 plus six for the lightning damage of Fenthras. 
MATT: So a total of? 
LAURA: 22. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Then-- 
MATT: Almost out of here. 
LAURA: Wait, I lost-- Then plus 10 because of the Sharpshooter. 
MATT: Right. So, 32. 
LAURA: Then the Bramble Shot. Oh, no, then sneak attack. Let's do that first. 
MATT: Right, sneak attack damage. 
LAURA: Oh, that's great. 18 points of sneak attack. 
MATT: Great. 
LAURA: Then the Bramble Shot-- 
MATT: 50. 
LAURA: -- is a grapple attack. 
MATT: Right. Which does additional damage as well. 
LAURA: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
MATT: Sorry, the timing of that-- 
LAURA: I know. I know. 
MATT: -- damage is-- That's okay, though. I can look up. 
LAURA: Yeah, Fenthras. I don't think Fenthras's stats are on here. 
MATT: It's okay. I've got it here. So it's DC 17. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
LAURA: (giggles) 
SAM: So much math. 
LAURA: Timing. 
MATT: Well, it says-- Here we go. Okay. 
TRAVIS: We are reliant upon--. 
MATT: So, 3d8 piercing damage-- 
TRAVIS: -- D&D Be-- 
MATT: -- from that as well. 
LAURA: 3d8 piercing damage. Got it. 
TALIESIN: That's why I've got my emergency. 
SAM: Yes you do, you're smart. 
MATT: And strength save. 
SAM: Percy's the smart one. 
LAURA: Whoa, that's great. 16 plus six-- 
TALIESIN: Just know that I-- 
LAURA: -- is 22 additional-- 
TALIESIN: -- forget what I have. 
LAURA: -- piercing damage. 
MATT: Whoo-hoo! 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: That is 72 points of damage to him on that one attack. 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
ROBBIE: Heesh. 
SAM: Against who? 
MATT: Against Ozo. He does save against the-- 
LAURA: Grapple. 
MATT: He rolled a 20 for his strength saving throw, so he's not restrained by it. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: But he did take the damage, which is pretty nice. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: You did the additional lightning damage that-- Yeah, you're good. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: All right. Cool. 
LAURA: So that's me? 
MATT: Thank you for waiting for us on that one. That finishes your go? 
LAURA: That's what I can do. 
MATT: Keyleth, you're up. 
LAURA: Trinket jump out. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
SAM: Did you move at all, Laura? Did you move at all? 
MARISHA: She moved. 
LAURA: I did. I moved 60 feet. 
MARISHA: I'm going to continue to glide. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Want to pop up next to Scantaur if I can. 
SAM: Oh, what the fuck is that? 
MARISHA: Do you see the beacon? 
SAM: I'm told that it's five feet down, five feet to the right, five feet down again, five feet to the left. 
LAURA: Five feet down, five feet over. Five feet down, five feet over. 
MARISHA: That makes no sense. 
TALIESIN: From the centerpiece, five feet down, five feet over. 
MARISHA: Should I bring it to us? 
SAM: Yes! 
MARISHA: All right. I apologize. Watch your step. I'm going to-- 
SAM: Did you become Pâté? (laughter) 
MARISHA: Yes. 
ASHLEY: Who's that? 
TALIESIN: It was inevitable. 
ROBBIE: Oh. 
MARISHA: Another campaign. 
TRAVIS: I don't think they can see you. 
MARISHA: So I tried to reach, they'll see me in a second, I want to cast Earthquake. 
SAM: This always goes well. 
MARISHA: I want to cast Earthquake. 
SAM: Uh-huh. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: It's 100 foot radius. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: I think I'm want to do a little bit in front of the tower, here-ish. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Oops. 
SAM: (wheezes) 
ROBBIE: (chuckles) 
MARISHA: Oops. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Percy! 
MARISHA: Percy, I'm sorry. 
ROBBIE: No! 
SAM: Hands-- 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. 
SAM: -- not working. 
MARISHA: I'm shaking. So that maybe-- 
LIAM: Figure it out. 
MARISHA: Figuring it out. 
SAM: Yep. Figuring it out. 
MARISHA: I don't know. 
LAURA: I got to get the beacon. 
MARISHA: I don't know. I'm bringing it down. 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you are. Yeah you are. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
LAURA: But it would-- 
TRAVIS: Go! Go! 
LAURA: But what if it hit the beacon before we-- 
TRAVIS: Go. Go! 
SAM: It might not even fall. 
LAURA: -- before we break it down? 
SAM: It might not even fall. 
LAURA: But what if it does? 
TALIESIN: It ain't going to fall. 
SAM: What if it doesn't? 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: It's a powerful tower. 
MATT: So, casting Earthquake. 
TALIESIN: I don't know-- 
TRAVIS: We're all making choices. 
SAM: I love it. 
MATT: 100 foot radius circle centered on the point. The ground in the entire-- 
MARISHA: We talked with Sam-- 
MATT: -- area becomes-- 
MARISHA: -- about this on the-- 
MATT: -- difficult terrain. 
MARISHA: -- hind side this whole time, I swear. 
MATT: Okay, so everything around becomes difficult terrain. 
SAM: Where did you want to center it, Marish? 
MARISHA: In front of the tower a little bit. 
MATT: In front of the tower there. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Mm. 
LAURA: Why is he speaking-- 
ASHLEY: Oh boy. 
LAURA: -- like it's-- 
ASHLEY: I know. I know. Why's he doing it. 
TALIESIN: Because-- 
LAURA: He's talking like it's really bad. 
TALIESIN: No, he's doing what we do, where he's trying to figure out the math because this is crazy. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: She's the best. 
TRAVIS: What level spell is this? 
MATT: So-- 
MARISHA: Eight. 
ROBBIE: Jeez. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: I did it. 
MATT: Yeah, fissures can open up at the start of your next turn. Not yet. The ground is shaking now. (rumbling) 
TALIESIN: You can fissure this shit. However it is, 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground. So everything here. 
LAURA: No, I'm nervous. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: So yeah, this tent is destroyed and the gentlemen within scream. 
LAURA: Poor little soldiers. 
MATT: Attempt to-- 
ROBBIE: Oh no. 
LAURA: It's just a little tent, though. 
TALIESIN: He's in the bathtub. 
LAURA: It's just fabric-- 
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. 
LAURA: -- that fell down on him. 
MATT: She's like, "Oh god!" 
TALIESIN: You should have put your arm around him, man. 
MATT: Sorry, microphone. 
SAM: It buried under. 
TALIESIN: Under a tent? 
MATT: It says 50 damage to all structures around here, this turn. (rumbling) 
ASHLEY: Ooh! 
MATT: Everything (rumbles) shifts. Cracks begin to appear in the parts that are stone and the parts that are metal. (creaks and groans) A creaking, horrible sound of large swaths of metal, beginning to bend and shift its points, beginning to become weaker. 
MARISHA: I hope this wasn't a mistake. 
TALIESIN: That was about 200 points of damage. 
MATT: Also, it's 5d6 bludgeoning damage to every creature that doesn't make it. So that point, roll 5d6 damage. 
SAM: We still have advantage on all saves, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Adorable. 
LIAM: Nope. 
ROBBIE: No. 
LAURA: Just wisdom saves, because we did our Heroes Feast. 
MARISHA: Oop. 
TALIESIN: Where's my pen? 
MARISHA: Okay. Five, 10, 14. 
MATT: 14. All right. So, the two guys that are trying to run, that is going to be a 15 DC. What's your DC? 
MARISHA: Fails to 20. 
MATT: 20? Okay, so fail. 
SAM: Fail. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Fail, they both take that damage and then fall prone and are currently buried in rubble. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Take that. 
MATT: They're like, "Oh god." All righty. That guy who is blinded and running is now screaming. He also fails. He falls and actually he gets crushed. He's gone from the blast earlier. So he's taken out. 
SAM: Amazing. The worm takes the damage, but is unaffected. 
LIAM: Does it affect the Shrike-y guy under Scrag? 
MATT: I'm going to get there. 
LIAM: Oh, sorry. 
MATT: It's okay. (laughter) It's a lot of rolling here to do. However-- Yeah, fails to save, so Vorak takes the damage. It was what again? It was-- 
MARISHA: 14. 
MATT: 14, yeah. Okay. Both of the-- Fail. Jesus Christ, a two and a four. Both of the Shrikes up there fail. 
SAM: Amazing. 
TALIESIN: Right. 
LAURA: What was your damage that you rolled? 
SAM: 15. 
MARISHA: It's not a lot. 14 damage. 
MATT: 14. 
MARISHA: But it knocks them-- 
MATT: They're both knocked prone and they are buried in rubble. 
SAM: Nice. 
ROBBIE: Cool. 
MATT: So they both get-- 
ROBBIE: That's a big one. 
SAM: (laughs) How many rocks did you bring? 
MATT: I have a whole bag. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Somewhere there's a Michael's that's like, "We're out of rocks, man. I don't know." 
MATT: That guy there-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) There's a Michael's. 
MATT: Fails, and he gets-- 
ROBBIE: Did you pack your-- 
MATT: -- crushed under the ground. 
ROBBIE: --sandwich bag full of rocks for school today? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Oh, I love it. 
TALIESIN: This is a dummy lunchbox. Picked up the wrong one. 
ROBBIE: Just got rocks in it! 
MATT: 100-foot radius. 
ROBBIE: It's Mercer's lunchbox. 
MATT: That's a five, and 95. Percy is just outside of reach. 
SAM: Yeah! 
MARISHA: Ya! 
LAURA: What about the Thought Eater? 
MATT: The Thought Eaters, they're not in contact with the ground. 
LAURA: Oh. Oh great. Because they float. 
TALIESIN: Surprise, motherfucker. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, and I'm flying. 
MARISHA: Rope ties, motherfucker. 
LAURA: Oh yeah, you fly. 
LIAM: Does that ho over there float? 
LAURA: That ho floats. 
ASHLEY: Hope floats. 
LAURA: Then what about the-- 
MATT: Oh, I misread it. I misread it. That's on me. 
SAM: Everybody dies? 
MATT: Yeah. This guy is still on the ground. Those guys are still knocked prone. They don't take any damage. They're all knocked prone. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: If the building falls on them from destroying, that's when it gets pulled in. Sorry, it's been a while since an Earthquake spell. 
TALIESIN: I get that. 
LIAM: That's both ways. 
LAURA: That's right. 
TALIESIN: Also means everybody's-- 
MATT: Down over there. 
SAM: So it just knocks people prone, it doesn't actually cause damage? 
TALIESIN: At-- No. 
LAURA: Unless you're in a building. 
SAM: Great. 
MATT: At buildings, constructions can do and if they fall, then it does it. 
SAM: That's great. 
MATT: So-- 
LAURA: What about those blind Thought guy? 
MATT: He rolls a natural 18, That gets him 21, which succeeds, so he's fine. 
LAURA: The blind by Reiloran that fell off the stairs. Does he fall off the second level, too? 
TALIESIN: He was already prone. (laughter) Oh wow. 
MATT: With a natural 3, he does. 
TALIESIN: Eyy! 
ASHLEY: Yay! 
MARISHA: Oh no! 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MATT: He falls off that. 
TALIESIN: I hate everything. 
LIAM: Oh, oh, thank goodn-- Ah! 
ROBBIE: What did you do in the war? (blows raspberry) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Let me tell you how I got this! 
ROBBIE: Fell down two-- 
LAURA: That poor guy. 
ROBBIE: -- flights of stairs. 
LAURA: He literally landed-- 
TRAVIS: Went down the bridge Didn't see anything-- 
LAURA: -- from the moon and then-- 
MATT: That guy-- 
LAURA: -- fell off some stairs. 
MATT: Succeeds, maintains standing up, that Reiloran on the edge. Also succeeds. Those two are the first two succeed. Lieve'tel you get jostled around a bit. 
LIAM: Yeah, I'm already lying down. 
MATT: Scanlan, I need you to make a dexterity, or sorry a strength saving throw? Dexterity. 
MARISHA: You got Freedom of Movement? 
SAM: Oh, I rolled a 10, but I have Freedom of Movement. Which means something. (laughs) 
MATT: Means you're immune to becoming prone-- 
LIAM: No paralysis. 
MATT: -- and everything, so you're fine. 
MARISHA: Yeah, you can't be knocked down. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: And you move through terrain just fine. 
TALIESIN: So this fucked up terrain-- 
MATT: Shrike up there-- 
TALIESIN: -- ain't going to fuck with you. 
MATT: -- succeeds, with a natural 19. Still poisoned, though. A poison-- Natural 20 on that. So he's fine. Then-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
LIAM: I don't know how many hit points I have any more. 
MATT: Scrag. 
LIAM: Because, this. 
MATT: Scrag? 
SAM: Is he going to be prone? 
MATT: Fails. 
SAM: Oh my god! 
MATT: Scrag-- 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
MATT: (crashing) -- falls prone onto the ground. (crashing) The legs-- it crumples out its held weight on it. 
TRAVIS: Spider on roller skates. 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: (chuckles) The Shrike that succeeded, I will say, gets partially crushed by it. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: He's going to try make a-- No, he fails the dex saves. So he takes 16 point. He gets crushed. He's dead. (laughter) 
LIAM: Is that fellow within 60 feet of Lieve? 
MATT: He is. 
LIAM: She will use, it's not a reaction, Keeper of Souls, and I will steal his number of hit dice as life force to myself. 
MATT: Oh great. 
ASHLEY: Oh that is cool. 
MATT: Yeah, that would be-- 
TALIESIN: I love that. 
MATT: -- eight. 
LIAM: Okay, got it. Thank you. 
TALIESIN: One of my-- I love that. Yeah, Wildmother had that. 
SAM: Cool. 
ASHLEY: Really? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: All righty. The structures all crack. You watch as the tower itself, which is fairly resilient, and it's structure (rumbles) shakes. As it does, the Bloody Bridge flickers, and you see two points at its base begin to (crackling) tense. It is certainly affecting the tower. So, you've cast Earthquake, 
SAM: What does that mean? anything else in your turn you want to do? 
MARISHA: That's what to do. 
TALIESIN: No moving? No? 
MARISHA: I did move. I moved and I did a spell. 
SAM: You did great. You did great. 
MARISHA: That's what I did. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: That's what I do. 
MATT: All right that finishes Keyleth's go. 
TRAVIS: Shit got fucked up. 
MATT: Scrag gets back up using half its movement to do so, is going to turn, step over this guy, and get close enough to this edge, here. 
TRAVIS: Worst "Starship Troopers" nightmare ever. 
SAM: There's a bear on his back. 
MATT: Yep. (laughter) 
SAM: He's bearbacking. 
MATT: And going to strike at you in your elemental form. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I was waiting for it. 
MARISHA: That's fair. 
MATT: First, let's see if he gets his-- 
TALIESIN: Shit, that doesn't help on that. 
MATT: He does get his corroding spray back. 
MARISHA: Oh boy. 
TALIESIN: Fuck you, bro. 
TRAVIS: Is Percy over there? 
MATT: So that's going to-- 
MARISHA: He's over yonder. 
MATT: So the Razor Mandible's against you. 
TALIESIN: I've got a lot of range. 
MATT: That's going to be a 20 to hit. 
MARISHA: Hits. 
MATT: All right, you take-- 
TALIESIN: But I need a nat 20 or kill somebody to start getting shit back. 
MARISHA: I'm getting smashed. 
LAURA: You're getting smashed? 
MARISHA: I am. 
MATT: 28 points of piercing damage to you, which is reduced to half in your elemental form, right? 
MARISHA: Oh, because it's just bludgeoning, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Yes. I have resistance. 
MATT: So it's 14 to you. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Then you take-- 
TALIESIN: Oh that's so clever. 
MATT: Oh. 
MARISHA: Wait. What? 
MATT: You take 22 points of acid damage. 
ROBBIE: Jeez. 
MARISHA: 22? 
MATT: Correct. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: It's then going to strike at you four more times, with its razor mandibles. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM and ROBBIE: Jeez. 
MATT: It does not have disadvantage anymore because that spell dropped. So I'm going to roll four dice here. Okay. So, does 14 hit? 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: Does a 16 hit? 
MARISHA: No. 
MATT: All right. Does a 22 hit? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: Does a 26 hit? 
MARISHA: Yes. 
MATT: So two of those strikes get to you. That's going to be there. 25 points of slashing damage reduced to 12, and 22 points of slashing damage reduced to 11. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: Then it's going to finish with another corroding spray. (inhales deeply) 
LAURA: God. 
MATT: (spits) And is going to unleash a massive torrent of acid towards this way, that's going to spray-- 
TALIESIN: Oh, a lot of people. 
MATT: Yeah, that's going to get-- 
SAM: That's not magic, it is? 
MATT: Keyleth. It's going to get-- It is not magical. 
SAM: Shit. 
MATT: It's going to get Scanlan. It's going to get Lieve'tel, and it's going to get your planetar. 
LAURA: Does it get the Thought Eater as well? 
MATT: It does not. 
TALIESIN: What? 
MATT: So for that, I'm going to roll. That's 8d8. 
LAURA: And Grog's in a worm. 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
SAM: Oh shit, I forgot about Grog. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Trying to help him out. 
MATT: 35 points of acid damage is what we're looking at here. So let's do dex saves. Keyleth? 
MARISHA: Natural 20. 
MATT: Natural 20. 
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
MATT: That's half acid damage, that. So half of 35, that's going to be 17. 
MARISHA: Okay. Jeez Louise. 
MATT: All right. Scanlan? 
SAM: 14. 
MATT: 35 points of acid damage to you. Concentration saving throw to see if you maintain your Bigby's-- or sorry, your Scanlan's hand. 
SAM: Oh no. I get advantage on this roll, right? 
MATT: Because of War Caster. 
MARISHA: Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. 
SAM: What do I do? 16 plus stuff. 
MARISHA: Plus your spell casting-- 
MATT: Constitution saving throw, is what it is. 
SAM: Constitution saving throw. 21? 
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: Lieve'tel? 
LIAM: Lieve'tel succeeded with a 22. The planar ally failed and is going to go bye-bye. 
MATT: Okay, so the planar ally, it's burned into very little. 
LIAM: Half of 22 for the damage? 
MATT: 35. So 17. 
LIAM: Half of 35. 
LIAM: Okay, thanks. 
MATT: That's going to finish Scrag's turn. 
SAM: ♪ Scrag, Scrag, ah ♪ 
MATT: It is now the 20 mark on the initiative. (wooshing) The arrival of-- 
LAURA: Every turn, more of them are going to come? 
TALIESIN: We should make that ladder go away. 
MATT: Two of these begin to emerge. 
LAURA: We should. 
MATT: There. 
SAM: I think the Earthquake would knock it down. 
TALIESIN: No, no. Not yet. 
SAM: It's a strong ladder. 
TRAVIS: I mean, we've-- 
MATT: It's funny, after the last attack on this, they've reinforced a few things. They learned from the last couple of moments. 
SAM: Oh, we can get it down. We got a hand. 
MARISHA: She can fly. 
ROBBIE: That was the end of Scrag's turn? 
MATT: That was the end of Scrag's turn, yeah. 
ROBBIE: I think, technically, since the birds are within 10 feet, that I can force him to make a dex save again. 
MATT: Is it on your turn it happen? 
MATT: It's at the end. If they're still in that position at the end of the turn. 
MATT: Okay, then yeah. Yeah, we can do that. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think you have to do the 19 dex save again. 
MATT: Let's go. I'll say they're technically right here. 
ROBBIE: Is that within 10 feet or did he move out of it when he moved? 
MATT: No, he's massive. He's still within 10 feet. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, that's what I -- 
MATT: Ozo doesn't get hit, but Scrag can. 
ROBBIE: I'm going to triple check, but I'm pretty sure I read it five different times. 
SAM: This is a bit of a pickle. 
MATT: Know what you mean. 
TALIESIN: You just need to-- 
ROBBIE: "Or ends its turn there, you can force the creature to make a dexterity saving throw." 
MATT: Yeah. All right. So, Scrag-- Well, that's a natural two. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Okay. 
MATT: That's a fail. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. So it's the same again. It's 5d10. 
MATT: Go for it. 
ROBBIE: Ugh, not great. I got two, five, seven, 14. 21 slashing. 
MATT: All right. Slashing damage to-- Got it. Okay. All right, so that finishes that go there. The 20 arrival, both of those begin to arrive. I'm rolling really low for that arrival, too. But more of the Reilorans are starting to arrive across the Bloody Bridge. Also, the towers that were flickering up into space. 
SAM: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: (chuckles) 
LAURA: Ah, Jesus. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
MATT: This one here-- 
MARISHA: Hoping I could shake him up a bit. 
MATT: -- is going to attempt to-- 
TRAVIS: (muffled) Over here! (mumbling) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (muffled) Fuck you! Bet you can't hit me. (laughter) 
LIAM: You see the giant face and hand prints on the side of the worm. 
MATT: So on that point, the Weave Mind, through the tower are going to attempt to slam you to the ground. I need you to make a charisma saving throw for me, Vex. 
LAURA: Charisma. 
MATT: Yes. 
LAURA: Charisma? 
TRAVIS: Advantage with a wink. 
LAURA: I get advantage on charisma. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Wink at them. 
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, okay. This is terrifying. 
MARISHA: It's okay. 
LIAM: I'm upset-- (laughter) 
LIAM: -- about the Holy Aura. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: I'm upset too. 
LAURA: 19. 
MATT: 19? Fails. As the orb begins to flicker up, you see the spectral image of one of the Weave Mind figures reach its long, thin, spindly fingers out in your way and then do this. You feel your hands move the broom beyond your control straight down and you go full speed (rapid descent) (crash) into the ground with all of your intent and the broom's speed. So you take-- That is 60 feet down from where you are. 
TALIESIN: I hate it. 
MATT: Actually, let's-- 
LAURA: I can't try to jump off at the last second? 
SAM: Who cast that spell? 
MATT: Unfortunately no. 
MARISHA: Weave Mind. 
MATT: 50 feet, that is 5d6 bludgeoning damage. 
LAURA: I can't use one of my rogue abilities like Evasion or whatever the other thing is? 
MATT: Not for this one unfortunately. 
LAURA: Uncanny Dodge? 
MATT: If it was dex maybe, but-- 
LAURA: Can I use-- 
MATT and ROBBIE: (laugh) 
SAM: Can I use my rules lawyer feature to--? 
MATT: You take 18 points of bludgeoning damage and you are prone on the ground. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: Knocked (impact) on the ground. 
TRAVIS: Oh cool, D&D Beyond says I have made new characters. (laughter) 
MATT: Sorry, man. Grog got eaten and they're all gone now. 
LAURA: Is my broom okay? Did it break the broom? 
MATT: No, the broom is not broken. But the broom scatters off about five feet from you, it's right next to you. But you're (grunts) dazed for a second. This right here that's arcing up-- 
LAURA: Where am I? 
MATT: It's going to attempt to (projectile whoosh) fire an arcane psychic bolt at Pike across the way. 
SAM: Jesus. 
LAURA: Where did I land? 
SAM: You're between the big monster and the cradle thing. 
MATT: Does a 20 hit you? 
ASHLEY: No. 
MATT: No. You see it far enough away and (small explosion) it blasts and leaves a crater in the ground where it impacted. Some strange force was focused like a massive magnifying glass that impacted where you were standing before you duck out of the way and it explodes next to you. That's going to finish the 20 initiative. Lieve'tel, you're up. 
LIAM: Oh, there's no other people before me? Percy went, Vex, Keyleth, everybody went? 
LAURA: Was that a spell targeting me? Would that be a spell attack? Would that orb take radiant damage? 
TALIESIN: If I recall. No, no. Please take it in. 
MATT: I'll allow it. Roll radiant damage. 
LAURA: Kind of bad. 10 points of radiant damage to the orb. 
MATT: (radiant boom) The Dawnfather's retribution causes the orb to flicker off with radiant damage. It takes it, but it doesn't take it fully. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: Not quite as vulnerable to the effect. But, Lieve. 
LIAM: All right, Lieve will stand somewhat battered. I think you said this area is difficult terrain, but she cast Freedom of Movement on herself so that doesn't affect her. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Half of her movement to stand. I will have her trudge her last bit of 15 of movement on a diagonal towards the rear of this thing. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Also trying to get away from the mayhem. 
MATT: Fair. 
LIAM: As she walks, she says: I left Raven's Crest for this purpose. Lady, I am here to serve your will. Your champion's prison lies before me. Unlock his fetters and pull that beacon to me. I will use Divine Intervention. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: Asking the Matron to rip the beacon free of this thing and deliver it into my hands. 
MATT: Okay. So, the tower as it stands, the structural damage that it sustained was fairly substantial but it still holds pretty strong. It's a very well reinforced tower. As these mutterings escape your lips, Lieve'tel, the brightness of the sunburst from last round that has faded now seems to be consumed with shadow, darkness. An eclipse seems to darken this space in the middle. As it does, you see black unfurling tethers of silk (unfurling) from this shapeless shadow. As it does, you watch as hundreds of ravens (winged flocking) scatter out from this dark space. The sound of their cawing causing this terrifying din that overshadows any other horrifying sounds of the battlefield around you. As they (multitudes of wings flutter) scatter out, you watch as they cling entirely. The entire tower now looks it's made of black ravens, shifting and undulating as their wings flap and move. You see the hundreds of little red glowing beading eyes of them as they cling to it. As that happens, the tower seems to (masonry shifts) shift again. A central cluster of them burst outward and (disintegrating poof) evaporate, leaving just a section of the tower exposed where you see the cracked housing has now been pulled open slightly, and you see this strange purplish gray glow (energy buzzing) now exposed to the air. More ravens delve in. (gathering whoosh) (poof) They get disintegrated as well. With each cluster of this cloud pushing inward, more of the tower's, the armored central core around this strange ancient relic that seems to be around this strange ancient relic that seems to be one of the major power sources for this tower is exposed further and further until the final bits of the tower that surround it, the armored edge of it are pulled away with the last cluster of ravens, themselves being destroyed along with it. Now you see the tower stands, but the central part of its midsection is just framework, strange arcana machinery, is just framework, strange arcana machinery, and the dodecahedron- shaped beacon floating in space right there. It has been left exposed. 
SAM: Nice. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay, so just to clarify, that was beautiful. I loved every second, but I said deliver it to me. But the divine-- (laughter) 
LIAM: I said I loved it. 
TRAVIS: Not what I ordered. (laughter) 
LIAM: I didn't know if you missed those words-- 
ROBBIE: Delicious, but no thank you. 
LIAM: -- but I know that you have to measure how much or little a Divine Intervention does. So it's hovering in space, right? 
MATT: Correct. 
LAURA: It's hovering still in the-- 
MATT: Yeah, it has been delivered to be plucked. 
LIAM: To the party, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
TRAVIS: With your finger-- 
MATT: And has provided you an absence of resistance-- 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: -- at the moment. 
LAURA: Where is it? 
TRAVIS: Height wise. 
MATT: This purple glow right there. 
LAURA: Okay, that's where it is. 
MATT: This is the height of where it sits. 
LIAM: The height of it. 
TALIESIN: Five feet down, five feet to the right. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Back. 
LIAM: Back and to the left. 
TALIESIN: Back and to the left. Yes. 
LIAM: Then I will use a bonus action to cast Healing Word on myself. 
MATT: All right. 
LIAM: At 3rd-level. 
MATT: 3rd-level. Go for it. 
SAM: In all of that destruction of the tower, do we see the Vax orb or is that somewhere else? 
TALIESIN: We got to do this first anyway. 
SAM: I know, but I still want to see him. 
TALIESIN: Nah, I don't think so. 
MATT: On your turn, if you'd like to try and look for it, you can. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: You noticed there were two important points. There was one where this was and there was one right at the base of where the Bloody Bridge is being-- 
SAM: Which you described. 
TALIESIN: I did. 
MATT: All right. Does that finish your turn, Lieve'tel? 
LIAM: Oh yes. That was all my movement, bonus action, Divine Intervention, donezo. 
MATT: The Shrikes go. 
MARISHA: We got to get it out. They get up-- 
SAM: I got it. 
MARISHA: You got it, right? 
MATT: -- and they rush into the side-- 
SAM: I got a hand right there. 
TALIESIN: Just pointing out, getting up is half speed but also that's rough terrain. 
MATT: Correct. That's as far as that one goes. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: This one here goes back to go towards Vex and only gets that far. So they both get up, (grunting) and that's about the full distance they can get. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
MATT: All right, finishing the Shrikes' go. Grog-- 
SAM: Oh boy! 
MATT: -- top of your turn inside Vorak. The first thing that happens is you take-- 
TALIESIN: Drum roll. [many dice rolling] 
SAM: Those were all d4s. 
MATT: 18 points of acid damage. 
TRAVIS: Ah! 
SAM: Reduced? 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: No, not acid damage. 
TALIESIN: We'll buy you some Pink Floyd. 
MATT: What you got, Grog? 
TRAVIS: I will go into a frenzied rage. 
MATT: Okay! 
TRAVIS: I will, with my bloodaxe I assume pressing against me-- 
MATT: You are restrained. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll try and grind against the inside of whatever wet tissue is in here, and make reckless attacks from the inside of this. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TALIESIN: Hell yes. 
MATT: You are restrained, so your attack's at disadvantage. Reckless cancels it out, so you're going straight attacks on this. 
TRAVIS: Straight up. 
SAM: Grind against that wet tissue. 
TRAVIS: Straight up. 
MATT: So three attacks. 
ROBBIE: Get him! 
TRAVIS: Oh right, that fell. 
MATT: Are these Great Weapon Master or not? 
TRAVIS: Negative. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Not on the first one. That is a-- 
LAURA: Did it come up just in time? 
TRAVIS: No, that's an old one. 
LAURA: Oh. 26 to hit. 
MATT: 26 hits. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Second one I'll do Great Weapon Master. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Natural 20. (cheering) 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! 
ASHLEY: Oh yes! 
TALIESIN: That might just do it. 
TRAVIS: Is that a natural 19? That's awesome. That'll hit, too. 
MATT: All three hit, the central one's critical from the inside. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god! 
MARISHA: Don't you crit on 19 too? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, on Great Weapon Master? 
TRAVIS: I think so. 
TALIESIN: You might crit on 19. 
ASHLEY: You do. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: (hums jaunty tune) Yeah, I might. Let's see. Okay, so the first one, that was seven plus 10 is 17 plus four is 21 plus 23, 24. That's 24 points of damage with three points of necrotic. 
MATT: Got it. 
TRAVIS: The second one is-- That's cocked. (quiet math) 
MATT: Don't forget to add your Brutal Critical elements too. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. 
TRAVIS: 16, 25, 50. 
TRAVIS: 16, 25, 50. 50 plus 10-- 
TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: 60-- 
MARISHA: He'll fucking just explode. 
TRAVIS: 61 points of damage on the second one. 
TALIESIN: Is that Brutal Critical, too? 
TALIESIN: Bet your sweet ass it does. 
TALIESIN: Fuck. Oh my god. 
TRAVIS: 13, 17, 18. 
MARISHA: I know. 
TRAVIS: 21 on the third one. Three points of necrotic. 
MATT: All right, so that is over 100 points of damage in that one round against it. It's going to make a constitution saving throw. Oh look at that, it fails. (laughter) 
MATT: As it vomits you back up-- 
SAM and LAURA: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: (retches) 
MATT: -- right there, prone on the ground next to it as you carve through it inside and it (retching) emerges you from there, and with it, a large splashing spiral of that strange molasses ichor from the inside. 
LAURA: (gags) 
MATT: So that's your action. You can use half your movement to get up if you want. 
TRAVIS: I'm going to get up. 
SAM: Get up! ♪ ("Chop Suey!" by System of a Down) ♪ 
TRAVIS: Got to get the fuck out of here! I'm going to run-- 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'm going to towards the open claw structure. 
MATT: Okay. What's your movement? 
TRAVIS: It'll be 25-- 50 total, so just 25 left. 
MATT: Okay 25 left. The 100 foot radius-- 
TRAVIS: I have Mobile, so it shouldn't slow me down too much with all the crazy-- 
MATT: So you ignore rough terrain? 
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Oh, great. So yeah you can-- 
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Mobile's so good, dude. 
MATT: So you go-- 
TRAVIS: 10, 15, 20, 25. 
MATT: 25? 
TRAVIS: Yeah. I guess I'll stay within the big boy's melee if he's that big. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. The Shrike does get one strike against you as you rush by-- 
TRAVIS: Cool. 
MATT: -- for 19? 
TRAVIS: That is my AC. 
MATT: All right, so you take, you take six points of slashing damage reduced to three. 
TRAVIS: Great. I'll use my reaction to take a swing at him. 
MATT: Go for it. 
TRAVIS: Just in case it kills him. 28, no, 30 to hit, nope, 32 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Sorry. 12, 22-- God, where was that hit before? 22, 26, (mumbled math) 27 points of damage, 22, 26, (mumbled math) 27 points of damage, four necrotic. 
MATT: How little attention do you pay to him when you cut him in half? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's being a bitch! (slashes) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Also, that 19 should've been crit. 
TRAVIS: I'll do just the-- It gives me 10 points of healing I think because of the bloodaxe? 
LAURA: You crit on 19? 
TRAVIS: Stop talking to me while I'm doing all this math! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: 10 points of healing. No! 
SAM: It crashed again. 
LAURA: It crashed again? 
SAM: Do you have a character sheet? 
MATT: If I recall, it's 10 temporary hit points. 
TRAVIS: Which I totally wrote down how many hit points I had. I guess I do. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Nice. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: That 19 should have been a crit, so that means you get extra dice as well. Then if you can remember what you rolled-- 
TRAVIS: I can't so I'll just roll one. 
TALIESIN: Well, actually-- 
SAM: 21. 
TALIESIN: I was going to say, it's easy because it's just there's a standard number so you just remove that from that. 
MATT: For which one? 
TALIESIN: For the 19. It was a crit as well. 
TRAVIS: I crit on a 19 or 20-- 
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: You do. 
TRAVIS: -- because of Great Weapon Master? 
ASHLEY: Brutal Critical. 
MATT: No, because of Brutal Critical. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: Brutal Critical. 
MATT: Wait, no, no, no, no, no. 
TRAVIS: Brutal Critical is an extra damage die. 
MATT: Yeah, its extra damage dice. No, the 19 and 20 is a fighter ability with Champion. 
TRAVIS: I don't have Champion, I have Battle Master. 
MATT: Correct. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Okay. Oh, nevermind then. 
MATT: Good looking out, though. You're fine, you killed him. It's all good. All right, Grog, that finishes your go. 
TALIESIN: I was taking what I had. 
MATT: Scanlan, you're up. 
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up. Don't fuck this up. Don't fuck this up. 
LAURA: Don't hit something with your hand again. 
SAM: I'm not going to hit, I'm going to grab. It's exposed. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: I will reach up the hand as my bonus action and pluck it like the womanhood of a-- No. (laughter) 
LAURA: The horsehood. (laughs) 
SAM: The horsehood of a young mare. 
TALIESIN: Neigh! 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: You are such a whore-se. 
MATT: As the hand reaches towards the beacon in the center, you watch as the fingers, the vibrant purple color of your hand begins to turn to a gray. There is a clashing of arcana here. Roll d20 and add your charisma. 
SAM: Ooh. Okay, charisma's good. 
MATT: It's contested roll with this here. All right. 
SAM: 26. 
MATT: 26? 20. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
LAURA: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Nice! 
MATT: So at the minute, it feels like the spell's about to be canceled out, you feel the threads of your spellcraft beginning to be unwoven, you redouble your efforts and concentrate. You've prevented gods from escaping your grasp. You've prevented gods from escaping your grasp. You push through as this magical hand grips this strange relic. As it does the hand (vibrates) and you see six or seven hands appearing in different sides, flashing almost like realities are colliding. Some hands of different shapes, different colors. For a second, you see seven different versions of Scanlan and six different timelines, one of which he's a ghost, one of which he's a king. In that moment, your eyes come back to reality and the hand pulls the beacon free from the center of the tower, at which point, the Bloody Bridge (collapsing). 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: Shuts down and you see these glimmering beams of red light (whooshing) they're sent adrift in this space between Ruidus and Exandria. (clamoring) 
MARISHA: We disconnected it. 
LAURA: You did it. 
SAM: I just fucking disconnected the world. 
TALIESIN: Get it to Grog. 
MATT: As that happens, too, the storm above-- 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: (whooshing) -- vanishes, and all of you have to brace yourself as an incredible wind (heavy gust) pushes down upon the battlefield from above. You feel hurricane force winds are suddenly pushing upon the ground and all of you have to steel yourself. A lot of the rubble is cleared out for the moment and pushed to the sides as you watch the tethered and strangled threads of Exandria's leylines (whooshing) begin to relax and return-- (clamoring) 
MATT: -- how they were and Ruidus (shifts) begin to continue-- (clamoring) 
ROBBIE: You made the moon move! 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
MATT: -- its rotation around the world. The rainbow gossamer threads of magic around the world that were on the cusp of tearing themselves apart begin to return to their natural order. And we're going to take a break there. (clamoring) 
MATT: Returning for the rest of Scanlan's turn when we see you here in a few minutes. (clamoring)

Break[]
(mysterious music) 
MARISHA: Oh, hi. Sorry, I must've nodded off for a moment. As you may have heard, we're just getting started with tons of new content, and of course our Daggerheart Critmas Live show, on December 7th in Not-Quite-Philadelphia. It's just over the bridge in Jersey. But it's been a lot of work, and honestly, it can be exhausting. But, you know, with 2025 and our 10 year anniversary just around the corner, we're not planning on slowing down. Oh no. In fact, we are just getting- 
TALIESIN: Things are heating up. 
MARISHA: No, no. That's not what we're saying. 
TALIESIN: Things are heating up. You wanted live shows, and you're getting live shows, starting this April with a live show in, drum roll please. 
MARISHA: No, I'm not- 
TALIESIN: Don't care. Chicago. That's right. We're returning to the Windy City for a very special event, where you, the audience, gets to choose whom your adventurers are. Selecting from your favorite campaigns: one, two, and three. So mark your calendars, because it all goes down Thursday, April 10th, 2025 at Wintrust Arena in Chicago, Illinois. Things are just- 
MARISHA: Getting started. 
TALIESIN: Heating up. 
SAM: The adventure continues. You heard me correctly. You're probably wondering why I'm upside down. Well, it's because I'm training. Training for an adventure down under! (grunts) That's right, Australia. We heard your requests, we've seen your fan videos, and we're taking the gang abroad with not just one, but two Australian shows this summer. Or is that your winter? I don't know how your country works. But what I do know is, we're coming to your neck of the woods on Thursday, June 19th, 2025 at the ICC Sydney Theater in… Sydney And then Wednesday, June 25th at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. Think of these shows like a double header, which is like a hockey term. Matt's cooking up an adventure where two of our main campaign parties cross paths in a pair of entirely separate, but narratively connected one shots. Tickets for both shows are available down under me, right there. So slip another shrimp on the barbie, because- 
MARISHA: We should probably stop with the Australian stereotypes. 
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, I think they call them prawns. 
SAM: Oh, slip another, anyway. I have no idea how Australia works, but I have a few months to figure it out, as do all of you. Because after we tour Australia, guess what? 
MARISHA: We're just 
TALIESIN: Heating up 
SAM: The adventure begins. 
LIAM: The hits just keep on rolling. 
MARISHA: No, you guys can't all make up new catchphrases. 
LIAM: Oh, yes, we can. Because the Critical Role cast will be rolling into Indiana on August 2nd, 2025 at the Fishers Event Center, just outside of Indianapolis. As you may have heard, Daggerheart will be releasing early next year, and this will be our first one shot set in the world of Exandria, utilizing Daggerheart as our game system. So get planning, 'cause 2025 doesn't end in August, which means the hits just keep… 
LAURA: We're just getting started. No, we did that one already. Can we go again? 
LIAM: Oh shit, yeah. Which means the hits just keep on… 
LAURA: 'Cause these dogs are off the leash. That works, right? Someone let these dogs out, and we're barking our way to the Big Apple in October. We're coming to Radio City Music Hall New York, New York, on October 7th. It's the final stop on our massive, globe-spanning 10-year anniversary live show tour. And what's the Radio City Music Hall show gonna be about, you ask? Well, remember when Fjord proposed at the London Live show? and Jester was like, "Yes, I will." Well, you're all invited to the wedding of the century. Move over Royals, there's a new power marriage going down. Five brand new live shows. And we still have tickets left for the upcoming Daggerheart Christmas show. Critmas show, in Camden, just outside of Philly. Critmas. That's six live shows around the globe, all in the next 12 months. And a lot of these will also include appearances by your friendly neighborhood CR cast. 
MARISHA: That's us. (laughs) 
LAURA: At conventions like C2E2 and the New York Comic-Con. The New York Comic-Con. Stay tuned for more information about that later. 2025 is gonna be the biggest Critical year yet. And as always, Beacon members get early access to tickets. So strap in and strap on because… 
LAURA: The dogs are 
SAM: The adventure 
LIAM: The hits keep 
TALIESIN: We're just 
TALIESIN: Heating up! 
MARISHA: We're just getting started. 
LAURA: These dogs are off 
LIAM: The hits just keep 
SAM: The adventure begins 
MARISHA: We're just getting started. 
TALIESIN: Things are heating up 
MARISHA: You guys. It has begin. (bright music) (cheerful holiday music) 
SAM: I can also pray to the Matron. 
TALIESIN: You don't need a mask to pray to the Matron. 
LAURA: We talked to her, why would you need to pray to her? 
TALIESIN: She was right there. 
SAM: That's a fair point. (laughs) I prefer texting. (laughing) 
MARISHA: You're just being a little god whore. 
LAURA: You're doing noble things, for the most part. 
SAM: I know, it sucks. 
TALIESIN: Like, they're still horrified. Yes! 
MARISHA: This episode is so unhinged. 
TALIESIN: This episode is brought to you by sleep deprivation. (mysterious music) 18 points of necrotic damage, bringing him to two points of health. Heera, make a wisdom saving throw. 17. A feeling that seems unrelated to the events in the chamber overcomes you. The hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You get that sensation once again that there is somebody with their eyes on you. Afraid to meet their gaze, Heera simply says, "Help my friends, and I'll give you whatever you want." [bells jingling] OLTGAR: Ho ho ho. 
LAURA: Oltgar is coming to town, which means it's Critmas time. All Critical Role shops have fantastic deals on some of our favorite creations.

LAURA: (VO) Do you find yourself dealing with low energy, drowsiness, or boredom? 
MARISHA: You may have made a pact with an infernal demon, or you may be suffering from Low CR. 
LAURA: (VO) Low CR is a common condition that affects between most and nearly all adult humans. Low CR, or Low Critical Role, occurs when human people don't have enough nerdy voice actors in their lives. But now, there's a cure! 
MARISHA: I don't let Low CR control my life anymore. 
LAURA: (VO) Beacon is a non-invasive subscription that provides 24 hours exclusive content each day. 
MARISHA: This was when we decided it should look like a gender reveal party. 
LAURA: (VO) Early access to event tickets, members-only Discord, 10% off merchandise, and more. Do not take Beacon if you are allergic to Beacon. Consult your familiar if you think Beacon could work for you. 
MARISHA: Side effects may include excessive enjoyment, overexcitement, and diarrhea. 
LAURA: (VO) Critical Role is in no way a treatment, medication, or anything other than a bunch of nerdy voice actors. Do not watch Critical Role unless you enjoy it. [smoke alarm beeping] 
LAURA: (VO) We repeat. We are absolutely not any sort of help… anything. To learn more, visit beacon.tv, or find it on your App Store. 
MARISHA: Tomorrow feels a little brighter now that I have Beacon. (loud crunching) 

Part II[]
MATT: And welcome back. So as we're jumping in, it is middle of Scanlan's turn, after managing to tear the remaining beacon from the center of the Malleus Key, and as such, shutting down the Bloody Bridge and releasing Ruidus from its arcane-locked placement in the sky. 
LAURA and ROBBIE: (applaud) 
MATT: Also, before the break, you rolled less damage than you were supposed to for Brutal Critical. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, Brutal Critical is-- 
SAM: (slurred) Brutal Critical. 
TRAVIS: -- three damage dice, and I only rolled one. So the first one was an eight. The second one is a-- It's cocked. It would have been that 12. It's a seven. So 15 extra points of damage on-- 
SAM: Yeah! 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: Woo! 
TRAVIS: -- worm boy. 
TALIESIN: Every little bit. 
ROBBIE: Nice! 
MATT: Done and done. So Scanlan, that was your bonus action. 
SAM: Bonus action. 
MATT: What are you doing for your action? 
SAM: Well, as part of the bonus action, I can move the hand up to 60 feet. So I'll bring it back down. 
MATT: Up to 60 feet. So you can bring it down to you, yeah. 
SAM: Yeah. Hover it, maybe, next to Lieve'tel. I still have an action. Oh shit! If I do that, Bigby's Hand will drop. But that's okay. I don't need it anymore. Oh wait, but what if I need to grab the the Vax orb? Shit! I should've thought of this. 
TRAVIS: Where is the Vax orb? 
LAURA: We don't know yet. 
LIAM: We don't know yet. 
LAURA: We don't know where the Vax orb is yet. 
TALIESIN: Not yet. 
LAURA: You really should have thought during the break. 
SAM: Yeah, I should have, instead of just eating Indian food. 
MARISHA: Well, also we've talked, because Laura, and I think I also have Locate Object. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Yeah, you guys can go get it, right? 
MARISHA: There's also other ways. 
LAURA: Sure. 
SAM: Okay. Then I will drop the beacon. 
MATT: You catch it there. 
SAM: Then, I will cast an 8th-level spell. 
ROBBIE: Jeez! 
MATT: What are you casting? 
SAM: I will point at that big creature called-- What's he called? Ozo? 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Scrag. 
TRAVIS: Scrag? 
SAM: Scrag. 
ROBBIE: Scrag. 
SAM: Yeah, and I will sing at him. 
LIAM: Ozo douche. 
ASHLEY: Scraggy! 
SAM: I will sing at him. ♪ Neigh-oh ♪ (tune of "Banana Boat (Day-O)") 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: ♪ Me say neigh-oh ♪ (laughter) 
SAM: ♪ Scanlan sings and you do what I say ♪ I cast Dominate Monster at him. 
MATT: Okay! 
LIAM: Oh wow! 
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laugh) 
MATT: I'm going to roll this above the table. What is the-- 
LIAM: Come on, Scan-man! 
SAM: 22! 
MATT: 22! And it is a wisdom? 
ASHLEY: 22! 
SAM: Yeah… It is wisdom. 
MATT: It is wisdom. 
SAM: Yeah, man. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Neigh-oh ♪ 
MATT: There is a plus three to this roll. It has to roll a 19 or 20 to succeed. It does not succeed. (cheering) 
ASHLEY: Fantastic! 
SAM: What should I have him hit? The guy on his back, or the worm? 
MATT: I mean, he's now dominated by you, for the time being. 
SAM: Yes. 
MATT: He hasn't had his turn yet. 
SAM: No, but I have to issue a command. 
MATT: That's true. Yeah. Yeah. What do you want to do? 
TRAVIS: If he gets hit, does it shake him out of it? 
SAM: He gets to roll every time he gets injured, yes. 
TALIESIN: We could start doing-- 
TRAVIS: Could you tell him to leave? 
TALIESIN: Or we could start doing-- 
SAM: Sure, but there's another guy on the field. 
ASHLEY: I say Ozo. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take care of that. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Ozo or assisted damage? 
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah! 
SAM: Guy on his back? 
SAM: Okay. Yes, I will tell him to-- 
LIAM: Just don't let it hit Trinket. 
SAM: Oh. 
LAURA: It's fine. 
SAM: -- to kill anything on its back. (laughter) 
SAM: Regardless of what it is, blindly stab! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: No! 
SAM: But try to avoid the bear. 
LAURA: (whispers) Thank you, Scanlan. 
MATT: That's your command? 
SAM: Try. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: You going to stay put or you-- 
SAM: Oh! Oh! I'm in the open, aren't I now? I will move my body in front of Lieve'tel to shield her from harm. But I'll do it in a way where my backside is right up against her. 
LIAM: Yeah. (laughter) 
LIAM: On ground or floating at this point? 
SAM: No, I don't float. 
LIAM: No, the hand grab. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: You're a horse. 
SAM: I'm a horse. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: So Lieve'tel. You currently have the beacon in your hand. Mind you, there's no handles on it, so it's clutching into your hand. 
SAM: Oh, what? 
LIAM: Wow! 
SAM: Oh, I didn't know that. 
MATT: Yeah, that's fine. You don't know. 
LIAM: Yeah, that's cool. 
ASHLEY: Raw-dogging that beacon. Sorry. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: That's it. 
MATT: Finishes your turn. Finishes Scanlan's go. It is now Ozo's go. 
LAURA: Ozo. 
TALIESIN: Ozo go. 
SAM: Hop on, Lieve'tel! 
MATT: Oh my god! You can ride him! 
SAM: We ride! 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: You're doing mine. 
LAURA: That's amazing! 
MATT: Ozo… You hear whisper through your minds. 
LAURA: Oh shit! 
SAM: I'm fine. She's fine. 
MATT: "I want to get more blood on these hands." And it's going to leap. 
LAURA: (groans) Oh, it's only going to attack Trinket! 
TALIESIN: Shit! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Going to attack you. 
LAURA: Yeah, and I'm laying down. I'm prone. 
SAM: I meant to attack that thing! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Ozo proof. 
MATT: And he's going to use his Frenzied Wrath. 
LAURA: On me? 
MATT: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: God-- 
MATT: You're prone, so he has advantage on these attacks. 
MARISHA: Hmm. 
TALIESIN: (groans) 
MATT: So for Frenzied Wrath, he attacks three times and for every attack that hits, he makes another attack. And this continues until he misses with all of his attacks. 
SAM: Oh shit! 
TALIESIN: Whoa! 
MARISHA: Wait! 
TALIESIN: What? 
MARISHA: Wait! Until he misses with all of them? 
MATT: I dropped a d20. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: That's… 
MATT: So he's going to attack you. 
TALIESIN: Nope. 
TRAVIS: That's-- 
MATT: A 19 and a natural 20. So that's a crit. 
TRAVIS: Well, Vex is dead. 
MATT: First-- 
SAM: Wait. 
LAURA: Can he Cutting Words? 
SAM: I'll Cutting Words that. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: Is Cutting Words an attack? 
MATT: All right, so it is a-- 
SAM: Yeah. I will scream out ♪ Whinny and poo ♪ ♪ Whinny and poo ♪ ♪ I'm a guy who likes to ♪ just whinny and poo ♪ (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
MATT: Okay. So you're reducing his attack by a d12? 
SAM: A d12. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Yes. At least it won't be a crit, right? 
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
MATT: He still rolled a d20. You're just reducing. If it misses, then it won't be a crit. 
SAM: Oh, I see. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: Oh, so you hit with a natural 20? 
MATT: I hit with a natural 20. 
LIAM: Am I within 60 feet? 
MATT: You are-- 
SAM: Oh shit! I'd have to roll a 12. 
MATT: You are just within 60 feet. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god! 
MATT: Though you do not have much of visual sight on them because of where you are. 
SAM: That's natural 20 plus 11. 
MATT: Yeah, your vision is obscured, unfortunately. 
SAM: So I'd have roll a 12 or something. 
MARISHA: Do you have Silvery Barbs, Liam? 
TALIESIN: Or maybe, no, this maybe might hold it. 
LAURA: I don't know. You might not be able to beat it. 
LIAM: Not 60. It's 30 feet. 
MATT: 30 feet? Yeah. 
TALIESIN: You might want to hold it for the next attack. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
MATT: So yeah. The crit's probably going to go through regardless. 
SAM: Then can I hold it for the next one? 
MATT: Sure, why not? 
LAURA: Can I use evasion on this, or uncanny dodge? 
MATT: You can use uncanny dodge to reduce the damage by half. Yes. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So the first strike is going to be-- 
LIAM: Evasion is dex saves. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god! 
LAURA: Times two. 
TALIESIN: I'm seeing a lot of weird numbers. 
MARISHA: She's on the ground. 
MATT: It's going to be 45 points of slashing damage. 
LAURA: Is that halved? 
MATT: Halved. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: To 22. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) 
LAURA: Okay. 22 damage. Okay. And then, he takes 4d6 radiant damage. 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: And then prone? 
LAURA: And is knocked prone. Okay. 10. That's 19 radiant damage. 
MATT: 19 radiant damage. All righty. 
LAURA: And he's knocked prone. 
MATT: (impact) Gets back up. That's going to be the rest of his movement there. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, that might, that armor is the only thing keeping him alive knock him prone again. 
MATT: Fuck, dropped my dice again! I'm going to pick up my dice on the way to have this fight today. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
SAM: He's thinking. 
TRAVIS: Keeps hitting until he misses is crazy! 
LAURA: I know, especially with advantage on the hit. 
ASHLEY: That is not good. 
TALIESIN: So what can I fucking do? What can I fucking do? 
MATT: (chuckles) You know what? He's not going to get up. He's going to stay there, prone on the ground next to you. He's going to keep attacking you. So he no longer has advantage. 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: He's also taking damage, though, as it hits you. So this strike is now going to be his regular attack against you. It's a natural 19. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: Whoa. 
LAURA: Nope. 
MATT: So for that, that's going to be-- 
TALIESIN: It gets three no matter what. 
MATT: 22 points of slashing damage. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. He gets three no matter what. If the third one fails, the third stops it. 
MATT: That's a natural 18. 
SAM: Jesus! 
TRAVIS: Wow! 
LAURA: Try it, though, because if he does it, then he'll keep-- 
TALIESIN: Yeah, you got to do it now. 
SAM: All right, I'll do it. 
LAURA: You got to try. 
SAM: I'll try to Cutting Words. 
LAURA: Oh, and he does another 4d6 radiant. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Oh! That's 17 points of-- No, that's higher! 19 points again! 
MATT: 19 points again. All righty. 
TALIESIN: So, yeah. 
SAM: All right, I'll try to Cutting Words. 
TRAVIS: Basically 12 or higher. 
SAM: (groans) It's only a four. 
MATT: Unfortunately, doesn't do anything. 
TALIESIN: Does for you, Scanlan. 
MATT: So that is going to be-- 
TALIESIN: Fuck! 
MATT: 18 points slashing damage. 
TALIESIN: Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! 
MARISHA: What if she kills him with her armor, though? That'd be sick. 
LAURA: I don't know. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Does it flare again? 
MATT: So that's three more. 
LAURA: And it flares again. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it flares again. Every time, right? 
LAURA: Yeah. Every time. 10. 14 points of radiant damage. 
MATT: 14 points of radiant damage. Okay. He gets three more attacks because all those attacks hit. 
ASHLEY: (gasps) 
MATT: That's going to be a 28 to hit? 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. 
MATT: That's a terrible roll. 14 points of slashing damage. 
SAM: Wait. He keeps getting-- 
LAURA: 14? 
SAM: -- three attacks? 
TALIESIN: Every single time. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: And he takes-- 
SAM: Unless one of them fails? 
TALIESIN: Unless the last one fails. 
MATT: Basically, for each attack, he gets another attack. And once it fails, that stops, but he has three attacks. So the three keep creating additional attacks until, basically, he's missed three times 
LAURA: 18 points of radiant damage. 
SAM: Jesus! 
MATT: 18 points of radiant damage. This is-- 
SAM: That makes sense. 
MATT: Mind you, he's also burning into himself because he chose you as the target. Natural one. So he misses one of his attacks. 
TALIESIN:(sighs) 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: So one of the three threads has failed. Next attack against you. Natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Oh! (sighs) 
MATT: 29. I'm sorry. No, sorry. That's 51 points of slashing damage. 
LAURA: Oh my god! 
SAM: Poor Vex'ahlia! 
TALIESIN: Jesus fuck! 
ASHLEY: Oh my god! 
LAURA: Okay, and he takes-- 
MATT: He takes-- 
LAURA: -- Nine, 11, 14 points of radiant damage. 
MATT: Okay. Attacks you again. That's going to be an 18 hit. 
LAURA: That misses! 
MATT: Misses? So that's the second miss. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: He still has one more attack train going forward. That's going to be a 23 to hit. 
LAURA: That hits. 
TALIESIN: Shit! 
MATT: 27 points of slashing damage. 
LAURA: I go unconscious, and he takes, well, of course eight points of radiant damage. And then, I come back up because of Death Ward. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: That's true! 
LAURA: So I've got one hit point left. 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: And he gets to hit me again. 
MATT: That is going to be a 21 to hit. 
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh! 
LAURA: 21 is my armor class. 
MATT: That is going be-- 
SAM: Does he get hit back? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: He does. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
MATT: That brings you to zero. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LAURA: 13 points of radiant damage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Oh my god! 
MATT: He will now use half his movement to stand up. 
LIAM: Yeah, fuck this Ozo! 
MATT: And he's going to finish the job. 
SAM: Unless he misses. 
MATT: You hear the laughing throughout the minds as he continues to slash and slash and slash. It's managed to hit. It's an auto-crit for a 25 to hit. Two death saves on you. He's going to attack again. 
SAM: Oh! 
MATT: Vex'ahlia, how do you gather your thoughts as the glass blade Carnage pierces into your rib cage? 
ASHLEY: (whispers) Fuck! 
TALIESIN: (sighs) 
LAURA: I think about my children and I know that Vesper will be able to lead. I know Whitestone is safe. I look over at Percy. I don't even know if I can see him. 
MATT: Through the legs you can. 
LAURA: And I reach my hand out to him. 
SAM: Oof! 
LAURA: And as my eyes close, I say: Save him. 
MATT: (impact) 
SAM: Uh! 
MATT: "(chuckles)" He's spent a lot of his movement jumping down there and getting up. So yeah, he can't get to anybody else to continue his thread of attacks. because he can keep going as long as people are near. That'll finish his turn. It is now Vorak's turn. The worm burrows into the ground before (blast) bursting out next to Pike Trickfoot. 
SAM: Oh boy! 
MATT: (whooshes) 
SAM: Does Grog get a hit when he disappears, or no? 
MATT: I'll allow it. You watch it vanishing below, and as it's burrowing since it's big enough, take a strike on it, if you want to. 
TRAVIS: I do have Sentinel. 12. Is it? 20. 
MATT: 20 hits. Oh yeah, and you have Sentinel, don't you? 
TRAVIS: I do. 
MATT: Well then. I shouldn't have allowed it. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: 22, 9, 30, 31. Four points of necrotic. 
MATT: Okay. (sighs) Let's see here. So as it tries to burrow away, you strike it hard and it turns back and focuses once more on you, still longing for the taste it only briefly had of you in its belly. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful! 
MATT: It's going to (whooshes) release a blast of spines around it. So I need you to make a dexterity saving throw for me. 
TRAVIS: You got it. Advantage on dex. 17, 19. 
MATT: 19? That will succeed. So you take 28 reduced to 14 points of piercing damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: Reduced again in half to seven. 
TRAVIS: Seven. Okay. 
MATT: And then it's going to attempt to bite you, since it can't go against anybody else. 
TRAVIS: Yep, yep. That's what Sentinel does. 
MATT: That's going to be a 16 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Misses. 
MATT: Misses. It goes to rear back to try and bite down on you, and you push it out of the way with your axe and knock it to the side. No impact there. 
TRAVIS: Is this for somebody? 
MATT: Cerkonos, you're up, with Pike on deck. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. How far away is Vorak, would you say? 
MATT: Vorak is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 feet. 
ROBBIE: And then, you have full control over Scrag, right? More or less? 
SAM: I do. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Oh my god! 
MATT: Well, you gave it a command and it follows your command on its turn. 
SAM: Yes. 
ROBBIE: Goddamn it. Oh man. (sighs) Yeah, I mean, I'm going to-- I mean, boring, but I'm going to cross over, try to jump down from there and then I'm going to use the rest of my action, I have 50 feet of movement, so I'll use all of my movement to get shoulder to shoulder with Grog up there. 
MATT: Okay. Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: I guess I would have 100 feet total if I used all. 
MATT: Used all of your action. Yeah, I'd say that's about, leaping down, you'd get about here on just your regular movement. And then if you wanted to spend an action to dash, you would be able to make that distance. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: You got it. 
ROBBIE: That'll end my turn. 
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go. 
SAM: Where are your little birds, or whatever? 
ROBBIE: They can come with me, but only up to 30 feet. So they can trail along. 
MATT: Yeah, if you want to. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
SAM: Can they attack remotely? 
ROBBIE: I can only send them 30 feet. Yeah, it's not really an attack. It's if they get in their proximity. Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
MATT: Finishing that go. Pike, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Um. 
LAURA: Yeah, I think you're more than 40. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) I want to get to Vex. I know I only have 40 feet of flight, so I can't-- 
MATT: You can get there if you dash, but that would be your action. 
ASHLEY: Then it would be my action. 
MARISHA: Watch out for him. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Um. Fuck. Okay. Um. I'm going to use Divine Intervention. 
SAM: Ooh. 
MATT: Okay. Call out to the Everlight. How so and what is your request? 
ASHLEY: Um. I grab my symbol and I look at Vex and I say: Everlight, please. Not today. Um. Please bring her back. 
MATT: Okay. As the Sunder King Ozo Cruth is now looking around the battlefield and sizing up his next quarry. You see his weapons (swords ring) sparking as he collides them together and is starting to walk away as Vex's body lay still on the middle of the Hellcatch, rocky, crumbled, earthquake-torn floor. You see what you think to be a shooting star. (faint swoosh) It continues to fall slowly like the tiniest mote, a soft dandelion seed. It drifts down and catches her shoulder where a golden flame (fire rustling) burns across her chest and her arms as the flame flickers. You see her eyes glow and that heartbeat of the Dawnfather's blessing that still sits within her matches it with a flash. As that gold light burns away from her eyes, her eyes blink. You're restored to one hit point. 
SAM: Whoa! (sighing) 
SAM: God stuff. 
MATT: Divine Intervention. (laughs) Level 20 god stuff. Yep. 
MARISHA: But you got to get the fuck out. 
LAURA: I know. It's going to be him again. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) They open and then they close again as she plays possum. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. 
MATT: I mean, that's viable. (laughs) That's your action. 
LAURA: He's still standing over me? 
TALIESIN: There's a bonus action that makes someone still look dead even if they're not. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I don't know if we have it. 
ASHLEY: No, I don't have it, but-- 
MARISHA: What? And try to get them back out? 
ASHLEY: Um. (sighs) I'm just-- I want to-- 
TRAVIS: You did good. 
ASHLEY: I want to get in closer. I want to get in closer. 
SAM: Yeah, sure. 
MATT: So a movement speed of 40? 
ASHLEY: 40 feet. 
MATT: 40 feet. 
ASHLEY: So maybe closer-- That's this way. 
LAURA: But you can fly. 
ASHLEY: I can fly, so yeah. 
MATT: That's true. So you can-- 
LAURA: You need to stay out of Ozo's range. 
MATT: How far up did you want to go? 
TRAVIS: I'll come join you. 
ASHLEY: Yeah? Okay. 
MATT: Like up over here-ish? That'd be about 40 feet there, if you wanted to go higher-- 
ASHLEY: Yeah. Let me-- Let's just-- 
MATT: -- or do you want to be lower. Up to you. 
ASHLEY: That's good. I'm going to stay there. 
MATT: Okay. 
ASHLEY: Hopefully that's not dumb. It's probably dumb. I'm going to do it anyway. Just go. 
MATT: So it's about 30-ish feet up, roughly. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Okay. (sighs) 
MATT: It's a little more than 30 feet. I can change that. 
SAM: Do you have any bonus action? No? Right? 
ASHLEY: I mean, not that I can-- 
SAM: Divine Intervention is not a spell. 
ASHLEY: It's not a spell, so I could do some-- 
LAURA: Yeah, that's true. 
MARISHA: Do you have a bonus action? 
MATT: If you have a bonus action spell you can do that. 
MARISHA: (muffled) Healing Word! 
LAURA: Yeah, you could. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you have any bonus action. 
ASHLEY: Yes. Okay, okay. 
MARISHA: (coos) 
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay, okay, okay. 
MATT: There we go. 
ASHLEY: Yep. Okay. I have it. 
MATT: Just a little more. 
ASHLEY: All right, so. 
MATT: A little more realistic. 
ASHLEY: Bonus action, Healing Word. 
MATT: What level? 
ASHLEY: Oh, I can go higher. 
SAM: Nine. (laughter) 
LAURA: 9th-level Healing Word. 9d4. 
ASHLEY: I can do any level. Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Let's do-- Let's see what I got. Let's see what I got. Okay. Minus. 
SAM: Whoa. 
LAURA: Don't do it too high. It's a four-- d4. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
LAURA: So don't waste a high-level spell. 
LIAM: Yeah, Vex having 10 hit points, or one hit point is not that different. 
LAURA: Yeah, exactly. It's not going to make a difference. 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. Let's do third. 
MATT: Okay. So it's 3d4 plus your wisdom. 
ASHLEY: Cool. Okay. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: 10 points. 
SAM: Woo! 
MATT: So you heal 10. 
LAURA: Hey. 
MATT: Hey, better than none. 
ASHLEY: Better than none. Just play dead. 
MATT: All righty, so as you see her flash to life, as you glide up into the air, you whisper a word to the winds around you that instill her with a flicker of vitality beyond her returning from the edge of death. 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
MATT: That finishes your go. 
LIAM: (jolting) 
MATT: All right. The Vanguard are going to take their turn now. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
MATT: This gentleman's going to get up. He's going to rush towards Percy. He's no longer blind. This figure here is going to rush over to… nobody. It's going to flee. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: With the Bloody Bridge no longer bringing any reinforcements and the surrounding chaos, is going to leap into here and is going to dash down. Leap here. That's about as far as it can get right there. It's just-- 
MARISHA: Run past Grog, you coward. 
MATT: -- booking it that way. 
LAURA: Or Cerkonos. 
MARISHA: Yes. 
TRAVIS: (deeply) Where are you going? 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Who's that again? 
LAURA: Just another bad guy. 
SAM: Someone. We don't know. 
MATT: Yeah. These figures all get up. 
TRAVIS: Those are the guys in the tent? (laughs) 
MATT: Yeah. This one's going to feel bold. He's going to come up here. The guys in the tent are going to continue to run this way. They full-on sprint this direction. 
TRAVIS: Come on, guys. 
MATT: They just, "Oh god!" 
SAM: That went fucking crazy. 
MATT: (laughs) The one that rushed up is going to attack you, Cerkonos. Two strikes. It's going to be 13. 
ROBBIE: No. 
MATT: And a 20. 
ROBBIE: Yes. 
MATT: All right, so you take five points of slashing damage. Does it take fire damage for your elemental form? 
ROBBIE: No. No fire, no poison. 
MATT: Does it take damage from you? 
MATT: Oh yeah. If you're in my proximity, yeah. 1d10. 
MATT: Yes, so roll that. 
ROBBIE: (grunts) Ha! Nine. 
MATT: Nine. Yeah, that hurt him. (flames whoosh). He's looking like he's second guessing his intent to have rushed in. That finishes the Vanguard's round. The Thought Eaters go. This gentleman here, now focusing up, is going to-- 
LAURA: Do those things still work? 
MATT: Yeah. They're still functional. 
LAURA: The orbs are still working? 
MATT: The orbs are still glowing. 
SAM: That's bad. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
MATT: This one here is going to arc (intensifying buzz) and arc right towards you, Grog. 
MARISHA: Goddamn it. 
MATT: Grog, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw for me. 
LAURA: I thought they would not work now that they're reconnected. 
TRAVIS: Sure, sure, sure. 
MARISHA: I was curious, but that answers questions. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Gentle reminder. 
TRAVIS: That's not a d4. (laughs) 
MARISHA: I still have Earthquake up. 
TRAVIS: That is a 16. 
MATT: 16 is a failure, unfortunately. 
SAM: Whoa. 
MATT: You take 41 points of lightning damage. 
ROBBIE: What the-- 
TRAVIS: But I have resistance because I used the Titanstone Knuckles. 
MATT: That's true, so you just take 20 points of any damage. 
TRAVIS: Just 20. 
MATT: So it was this Thought Eater focusing on that orb there-- 
TRAVIS: (sputters) 
MATT: -- which is his turn. This Thought Eater is going to focus in on this focal point here and is going to come in… Hmm. 
MARISHA: We got this. We got this. 
TALIESIN: Mm. ♪ (suspenseful music) #3 ♪ 
TRAVIS: Sounds like "Unsolved Mysteries" right now. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Yep. It's going to psychic slam you, Grog, from up here. That bit there, that's going to be a 28 to hit you. 
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. 
ASHLEY: Oof. 
MATT: So you are going to take 14 points of psychic damage. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: And you are shoved 15 feet this way. 
TRAVIS: Amazing, I'm going to use my Stone's Endurance, a one-time use 1d12 plus six. Seven plus six, 14-- 
LAURA: What? 
TALIESIN: They're immune to psychic-- 
TRAVIS: -- to make that-- 
LAURA: Those guys? I think they're resistant. 
TRAVIS: How much damage was that? 12? 14? 
LAURA: I don't think they're immune. 
MATT: That was 14. 
TRAVIS: 14. Oh, so that negates it. Perfect. 
MATT: Great. Great. There you go. Okay, that finishes their turn. Now the troops, this guy is going to get up. 
MARISHA: You can certainly try. I don't know. 
MATT: No longer blind, he's going to move. 
MARISHA: I'm sure they have resistance, but they might not be immune. 
MATT: This guy is going to move down to here. 
MARISHA: Which big baddie are you talking about? 
TRAVIS: Oh. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: He's going to move down to there and leap off down here and meet Scanlan. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
SAM: Uh-oh. 
MATT: It's fine. I got it. (laughs) This one's going to fire two darts at you, Grog. 
TRAVIS: Naur. 
MATT: Ooh, one's a natural 20-- 
TRAVIS: Hit it. 
MATT: -- and the other's going to be 22 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Both hit. 
MATT: All right so. 
TRAVIS: Obvi. 
MATT: You take for the crit. Rolled a two on the dice, so it's four plus three, so you take seven points of piercing damage, reduced to three. 
TRAVIS: Awesome. Awesome. 
MATT: The other one-- 
TRAVIS: Ow! 
MATT: -- is going to be six points, reduced to three, so you take six points of damage total. 
TRAVIS: Ow! 
MATT: (laughs) The guy there is-- 
SAM: You okay, Grog? 
TRAVIS: (yelps) Yep. I'm great. (laughter) 
MATT: Other guy over here is going to toss two darts-- 
TRAVIS: (grunts) 
MATT: -- at you as well. 
TRAVIS: (grunts) 
MATT: That's going to be a 23 and a 25 to hit. They're rolling really high-- 
TRAVIS: They both hit. 
MATT: -- with shitty attacks. You take seven points, reduced to three, and five points, reduced to two. 
SAM: Grog! 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: No! 
TRAVIS: Oh no. Please. (cries) 
MARISHA: (laughs) (laughter) 
TRAVIS: They're doing really good. Got to make them feel, you know. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: All righty. Then the one down here that's up against you, Scanlan, that troop is going to go ahead-- 
SAM: (blows raspberry) 
MATT: -- and commit you with its glass-edged blade for two attacks. 
SAM: Bring it. 
MATT: That's a 22 to hit? 
SAM: Hits. 
MATT: And a 16 to hit. 
SAM: Hits. 
MATT: Okay, let's go! With that. There we go. Total of 15 points of slashing damage against you. 
SAM: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: That's going to finish their go. Top of the round, Percy, you're up, and Vex on deck. 
TALIESIN: Oh boy. 
SAM: Round three. 
LAURA: Oh my god. (laughter) 
MATT: ♪ High-level, eight-player D&D ♪ 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, how far away am I from that fuck that made me watch-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: -- that shit? 
MATT: You are about a hundred or so feet. 
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to start walking straight towards him. 
MATT: Okay. Around to this guy? 
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't give a fuck. 
MARISHA: Yeah, come on, Percy. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't-- 
MARISHA: No mercy! 
ASHLEY: -- give a fuck! 
MATT: You're about there at 30 feet. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
MATT: That one guy will get an attack of opportunity against you. That's going to be a 20. 
TALIESIN: Sure. 
MATT: Okay. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage. 
TALIESIN: Afterwards, I literally shove him by the face aside. 
MATT: Just. (scratching impact) 
MARISHA: Palmed. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Oh, we've decided that's not a thing anymore? I don't know why I bothered. 
MARISHA: Don't fuck with it. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Don't fuck with it. 
TALIESIN: So that was eight points of damage? 
MATT: Correct. 
TALIESIN: So-- 
LIAM: I've lost-- 
TALIESIN: I'm going to put that up there. Eight points of damage. I feel like-- Five, 10, 15, 20, 25. I guess that's 30. I'm within 90 feet of that ass now. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Dat ass. 
SAM: Are you talking about your wife? (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I mean, there's a reason they got five kids, right? 
MATT: I mean. (laughter) 
SAM: Coming for that ass. 
TALIESIN: Here we go. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Yeah, so-- 
MATT: Her title got longer over the years. (laughter) 
MARISHA: Mistress of the Grey Hunt-- 
MATT: Grey Hunt-- 
MARISHA and MATT: -- dat ass. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Smoke is going to start pouring out of my fucking collar. 
LAURA: (gasps) It's bad? 
TALIESIN: Every fucking go. 
SAM: What? 
TALIESIN: It is trailing behind me as I'm goddamn walking. I cast Hex on that asshole. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: He also now has disadvantage on strength ability checks. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Oh, the one in the house? 
SAM: This is a different smoke monster? 
TALIESIN: This is no smoke monster. This is just a scar. 
MARISHA: He left a little reminder. 
LIAM: Left residual. 
MATT: Yeah, it's just a facet that remains. 
TALIESIN: It's just what happens when I'm really pissed. 
LAURA: Or really turned on. 
TALIESIN: That, too. 
ASHLEY: It's just trauma. 
SAM: Because if so, we have to do some rewrites. 
TRAVIS: It's real smokey in the bedroom. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: There's a lot of soot on the ceiling. 
TALIESIN: So he's standing upright. 
LIAM: If there's crude oil coming out of the de Rolo's bedroom, do not go in. 
TALIESIN: All right. How far away from him am I right now? 
MATT: You are-- 
MARISHA: Just in caseies-- 
MATT: -- about 60 feet. 
TALIESIN: About 60 feet? Okay. Then if it's just about 60 feet, I'm in enough room to pull out a small steel bar, a ball. 
LIAM: Pull out his ball. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Fucking toss it straight at him. I'm tossing Manners at 60 feet. 
MATT: Okay. (quick whirl) Does he make a save or are you rolling to hit him? 
TALIESIN: I roll to hit. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: So that's 20 to hit. I wish I had advantage on this shit but I'll take what I can get. Come on, motherfucker. 15. Fuck. 
LAURA: (sighs) 
MATT: 15 misses. 
ASHLEY: Wait, are you within 30 feet of me? You're not. 
TALIESIN: I'm not within 30 feet of you. 
MATT: It's unfortunate. Manners arcs past and (light impact). 
TALIESIN: Is that an attack, or--? 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: Manners is an attack. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so I have a few more attacks. All right. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: It never works. 
TALIESIN: No, nothing ever works. 
TRAVIS: You threw a racket ball at him. (laughter) 
MARISHA: You were trying to catch that Charizard. (laughter) 
MARISHA: (yells) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: That would've gone real goddamn well. 
MATT: That would've. Hey man, big swings-- 
TALIESIN: That's okay. 
MATT: -- that's what it's for. 
TALIESIN: Big swings. I'm going to pull out Bad News. 
MATT: Motherfucker. 
TALIESIN: And I'm going to-- Thank you, man. I'm going to pull out Bad News. I'm going to start shooting. I'm going to shoot. 
MATT: Let's go. 
TALIESIN: Yep. Here we go. Fuck this shit. I'm also going to spend a Grit point for advantage. 
MATT: All righty. 
TALIESIN: I'm done with that. All right. That's-- 
MATT: Actual Hex text on that one. 
TALIESIN: -- much better. 23 to hit. 
MATT: 23 to hit? 
TALIESIN: Oh, no, I'm so sorry. 14. I read that wrong. 28 to hit. 
MATT: 28 definitely hits. 
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's 2d12 plus six. That's eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 points of damage plus three points of necrotic damage. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
TALIESIN: And that's shot two. Three is a reload. Shot four is-- I do not have Grit, so I'm just going to take a shot at it. That's 26 to hit. 
MATT: 26. 
MARISHA: Kill him. Come on, Percy. 
TALIESIN: That sucked. Five-- 11 points of normal damage. Two points of necrotic. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: So that's where I am. I'm going to spend an Action Surge. 
MATT: All right. 
SAM: Not enough damage. 
TALIESIN: I'm doing math. Sorry. 
ASHLEY: He's walking. 
TALIESIN: One second. 
MATT: Yep. Just (gun clicking). 
TALIESIN: One is reaction. There we go. 
SAM: Racketball. 
TALIESIN: So. (laughter) 
MATT: (ball clanging) (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Don't fuck it up. Okay. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Shit, I need a crit really goddamn badly. 
MATT: Ozo just kicks it away. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
TALIESIN: (scoffs) That's bullshit. 
MARISHA: Pike's going to walk by later. Get smashed by it. Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: What'd you roll? 
TALIESIN: I rolled a two, which means it misfires. 
MATT: Misfire. 
TALIESIN: I pull out Animus. 
MATT: Okay. 
ROBBIE: Animus. 
TALIESIN: So I take an Animus shot. 
ASHLEY: I don't understand how you give him like 10 turns and then I'll do one turn. 
TALIESIN: That's with Animus, that's 13, 25, 28 to hit. 
MATT: 28 hits. 
TALIESIN: That's-- Where are they? 1d10, 1d6. 
LIAM: Action Surge. 
TALIESIN: And another 1d6. 
TRAVIS: The man's at work in the workshop. 
TALIESIN: So that's five. 
MARISHA: Your damage rolls are pretty low. 
TALIESIN: They suck. 
MARISHA: I'm sorry. 
TALIESIN: 12 points of damage. One point of necrotic damage. 
MATT: (bullets impacting) 
TALIESIN: I'm sorry. 12 points of damage, one point of psychic damage, two points of necrotic damage.

TALIESIN: Yep. 
MATT: He's going to spend his reaction to do Whirling Parry. which adds plus three to his AC to the end of the turn. So weapons are going (weapons whirring) and one of the shots he (weapon swishing) parries it off to the side. 
TALIESIN: Cool.

TALIESIN: No. 
MATT: I was going to say, you got more, right? From your Action Surge. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh my god. 
TALIESIN: One to reload. Another attack. I'm so sorry, guys. This is going to be a second because I am done with this shit. 
ASHLEY: Just do it. 
LIAM: Yeah, do it. 
ASHLEY: Get him. 
MARISHA: Defend your wife. 
SAM: Legend says he's still out there, attacking. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: 16, 26, so 30 to hit. 
MATT: That hits. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
ASHLEY: He attacked your baby mama. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's 11 points of damage, four points of psychic damage. 
MATT: Nice. 
TALIESIN: One point of necrotic damage. 
MATT: All right. Let's go. 
TALIESIN: That's the third one, so I have one more after that. 
MATT: One more attack. Yeah. 
TALIESIN: This is one more. 
MARISHA: ♪ 48 more times ♪ 
TALIESIN: You don't even know, man. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: 15. Yeah, that hits. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Sorry. Wrong dice. That's 15 points. 15 points plus four points of psychic damage plus one point of necrotic damage. 
TALIESIN: Jesus. These are sucking. 
MATT: Twenty. 
TALIESIN: Action Surge. 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: You can do three Action Surges? 
LIAM: I think it's two. 
MATT: I think it's just two. 
TALIESIN: Hold on, hold on. Let me double check. I have it written down here. 
MARISHA: He caught you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, I do. Okay. I ran both of those. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's-- Jesus, I cannot believe he's still standing. 
MATT: Yeah, he's looking pretty hurt. 
LIAM: He's a chonker. 
MATT: Oh, he's looking hurt. 
TALIESIN: All right. 
LAURA: He's looking hurt. 
ASHLEY: He's looking pretty hurt, he said. 
MATT: He's looking hurt. 
MARISHA: You did good. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I know. 
MATT: All right, Percy. 
LIAM: He's at 40%. 
MATT: (gunfire and bullet impacts) Just blasting him. (exhales sharply) He's like. (coughs) Bit of blood come out. (sniffs) "(chuckles)" That's your turn. That's Percy. Vex, you're up with Keyleth on deck. 
LIAM: Jesus. 
LAURA: (blows raspberry) 
SAM: Finish him! By running away. 
MARISHA: Get the fuck out. 
TRAVIS: Get away. 
MARISHA: Get the fuck out. 
LAURA: I'm going to-- 
SAM: By running away. 
LAURA: -- disengage. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Which hopefully he doesn't ignore. 
LAURA: And fly up in the air. 
MATT: Okay, so you get on your broom. So it's half your movement to get up from prone, essentially, so we'll say it's 30 feet in the air you can (whooshing) shoot up on your broom. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot (whooshing) that way towards the-- (sighs) 
MATT: You got it. 
LAURA: Up. (swishing) (giggles) 
MATT: Up which way? (swishing) 
ROBBIE: Pew pew! 
MATT: Up here? 
LAURA: Yeah, why not? 
MATT: Let's say-- 
SAM: Oh boy. 
TRAVIS: You're going into the suck? 
LAURA: I don't know where else to go. 
TRAVIS: I don't know. 
LAURA: Where's the not suck? 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's all bad. 
SAM: Yeah, it's bad everywhere. Up there, at least your brother is-- 
MARISHA: Happen again. 
SAM: -- a sconce that she can grab. 
TALIESIN: I'm so pissed at these guys. 
TRAVIS: All those little orbs on the staircase are probably defensive. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Right? 
TALIESIN: Well and Earthquake's about to hit. So-- 
SAM: Could be decorative. 
MATT: All right, so. 
MARISHA: Yep. 
MATT: You fly over that direction. 
LAURA: Does he know that I'm up? Did he see me move? 
MATT: If you wanted to try and move away stealthily and even further half your movement and take only 15 feet, then you can roll a stealth check if you'd like. Otherwise he will notice. 
LAURA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: He's got a ranged weapon. 
LAURA: Yeah, then I'm going to get as far away from him as I can. 
MATT: Okay. So that's your movement? 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: So you move about there. 
LAURA: Fuck. Okay. I am going to shoot an explosive arrow at him. 
MATT: Okay. So you whip around. (bow swishing) (arrow firing) Make the shot. 
LAURA: Is he still at 26 DC or is he--? 
MATT: He's 23. Though actually, at the end of your turn, he will spend a Legendary Action to not Action Surge but Surge, which means he regains his reaction. 
LIAM: Be sure you take all your shots, sis. 
LAURA: I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. 
LIAM: Yep. Yep. 
LAURA: That's a 22 to hit. 
MATT: 22 just hits. He will spend his reaction to (weapons whirring), go to another Whirling Parry. 
LAURA: Oh, damn it. 
MATT: He deflects the air off to the side and it (explosion) explodes harmlessly in the distance. 
LAURA: Harmlessly in the distance? There's a lot of things around. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: ♪ Harmlessly in the distance ♪ 
ROBBIE: (groans) 
LAURA: That doesn't hit. That's a 24. On my second arrow. 
MARISHA: 24? 
MATT: 24 misses. Yeah. 
LAURA: 24 misses because he's upped it by three. 
MATT: (weapons swishing) 
SAM: His whirling dervish. 
MATT: Both arrows get cut out in the middle of the air and he's looking up at you. "Oh, we'll finish this again." 
LAURA: Can he reach me? 
MATT: (hums "I don't know"). 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: All right, so that finishes Vex's go. Keyleth, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Coming at you? 
TALIESIN: This is about to help a little. 
SAM: Maybe. Maybe. 
TALIESIN: He's got a little while before he goes. Well, hopefully. We'll see. I don't know. 
MARISHA: I'm going to bonus action to switch forms. 
ROBBIE: (gasps) 
MARISHA: Into my air elemental form. 
TALIESIN: You need get, yeah. 
SAM: Cool. Woo. 
MATT: Okay. (wind whooshing) 
MARISHA: I, as my air elemental form, starts from the top down and as I release the earth elemental form and push off, Earthquake is still up, so another 50 damage to everything. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: As I float to the air. 
MATT: Okay, so you take up into the air? 
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: What's your distance? 
MARISHA: So I believe my fly distance-- Let me pull this up. Hold on. 90 foot flying speed. I'm going to go to the tippity-top of the (speaking gibberish). 
MATT: (whooshing) 
MARISHA: I'm going for the ball. 
MATT: Okay. (wind whistling) 
MARISHA: Can I see my boyfriend? 
MATT: First off. (ground rumbling) 50 damage to all these structures. You watch as the towers on each side (towers crashing) begin to collapse. These current channels for the Weave Mind begin to tumble inwards. 
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! 
MARISHA: I was afraid that was going to take out Vex. 
LAURA: Yeah, that's why I wanted to get in the air-- 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
LAURA: -- before your turn. 
MARISHA: Uh-huh. 
MATT: This will all. (towers crashing) 
TRAVIS: That's huge. That's huge. 
ASHLEY: That's huge. 
LAURA: Before his turn. 
MARISHA: My heart's racing. 
MATT: Leaving this guy floating here. 
ROBBIE: (chuckles) 
MATT: All of this is rubble and-- 
SAM: Teeth. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
SAM: Just loose teeth. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: Took me years to meet enough children at dentists. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: I am the tooth fairy. 
SAM: The tooth fairy is real. (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Hit by laughing gas, "Big fan." 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
MATT: All right, so. 
ROBBIE and TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: What about the other towers? 
MATT: A creature within half the distance of a structure's height has to make a dexterity saving throw. 
SAM: Oh boy, that's a lot of us. 
MATT: So yeah, that's going to be-- 
MARISHA: But you have Freedom of Movement. 
MATT: -- Lieve'tel, Scanlan, and this Weave Mind here, as well as Scrag. 
LIAM: Freedom of Movement doesn't affect this roll, right? 
LAURA: No. 
MATT: No. This is collapsing towers, so. All right, that's going to be eight, 20 points of bludgeoning damage. So what'd you roll? 
LIAM: I got a 16. 
MATT: So it's 22 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Lieve'tel. Scanlan? 
SAM: Full damage. 22. 
MATT: 22 points of bludgeoning damage. 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
MATT: That right there, that's going to be a fail on him. He takes 22 as well. All three of you are knocked prone, and you are currently restrained and buried in rubble from the building. 
SAM: Except for me and the Lieve'tel. 
MARISHA: Correct. 
MATT: That's right, because you are-- 
SAM: We both have-- 
SAM, MARISHA, and ASHLEY: Freedom of Movement. 
MATT: -- of Movement. That's right. 
MARISHA: Which was all part of the plan. 
SAM: It was really good. 
MATT: It's a great spell, man. 
MARISHA: I thought about it. 
MATT: Yeah, you did. All right. 
MARISHA: (sighs) 
MATT: That guy however, though, is completely buried in rubble right there. He's like, "Oh no. I can't get out of here! 
ASHLEY: Rubble, rubble. 
MATT: So much teeth. 
SAM: (laughs) 
MATT: Up here however, this got also-- 
LAURA: Yes, yes! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
LAURA: Throw it down. 
ASHLEY: Take it down. 
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
ROBBIE: Ah! 
MATT: He is now floating over this path here. 
MARISHA: (exhales deeply) 
MATT: Where it was because the rest of that tower has now collapsed and it's out of the battle. I'll put it there for now. (tower crashing) That finishes that point. This tower here is. (tower crashing) Right as you rush up, the tower is collapsing. It is breaking apart in front of you. 
MARISHA: Can I see the ball? 
MATT: You can make a perception or investigation check to see if you can. 
SAM: Come on. 
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, okay. Come on. This is when I need a nat 20. This is only when I need a 20. It was not a nat 20. 15. 
MATT: 15? 15 is just enough. (gasping) 
SAM: (sighs) 
MATT: As it is cracking and breaking and falling, you reach forward and you can see part of it starting to pull away. As you do, you can see the mechanisms inside of it are all pushed into this dark sphere. This sphere that is a small, rapidly spinning, vibrating glass, gathering of dark shadow. It looks like it's strained and cracking. (ball crackling) 
SAM: Oh god. 
LAURA: (gasps) Cracking? 
MATT: You see it as you reach out and encapsulate it with your wind-charged essence. 
MARISHA: Yeah, I almost want to go because I can encompass a space, so I almost want to take it into me. 
MATT: Take it. You fill the gaps in there. 
ASHLEY: Cool. 
MATT: And to try and pull it out with you. Make a strength check for me if you don't mind. 
MARISHA: A strength check. 
MATT: I'll say strength or dexterity on this because you're also trying to pull it through the gaps. 
LAURA: He's inside of you one last time. 
MATT: Using the physicality of your-- 
LIAM: Good work. 
LAURA: I know. 
MARISHA: Yeah, using my-- 
LIAM: Balls deep. elemental form. 
MATT: Yeah, your form. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
SAM: Balls deep. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: I'm making sure-- (wheezing laughter) 
MARISHA: -- there's nothing here. 
LIAM: They started it. 
TRAVIS: Nothing sacred to us. 
MATT: Never. 
TRAVIS: Nothing's sacred. (wheezing laughter) 
SAM: Oh, man. (laughter) 
LIAM: It's a very beautiful moment. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LAURA: You got this, Keyleth. (laughs) 
MARISHA: Come on. 
LIAM: (exhales deeply) 
MARISHA: Okay. 18. 
MATT: 18. You shift your form through focusing on where the sphere is placed within you. As you do, you maneuver it through and around its fragile state, being maneuvered through the crumbling tower. As you emerge from the outside, the last bits of cables that are affixed to it, pulling and pulling, trying to yank it back as part of the main device before they snap. As they pull away, the sphere shatters-- 
LAURA and ROBBIE: (gasp) 
MATT: --inside you. And a cluster of black shadow drips out of your body. 
SAM: Ugh. 
MATT: (shadow fluttering) (shadow whooshing) Gently hits the ground-- 
MARISHA: Oh no, no, no. 
MATT: like mist. There you see, forming-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- before the now-crumbling remains of the Malleus Key as it teeters and smashes onto the ground, you see the black shadow form the tattered, standing form-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- of Vax'ildan. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
LAURA: (squeals) 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
MATT: Oh god. DANI: (distant scream) 
TRAVIS: Oh, holy shit. 
SAM: (laughs) Dani. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh! That's foreshadowing. 
MATT: Yep. 
LIAM: (grunts, clears throat) 
ASHLEY: (sighs) 
MARISHA: You cannot die. You cannot die, Vex'ahlia! 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
SAM: Actually that would be-- 
LAURA: Watch me. 
SAM: -- pretty poetic. 
MARISHA: No! 
ASHLEY: No! 
SAM: It would be, though. It would be. She sees her brother for 10 minutes. 
TRAVIS: Oh, brother! (sound of impact) 
SAM: (groaning) 
LAURA: 10 minutes? 
ASHLEY: Not happening today. 
LAURA: 10 minutes? 
SAM: 10 seconds. 
LAURA: It's like, I won't even say a word. 
MATT: This tower is gone. 
MARISHA and LAURA: The tower is gone? 
ROBBIE: Tower's gone? 
MATT: It has collapsed and crumbled to the ground. 
LAURA: Mission successful. Let's get the fuck out. 
ROBBIE: What's all that? 
MATT: Vax'ildan, if you wouldn't mind rolling initiative for me. 
LAURA: Oh! 
SAM: Ohh! 
ROBBIE: Wow! 
MARISHA: What! 
SAM: He starts back again at level one, right? 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. That's how it works. (laughter) 
MATT: As a note-- 
MARISHA: Fucking pull you away. 
MATT: Vax? 
LIAM: Yes. 
MATT: Due to the state of your physicality and the damage sustained at the attack on the tower, you do start at minus 65 hit points. 
LIAM: Minus 65. 
LAURA: Because we Earthquake-d the tower? 
MARISHA: Because we-- 
TRAVIS: I mean, we got to get the tower down. 
LIAM: Yes. 
TRAVIS: There was no way around it. 
LIAM: Understood. 
MATT: The tower-- 
LAURA: We had to get the tower down. 
MARISHA: Because of him being attached to it? 
MATT: Of course. Well, also just the-- 
TRAVIS: Strain of being-- 
MATT: -- the strain of being in the tower-- 
MARISHA: Of being-- 
MATT: -- for a long time. 
MARISHA: -- in the tower for weeks, right. 
LIAM: You said-- 
MATT: A little bit of jostling. 
LIAM: Minus 65? 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TRAVIS: And trapped-- 
MARISHA: It's okay. 
TRAVIS: -- for weeks. 
MATT: Minus 65. 
LAURA: Smidgen of jostling. 
LIAM: A natural 20. 
ASHLEY: Oh! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! No. 
MATT: For a? 
LAURA: That's a way to start. 
LIAM: For, well-- 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
MATT: An initiative of? 
LIAM: 25. 
MARISHA: Oh my god. 
LIAM: So that's before your sister. 
LAURA: Yes, it is. Of course it is! 
MARISHA: But after Percy. 
MATT: After Percy and before Vex. 
MARISHA: Vax, wow. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MARISHA: So wait, where's my air elemental form, then? 
LAURA: Have to go first-- 
MATT: Oh right. 
LAURA: -- every single time. 
MATT: Elemental would be-- 
MARISHA: I'm still floating. 
MATT: Up here right now. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
LIAM: What was it? Between you and Percy? That's what it was? Got it. 
MARISHA: It's okay. We can pretendsies. 
LIAM: (sighs) 
MATT: Here you go. That works. 
SAM: This map is crazy. 
MARISHA: Okay. 
SAM: There's six floating things. 
LAURA: It's crazy that it's only the third round. 
SAM: And a bear on a monster. 
MARISHA: Does anything else happen because of Earthquake? I guess that's it. That's my turn, right? 
MATT: Yeah, that's it. 
LAURA: Oh, that sucks that you-- 
MATT: Because you've used your action action to pull it out. 
LAURA: -- don't get to go, though. 
MATT: That finishes your go, Keyleth. All right. It is now Scrag's turn. Scrag was given the command to attack whatever was on its back. 
SAM: Ah. That was me being an asshole. I meant attack Ozo Cruth. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: Okay. As Scrag shifts right there. 
ASHLEY: Ooh. Look at that mean face. 
MATT: Shift on-- And Percy back away. 
ASHLEY: Oh, he's kind of cute a little bit. 
MATT: Shift on its master at the moment. As Ozo looks over his shoulder, seeing the strange action of one of his prized bonded companions turning on him in the moment, its eyes wide and affected with strange, aberrant magic. It's going to take its attacks on Ozo. 
LAURA: I love that Trinket is riding his back, though. Trinket's having the fucking time of his life. (laughter) 
MARISHA: This is awesome. 
LIAM: He got spit out. 
TRAVIS: (howls) 
MATT: "What?" 
MARISHA: Whoa! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: I'm fighting, Mama! 
MATT: Actually at the end-- 
SAM: He probably thinks-- 
MATT: -- of that last turn. 
SAM: -- he's doing it. 
LAURA: Mm-hmm. 
MATT: Ozo's going to use another Legendary Action to Surge and regain his reaction-- 
ASHLEY: I'm a good boy. 
MATT: -- because he's going to want that. So with that, let's go with the four scythe claw attacks against Ozo. Ooh. That's a natural 20. 
TRAVIS: Ooh! 
MATT: A natural 17 and a natural 18. 
TRAVIS: Ooh hoo hoo. 
ASHLEY: Damn. 
TRAVIS: Good boy. 
TALIESIN: This is the irony I'm okay with. 
TRAVIS: Good boy. 
MATT: And a 22. Ozo is going to take them all. 
TRAVIS: Really? 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: I don't like the confidence in which you said that. 
ASHLEY: I don't either. 
MATT: So that's going to be-- 
TRAVIS: With which you said that. 
MATT: -- 4d10 for each of these. 
TRAVIS: Why? 
LAURA: Why? 
MATT: So that's going to be 22 points of damage against him. 
LIAM: Where's Scanlan? 
MATT: Oh, that's a bad roll. 
LAURA: On the other side. All the way over. 
MATT: 20 points of-- 
LAURA: With Lieve'tel. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Third one. 
ASHLEY: Why would he take it all? 
MATT: That's better. 
SAM: Why would he take what? 
LAURA: The hits. Even a crit? 
MATT: And… Ozo starting to look pretty hurt, not happy. 
LAURA: Maybe all the hits were higher so that it wouldn't have mattered. 
MATT: Well, the three did not recharge its corroding spray. It's going to do its final attack against him, which is its mandibles, its razor mandibles. That's going to be a 21, which misses. So the mandibles do not strike. Actually, I'll say it strikes down and he puts his mace up and lodges it in the mandible, looks up and just goes, "Shh!" 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: The beast is going to look confused at the moment. At the end of its turn, does it get to try and save against your Domination?
SAM: At the end of my turn. 
MATT: Your turn? Okay. 
SAM: Or if it gets injured. 
MATT: Or if it gets injured. Okay. Okay. Well, that's going to finish Scrag's turn, in which it unleashed on its master. That brings us to the-- There's no more arrivals, since the Bloody Bridge is destroyed. That's going to bring us to Lieve'tel, who is currently holding the beacon in your hand. 
LIAM: Prone, right? 
MATT: Prone. No-- 
LAURA: No you don't-- Oh, wait. 
MATT: No, you ignore prone because of the-- 
LIAM: Oh, I can stand through. 
MATT: -- Freedom of Movement. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Yeah. Make a wisdom saving throw for me, please. 
LIAM: Okay. 
LAURA: Oh, jeez. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Oh, a wisdom save? 
LAURA: Because the beacon is just-- 
MARISHA: Oh, shit! 
LAURA: She's just holding the beacon. 
LIAM: Not good. Oh, well, 15. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: 15? 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Okay. So, as you hold it in your hand, clutching your fingers, you feel the essence of it pulling you in. You lose yourself momentarily. You can continue with your turn if you want to, but you are distracted for your turn. So any attack, any rolls you make are at disadvantage and you can move half your speed. 
LIAM: Half my speed. I can't really see over this map too well, I've been-- 
MATT: That's why they built handles. 
LIAM: -- going around the entire table trying to see. 
MATT: So you were right here. 
LIAM: I would've seen-- If I was still on my feet, I would've seen the air elemental pulling the sphere and then spilling it out, and I see Vex'ahlia flying above, really injured. So what I would like to do is try to walk as close as I can to Vex and where the ink dropped out. I don't know if that's the bottom of the steps. 
MATT: Yup, it's about there. You can get-- Because you move half movement. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Which is 15 feet. That'll get you right next to Scanlan on the other side. 
LIAM: I look within 60 feet of Vex'ahlia. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: She cradles the beacon in one hand after pulling her face away from it, and she pulls a bone staff with a little boned claw on the end holding a gem and aims it-- No. No, that's-- I'm not going to do that. 
LAURA: What? 
LIAM: She holds her hand out and shadow spills out around her like a blouse, covering the floor, creeping up the stairs and wafting into the air and she casts Mass Heal. I'm going to burn my ninth. 
SAM: Whoa! 
ROBBIE: Whoa! 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: That's nuts. 
LAURA: That's huge. 
LIAM: I'm looking at the wrong shit! (sighs) So that's hundreds of hit points. 
LAURA: 700 hit points. 
LIAM: 700. So she will hit Vax and get him to full. She will hit Vex and get her to full. 
MATT: Hold up. 
LIAM: Tell me the amount to your max. It's like-- 
LAURA: 140… 
LIAM: So that's, okay. 
MATT: What's the total to your max? 
LAURA: To get to my max is 147. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: To Vax, it was-- 
TRAVIS: 147. 
LIAM: 65. So he's at full. I have almost 500 left. She will heal Centaur. She will heal, is Percy within range? 
MATT: Percy is about 100 feet from you. 
LIAM: Okay, so no. 
MARISHA: Grog? 
LAURA: Fuck. 
LIAM: Herself. 
MARISHA: Grog could take it. 
LIAM: I don't know if Grog is probably cusp. 
TRAVIS: I'll take 100 if you got them. 
LIAM: I've got-- 
MATT: Grog's further than-- 
LIAM: I can't reach many people. It was really just to hit the twins. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful. 
MATT: Okay. The Reiloran on the ground, the two Reilorans here are going to use their reactions to use Dampen Divinity. 
SAM: Oh shit. 
MATT: Which halves the amount of hit points gained. 
SAM: Oh, shit! 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: Hasn't been an opportunity for them to show this in the past, but they as a reaction, can reduce healing. 
LIAM: Wow! My 8th and 9th-level spells-- 
ASHLEY: Whoa! 
LIAM: -- got kicked in the nuts this game. 
SAM: So wait. 
LIAM: Okay. 
SAM: We still get healed, but half? 
MATT: You still get healed but whatever you received from that heal, you get half of it instead. 
LIAM: If I have 700 can I continue to funnel-- 
LAURA: I know but if you have 700 hit points would it be-- 
LIAM: -- the excess since it's so few people? 
MATT: It's the idea if they-- You do the healing-- 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: -- and then the heal is reduced to half. 
LIAM: I got you. I got you. 
SAM: They're both doing it so it gets halved and halved again? 
MATT: Well, this one is reducing Vax. 
LAURA: Oh. 
MATT: This one's reducing Vex. 
SAM: Oh. 
MATT: Then this one's reducing Lieve'tel. 
LAURA: Lieve'tel's. 
SAM: What about me? 
MATT: Actually, this one can reduce Scanlan. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: So everyone, whatever would get you up to, whatever gap you have to full-- 
LIAM: Cut it in half. 
MATT: You cut that in half. 
SAM: Okay. That's great. 
MARISHA: It's still really good. 
MATT: That's all their reactions. That's still great. 
LAURA: That's still great. 
MATT: But that is an innate ability of the Reilorans. 
LAURA: That's still 71 points. 
ASHLEY: That's fine. 
MATT: They devour divinity. 
LIAM: That hurts. 
TALIESIN: Okay. 
LAURA: But that's still great. 
TALIESIN: It's still, yeah, it's a game changer. 
LIAM: I mean, sometimes you cast Tidal Wave and it doesn't do as much as you'd like. 
LAURA: Yeah, sometimes you cast Earthquake-- 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: -- in a city made of flesh and nothing moves. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 
LIAM: Yeah. Okay, so I'm doing my own math. 
MATT: It's okay, mister two characters on the board right now. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: You got plenty to do. 
LIAM: I don't know if I can keep up! 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: Wowsers. 
SAM: What am I doing next? 
ROBBIE: Everything's fine. 
LAURA: Lieve'tel, and Grog's up next. 
SAM: What are we doing? 
LIAM: I can cast a cantrip-- 
SAM: Do we run? Do we kill? 
TALIESIN: We kill. 
LIAM: -- after that action? 
LAURA: As a bonus. 
MATT: If it's a bonus action. 
LAURA: If it's a bonus cantrip. 
LIAM: If it's a bonus? No, forget it. Thank you. 
MARISHA: No! 
MATT: Is that your turn? 
LIAM: Yeah, that's my turn. 
MATT: Do you want to move anywhere? Oh, you already moved. Yeah. 
LIAM: I moved, yeah. 
MATT: So, you look up, cast Mass Heal. It gets half eaten by the surrounding Reiloran essences but it's still enough to greatly help your friends, and you continue to walk, holding this beacon that is like-- (hollow, disorienting whoosh) You feel like you're getting vertigo just walking with it. All right, that finishes your go, Lieve'tel. The Shrikes go. This one is going to rush up to Grog there. I think that's the only standing Shrike at the moment that I can see. So it's going to come at you, Grog, with its arm blades. It's going to be three attacks against you. 
MARISHA: It's like he has arms-- 
ROBBIE: They're blades. 
MARISHA: -- but they're blades. 
MATT: Yeah, that's weird. Natural 20. 
ROBBIE: Oof! 
MATT: 25-- 
ROBBIE: Jeez. 
MATT: -- and a 12. 
TRAVIS: First hits, second doesn't. I'll use my retaliatory strike as well. 
MATT: Okay, so two hits and a crit. Oh, sorry. One hit and a crit. 
TRAVIS: Beautiful. 
MATT: All right, so the crit is going to be a nice old 11 points of slashing damage, reduced to five. 
TRAVIS: Got it. 
MATT: The one that hits you is going to be seven points reduced to three. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 22 to hit? 
MATT: That was-- Oh. Yeah, that hits. 
LAURA: (laughing) Oh no! 
LIAM: Tried to change a thing on my page and it vanished. 
LAURA: Don't do it! 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can't do it. You can't do it. 
MARISHA: Dude. Don't forget. Don't touch it, don't touch it. 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. I should fix that. 
LAURA: Fuck. 
TRAVIS: 30 points of slashing damage, three points of necrotic. 
MATT: Ooh! 
ROBBIE: (impressed whistle) 
MATT: He's looking real hurt! Comes at him. (slashing) 
TRAVIS: Fire! 
MATT: Dark shark eyes go wide for a second as you: Wham! Falls to the ground and kind of (delirious grunts) and is a little dazed. Like, (delirious) "Come at me, bro." (laughter) 
MARISHA: Aw! 
ASHLEY: Pew. 
MATT: Don't say cute. It's a killer! 
ROBBIE and LAURA: (laugh) 
MARISHA: Aww, he's going to go all ten rounds, buddy. 
ASHLEY: Aw, you're so tough! 
MATT: Fair. All right, that finishes the Shrike's go. Grog, you're up with Scanlan on deck. 
TRAVIS: Grog starts to vibrate and he looks down at the little Shrike and goes: Run. And starts walking slowly past the Shrike, knowing he'll take the attack of opportunity. 
MATT: Okay, you walk past the Shrike. The Shrike is going to take the attack of opportunity. Ooh, natural 19. I think it's going to be a 28 to hit. 
TRAVIS: Hits. 
MATT: You take, ooh, a whopping 11 points of slashing damage reduced to five. 
TRAVIS: I'll take it. 
MATT: (laughs) As you walk by, it turns around, and looks right at the massive flaming elemental that is Cerkonos in front and is like-- 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: (sighs) "I'm going to, I'm just going to go. Right this way." 
TRAVIS: Grog's going to look over and say: Hey, Ozo the Bozo! ♪ (roughly hums battle theme) ♪ He starts doing his own theme music. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: ♪ (continues theme music) ♪ 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: Race you to the bottom. 
ASHLEY: Get him, Buddies! 
MARISHA: Let's fucking go! 
TRAVIS: I'll engage Ozo. 
LAURA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: I'll go reckless frenzied rage. 
MATT: (laughs) Yes! 
TRAVIS: I'll make the first of three attacks. 
MATT: Let's go. 
TRAVIS: Great Weapon Master on all of them. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: On all of them? 
LIAM: Shit, yeah! 
MATT: All right. 
TRAVIS: The first one is 32 minus five, is 27. 
MATT: 32, it's going to be 27. That hits. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
LAURA: Is he at 26 or is he 23 right now? 
MATT: He's at 23 now. 
TRAVIS: 32 minus five is 27. 
MATT: That hits. 
TRAVIS: Okay, third one. I'll make this a disarming strike with a superiority die. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: That's 14, 16, 30, 36, 31 to hit? 
MATT: Yeah, they all hit. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Okay, so we'll do-- 
ASHLEY: Let's go, Buddies! 
LAURA: Let's go, Grog! Where's the popcorn? 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 10, 11, 12, balls. 25, 35 on the first one. Second one is nine, 10, 18-- 
LAURA: Yeah, it was that one. 
TRAVIS: -- 18, 20, 20, 23, 33 for the second one. The third one is three, seven, plus four is 11, 21, 31 plus 36 for the third one. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? (cheering) 
ROBBIE: Get him! 
LAURA: Yes! 
MARISHA: Yes! 
TRAVIS: I'll take the bloodaxe and cut once into his left delt, which sends his shoulder sagging. 
MATT: His mace (heavy clatter) to the ground with a heavy hit. 
TRAVIS: I'll cut once into his right delt, which sends the other arm sagging. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
TRAVIS: For the third one, I'll start low. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: He's going to start running at you. 
TRAVIS: (grunt of attack) Yeah, navel to chin. 
MATT: You do so, and the blade stops partway in. The axe lodges up. His dense torso and ribcage catches it inside. The axe is burrowed into his abdomen and won't go through, his arms themselves, hanging to the side, useless. He pulls in and leans into your face. (snarling huffs) 
TRAVIS: I can fix that. (bludgeoning punches) 
MATT: (groans) 
MARISHA: Oh my god! 
TRAVIS: My hand goes into his rib cage and I (forceful reach) into his mandible. 
LAURA: Oh! 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
TRAVIS: ("Ozo") "I'm so sorry for killing my friend. I really shouldn't have fucked with Vox Machina!" (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) (applause) 
MATT: He tried to Uruk-hai you, and it didn't work. Not in his favor. (laughter) 
MATT: Yup. 
TALIESIN: No go for the Uruk-hai. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh, I had this action surge, and I didn't even get to use it. 
ASHLEY: Oh, Buddies! 
TRAVIS: I turn around and look at the big ass worm behind me. (laughs) 
MATT: (laughs) 
TRAVIS: I'll hold it. 
MATT: At the death of their master, both creatures start screeching madly. A sorrowful, baleful cry and fury of vengeance-- 
LAURA: Don't give sad faces right now. 
MATT: -- that makes their creature essence. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MARISHA: They loved their papa. 
MATT: They are both feral and frenzied. All right. 
LAURA: Uh-oh. 
MARISHA: They're all in frenzy? 
TRAVIS: The creatures are feral and frenzied? 
LAURA: They're feral? 
MARISHA: Okay. 
TALIESIN: This one's still under our control, or no? 
LAURA: Still under Scanlan's control? 
TRAVIS: Currently. I heal 10 hit points for the kill. 
MATT: Uh-huh. 
TRAVIS: Temporary hit points. 
MARISHA: Okay. Let's fucking go. 
TRAVIS: I think I used all my distance to get over there. 
MATT: I'm going to put Trinket, Trinket moves into the seat. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Yes, buddy! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: What a good boy! 
LAURA: Who's your daddy now? 
MATT: He's holding on-- 
LAURA: Who's your daddy now? 
MATT: (Trinket growling lowly) 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
LAURA: Get him, Trinket! 
ASHLEY: He's going to get so many scritches. 
TRAVIS: If I use an action surge, that gets my-- I get two more attacks? 
MATT: You do. 
TRAVIS: Not the third frenzied, right? 
MATT: Correct. That's a bonus action. 
TRAVIS: Just the two, okay. But I've used up my movement, so I couldn't really travel if I wanted to, and I've used my bonus action as well. 
MATT: Your movement was five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. You've moved 35. 
TRAVIS: 35. 
MATT: To get to Ozo. 
TRAVIS: I have 50. Could I use 15 feet and use-- My bonus action would be the boots to go 20 additional feet. But I think I've used my bonus, haven't I? 
MATT: You have, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Okay. Then that's my turn. I wouldn't be able to get to wormy, anyway. But I'll start walking back towards wormy so I can put myself between Pike and-- Yeah, if I can be around-- 
MATT: About there or there? 
TRAVIS: -- here-ish, yeah. Just to stand in the way. 
MATT: Yeah, that'll get you there. Cool. 
TRAVIS: Don't even look at my Buddies. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Yeah, Buddies! 
MATT: All righty. That finishes your go, Grog. Scanlan, you're up. 
SAM: I will try to get rid of this thorn in our side, the floaty guy up there in the corner. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
SAM: I will rear up on my hind legs and I'll fire a bolt of lightning up at that one. 
MATT: Okay! 
SAM: Okay, so-- 
MATT: What level? 
SAM: Oh, just, I guess fourth. 
MATT: Okay, so 9d6. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Dexterity saving throw. That is going to be a natural six plus, yeah, that's going to be a 13. 
SAM: No. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's already pretty-- 
MATT: Oh, that's not even, never mind. 
SAM: Okay. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: So 10, 20, and then three more. 26 lightning damage. 
MATT: It tries to glide out of the way, and as the bolt hits it, you see it screech in your mind for a second. (anguished screech) It disintegrates into ash. 
SAM: Yeah! Gone. 
MATT: This one was already-- 
ROBBIE: Nice! 
MATT: --heavily hurt by Vex early in the fight and that was the final blow for it. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
SAM: Thank you. Golf clap. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: (laughs) 
SAM: I will, unless it saves, I will command, do a new command to Scrag. Boy, that worm looks really aggressive. I think you should probably take out the worm, Scrag. Sorry. 
MATT: (laughs) 
SAM: Then, the beacon is behind me with Lieve'tel, right? 
MATT: Yes, Lieve'tel is currently holding it. 
SAM: Does she look okay? 
MATT: She looks a little better than she did before. She's healed up a little bit. 
SAM: She's not possessed by it or anything? 
MATT: Make an insight check. 
SAM: Okay. That's a natural one. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: She's fine. 
SAM: She looks super creepy and fine. Oh, it's a two. It's a two. 
MATT: (laughs) For a total of? 
SAM: Four. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah. I mean, she's hard to read anyway. 
SAM: Scanlan doesn't read people very well. (laughter) 
MATT: Yeah, that makes all the sense. 
LAURA and SAM: (laugh) 
SAM: Then, that's all I'll do, I guess. I'll offer my back to Lieve'tel if they want a ride. 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, they do. 
MATT: Okay. 
SAM: Maybe I'll gallop up the stairs to get closer to Vax. 
ASHLEY: ♪ Ride and ride ♪ ♪ On the fantastic ♪ 
TRAVIS: ♪ Slide slide lippety slide ♪ 
ASHLEY: ♪ Scanlan's ride ♪ 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: All righty, that finishes Scanlan's go. 
SAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Ozo is off the board. 
LAURA: Ha! 
MATT: But it is Vorak's go. 
ROBBIE: Uh-oh. 
MATT: Vorak will (rocky rumble) shift over here. Burrowing over here and seeing the flying, glowing, tiny little morsel that floats there. 
ASHLEY: Ah! 
MATT: You turn around and see it come up behind and it's going to try and strike at you, Pike. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: That's going to be-- 
MARISHA: She's like a grape. 
LAURA: I know. 
MATT: (laughs) 
MARISHA: A single grape. 
MATT: I looked at the wrong one. 
ASHLEY: Just a tasty snack. 
LAURA: Wouldn't she want the whole peach? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: That's Scrag. Vorak's going to be-- 
TALIESIN: Terrible sound. I feel bad about that. 
MATT: 24 to hit? 
ASHLEY: It hits, yeah. 
MATT: Okay. All right, so you take-- 
TALIESIN: I can't do any of that shit. 
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. 
MATT: -- 30 points of piercing damage. 
ASHLEY: Which I'm resistant. 
MATT: Right, so you take 15. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: I need you to make a dexterity saving throw. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: You got this. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Dex, dex, dex, dex. Which one am I going to go with? Okay, let's do this one. Oh, that was almost a natural 20! Did you see it? That's a nine. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: That's a nine. (laughter) 
MATT: You are flying forward, see it coming as you spin to fly away. (Vorak advances) 
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no! 
MATT: Everything goes dark as you see the creature-- (chomp) 
ASHLEY: Damn it! 
MATT: -- and snatch up Pike. 
ASHLEY: Damn it! Right before my damn turn! 
MATT: I know. 
ASHLEY: Okay. That's okay. That's okay. 
MARISHA: You can still do stuff inside. 
ASHLEY: I can do stuff in there. I can do stuff in there. 
MATT: Oh yeah. For its second attack, it's going to bane spines (ejecting) around it. 
LAURA: Bane spines. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
TRAVIS: Pike-y! 
MATT: So Grog, make a dexterity saving throw. 
SAM: Bane spines. 
TRAVIS: Dexterity? 
MATT: Yes, please. 
TRAVIS: You got it. Oh, I thought that was-- Oh, it was a natural 20! Oh! 
SAM: Oh! (laughter) 
MATT: So 28 damage, reduced to half. 
TRAVIS: 19. 
MATT: 28 to 14. 
TRAVIS: Or, yeah. 
MATT: And then half that because of your-- So that's seven. Seven points of piercing damage. 
SAM: At the end of my turn, Scrag gets to make a wisdom save to try to-- 
MATT: Oh, that's true! 
SAM: -- break free of my control. 
MATT: Yes! That is going to be-- No, 19. 19 doesn't do it, right? 
SAM: No. 22. 
MATT: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: (excited growls) 
LAURA: 22! That's huge! 
MARISHA: Yeah, that's high. 
MATT: Yeah. 
MARISHA: Very high. 
SAM: Scanlan was overpowered. 
LAURA: Oh, that's right, because you had those books. 
SAM: Had the Hand Cone of Clarity. 
TRAVIS: Hand Cone of Clarity, baby! 
LAURA: Had? You have. 
SAM: Have, yes. 
MATT: Cerkonos, you're up. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. I'm going to turn and face that little guy right in front of me, blade arm guy that Grog jacked up real bad. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, and I'm going to take a touch attack at him. A big fiery swipe at him. 
MATT: You got it. So move in to here. 
SAM: Come on, Cerkonos! Impress Lieve'tel! 
ROBBIE: I'm trying! 21? 
LIAM: She can't see him. 
SAM: She's watching! She hasn't seen him this whole time. 
MATT: 21 hits. 
ROBBIE: Yeah, and then-- 
LIAM: I thought Cerkonos was with us. 
ROBBIE: Seven. 
TRAVIS: Get him, Cerkony! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: 13 points of damage on that one. 
LIAM: 13 points of damage. 
ROBBIE: And then, he's also on fire. 
MATT: (whooshes) Yes, he is, and he falls to the ground, (crackling impact) looking up at you. "(gasps)" (whooshes) As the flames carve through his skull and he burns. 
SAM: I'm narrating in real time to Lieve'tel what Cerkonos is doing. 
ROBBIE: Oh! Amazing! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Finally feeling confident, looking around the battlefield, seeing all these heroes do this amazing stuff. The earth is shaking. You just puppet mastered a guy. My hero just nuked a guy from the shadows. That's exactly what I'm seeing in my mind's eye. Speaking of mind's eye, I look at my wrist, and even though I don't have a human form, I can picture my favorite bracelet that I made before we left. It says, "W-W-S-D? What would Scanlan do?" (oohing) (laughter) 
ROBBIE: After I vaporized that guy-- 
ASHLEY: Damn, yes! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: -- to myself, I say: Now's your chance to be charismatic and charming, to say something! Make it funny! Make it cool! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Make it perverted! Then, I'm going to use Blink Staff after my attack-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: -- and take 30 feet and poof right in front of the worm-- (laughter) 
ROBBIE: -- because I can teleport right there. 
MATT: Yeah, yeah. 
ROBBIE: I go: Hey! (licking flames) You look like diseased genitalia! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Tell me, does it burn when you urinate? (laughter) 
SAM: Nice! 
ASHLEY: He said, "Nice!" 
LIAM: Is that all the sound of crackling fire? 
MATT: It is. 
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah! 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. You don't hear it. 
LIAM: But there's a fiery hand pointing. (laughter) 
MATT: (intense flames) 
TALIESIN: He feels genuinely bad about that. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Then I'm going to take a punch at his urethra-looking whatever. 
MATT: Go for it. Go for it. 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
LAURA: I thought you were casting a spell or something. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Punch him in the big ball! 
ROBBIE: 18. 
MATT: 18 just hits Vorak, yeah. 
ROBBIE: Just barely. Oh, pretty good! 11 plus seven, 18. 
MATT: 18 points of damage, and it is on fire, correct? 
ROBBIE: Yeah, he is on fire. As I teleported, my birds covered the distance with me after that strike. 
MATT: Oh yeah. So they went. (whooshes) 
ROBBIE: So then, I can force a dex save on the worm? 
MATT: Indeed! 
ROBBIE: 19? 
MATT: With a natural two, it is not going to do it. 
ROBBIE: Sick! That looks pretty good. 10, 13, six, 19, nine, 28, seven. 
MARISHA: Wow! 
ROBBIE: 35 damage from the birds. 
MATT: Woohoo! 
ROBBIE: Since I connected on that attack, I can do one more Blink Step and I'm going to pop into his mouth, inside the body, and upper cut him from the inside. 
ASHLEY: Woo! 
MATT: Let's go! 
ROBBIE: For my last attack. Ugh. Nah! (groans) 
MARISHA: Come on, Flamespeaker! 
ROBBIE: Not great. Yeah, that probably won't hit. That misses. Yeah. But I'm-- 
SAM: Pike, you're now on fire. 
ROBBIE: -- currently-- 
ASHLEY: What was it? 
ROBBIE: It was a 13. Yeah. 
MATT: You were inside its mouth. He's inside his mouth. 
ASHLEY: But I'm within 30 feet. 
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you can see the flame and the light come up the gullet. 
ASHLEY: So what if I did-- 
MATT: War God's Blessing? 
ASHLEY: War God's Blessing. It adds an extra 10. 
MATT: You can do that. 
ROBBIE: Well, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. 
MATT: That'll hit! 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah. Okay. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: Sweet! Thanks! 
MATT: You're tethered and burning in acidic darkness. Then suddenly, a bit of light peers in, and it looks like someone bringing a torch around the corner of a wall, and you see the flaming form of Cerkonos punching his way into the mouth of this creature. 
ROBBIE: Thank you for that! That was 15 damage. 
MATT: Nice! 
ROBBIE: Also, because I'm inside him and occupying his space, which I can do in this form, he's on fire. His head should be on fire. 
MATT: Yeah. The flames are emerging out of its mouth. You are glowing and beating around inside its jaw. That is a pretty solid, it's almost 70 points of damage in one round. 
ASHLEY: Yes! 
MATT: Hell yeah! 
ROBBIE: All right. That's it for everything for me. 
MATT: All right, that finishes Cerkonos's go. Pike? 
MARISHA: Chomping on the fireball. (gnaws) 
MATT: Pike, beginning of your turn. 
ASHLEY: All right. 
MATT: You take-- 
ASHLEY: (muffled) Get me out of here! 
ROBBIE: I'm trying. 
MATT: Oof! 
MARISHA: That was awesome. 
LAURA: No good. 
MATT: Take 25 points of acid damage. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: It's digesting you from within. 
SAM: Pike! 
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's okay. I'm great. I'm a tank! I'm a tank. Okay. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: All right, I am going to (mouth farts) little fart a little bit. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Oh, where did you go? All right, there we go. I'm going to put my hands out on either side-- 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: -- and I'm going to Inflict Wounds. 
MATT: At what level? 
ASHLEY: 7th. 
TRAVIS: Whoa! 
MATT: Whoa! 
TRAVIS: Shit! 
ASHLEY: I'm going to blow this puppy up. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
ASHLEY: All right, so that is-- Hold on, let me roll to see if it works. 
MATT: Now you do have disadvantage on attacks within because you-- Well, it's a touch attack. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
TRAVIS: Yeah. 
MATT: I'll say, even though you're restrained, if anything-- 
ASHLEY: If I'm like this, I can still-- 
MATT: No. You have advantage on the attack. I'll say. 
TRAVIS: Eyy! 
ASHLEY: Okay. All right. 
MATT: A touch attack while you're inside of it, it wouldn't make any sense other way. 
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, that's 21. 
MATT: 21 hits. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
LAURA: Yes! 
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. Great! So that is 9d10. 
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! 
ROBBIE: Oh my god. 
MARISHA: Come on. 
ASHLEY: Might be going a little overboard here, but that's what we're going to do. Okay. I'm going to get my tens. 
TALIESIN: Mm! 
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you. 
LAURA: I have some here. 
TALIESIN: I am excited for this one. 
ASHLEY: All right. So we got-- Is that 10? 
LAURA: A zero is a 10, yes. 
TRAVIS: 15, 17. 
ASHLEY: Okay, so 15, 17. 
TRAVIS: Nine. Yeah, 26. 
TALIESIN: Hmm. 
ASHLEY: That's a little better. 
TRAVIS: 26, 36. 42. One more. 
ASHLEY: One more? 
TRAVIS: Is it 10d10 or how many was it? 
ASHLEY: I think it's nine. 
LAURA: 10. 
MATT and ASHLEY: 9d10. 
TRAVIS: 9d10. Yeah. 
ASHLEY: Thank you. 
TRAVIS: Yep. 
ASHLEY: So that was 40. 
SAM: 42. 
ASHLEY: Two? 
SAM: Two. 
ASHLEY: 42 points of damage. 
TRAVIS: Is it 42 plus anything? 
ASHLEY: 42. Just 42 points. 
MATT: Okay. 
TRAVIS: I'm one dead round already. 
MATT: Okay, has to make a constitution save for half the amount of damage it took. That is going to be a 14. It fails. It spits you out. 
ASHLEY: Yay! 
LAURA and ROBBIE: Yay! 
MATT: Pike Trickfoot-- 
TRAVIS: I got her! I got her! (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Ka-boosh! 
MATT: You know what? You want to go ahead and try maybe? 
TRAVIS: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! (laughter) 
MATT: Make an athletics check. 
TRAVIS: Boof! Oh, sorry! (laughter) 
MATT: Make an athletics check. 
TRAVIS: Okay. 
MATT: With advantage, because you're raging. 
TRAVIS: Eight plus 14. 22! 
MATT: (impact) You managed to baseball mitt catch her. 
TRAVIS: I have Pike-y! 
ASHLEY: Hey! 
TRAVIS: (grimaces) 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: As a bunch of its acid spittle comes up on you as well. (splatter) 
TRAVIS: (shouts) (laughter) 
MATT: But you catch her and set her down. You are no longer within the creature's stomach. 
ASHLEY: Okay. 
MATT: All righty. 
TRAVIS: Look at how little you are. 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
MATT: So, does that finish your turn, Pike? 
MATT and SAM: Turnpike. (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Well, I guess it does because-- All right, so that was that. I don't have any movement. 
LAURA: No bonus action? 
ASHLEY: I mean, I guess I could take, with War Priest, when you use the attack action, you can make a whip. Wow! One weapon attack as a bonus action. 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
MATT: But you can't take an attack action. You used a spell. 
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Sorry. 
MATT: It's okay. Okay. Sorry. 
MATT: It's all good. 
ASHLEY: That's it. That's all I can do. 
MATT: Sure. All right. 
ASHLEY: (laughs) 
MATT: These Vanguard folks are going to continue to run. This guy and this guy are both going to run way over here, get the fuck out of Dodge. 
ROBBIE: Hi! 
MATT: This guy here is going to run and flee. 
SAM: Oh yeah. 
TALIESIN: Ooh shit! 
MARISHA: Sorry. 
TALIESIN: That's okay. I know that changes things. I'll figure it out. 
ROBBIE: Outclassed. 
TALIESIN: Goddamn it! 
MATT: I have finished the Vanguard. This Thought Eater here is going to-- 
TALIESIN: That definitely fucks up my reality a little. 
MATT: -- shift up. 
LAURA: Ugh! 
TALIESIN: Oh, that's something. 
MATT: It's going to fly down into the center here, look up, and raise its hand. 
SAM: Oh, what's this now? 
MARISHA: What now? 
ROBBIE: Mm-mm. 
MATT: You see as the four different orbs here-- 
LAURA: (gasps) 
MATT: -- begin to glow the spectral images of the Weave Mind. 
LAURA: It can still connect? 
MATT: Four of them appearing out of it. 
LAURA: It can still connect to it, even though the moon is not connected? Yeah, it can still connect! 
SAM: Is it casting a spell? 
MATT: The Bloody Bridge was a means for people to travel to and from. 
LAURA: (shrieks) 
MATT: (laughs) 
ASHLEY: Well, maybe Mighty Nein has already done what they were supposed to do. 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Not yet. 
LAURA: Okay. 
SAM: Is it casting a spell? 
MATT: It might be. 
SAM: I will Counterspell it. 
MATT: Okay. What level? 
SAM: I don't know what it's doing. 
MATT: You don't know. 
SAM: So let's say six. 
MATT: 6th? Okay. You see him becoming a conduit for the Weave Mind, all generating all the psychic power into him. Begins to glow, his eyes going from a black, deep, colorless darkness into a bright, vibrant, flickering psychic frenzy. Spins and unleashes this massive blanket of soft psychic cleansing energy in the direction of Scrag. 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
MATT: It (fizzling out) dissipates. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Oh! 
SAM: Amazing. 
TRAVIS: Across the border. 
MATT: It looks over at you and goes, (gasps) as the grace of the Weave Mind blink out one by one. 
SAM: I lock eyes with it and then big piece of poop falls out of my backside. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Or a big horse apple. 
SAM: Yeah! 
LIAM: Horse apples! 
MATT: Which, based on where you're standing, goes (plops)-- (laughter) 
MATT: -- down the stairs. (laughter) 
TRAVIS: Leaves little dots as it goes. 
MATT: Yep. Little Indiana Jones travel line. (laughter) 
ROBBIE: That's funny. 
TRAVIS: Indiana Jones travel line! (laughter) 
TALIESIN: Oh god. 
TRAVIS: (Indiana Jones theme music) 
MATT: These troopers are going to quickly-- 
ASHLEY: (Indiana Jones theme music) 
MATT: -- back into the place, going to try and swarm against the wounded champion 
LAURA: No! 
LIAM: Mm-hmm. 
MARISHA: He just came back! 
SAM: What if Vax forgot how to fight? What if he can't move? What if it's like "Princess Bride" and he's paralyzed? 
MATT: 11. 
LIAM: Miss! 
MATT: 28. 
LIAM: Oh, that'll hit. 
MATT: All right, you take four slashing damage. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: The other guy is going to attack. So advantage on each of these. Natural 20. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: For-- 
LAURA: Cutting Words! 
SAM: You can do that? 
LAURA: Just kidding. (laughter) 
MATT: 20 points of slashing damage. 
LIAM: Lieve'tel can do it. 
MATT: Cutting Words? 
LIAM: Natural 20. No, she's within-- 
MATT: She can steal it. 
LIAM: She's within 30 feet and she does, it's called-- 
SAM: Butt stuff. 
LIAM: -- Sentinel at Death's Door. (laughter) 
MATT: Unfortunately, they're a little beyond 30 feet from her. 
LAURA: Oh! 
LIAM: All right. 
MATT: That's okay. So it's just 20 points of damage. 
LIAM: I can't see over there. Okay. 
MATT: Another one. It's going to be 19 to hit? 
LIAM: Miss. 
MATT: Okay. As he goes striking at this wounded champion, who seems not as affected as they had hoped in this frenzy, begin to step away to the side, and they're both going to leap off. 
LIAM: I'll cut that motherfucker. 
MATT: Yep, go for it. 
MARISHA: Come on! 
LIAM: Natural 20. (laughter) (cheering) 
MATT: Let's go! One for one. 
ROBBIE: Here we go! 
LIAM: Boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Where's the stuff? Where's the stuff? There it is. Okay, so that is with Whisper. So that is. Shite. Four ones, eight. It's nine. Then, necrotic. So nine points of slashing damage and-- Oh wait, no. I got to double the damage. So two, and the necrotic is 12. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
LIAM: Two, two. 10 points of slashing damage, 12 points of necrotic damage, and it has to make a wisdom save, 17, or be afraid of me. 
MATT: Natural 19. 
LIAM: Okay. He's running away now. 
MATT: They succeeded. Okay. 
LIAM: Okay. 
MATT: (grunts) Hits the ground. (grunts) Gets up. It's like they're both hobbling and running away. That finishes their go. Top of the round. Percy, you're up with Vax on deck. 
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my 30 feet and head up towards where we're having a little family reunion over there. 
MATT: Okay. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
MATT: 30 feet will get you just beneath Scrag. 
TALIESIN: Okay! I'm going to, as long as I have clear view of the guy right up in the center right there. Do I have a clear view of him? 
MATT: You do. 
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take an Animus hit and I hope this goes well because I've been rolling crap. Animus shot. It's 29 to hit. 
MATT: That hits! 
TALIESIN: This isn't my pen. Where's my pen? Okay. That's, and I know it's ridiculous for the psychic, but I'll take it. Nine. Nine points of damage. Nine points of damage plus six psychic. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: Here we go for another one. 
TALIESIN: For fuck sakes! Hold on. No, I'm good. 18? 
MATT: 18 hits. 
TALIESIN: (sighs) That is absolute crap. That's 15 points of damage with four psychic. 
MATT: Okay. This one, as you're striking it, blasts are (echoing burst) blasting past an arcane shield that has not been broken yet. 
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. I'm going to take another shot. 
MATT: Or I guess, psychic shield. 
TALIESIN: Nope. And I take 2d6. This has been my game. 
MATT: Oh, buddy! 
TALIESIN: I take 2d6 damage. Here we go. Where is it? Where is it? There we are. 
SAM: He's, you know, he's a little older. 
TALIESIN: I have to take five psychic damage. 
TALIESIN: Also has taken an ungodly amount of damage. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ASHLEY: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I have rolled such shit! It has been embarrassing! 
MATT: And even as such. 
TRAVIS: I retract my statement. 
ROBBIE: You watched your wife die. You're emotionally distraught. 
SAM: Yeah. 
TALIESIN: I know. Yeah, this is the worst I've ever rolled. 
LIAM: We miss the snitch. 
TALIESIN: Then, let's see. I don't have that. 
MATT: Wherever it lies. 
TALIESIN: So that's gone. Hold on. Let see what else I got. 
TRAVIS: Hopefully someone knows what they have. 
SAM: Just send a toy. 
TALIESIN: I can't. That's a full action. 
TRAVIS: A flaction? 
TALIESIN: It's a full action. 
SAM: A flaction. 
MATT: (laughs) 
TALIESIN: Bonus action. What do I got? Second Wind for bonus action. 
MATT: Go for it. That finish your go, Percy? 
TALIESIN: Yeah. Let's see. 1d10. 
SAM: But you exited that way! 
TALIESIN: 23. Yeah, okay. 
SAM: Came back that way! 
TALIESIN: I'm all done. 
MARISHA: Movie magic. 
TRAVIS: Don't drop that! Don't drop that! 
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Is this stuff in real time? (laughter) 
LAURA: We've done no damage to the Scrag. 
SAM: The Scrag? 
ROBBIE: The Scrag? He's been controlled. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: I'd leave him alone. 
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're leaving him absolutely alone. 
MARISHA: Well, for a second. 
TALIESIN: For now. 
MARISHA: For now. 
SAM: Maybe we'll just befriend him. 
MATT: Percy, does that end your turn? 
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. That's everything. 
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up. 
SAM: Oh. (laughter) 
MARISHA: The fuck? 
TALIESIN: I said I'm done. 
MATT: Sorry, I didn't hear that. 
ASHLEY: Oh. 
SAM: He was in his Percy place. 
TRAVIS: In the workshop. 
SAM: Yeah. 
LIAM: I click my boots. 
SAM: The mind palace. (laughter) 
LIAM: In a blink of an eye, I'm going to pirouette around this Reiloran so that I'm on the other side of it, not breaking-- 
MATT: (whooshes) 
SAM: Whoa! 
ROBBIE: (shouts) 
MATT: You pirouetted too far to the city. 
LIAM: Old gray mare just ain't what she used to be. 
TRAVIS: The Matron giveth, then taketh away. 
MATT: (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Centered or not centered? 
MATT: (whooshes) 
LIAM: I will dagger, dagger, dagger. Here we go. 
MATT: Let's go! 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
LIAM: Ooh! That is a natural one. 
LAURA: (gasps) I'll use my first Luck to re-roll it. 
LAURA: Yay! (laughter and cheering) 
TALIESIN: Nice. 
LIAM: That is a 24 to hit. 
MATT: That'll hit. 
LIAM: Okay. So deedle-lee-lee-lee. 
LAURA: ♪ Deedle-lee-lee-lee ♪ 
LIAM: That is three. Plus one is four, plus the necrotic. Four points of slashing, one point of necrotic. Five points. But I will also dump a 2nd-level Smite in it for 3d8. 
MATT: (laughs) He'll dump. 
LAURA: He'll just poop as well as stab. 
MARISHA: He's been in there for a long time. 
MATT: That's true. 
TALIESIN: Yeah. 
MATT: Weeks. 
TRAVIS: If Scanlan can do it, I can do it! (laughter) 
SAM: His is like bird poop. 
LIAM: 18 points of Smite. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: That is the first dagger. 
MATT: With three on that. All right, awesome! 
LIAM: I keep slashing with Whisper. 
MATT: That does shatter the Psychic Shield and now your wounds are going directly to the creature. 
LIAM: 27 points of damage. One. Come on, man! So that is nine, plus the necrotic is 11. And I will dump another 2nd-level Smite in there. So that is five. 
MARISHA: You became the champion and got a cloaca. 
LIAM: 13 points of Smite. 
MATT: Okay. 
LIAM: Last dagger. 
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs) 
ROBBIE: Same hole. 
LIAM: That's a natural one. 
ROBBIE: Sounds great. 
LAURA: Ugh! 
LIAM: I'm going to save the Luck for something more important after doing that once. 
MATT: Okay. It's looking pretty hurt. You over there carving up. as you're rolling around it (blades slashing) and landing on the other side, the Thought Eater is like-- 
LIAM: Yes, fuck it. 
MATT: (grunts) 
LIAM: I burn Luck and I get-- 
TRAVIS: Atta boy. 
LIAM: -- 21. 
MATT: That hits. 
LIAM: Okay. Okay, so that is four is five, and seven is 12 between slashing and necrotic. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? 
TRAVIS: Eyy! 
ASHLEY: Yeah! 
TRAVIS: Welcome back, bitch! 
ASHLEY: Eyy! 
ROBBIE: Fuck shit up. 
LIAM: Okay, so the first slashes as Vax moves to the new position. The dagger streaks across along its gut, and that's what breaks the shield. He continues up its sternum, cutting up to the neck, and then he pushes with such ferocity through that the head goes almost off, leaving a little bit and then falls to the side-- 
MATT: (impact) 
LIAM: -- and splits away. Then he will (whooshes) into the air 15 feet and turn and look to his sister. 
SAM: Whoa. 
LIAM: And then turn and see the swirl of air that he knows to be Keyleth of the Air Ashari. And then, he'll look back to the field. 
MARISHA: I missed you! 
LAURA: Yay! (laughter) 
ROBBIE: You look so hot! (laughter) 
TRAVIS: (wind noises) 
MATT: So you're just staying floating 15 in the air? 
LIAM: Yeah. 
MATT: Okay. So that'll be you right there. There. All right, finishing Vax, Vex, you're up. 
ASHLEY: Also, little late but because I forgot the Blessing of the Everlight, whenever I do healing, you get an additional 10 extra points of healing. So you actually have 10 extra points of HP. 
MATT: There you go. Got 10 more. 
LAURA: Oh! Amazing! 
ASHLEY: Not that it's going to do much now, but-- 
ROBBIE: Can I ask a flavor question? 
MATT: Sure. 
LAURA: That's great! 
ROBBIE: How long you been in that orb? 
LIAM: Half the campaign. Weeks? Many weeks? Months? 
MATT: Probably a good almost two months. 
ROBBIE: Okay. Months. 
LIAM: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: Okay. Got it. 
LIAM: And dead for many years. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
MATT: Off the top of my head, five, six weeks. 
ROBBIE: I was asking if you aged, like everyone else. 
LIAM: No. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. That's what I was curious about, right? Then, you age at a slow rate too, right? 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
ROBBIE: So you guys are still-- 
MARISHA: 10 years for every 100. 
ASHLEY: Looking hot. 
MARISHA and ROBBIE: Yeah. 
LAURA: Look-- 
ROBBIE: I'm creating mental image for myself. 
MATT: No, of course. No, I mean-- 
MARISHA: Yeah. 
MATT: He looks ragged, in the sense that-- 
ROBBIE: Sure. 
TRAVIS: He dead. 
MATT: -- he just emerged from a tortured space. 
ROBBIE: Yeah. 
MATT: But other than that, complexion is still pale and young. 
LIAM: There's also little bits of black cloud or mist wafting off of him as it flies in the air. 
MATT: Mm-hmm. 
ROBBIE: Sweet. 
MATT: All right, Vex. 
LAURA: I'm going to stare at him. It's good to have you back. Then I'm going to take off (whooshes) this direction. 
MATT: (whooshes) 
LAURA: Up and this way, to here, if I can, I want to get away from Scrag. 
MATT: Okay, you can get about-- 
TRAVIS: And the worm. 
LAURA: Up in the air. Up. Yeah. 
MATT: Got a placement here. You could get-- 
LIAM: For a split second, I thought, "What happened to her arm? Oh, it's the shirt." 
LAURA: (laughs) 
MATT: Up there is where you get at 60 feet. 
LAURA: Okay. 
ASHLEY: That mini is so cool. 
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to do something crazy. 
MATT: I like it! Let's go! 
SAM: Whoa! 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: I'm going to shoot two arrows. 
SAM: At Trinket. 
MATT: Okay. (laughter) 
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to bonus action Hunter's Mark the worm. 
TRAVIS: Eyy! (cheering) Let's go! 
MARISHA: She's back! 
LAURA: (laughs) All right, 
TRAVIS: ♪ Hunter's Mark the worm ♪ 
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (laugh) 
LAURA: That is 12 plus-- 16 minus five. 
SAM: 11. 
LAURA: 12 plus 16 minus five is 2O-- 
MATT: 28 minus five. 23. That hits. 
LAURA: Okay. So that is-- (blows raspberry) That's 11, plus Hunter's Mark. It's two. Wow! Oh, darling! I'm rolling shit just for you. 
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you! 
LAURA: Two for Hunter's Mark. Sorry, should I add these things up-- 
SAM: Yes. 
LAURA: -- before I tell you this? 
MATT: That's okay. 
TALIESIN: We've got shitrolling for two. 
LAURA: Sneak attack is 12. Ooh! 18! 19 sneak attack. 
ROBBIE: Yeah! 
LAURA: And then three for Fenthras, and another 10. 
MATT: Okay. Great! (whooshes) The arrow strikes with a pretty heavy amount. 
LAURA: It hits it. 
MATT: Yeah. 
LAURA: Then, I'm going to do it again. 
MATT: Cool! Let's go! (laughter) 
MATT: Let's go! 
TRAVIS: Pulling out all the stops! 
ROBBIE: Two arrows?! 
TRAVIS: All the stops! 
LAURA: Listen, you guys! 
ROBBIE: Let's do it! 
TALIESIN: You got a fancy one left that's interesting? 
LAURA: I do. Well, okay-- I'll do a Residuum arrow on this one. 
SAM: Whoa! 
MATT: Okay. 
LAURA: Which means that the next attack, this next spell that hits this worm-- 
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! 
LAURA: If you hit it with a 5th-level spell or lower, it's going to count it as a one level up. 
SAM: Nice! 
ROBBIE: Oh! 
TALIESIN: This is a little bonus kick. 
LAURA: If that makes sense. 
MATT: Yep. 
SAM: Nice! 
TRAVIS: I know only-- 
LAURA: Okay. This is Sharpshooter. 
SAM: (imitating Grog) "All my spells are higher than 5th-level." 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: I don't know if that-- 
TRAVIS: Hit them with my Bewitching Gaze. 
LAURA: 20. I'm sorry. 12 plus 16 minus five. 
MATT: Minus five? Yeah. 
LAURA: Okay. 
MATT: Same. Hits again. 
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay. (splutters) One plus. Okay, I'm not going to tell you what my totals are. I'm going to add them up myself. 
MATT: Okay. (laughs) I'm proud of you. 
MARISHA: I'm going to do it myself! 
LAURA: 16. 
SAM: She's just saying-- 
ROBBIE: ♪ Watching your friends ♪ do math ♪ 
SAM: She's still staying all of it, just much quieter. 
MARISHA: (laughs) 
LAURA: 27! 27 total. 
MATT: 27 points of damage. 
ROBBIE: Pretty much. 
SAM: You're still saying all the same things. 
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm saying the total to him instead of-- (laughter) 
TALIESIN: I don't know. 
MATT: How do you want to do this? 
ROBBIE: Eyy! (cheering) 
TRAVIS: You did it! 
MARISHA: Yay! 
TRAVIS: You did it! 
MARISHA: What? 
SAM: You did something! 
LAURA: I did it! Amazing! (laughter) 
LAURA: In that case, I'm going to aim for its mouth? I'm going to go in a little crevice, past Cerkonos, and I'm going to try to lodge my Residuum arrow into the little dangly bit at the back of its throat. 
TRAVIS: Uvula. 
SAM: It's a uvula. 
MATT: Okay. 
TALIESIN: I love a uvula hit. 
MATT: Here, I'll toss the ball here on this. So as you fire this arrow, (whooshes) it goes, (whooshes) sinks in the back of its throat and marks up, and you see this arrow as it strikes in the little glistening green crystal that is a focus for magical energy. Inspires you to react. 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah. 
MATT: What do you do? 
ROBBIE: Oh yeah! I get a bump from your level five? 
LAURA: You'll get a bump. But also, as it hits, that arrow is going to go (whooshes) and split apart and a fucking tree is going to start growing out the back of that worm's head. 
MATT: (laughs) 
LAURA: So whatever you do-- 
ROBBIE: You got a tree growing out of that thing? 
LAURA: He's got a tree growing out of his head now. 
TALIESIN: That little green crystal powder. 
ROBBIE: Aw man! 
TRAVIS: A little Miracle-Gro for your spell. 
ROBBIE: It's just flavor, right? 
MATT: It's just flavor. 
ROBBIE: Great! As the tree grows, what does it do? You tell me. Does it burst out of his head? 
LAURA: It bursts out of the back of his head and starts growing up, almost like antlers out of the back of the worm's head. 
ASHLEY: Cool! 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah! It's storming out, right? A little bit, yeah? 
MATT: Actually, the sky is clear now. 
ROBBIE: the sky is clear. 
MATT: Because of the blast of the ending of the Bloody Bridge. 
ROBBIE: Oh, that's right. Yeah. Well, it doesn't matter because the lightning's coming, baby! 
TRAVIS: Yeah! 
ROBBIE: From the top of tree! (lightning crackles) Hits the top of the tree, splits 
MATT: (lightning strike) (cheering) 
ROBBIE: Right down the middle of it. 
MATT: Yes! (cheering) 
ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
TRAVIS: Oh, nice! (laughter) 
LAURA: Nice! 
SAM: I'm still yelling, Lieve'tel! He just split a fucking tree! (laughter) He's crazy!" 
LIAM: (Lieve'tel) I don't think he's here! (laughter) 
SAM: He just split it with a lightning bolt! 
LIAM: I haven't seen him in 20 minutes! (laughter) 
SAM: On the tree he just hit the worm! (laughter) (sighs) 
MATT: All right. 
ROBBIE: (laughs) 
MATT: So currently, we have many scattered figures and troops either fleeing or on their way in a bit to recover, and a Scrag that is currently mentally controlled by Scanlan. Scanlan, what do you want to do in the brief time left that you can control this entity? 
SAM: I mean, I can have it kill or I can have it run. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, flee? 
LAURA: Flee. 
SAM: Should I send it off into the desert? 
TRAVIS: Make it somebody else's problem. (laughter) 
MARISHA: I know! That's what I was thinking! 
SAM: Boy? (laughter) 
MATT: It turns. (thumping) 
TRAVIS: "Old Yeller." 
MATT: (snarls) 
TALIESIN: Went full "Harry and the Hendersons." 
SAM: I've loved our time together. But you don't belong with us. 
TALIESIN: (alien noises) 
MATT: (snarls) 
SAM: You belong out there-- 
MATT: (clicks) 
SAM: -- free in the wild. 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
SAM: Go! 
ASHLEY: Oh no! 
SAM: Go be free! Don't look at me like that! I don't like you! I don't want you anymore. 
MATT: Massive bladed claw comes up and strokes the side of your chin. (laughter) (thumping) 
SAM: Just go! 
MATT: (grunts) 
SAM: Just go! 
ASHLEY: Get out of here! 
MARISHA: Yeah! 
SAM: (sobbing) I gallop over to Pike. 
LAURA: As it takes off flying, Trinket runs across the back-- 
SAM: Oh shit! That's right! 
LAURA: And leaps towards me. 
SAM: Take Trinket too! 
LAURA: And I bamf him into my-- 
TRAVIS: I've got you, Trinket! (laughter) 
LIAM: (Godfather voice) Take the bear, leave the kaiju. (laughter) 
MATT: In this brief minute amongst the cleared skies, the sparkling stars above, in the eye of the proverbial hurricane here before the rest of the battle finds its way to the core that you had struck, you all take a beat, look back at your recovered companion, once again on borrowed time. 
ASHLEY: (quietly) Hey, Vax. 
LIAM: (Vax) It has been a while. 
LAURA: How dare you look younger than me! 
TRAVIS: (laughs) 
LAURA: I hug him. 
LIAM: DM, question before we wade forward here. So I know the state that I've been in for so many years. I know that the tether or the tie or whatever you want to call it, so there's no change with all of the everything that's going on with the gods and him. Everything feels to him the same? 
MATT: Yeah. 
LIAM: All right. What do we do now? 
MARISHA: I guess it's still the same. You're not really back, are you? 
LIAM: No. 
MARISHA: How long before you have to go? 
LIAM: I would like nothing more to stay with you all. I've thought of you forever. Forever and ever. 
LAURA: Then stay. She's distracted. Stay as long as you can. 
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is the fight. (chuckles) I mean, if you can get an extended hall pass or something. 
MARISHA: If there is no more Matron, do you know what happens to you? 
LIAM: It's funny. I would not have her go. 
MARISHA: You would not have her go? Okay. Well. 
LIAM: He takes her by the hand. 
MARISHA: I'll still be here, I guess. 
LIAM: Death is a part of life. When I say I would not have her go, it does not mean that I do not want to stay. I mean she does a kindness, in all our ends. I mean she does a kindness, in all our ends. Do not mistake me. I long for our life. 
MARISHA: When will your time be served? When will your debt be paid? I have to assume that I won't see that in my lifetime. And that's a long time. 
LIAM: There's no question that he's different than his manner when he was alive. But there is no mistaking the amount of melancholy and longing and love for all of you. 
SAM: So that's it, you're just going back? Just right now? 
MARISHA: I actually turn my attention to Lieve'tel. This is why you came, isn't it? What is there to do? 
LIAM: (Lieve'tel) After this? 
MATT: It's about this moment that the sounds of surrounding battle you've noticed have begun to lull. You begin to see gathering around the tower tops and walls in the distance, beings arriving. The reinforcements should you have needed them or those that were to finish the job if you could not. Devils, warriors, mages, leaders, the glowing angelic wings of the chosen planetars and celestial messengers and warriors for the gods all encircling here, the site of a fallen key. One such hooded, massive, angelic figure, gold skin and a feathered wingspan that stretches 40 feet flies in. (wings beating, thudding) "Champion, the deed here is done. The next fight we bring to them, to Issylra, to finish what they might not be able to. Come." (wings flapping) 
LAURA: Issylra? 
LIAM: All of those angels took off? 
MATT: That one took off and the others stand there floating and flying, staring at you. 
ASHLEY: What's on Issylra? 
MATT: A spectrum of pantheon messengers. 
LIAM: The Champion will turn to no one in particular and stare off into the near distance. (Vax) Would it really be so bad if I were to stay? 
TALIESIN: The children would love to meet you. And finally find out how much I'm embellishing the memory of you. 
MATT: You feel a hand touch your shoulder, Vax, and whisper in your ear, "Those that fight to buck fate will march on their own path. In this moment, you choose what's important to you. In this fleeting moment." And you feel her presence gone. 
LIAM: I touch my own shoulder where I felt that hand. I will serve you still. Here. In this mortal world and to its end. Thank you. Turns to the rest of you. But what are we going to do next? 
TALIESIN: What must be done, I suppose. 
ASHLEY: Wait, what? 
MATT: "The night is yours." 
MARISHA: The night? 
LIAM: Issylra? 
LAURA: No, fuck the battle. You're here with us. 
MATT: You look beyond and see droves of holy warriors, battle-scarred Judicators, and high war clerics. You see an incredible array of angels rubbing shoulders with the devils held from their ages-long animosity for a singular golden purpose. Past the muffled sounds of detonations and war cries, the beings born of powers beyond, their focus here completed, begin to turn and leave together towards goals far from here. 
LIAM: Vax, to you guys, feels a little amazed and confused even, to a degree. There has been, he's lived on a stretched view of time looking in both directions and he is feeling that slip away. He doesn't fully understand what is happening yet and is feeling some of that touch of omniscience fading like when you wake and the dream wafts away. He threads his fingers into Keyleth's hand and then into his sister. 
MARISHA: She tenses a bit. 
LIAM: He does a very tentative, gentle squeeze. Tell me what I've missed. Tell me about these nieces and nephews. 
TALIESIN: We can do better. We're Vox Machina and we have fought today. We go to rest, we go to recuperate, we go home, and we will be called when it is time. Come home, we are not battle ready. Let us rest, if even for one day. 
MARISHA: Is that all you have? One day? How long? 
LIAM: I don't know. DM, it was unclear, right? 
LAURA: She said one night. 
LIAM: The mandate? 
MATT: You have the night. 
LIAM: The night, the night. 
MATT: You get the sense based on the events transpiring, the nature of where things are going, and the tone of her voice, that it seemed like a gift on the precipice of the end of everything. 
LIAM: I want to hear everything. 
TALIESIN: We go home. 
LAURA: Yeah. 
SAM: Are there any trees around here? 
TRAVIS: Look over and Grog's pulling the guts out of these three last Reiloran. (laughter) 
SAM: And looting them too? 
TRAVIS: Yeah, definitely checking for valuables. (gurgling) 
TALIESIN: Darling, we need a tree. 
LAURA: There's a tree sprouting out of that worm's head. 
MARISHA: I think that'll do. 
SAM: It's been sliced in half. 
LAURA: It's fine. 
SAM: Okay. 
LAURA: I'm going to let go of Vax's hand for a minute and go over to Keyleth. 
MARISHA: We did it. 
LAURA: We did it. Darling. One night. One night. 
MARISHA: I could use that glass of wine. 
LAURA: Let's pretend everything's all right for one night. 
MARISHA: One night. To Whitestone? There's five of them. Twins! 
LIAM: What are their names? 
LAURA: Vesper, Wolfe, Leona, Vax'ildan, we call him Freddy, though, it's confusing, and Gwen. 
LIAM: That all makes perfect sense. 
ASHLEY: Oh, Scanlan and I also had some kids and we named one of them-- 
MARISHA: Walk and talk, it only lasts six seconds. 
SAM: We have this many kids. (bangs table twice) (laughter) 
ASHLEY: Wax'ildan and Den'ildan. 
LAURA and MATT: (laugh) 
SAM: Wihend'ildan. 
LAURA: Wilhand'ildan. 
SAM: And Juniper. 
LIAM: I'm sorry. 
LAURA: (laughs) Through the tree, through the tree. 
MATT: The still smoldering lightning-split tree upon the corpse of the massive worm, Keyleth conjures with what space exists, enough to open a gateway to the mid-evening open starscape of Whitestone. Clean of color-tensed magic chaos for the first time in many weeks. 
MARISHA: I return the squeeze on Vax's hand. 
MATT: As you all step through, new friends in the battle, the tree closes as the red burning moon of Ruidus still looms in the sky where two other groups currently fight for their goals as well. We'll get to that next time. 
TRAVIS: Oh shit. (laughs) 
LAURA: Oh man, oh man. 
MATT: So we'll get to jump into the division of the other troop and then follow the Mighty Nein on their journey next time. 
LAURA: Oh my gosh. 
SAM: We're not going to come back to Vox Machina? 
MATT: We can come back to them-- 
SAM: Another day. 
MATT: Another day. Maybe, depending on where this campaign goes, we'll see. 
LIAM: Ouch, ouch. 
SAM: Yikes. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
MATT: Love you guys. 
TRAVIS: Amazing. 
ASHLEY: We love you, Matt. 
LAURA: We love you, Matt. 
MATT: Well, thank you all so much for joining us. We'll pick up on Ruidus next time. 
SAM: Oh my god. 
MATT: We love you very much. 
LAURA: Yes. 
MATT: And is it Thursday yet. Good night. 
SAM: Woo hoo!

Cooldown[]
TRAVIS: Holy shit.
ASHLEY: Dang. Oof. That was sad.
LIAM: Just like the wedding one-shot, I felt very tight-ropey with it because I still don't know everything that's going on in Matt's brain, so I feel like it's walking blind with the roleplaying.
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: At least it's the Vax we know. 
SAM: Sort of.
LAURA: No, he's back. He's kind of back. He's shaking off the dream state.
TALIESIN: Little shell-shocked.
TRAVIS: Those last 30 years-- 40 years? 30 years?
LAURA: 30.
MATT: 20 something. Like 27 years.
LIAM: I think the way I played it, I think to allow him 24 hours, all of that. Big sky picture had to sort of--
DANI: (from the other room) It's been 30 years!
LAURA: It's 30. Dani yelled.
TALIESIN: 30?
LIAM: --get pulled out of his-- conscious, mostly, though there's just a ghost of it there, but--
TALIESIN: "Weak and idle theme".[1]
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Are you okay, Marisha?
MARISHA: (tearfully) No! 
ASHLEY: Oof.
MARISHA: It sucked eight years ago, it sucked at the wedding. Just like, I feel so bad for Keyleth. 
SAM: I know. It's so not fair to her.
MARISHA: It's not fair to her.
TALIESIN: It'd be a shame if something happened to the gods while he was down here.
MARISHA: I know!
SAM: That's why I'm saying like, maybe it's better if he just goes away.
MARISHA: I know. She can never move on.
SAM: It's torture.
ASHLEY: It's like one night almost just makes it--
LAURA: Worse.
ASHLEY: --even worse.
MARISHA: It's worse!
LIAM: Yeah, it is.
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Why are these emotions so real!? Fuck this game!
ROBBIE: It's a tough table to flip, though.
MARISHA: Yeah, I know. It's too big.
TALIESIN: Very specifically because of her.
TRAVIS: It's pretty sturdy.
MARISHA: Uhh. It just sucks.
TRAVIS: Hey, you died again.
LAURA: I died.
TALIESIN: We get to throw you a wake though. That's nice.
ASHLEY: God.
SAM: So Divine Intervention just works?
ASHLEY: When you're level 20, it just works.
TRAVIS: You get one of them, though.
ASHLEY: You get one of those per long rest.
LIAM: Per week.
MATT: Well, once it succeeds, you have to wait a week for it to be usable again.
ASHLEY: I can use it three times a day!
SAM: That means you can get like--
TRAVIS: Looks like you mismanaged your character cards.
SAM: You can do 52 Divine Interventions a year.
LAURA: You could do some serious shit.
ASHLEY: Yeah!
SAM: Jesus! "I want to win the lottery again!"
TALIESIN: You really have to--
LAURA: Pinpoint it, yeah.
TALIESIN: It's a target you have to hit. If you shoot too far it doesn't work.
MATT: Don't look too deep into it. The further you look into the logistics of the rules of D&D and the long form lifestyle, the world is absolutely nightmarish and broken.  
TRAVIS: That's why "Baldur's Gate" capped out at a certain level.
MATT: Yeah, they're like, "Level 12 is good. I think we're good."
TRAVIS: That was an epic, epic map. And fight.
MARISHA: That was crazy.
TRAVISL Those creatures are crazy.
LAURA: I can't believe you bamfed out two kaiju.
TRAVIS: Who made the amazing… Scarge?
LAURA: Scrag.
TRAVIS, ROBBIE, MATT: Scrag.
MATT: The design work was done with Tyler Walpole, who designed all the Reilorans as well. Designed Ozo.
TRAVIS: Can you crack out that Ozo mini?
SAM: Ozo Cruth!
TALIESIN: That fuck. I hit him--
TRAVIS: I mean, we've never met a character that kept hitting until they miss?
MATT: Yeah, that was just a fun…
TRAVIS: Is that an active thing he activates, or--?
MATT: Yeah, it's an ability. Once he uses it he has to recharge it to see if it comes back, but it's just, "I'll keep hitting you until I miss."
LAURA: Wow.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MATT: It's crazy. He's a fun one.
ASHLEY: He's a beast.
LIAM: Yeah, I want to get a better look at him.
LAURA: Oh my god.
MATT: He is fun.
ASHLEY: Wow, look at those muscles.
LAURA: Sheesh!
TRAVIS: Yeah, look at that, man. Can't hug him very easily.
ASHLEY: These little dangly bits are so scary.
TALIESIN: That defensive reaction is just the fucking worst.
LAURA: Yeah, upping his AC to 26.
TALIESIN: Putting up a Shield over and over again. I hated that.
LAURA: Yeah, the whole turn at 26.
MATT: He's the warlord of the Reilora for that reason.
SAM: Was.
TALIESIN and LAURA: Was.
LIAM: It's like a mage with Shield. Except his AC was already massive.
SAM: I'll take a look at it.
MARISHA: His mace almost looks like rock candy.
MATT: Want to take a bite?
TALIESIN: Hey, you collected everything, right? While we were talking, you were grabbing all that shit? Yeah, we have cool armor now.
LAURA: Put his whole body in the bag.
TALIESIN: We'll clean him out when we get home.
LAURA: Scanlan MVP.
SAM: Well…
LAURA: Scanlan did some serious shit.
SAM: Keyleth, actually, the Earthquake.
TALIESIN: The Earthquake. Counterspell.
ASHLEY: Earthquake was clutch.
MARISHA: It was risky.
SAM: It was awesome.
MARISHA: I wasn't sure there for a second.
LIAM: Yeah, I thought I'd get at least two rounds out of that.
TALIESIN: Monstrous.
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, even the one round.
MATT: A full round of everybody having disadvantage on attacks against them and advantage on saving throws was huge.
LAURA: Especially with as many 20s as you rolled.
MATT: Yeah, that would have swung it a lot differently.
LAURA: That was good.
MARISHA: Was that your only means of bringing Vex back? Did you have any other means? Did you pack any Revivifies?
ASHLEY: I did.
LIAM: I had Revivify, but I was also in the corner.
LAURA: But there was no way to get to me.
ASHLEY: But I couldn't get to her, and I was like-- I didn't want to chance him… you being dead-dead. Just because--
TALIESIN: We had time. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, probably--
TALIESIN: There's a minute or two before everything goes to fuck.
MARISHA: I think it's like within one minute or ten minutes or something.
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's one minute, which I probably could have done other things and got over there, but I just didn't want to chance it.
MARISHA: No.
ASHLEY: It's like, what if you fail?
LAURA: So much was happening in every single round.
ASHLEY: What if it failed? What if her body--
TALIESIN: She failed three immediately. She would have been done.
ASHLEY: Then knowing the Earthquake, that was coming up, you would have been done-done.
LAURA: Stuff would have fallen on my body or a fissure.
SAM: A rift could have opened up. You could have fallen through. A crevasse.
MARISHA: That was the other thing. It is a DM's choice, and of course it gets worse the more rounds that go on, like if we kept demolishing buildings, with Earthquake the DM eventually can decide that a fissure just opens up and things just fall into it.
LIAM: Here, or over here. 
MATT: The next round, I was considering that.
MARISHA: Were you?
TRAVIS: Oh, no shit?
MARISHA: I was trying to weigh it. I was like, I don't want-- it could end poorly.
TRAVIS: Sand castle?
MARISHA: Uh huh.
TALIESIN: If fucking Manners had worked, that would have been--
MARISHA: That's the funniest fail, though.
TALIESIN: He had disadvantage. I gave him-- because it's not a strength save, it's a strength check.
MATT: Yeah, that would have been disadvantage on it, yeah.
TALIEIN: And only gets one for the day, and so he's stuck in there. He can attack but he can't move.
MATT: That would have been pretty awesome.
TALIESIN: It would have been amazing.
MATT: But also--
TRAVIS: The dead racket ball was pretty great. 
MATT: Yeah, that was pretty great too.
TALIESIN: I was trying to have a moment.
MATT: "I'll see you in hell, bitch!" (fwink)
TRAVIS: Trench coat flutters as he throws it.
TALIESIN: Almost every weapon I had was dead by the end of it. I had-- it would have been a full action to repair anything.
TRAVIS: You put it to good use. You emptied the clip.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was done.
LAURA: It was very romantic, darling.
TALIESIN: You were unconscious for most of it, so you don't know that.
MARISHA: In our animated series, I want a moment where Grog is walking towards a baddie doing his own guitar riffs.
TRAVIS: (electric guitar riffs)
ASHLEY: It was so funny. It was so good.
TRAVIS: (as baddie) "What are you doing?" (Grog) What are you doing?
SAM: I'll make a note.
TALIESIN: I had my wind up toys in there.
TRAVIS: (as baddie) "Stop it!" (Grog) You stop it!
SAM: Did you use your 9th-level spell? Did everyone use theirs?
MARISHA: I did not.
ROBBIE: I didn't.
MARISHA: I was actually about to, because I was up after Vex and Vax.
SAM: What were you going to do?
MARISHA: I was going to turn into a white dragon, and just rip apart the-- just go into kaiju battle mode, but then you were like--
TRAVIS: Destroy all the things.
MARISHA: Destroy all the things.
SAM: What's yours?
TRAVIS: What's your 9th-level?
SAM: Do you have a 9th-level spell?
ASHLEY: I don't know.
MATT: Guiding Bolt, I'm pretty sure.
ASHLEY: Say again?
MATT: Guiding Bolt.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think it's Guiding Bolt at 9th level.
TRAVIS: Are you the only one that has Wish?
SAM: I don't have Wish.
MATT: He lost it at the wedding.
LAURA: That was the last time he was able to use Wish.
MATT: And you're like, I don't fucking care.
ASHLEY: I think it's True Resurrection, maybe? I don't know.
SAM: Oh, that's right, so we didn't need a body.
MARISHA: And you had your souped up fire elemental?
ROBBIE: Oh, that was fun, yeah.
MATT: D&D breaks at 20th level.
LAURA: But she has True Resurrection.
TALIESIN: I have creepy wind up toys of Sylas, Delilah, Ripley, and Stonefell still to set off.
LAURA: So we can just steal Vax back.
ASHLEY: Yeah.
ROBBIE: You have True Resurrection as well? I did it too, yeah, yeah, yeah.
ASHLEY: I think that's what it is.
TRAVIS: When did Percy start making toys?
TALIESIN: I've had some time and I have kids and I thought it'd be funny to make toys that actually really hurt people.
TRAVIS: You were inspired by an old gnome that came to the castle?
TALIESIN: No. What gnome?
TRAVIS: Yes.
TALIESIN: Was there a gnome?
TRAVIS: Yes, I think--
TALIESIN: The minute the sky went weird, I thought it would-- I love you. It was actually Laudna, the whole standoff with you, I'm like: You know, I really need to get a hold of any remaining fear, and I thought it would be hilarious to turn them into stupid toys that die the way they did. 
MARISHA: Oh, that's funny. That's good.
LAURA: That's funny.
TALIESIN: Ripley tries to shoot and explodes.
MARISHA: Did you only use the one?
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: She could resurrect Vax.
LAURA: I know, that's what I mean.
ASHLEY: Well, that's why--
LAURA: We could steal him back.
SAM: It says, "if the soul is willing."
ASHLEY: I was hanging on to the Intervention.
LIAM: I don't think I'm dead or alive. I think I'm--
ASHLEY: He's not dead.
TALIESIN: A phantom.
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: He's tethered. Fucking Matron won't let him go.
ASHLEY: If I didn't use Intervention, I was going to try to be like: Can you make a deal here, Everlight?
SAM: We could just make a new Vax.
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: And a new Matron.
LIAM: Maybe someone could make a simulacrum of me we can leave with Vox Machina.
TALIESIN: Reincarnation.
SAM: I could turn a chair into you or something.
MARISHA: No!
MATT: I've seen that "Black Mirror" episode.
MARISHA: It is a "Black Mirror" once again!
SAM: Technically, I could turn Vex into Vax.
LAURA: Whenever you need him.
TALIESIN: Or we do have Delilah's old little clone factory. You could come down to the clone factory if you lose the other two feet and we could figure it out. It'll be great.
LIAM: My stomach feels full of lead. That was such a…
ASHLEY: That was such a fun episode, but that was heavy.
ROBBIE: That was just the fun, loving reunion, full of shenanigans, I thought it would be.
TRAVIS: I had a great time.
TALIESIN: It was very shenanigany.
ASHLEY: I feel so sad for Keyleth.
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome. I didn't dip below 100 hit points.
SAM: Well, I also feel sad because we don't get any resolution because we're not coming back to these characters, right? We're going to--
TRAVIS: We don't know.
ASHLEY: Ever again.
LAURA: We don't know.
MARISHA: It could be a denouement or something.
LAURA: Totally, and I think what happens with Vox Machina is going to depend on what Mighty Nein and Bells Hells does.
MATT: That is likely.
MARISHA: For sure.
SAM: Okay, okay.
MATT: I do not foresee a denouement to this campaign that we do not return to other figures that are involved in this overarching story, outside of complete and utter failure. In which case, we'll see.
ROBBIE: Complete and utter--
MARISHA: Failure. I know.
LAURA: It's not over. 
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's not over till it's over.
TALIESIN: That'll be the name of the final episode: "Complete and Utter Failure."
MARISHA: Oh god!
ASHLEY: That's pretty great.
MARISHA: Three campaigns, ten-year long legacy, the last episode: "Complete and Utter Failure."
ROBBIE: 27 characters trip over their shoelaces.
TALIESIN: Put that on a tombstone.
ASHLEY: I'm not giving up on Vax yet.
LAURA: Me neither.
ASHLEY: I'm not giving up on Vax yet.
ROBBIE: Into lava.
SAM: I am considering modifying Keyleth's memory so she forgets about him entirely.
LIAM: That's so many 10-minute blocks all throughout time.
LAURA: Nah, at 9th-level, you can remove an entire person.
LIAM: Oh, it's just-- wow.
TALIESIN: You know, that might change her personality in some kind of negative ways.
LAURA: No.
SAM: Let's find out.
LAURA: Terrible.
MATT: That's awful.
TRAVIS: I love it. All right, whatever.
MATT: All right, see you guys next time.
