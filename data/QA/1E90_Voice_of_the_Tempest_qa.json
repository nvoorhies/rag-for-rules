    "question": "Can a creature that can change shape transform into a door?",
    "answer": "The shapechange spell allows a character to polymorph into a different creature. It does not allow the character to polymorph into an object.",
    "rules": [
      "Spellcasting > Spell Descriptions > Shapechange",
      "Spellcasting > What is a Spell?"

    "rules_explanation": "The Shapechange spell states that you assume the form of a different *creature*. A door is an object, not a creature, therefore you cannot use the spell to change shape into a door.  Creature and object are defined separately, objects are inanimate items.  Thus, only being able to turn into a *creature* restricts polymorph to those sorts of things."
