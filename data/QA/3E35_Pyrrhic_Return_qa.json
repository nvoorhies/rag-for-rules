    "question": "A level 4 Barbarian with Rage attempts a persuasion check against a Tummech-faced character. What do they roll to persuade that character. ",
    "answer": "The level 4 Barbarian rolls a d20 and adds their Charisma modifier for this persuasion check.  Advantage is not relevant for this check because the Barbarian is trying to find a rope. There is no proficiency bonus because they lack proficiency in Persuasion.",
    "rules": [
      "Ability Scores > Using Each Ability > Charisma Checks",
      "Combat > Actions in Combat > Ready",
      "Races Racial Traits > Skills",
      "Classes > Barbarian > Rages"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "A persuasion check is a Charisma Check. Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all Ability Scores. The rules show how to form ability scores, but there is nothing in the transcript to determine ability modifiers, or specific values for any stats. There are no rules for rolling a d20 with a modifier other than relevant ability modifier. There are no rules for how or when to declare a skill other than at character creation. The use of Rages grants advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, so it is not applicable in this instance."
