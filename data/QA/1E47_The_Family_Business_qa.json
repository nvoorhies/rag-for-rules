    "answer": "Yes, any creature you designate when you cast the spell to enter can be targeted.",
    "rules": [
      "Spellcasting > Spell Lists > Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion spell states \"You conjure an extradimensional dwelling... You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open.\""

    "question": "When the level 1 Vex'ahlia (half-elf ranger) exits the mansion, can the level 1 Keyleth (half-elf druid) get a plate of food from the servants as proof that it's real?",
    "answer": "No, as soon as level 1 Keyleth (half-elf druid) pops out of the door, it all turns to smoke and dissipates.",
    "rules": [
      "Spellcasting > Spell Lists > Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion spell states \"Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\" This would apply to food as well. Since the mansion and everything in it is an illusion it cannot leave the premises without reverting to smoke and dissipating."

    "answer": "Once a day.",

    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion spell does not specify any limit to the number of castings, except that it requires a spell slot of 7th level to cast. The level 9 Scanlan (Gnome Bard) has exactly one 7th level slot, so can cast this spell once per long rest."

    "question": "If a creature (a large bear) has a bonus to attack of plus eight, what does the bonus become with advantage on the attack?",
    "answer": "Advantage just means you roll an additional dice and take the highest, so it remains at plus eight.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Advantage and Disadvantage"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Advantage on a roll just allows the player to roll a second dice and take the highest roll. It does not modify the bonus to the roll.

      "Combat > Making an Attack > Melee Attacks > Shoving a Creature"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Shoving a creature uses the attack action in melee to make a special melee attack.  Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you."

    "rules": [],
    "rules_explanation": "There is no general advantage for anything having to do with dragons. This seems to be an effect of an earlier event, about which no rules information is given, so there's nothing to look up."
