      "Combat > Making an Attack > Attack Rolls",

    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The DM asked the cleric to make an Arcana check to determine if the character knew if the Antimagic field would protect against Inuit charges. The difficulty of the check would depend on the nature of Inuit charges and the Arcana skill of the cleric. A roll of 3 by the character with a -1 adjustment resulted in a net value of 2 which the DM stated was not sufficient to know the answer."

    "question": "The DM described a scene and then said 'Those of you with darkvision, if you would like to go ahead and make a perception check with disadvantage, because you are quite a ways away'. What rules should the players use for this roll?",
    "answer": "To determine if a level 4 Grave domain cleric can see into the distance, the player must roll a d20 and add their Wisdom modifier and any other relevant bonuses then apply disadvantage to the total.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks",
      "Conditions > Advantage and Disadvantage"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The DM called for a Wisdom (Perception) check. A Wisdom (Perception) check consists of rolling a d20, adding the character's Wisdom modifier, proficiency bonus if proficient in perception, and any other relevant modifiers. The DM imposed disadvantage on the roll, requiring the player to roll twice and use the lower result."

    "question": "A player wants to know if the blood magic with fire damage that the BBEG uses can be resisted with a ring of fire resistance. Is the character resistant to fire?",

    "question": "A character with rage, haste, and an action available wants to attack and asks 'So, here we go, first attack'. How many attacks can the character make?",

    "question": "A character has cast the Slow spell. What happens to the slowed character during combat?",
    "answer": "An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a âˆ’2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.",
    "rules": [
      "Spell Descriptions > Slow"

      "Player's Handbook > Spell Descriptions > Haste"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Characters can only have one advantage or disadvantage on an attack roll, even if multiple things provide the same bonus. This may make some things that would normally be helpful like another character trying to use the help action to give advantage redundant because it does not stack with previous advantages."

    "rules_explanation": "The consequence of rolling 11 or higher or lower as a result of the Luctus effect on the Fjord is stated in the rule, rather than requiring lookups in multiple sections of the rules."
