    "rules": [
      "The Environment > Vision and Light > Darkness",
      "Appendix PH-A: Conditions > Blinded"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The text for the 'Darkness' describes that it creates an area of heavy obscurement. Heavy obscurement blocks vision entirely, effectively blinding the character. Darkvision allows a character to see in normal darkness as dim light, but does not allow a character to see through magical darkness or other sources of heavy obscurement."

  {
    "question": "When you cast a prepared spell and then hold it without releasing it until the last moment, and then not release it, does the spell use the spell slot?",
    "answer": "Yes, the spell is cast but then held, and the magic expends whether or not the effect is released.",
    "rules": [
      "Spellcasting > Spell Slots"

It is not possible to select or declare that attacks or damage are nonlethal. The text does not state that if it was meant to be lethal, it needed to be declared."

      "Appendix PH-A: Conditions > Charmed",
      "Races > Elf > Fey Ancestry"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Resistance to a damage type means damage of that type is halved against you; advantage on saving throws means that you roll a second d20 and use the higher value when making saving throws where you have advantage. Neither of these prevents you from being targeted, and the target of being charmed is making the saving throw. The charmed condition does not cause damage so resistance does not apply."

The GM would need to decide if circumstances are appropriate for granting advantage, but the Charmed condition does influence the ability to gain insight about the caster."

    "question": "If you get a new level, and you level up your health, but you roll a one for hit points, can you re-roll that?",
    "answer": "The rules include no re-rolling of health on level up, but the Dungeon Master offers a houserule to allow it.",
    "rules": [
      "Beyond 1st Level > Hit Points"

    "rules_explanation": "The rules state that each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die and you roll that Hit Die, adding your constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum.

    "question": "When does thread, from the alarm spell, connect to the individual who cast alarm?",
    "answer": "If the thread connects anything, it is thread or magic which allows the caster to know if someone they didn't want to be in here came in here, not to determine if people have been spying.",
    "rules": [
      "Spell Descriptions > Alarm"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "An Alarm spell does not indicate or relate back to scrying. Instead, it acts as an alarm for a location or object, not a creature"
