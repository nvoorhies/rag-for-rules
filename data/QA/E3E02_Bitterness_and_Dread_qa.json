    "question": "A level 14 character examines a hodmedod with the Golden Scythe logo on it. What information can they gain from a roll of 12 on an arcana check?",
    "answer": "With a roll of 12 on an Arcana check, the level 14 character can determine that the lack of animating material is unusual. They understand that the Golden Scythe creates and sells these constructs, and it is strange that there appears to be no engine or proprietary technology to animate it.",
    "rules": [
      "Ability Scores > Ability Checks > Skills",
      "Running the Game > The Environment > Objects"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "This question references a roll of 12 on an arcana check. The SRD describes Arcana as a skill associated with Intelligence checks. It also explains that an Investigation check might uncover the working of objects. However, Brennan made a judgement call and set a specific DC for the check, as a game master is empowered to do."

    "rules_explanation": "The Lay on Hands class ability allows a Paladin to heal or cure disease. In this case the Dungeon Master interprets the application of divine energy as a blessing for the dead, not a healing of the sickness from which he died."

    "question": "If a character is going to attempt to pinch a cable to bottleneck the Arboreal Calix, and Nydas, a bard, wants to help, what does a bard do?",

  {
    "question": "Aabria asks Brennan: I'm going to cast Animate Objects on them and set them up as a guard behind me. In a mechanical sense, is that actually how that spell works to give them momentary life using ether from a receptacle on my own wrist and give them the momentary life that their initial construction no longer can?",
    "answer": "The rules for Animate Object work to give objects sentience, not to recharge automatons with new ether.",
    "rules": [
      "Spell Descriptions > Animate Objects"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "This is question about the spell *animate objects*. The text of the spell describes how it can affect multiple objects, not just one."

      "Ability Scores > Ability Checks > Skills > Perception"

Also, the use of perception is required to properly interpret the results."
