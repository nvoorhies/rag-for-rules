    "question": "The GM ruled that the 20 rolled by Level 1 hexblade warlock Opal for trying to deceive the group was unsuccessful. Is this permitted?",
    "answer": "A natural 20 on a check does not guarantee success. The roll must equal or exceed the target DC taking all modifiers into account",

    "answer": "The Thaumaturgy ability can cause your voice to be three times as loud.",
