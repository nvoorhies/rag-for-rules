    "question": "If a character is beyond the 30 foot limit of the hand crossbow of a Level 3 Rogue without advantage, do they get sneak attack?",
    "answer": "A level 3 Rogue shooting without advantage will be unable to apply sneak attack due to the disadvantage on their attack cancelling their advantage.",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Making an Attack > Attack Rolls",
      "Adventuring > Vision and Light"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The attacker would normally have advantage on attack due to the fact that they are hidden. However, they also have disadvantage on the attack because they are firing beyond the 30 foot range of the weapon. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. Since they don't have advantage, they do not get sneak attack."

The Aid spell is a second level spell, and there is no rule in the description of the Bard class that allows for a specific number of class spells to return on a Short Rest. Therefore, the Aid spell is not a warlock spell and does not return on a short rest. "
