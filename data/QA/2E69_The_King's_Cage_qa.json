    "answer": "Whether the level 7 monk can jump on top of the Barlgura and jump again to attack depends on several factors, as determined by the GM. First, the monk must make an acrobatics check. On a success, they are close enough to Obann to make an attack. The Flurry of Blows feature allows a monk to make one additional unarmed attack.
