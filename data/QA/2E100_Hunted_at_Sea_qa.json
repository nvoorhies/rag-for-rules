    "answer": "The DM has determined that a check of 12 is not sufficient to recall a history fact.",
    "rules": [
      "Ability Checks > Skills"
    ],

    "answer": "To use Divine Intervention, roll percentile dice. The target number to succeed is equal to or less than the cleric's level, which is 12.",
    "rules": [
      "Cleric > Divine Intervention"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The question references level 12 which is the cleric level and it applies to divine intervention. The roll is percentile and requires a roll result equal or lower than the appropriate level for the question to succeed."

    "question": "If the water moves around an object due to a spell effect, such as Whirlpool, does that inflict bludgeoning damage on the object, as asked by Level 10 Caduceus?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered. The answer depends on the effect in question. The Whirlpool spell does 3d8 bludgeoning damage to creatures that fail a strength save when it is initially cast.",
    "rules": [
      "Spells > Level Descriptions"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Level of the character is not important for the description of the operation of the damage mechanics of this spell.

      "Spellcasting > Areas of Effect",
      "Spells > Level Descriptions"

    "question": "If a ship is within cannon range of a target, but the target is 10 feet under the surface of the water, does the cannon fire have disadvantage on the attack roll?",

    "rules": [
      "Combat > Making an Attack > Unseen Attackers and Targets"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "It is assumed that being underwater makes the target not seen, this imposing disadvantage on the attack roll."

      "Making an Attack > Unseen Attackers and Targets"

    "rules": [
      "Spells > Range"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "If a target leaves the range of a spell, that spell no longer affects them. A whirlpool is 50 feet square so the diameter is 75 feet. If a creature moves 80 feet away from it, they are no longer in range."

    "answer": "A creature that starts its turn in the whirlpool's area must make a Strength saving throw.",
    "rules": [
      "Spells > Level Descriptions > Control Water"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The spell description says that 'When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw.' and does not distinguish the save for initial entry versus starting a turn there. Because this is a spell with concentration, it affects those who are caught within it."

    "rules": [
      "Spells > Level Descriptions > Command"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The conditions for the Command spell are specific, it has to be a creature, must be able to understand the character, and can not be directly harmful to the creature. Since a dragon turtle is a turtle and a dragon, which are both monsters it is not a valid target for the Command spell."
