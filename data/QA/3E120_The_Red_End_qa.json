    "answer": "No, the level 12 Blood Hunter does not get a reaction attack because by the time the head leaves the level 12 Blood Hunter's melee range, it's underground, so the level 12 Blood Hunter would be striking the dirt.",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Actions in Combat > Opportunity Attacks"
