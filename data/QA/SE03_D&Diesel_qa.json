The improved critical feature of the Champion fighter makes it such that their weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, so the attack is a critical hit.

However, the barbarian has the Brutal Critical class feature, which states, \"Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\" Thus, with a normal critical hit and the brutal critical class feature, the damage dice are rolled 2 additional times, and the damage is added together. If you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together and then add your relevant ability modifier."
