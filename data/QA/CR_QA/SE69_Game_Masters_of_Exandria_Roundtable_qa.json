    "question": "When a person starts their first 10 levels as a paladin, can they discard it and start life as a warrior, and not necessarily multi-class but just switch over to it?",
    "answer": "The rules do not forbid a player from discarding character levels to choose a different class, to get rid of levels, reskin, or do a different. This is ultimately up to the player to decide.",
    "rules": [
      "Beyond 1st Level > Multiclassing",
      "Legal Information > Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Multiclassing rules define how to add levels of a new class, there is nothing in the rules about discarding levels, and, as stated in the legal disclaimer, there are no warranties express or implied in this document about how game play should progress."
