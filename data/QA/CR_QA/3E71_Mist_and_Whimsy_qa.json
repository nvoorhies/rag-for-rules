    "question": "A level 4 [sorcerer] casts `Sending`. What roll is required to determine if the message gets through?",
    "answer": "A d100 should be rolled. If the total is 57 or higher, the `Sending` spell succeeds.",
    "rules": [
      "Spellcasting > Casting a Spell > Range",
      "Spell Descriptions > Sending"

    "question": "Can a level 4 [fighter] with proficiency in Survival and proficiency bonus +2 and wisdom score of 11 (+0) use his action to determine direction?",
    "answer": "You can make a Survival or Nature check to ascertain some semblance of direction.",

    "rules_explanation": "This falls under the general guidance for using skills and is appropriate for the DM to request either a Survival or Nature check.

    "question": "The spell Tongues has been cast on the character \"Me\". A 5th level cleric wants to use Tongues with Detect Thoughts. Is this possible?.",
    "answer": "Yes, if they touch the character \"Me\" again, the 1st-level `Tongues` spell will allow the NPC and PC to understand each other while the 2nd level spell `Detect Thoughts` allows the character to read thoughts from the touched NPC.",
