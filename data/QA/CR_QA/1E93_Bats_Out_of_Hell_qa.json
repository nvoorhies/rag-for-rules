      "Spellcasting > Polymorph",
      "Races > Racial Traits > Ability Score Increase"

    "rules_explanation": "The rules for the *polymorph* spell state that a target is transformed into an average example of that creature, but with its original mental stats.

    "question": "Level 3 Bard has moved to the other side of the door really quickly, and is backing up a little bit, and then is taking three more potshots at that bone devil because that's what the Level 3 Bard can see.  Because he has Hex on it, does it mean he doesn't have that anymore, since Hex lasts for an hour, and is transferred when an existing creature is killed?",
    "answer": "You must use a bonus action to apply *hex* to a new target after the original target is no longer alive. Therefor Hex will remain on the target. The Hex spell description says 'If the target drops to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature.'",
