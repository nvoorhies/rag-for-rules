    "question": "The character is trying to see if there's anything psychological or arcane going on with him as he speaks. Should the check be Focus or Sense?",
    "answer": "If the character is looking for the mundane nature of his distress the check should be Focus, but if trying to see if there is something magickally wrong give me a Sense roll.",

    "question": "The character is a gifted Witch. Does that qualify the character to feel proximity to bleed in others?",
    "answer": "So the idea of this would be if you're trying to pick up a trail or detect bleed in thresholds or amounts that you wouldn't notice right away because anyone in proximity to incredible amounts of bleed is going to feel it regardless, but this allows you a little more sense of focus, directionality, intensity, and the ability to hone in.",
