    "answer": "Aimed shots against an invisible assailant will be with disadvantage",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Making an Attack > Unseen Attackers and Targets"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The text 'When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll' indicates the attacker must make the roll at a disadvantage."

    "question": "A character is asking the DM for their save DC for an ability.",
    "answer": "the save DC equals eight plus your proficiency bonus plus your dexterity modifier, so 19.",

    "answer": "No, it is invisible but it is prone, so that evens out to no advantage or disadvantage.",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Making an Attack > Unseen Attackers and Targets",
      "Combat > Movement and Position > Being Prone"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Since the creature is invisible, attackers would normally have disadvantage on attack rolls against the creature, but the creature is prone, giving advantage on attack rolls against it. The prone condition removes the normal benefit of cover granted by the attack since the target is invisible, so these adjustments effectively cancel out."

    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The rule text 'An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).' indicates the damage for the improvised weapon."

      "Combat > Making an Attack > Attack Rolls"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The rule text 'Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency' means the character would not be proficient in that weapon."

    "question": "Does a player add wisdom to cure wounds?",
    "answer": "You add your wisdom modifier.",
    "rules": [
      "Spellcasting > Spell Descriptions > Cure Wounds"

    "question": "If you roll by accident, does that count as a check, skill check, or saving throw?",
    "answer": "If you rolled by accident, you have to roll intentionally to take the score. Because if you were to accidentally roll really bad, you'd be like, “That doesn't count! I didn't actually roll.”",

  {
    "question": "The players have been on a long adventure and have decided to try and craft new weapons. Does marisha have proficiency to assist with the roll?",
    "answer": "I would say the tinkering, the mechanisms involved, would be so far beyond your understanding as a druid. Even just metalwork in general. You can cheer him on, but would not be able to assist him with it.",

    "question": "What is the effect of using a canteen of water of pure water?",
    "answer": "the enchantment of the actual water creation itself is separate than the holy enchantment that has been attached to it. The holy enchantment is not very powerful because it is an enchanted item. How it functions is the first burst per day that you use of the water does an additional 1d6 radiant damage.",
