    "rules_explanation": "Percival is attempting to complete construction of the spring by hand.  The game master specified the skill check by name and which modifiers to use.  This is equivalent to using thieves tools and therefore Dexterity applies to the check. He is adding the proficiency bonus and then rolling a 20 sided dice."

As the evening comes into about ten or 11 o'clock at night, after hours of aching work, sweat beads dripping down the foreheads of the three of you, forcing the furnace to work overtime. The room's heat and darkness eventually almost puts you to a point of exhaustion and passing out. However, you do manage to complete the springs. They seem to be functional, the structure of your trap is set. We shall see on the morrow if it is as functional as you hope it is. You do take a point of exhaustion through the work that will consist throughout the next day. > TALIESIN: Okay. What does a point of exhaustion do? > MATT: Disadvantage on ability checks. So, essentially, any skill checks or ability checks you makeâ€“ not attacks or saves, but ability checks you make for the next 24 hours will be at disadvantage."
