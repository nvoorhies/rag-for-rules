    "question": "If the level 4, class unknown, race unknown, with chutzpah of 4 wants to use Animalgram and roll chutzpah, what does that mean in game terms?",

    "rules_explanation": "The question establishes the use of a skill called 'chutzpah'. The DM determines this uses the 'Ability Checks' rules from the 'How to Play' section. The core mechanic involves rolling a d20 and adding an ability modifier. However, the system the character is playing only has D6s, and 4 is a success. The success of this is related to the class, level, and race as listed in the prompt. The system doesn't use modifiers so they can be ignored."
