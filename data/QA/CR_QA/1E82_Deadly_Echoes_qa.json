    "answer": "The ranger can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, so you have about 15 feet you can kind of see out in front of you in straight darkness. If you have your dagger out, you can see pretty decently for 60 feet.",

      "The Environment > Vision and Light > Darkness",

    "answer": "The rogue indicates that he is going to use his wings. Then the question comes back on, would it be useful to have the rogues little dagger be used, to check for traps. So the implication was that you can tell where it is, but you will have to roll with a disadvantage. The game master, however, doesn't answer the question.",

This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly."

So you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, so you have about 15 feet you can kind of see out in front of you in straight darkness.
