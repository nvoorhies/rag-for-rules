    "answer": "No. The dragonborn's **Breath Weapon** requires the use of an action. You cannot take another action on the same turn.",
    "rules": [
      "Races > Dragonborn > Draconic Ancestry > Breath Weapon"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The Draconic Ancestry > Breath Weapon rule states that you can use an action to exhale destructive energy. Since it takes an action you cannot use it on the same turn as another action."
