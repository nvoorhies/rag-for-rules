    "question": "A character cast Rary's Telepathic Bond and restored a temple. Can they see the mortal avatars as they were originally?",
    "answer": "No, though the frescoes and murals in the temple are restored.",
    "rules": [
      "Spells > Rary's Telepathic Bond",
      "Environment > Vision and Light"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The transcript indicates that even with the restored frescoes, the characters can't automatically see the true nature of the mortal avatars. Rary's Telepathic Bond creates a telepathic link but doesn't grant special sight.  Seeing the true nature of the avatars isn't a function of the temple relighting."

    "question": "A Level 20 Tempest Sorcerer with the War Caster feat is in a grotto of poetry and beauty and passion and a planetar is attempting to move out of its threatened area. What actions can this character take?",
    "answer": "The Tempest Sorcerer can take an attack of opportunity or cast a spell of their choice as a reaction.",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Reactions",
      "Feats > War Caster"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "A Level 20 character can make a single attack of opportunity as a reaction.
