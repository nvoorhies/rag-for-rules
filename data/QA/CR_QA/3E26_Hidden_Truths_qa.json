    "question": "A description of the face seen in a dream has been provided, can a +0 modifier character roll to recall more details from the dream, and will the casting of the spell calm emotions affect that roll? Also, can they have guidance cast on them for this recollection?",
    "answer": "The character can roll a perception check to recall the details of the dream, but guidance won't help, as the roll is for recollection of the dream, not perception.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks",
      "Spellcasting"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The rules allow for an ability check to recall details, and the casting of the spell guidance only affects ability checks that are made for a task that is being attempted. Recalling a dream is a mental exercise, which the spell guidance would not directly assist with."

The rule does not explicitly indicate when you can, it is only a constraint on what you can use the ability on. The current situation falls within these constraints. A little intimidation situation, as explained later, is defined as eye's blackening over. This is a description of the use of the ability, not an effect of the ability. There is no additional detail on when it can be used."
