    "rules": [
      "Part I > General Gameplay Transcript Excerpt > Passive Perception"

    "question": "If a character has 'until the end of the turn', does that effect end immediately after that character's turn, or does it persist until the end of the next character's turn?",
    "answer": "The effect ends at the end of the character's turn whose turn it is.",
    "rules": [
      "Part I > General Gameplay Transcript Excerpt > End of Turn Effects"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Rules say the effect only lasts until the end of 'the turn'. That is, the turn it began on. If it was meant to last until the beginning or end of the next turn, then the rule would be written to be active until the beginning or end of the next turn."
