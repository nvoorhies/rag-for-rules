    "answer": "This rules question cannot be answered using only the SRD. There are no general rules for a creature with that composition and saves. It would depend on any features or spells currently affecting the entity.",
    "rules": [],
    "rules_explanation": "The effects on saves are all dependent on spells or abilities being in play."

    "question": "If an attack requires to be within five feet and is slowed, how does that function?",
    "answer": "This rules question cannot be answered using only the SRD. It is possible for many different factors to impact a creature's move speed. This would depend on the specifics of whatever caused the speed to be halved.",

    "question": "After a long rest, how does one choose between a one or a zero for Rollies and breaking concentration?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered using only the SRD. As Rollies is not an SRD rule, there are no ways to determine what dice are rolled or the DC that is required to beat it",
    "rules": [],
    "rules_explanation": "Rollies are an invented game mechanic and so not specified in the rules"

    "question": "The text states: They are. As many as he wants. As many as he wants, it can.' What is being referenced?",
    "answer": "This rules question cannot be answered using only the SRD. It is an incomplete and not fully sensical question. It is referencing some undefined action or feature.",
    "rules": [],
    "rules_explanation": "It is impossible to derive from the SRD what the statement is referring to as the context is missing. Nothing in the rules is able to allow actions without limits"

    "question": "A character uses their reaction after being attacked. Can they still move?",
    "answer": "This rules question cannot be answered using only the SRD, as it would depend on what type of attack was used that made the player use their reaction, as some may force the player to be unable to move due to being stunned.",
    "rules": [],
    "rules_explanation": "Some conditions may restrict movement. Without further information, one cannot generally say whether or not movement is possible."
