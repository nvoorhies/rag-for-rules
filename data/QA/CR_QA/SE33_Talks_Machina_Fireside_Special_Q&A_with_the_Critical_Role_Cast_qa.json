    "answer": "There is no mention of the Rogue's features at level 14.",
    "rules": [

    "question": "If Vex the ranger promises the Raven Queen her soul in exchange for a boon to the party, is this something a god could be like \"Okay, I'll accept that.\"",

    "question": "If the level 5 Scanlan, with the artificer's mechanical automaton companion Doty, takes physics and engineering classes and finds a tutor, does the Artificer's Lore feature in the SRD apply?",
    "answer": "No, as per the SRD, the artificer class information is from Unearthed Arcana and in the testing phase, so there is no official support for the Artificer's Lore feature.",
    "rules": [],
    "rules_explanation": "The information about the Artificer class comes from a non-SRD source. Since the artificer class isn't in the SRD, none of its class features can be discussed in SRD terms."

  {
    "question": "If the level 5 Grog, a barbarian, is fighting an intelligent creature, and the dungeon master chooses to stun Grog, is that a legitimate DM tactic according to the SRD?",
    "answer": "The SRD states \"If it's an intelligent creature, it knows what the biggest threat is, the seven-foot, eight-foot guy with the giant axe who looks like he could take anything you throw at him. I'm not even going to damage him, just (pop). Get out of the fight.\"",
    "rules": [],
    "rules_explanation": "The acceptability of a DM tactic is not a rules question. The DM is merely explaining his in-game reasoning, not claiming to be invoking any rule."

    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The Raven Queen and Sarenrae are deities that do not appear in the SRD document, and therefore their respective oaths cannot be listed using it."
