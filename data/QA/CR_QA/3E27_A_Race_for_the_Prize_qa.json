    "question": "A level 4 Wild Magic Barbarian (Chetney P.) uses Minor Illusion to cast the illusion of glass. What rules apply?",
    "answer": "Minor Illusion does not appear on the spell list for the Barbarian class. Barbarians also cannot cast spells while raging. A multiclass character could potentially cast it if they have a level in another class, but there is no evidence that Chetney P. has levels in another class.",
    "rules": [
      "Classes > Barbarian > Rage",
      "Spellcasting > What is a Spell?"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The barbarian class rules state that a barbarian cannot cast spells while raging and the definition of spells states that each class has their own unique spells. For Chetney to cast minor illusion he would have to have a level in another spellcasting class."

    "question": "A level 4 Wild Magic Barbarian (Chetney P.) rolls a 4 on a performance check. What rules apply?",
    "answer": "A performance check is a Dexterity, Charisma, or Wisdom skill check. The player rolls a d20 and adds any adjustments due to the character's skills and abilities. The DM sets a target number (DC), and if the result is equal to or greater than the DC, the check is a success",

    "answer": "There are no explicit rules for this action in the SRD. The game master can use the general guidance to determine if this action is possible. There is a rule about worn items needing to be adjusted to fit a non-humanoid. So the Game master would adjudicate if this item and ear were able to be connected in this fashion.",
    "rules": [
      "Equipment > Wearing and Wielding Items"

    "answer": "The SRD does not have specific rules for dynamite or explosive items, but the Game Master can improvise with existing rules and guidance.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks",
      "Equipment > Weapons > Weapon Properties > Range"

The woodworker (Chetney P.) has an intelligence of 5. Another character casts Fox's Cunning on them. What rules cover these actions?",
    "answer": "The character makes an intelligence check. The Fox's Cunning spell gives them advantage on intelligence-based checks. Fox's Cunning does not appear to be a spell.

    "rules_explanation": "The rules for resolving contests state to make ability checks appropriate to their efforts, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks, so two melee combatants will be making either a Dexterity or strength check as per the action they are taking. If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest."
