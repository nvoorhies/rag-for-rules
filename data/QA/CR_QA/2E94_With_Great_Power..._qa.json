    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The SRD specifies that a Wisdom check is made up of a d20 roll, plus all modifiers, and that all classes derive the proficiency bonus from the Character Advancement table. A level 4 cleric has proficiency bonus is +2 and should use their wisdom modifier."

    "question": "At what level can level 4 cleric use the 'Turn Undead' ability with effects affecting undead of CR 2 or lower?",
    "answer": "The level 4 cleric cannot use the 'Turn Undead' ability with effects affecting undead of CR 2 or lower. At the 5th Level the level 4 cleric gains the 'Destroy Undead (CR 1/2)' so it has to be level 5 to use the ability on CR 1/2 or lower.",

    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The SRD states 'Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.' which makes running at full speed impossible, but the same terrain can be negated by some features."
