    "question": "What is the effect of adding the paladin's Divine Smite to the weapon's damage?",
    "answer": "When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.",
    "rules": [
      "Class Features > Paladin > Divine Smite"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The Divine Smite feature of the paladin class allows a paladin to add radiant damage to a melee weapon attack by expending a spell slot. The amount of radiant damage depends on the level of the spell slot expended and the type of target."

    "question": "How is the proficiency bonus for skills like Acrobatics calculated?",

    "question": "If an effect allows you to double your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, do you add the bonus to the check?",
    "answer": "No. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Proficiency Bonus"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "A proficiency bonus can only be added to the check if you have proficiency in the skill. If you do not have proficiency, then you do not have a bonus. Multiplying zero by any number is still zero."

    "question": "A level 3 forever DM asks, as a forever DM, much often like yourself, do you have any NPCs that didn't see the light of day that you really wanted to?",
    "answer": "The forever DM responds that, if you are partial to something, you'll find a place for it. And if it doesn't find a place, then it usually ends up being a PC in the rare times that I do get to play. And often, many of the PCs that I make for the eventual hope that I'll play them, which never happens, just end up becoming NPCs.",
