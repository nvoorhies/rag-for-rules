    "question": "As a 14th level barbarian wearing the Chain of Returning with one point of exhaustion and having raged before but not currently raging, does having one point of exhaustion affect the Athletics check to climb?",

    "question": "If the 14th level rogue is within 5ft of a dragon, does it have sneak attack?",
    "answer": "Whether the 14th level rogue has sneak attack depends on whether or not there's another enemy of the dragon within 5ft of it that isn't incapacitated and the rogue doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll. If those conditions are met, the 14th level rogue has Sneak Attack.",

    "answer": "The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. Assuming the target fails the saving throw, it must follow the command on its next turn. The available commands are Approach, Drop, Flee, Grovel, and Halt. The target must follow the command to the best of its ability.

Since it only takes the bonus action to activate the ability, it does not require the command spell to take an action. It can force the barbarian to take an action, in particular, it does not let the barbarian 'use the extra action' to move and therefore it cannot make the barbarian do anything that would require the action."
