    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks > Advantage and Disadvantage",

    "rules_explanation": "The question contains information about character level and class, however there are no rules in the SRD for general skill checks that refer to level or class for a roll.

    "rules_explanation": "When trying to squeeze into a smaller space it costs extra movement. To make it through the rat will have to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Since the space is small for the creature, it will have disadvantage on the roll. Since the roll requires disadvantage, it must roll 2 dice, and take the lower number."

    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks > Skills",

If a character has advantage or disadvantage on the roll, two dice are rolled instead, and the higher or lower die is taken as the result. At the end of the check, all of the parties involved in the combat encounter are ranked from highest to lowest. The initiative order will follow that ranking during combat."

    "question": "If I have mage armor and am using Orym's Interception ability, do the bonuses stack?",
    "answer": "That depends on what Orym's Interception ability is. If it's a bonus to AC, it will not stack with mage armor's AC calculation since you can only have one calculation for AC.",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Making an Attack > Armor Class (AC)"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The bonus from mage armor and Orym's Interception cannot stack because of the general rule that you can only have one AC calculation. If Orym is merely providing temporary hit points, those would stack because they are not part of your AC."

  {
    "question": "Can you use the Eldritch Blast spell and hex multiple targets, or just one?",
