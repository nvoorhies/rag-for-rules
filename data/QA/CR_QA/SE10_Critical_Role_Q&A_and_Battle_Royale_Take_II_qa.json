    "question": "The description for Dimension Door states if you teleport to a space occupied by a creature, it would shunt you out and take 4d6 psychic damage. There are two small party members. They came up with a plan, and formed the two smallest possible members into a creature that is so large. Can I justify that there would be enough space where you wouldn't be occupying technically the same space as the creature and allow it for that circumstance and if you rolled a lower intelligence roll, you probably would have been pushed out the side?",
    "answer": "As a Dungeon Master, you have to consider what makes sense versus what doesn't, how much do the mechanics written in the rules rule your game in the narrative, and how much you want to allow because the players have been creative or it's an interesting way that could make sense and you can justify.",

    "question": "If I'm concentrating on a spell and take damage, what do I roll for the Constitution check?",

    "question": "I have Dimension Door, from a rules standpoint, says that if you are to teleport to a space occupied by a creature, it would shunt you out and take 4d6 psychic damage, I think. I agree with that. However, the players came up with a very interesting plan, formed two of the smallest possible members into a creature that is so large that I considered in that moment that there would be enough space where you wouldn't be occupying technically the same space as the creature. So I allowed it for that circumstance.",
