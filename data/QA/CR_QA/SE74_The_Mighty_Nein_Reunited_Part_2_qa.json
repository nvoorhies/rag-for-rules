    "answer": "Yes, a creature sharing a space with another creature is in melee with them.",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Making an Attack > Melee Attacks"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The rules for Melee attacks and Reach require the attacker to be within 5ft of the target. The game describes melee attacks as being used in hand-to-hand combat, and doesn't give a special definition of melee beyond that, so it's up to the DM to adjudicate whether it is in effect. Since the Rogue is physically under the giant I rule they are engaged in melee."

      "Classes > Rogue > Sneak Attack",
      "Combat > Making an Attack > Unseen Attackers and Targets"

    "rules_explanation": "The rogue has advantage on the attack roll due to the prone condition. The rogue is within 5 feet of the target and not incapacitated. A ranged attack against a prone target is disadvantage, but this disadvantage is countered by the existing advantage, resulting in a normal attack."

While not explicitly specified, any effects acting on the target of water walking remain in effect, such as gravity pulling the target toward the ground as normal. In effect, the creature with the water walking spell can walk upon and therefore touch the ground as if the ground had no liquid surface covering it. There is nothing in the spell to imply that the subject hovers above any surface, water, or otherwise."

    "question": "If the 17th level character uses an Action, and the enemy caster teleports away, can it counterspell if it has a reaction available?",

      "Spellcasting > Casting Time > Reactions",
      "Spellcasting > Spell Descriptions > Counterspell"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The Counterspell reaction must be in response to 'seeing a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell'. This requires that the counterspell be in reaction to the casting of the spell, and the description of counterspell makes no exception to the rules for use of a reaction, so the Counterspell must be used immediately, and the caster must be present at the end of the spellcasting activity. Because of this, if the Action the opponent took was not a casting of a spell, then counterspell can't be applied. If the opponent takes the cast a spell action, but the spellcasting has not been completed, then the counterspell can be applied."
