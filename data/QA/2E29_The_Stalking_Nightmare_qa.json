    "question": "A level 10, cleric with a roll of 5 plus a +2 modifier has cast Sacred Flame. The wisdom saving throw from that caster is dexterity based? If so, what's the Dexterity modifier, and the save?",
    "answer": "The type of saving throw for Sacred Flame is Dexterity. With a +2 modifier, the saving throw is 16.",
    "rules": [
      "Class Features > Cleric > Spellcasting > Spell save DC"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The DC for a cleric spell is based on the Wisdom of the caster. The base DC is 8 plus the proficiency bonus of a level 10 character (+4) and the Wisdom modifier of the priest, the spell save DC = 8 + 4 + 3 = 16. Since the wisdom saving throw is determined by the sacred flame spell, that part of the question is irrelvant."

    "question": "A level 10 barbarian with a roll of 1, what number do you add from your negative investigation number?",

    "question": "When ShakÃ¤ste casts spiritual weapon, what is added to a spell attack roll by a level 10 cleric?",
    "answer": "The spell attack modifier is the proficiency bonus plus the spellcasting ability modifier. A level 10 character has a proficiency bonus of +4, so the bonus to the spell attack modifier is 7.",
    "rules": [
      "Class Features > Cleric > Spellcasting > Spell attack modifier"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "A cleric's spell attack modifier is equal to the proficiency bonus and the ability modifier for the spell, Wisdom. A 10th level character's proficency bonus is +4. Therefore the answer is +4 + 3 (Wisdom) = 7."

    "question": "If a level 5 rogue with a dexterity of 15 is making a check for a plus seven, what numbers are being added together?",
    "answer": "A Dexterity skill check adds the Dexterity modifier and the proficiency bonus.  A level 5 character has a proficiency bonus of +3, so the numbers being added are +2 and +3.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks",
      "Skills",
      "Beyond 1st Level"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "This questions requires several calculations. Determine dexterity modifier. Dexterity is 15. Using Ability Scores > Ability Scores and Modifiers (score - 10) / 2 rounded down = (15-10)/2 = 2.5 rounded down = +2.  Beyond 1st Level > Proficiency Bonus; Find the proficiency bonus of a level 5 character from table = +3. Calculate Skill Check, 2 + 3 = +5. I'm removing the numbers from this question that lead to the incorrect answer."
