    "question": "Level 4 Race Class with Strength 13 asks: When I do an insight check against a creature's honesty or deception, does the target roll against it?",
    "answer": "No, the target does not roll.  The GM uses the target's Persuasion skill bonus (if the target is honest) or Deception skill bonus (if the target is lying) as the DC to determine the success of the insight check.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "An ability check is made by a single character or creature. An ability check is against a DC which is set in the rules or by the GM. This is not a contested action, so the second creature does not make a check or saving throw."

  {
    "question": "Level 3 Warlock casts I want to be on you on the barmaid, what check is used?",
    "answer": "The Charisma (Persuasion) check is used if the character is honest in the intent and description if their desire.  The Charisma (Deception) check is used if the character does not honestly want to be with the target in the intended, or described manner.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "There is no roll specified by the rules, so the gamemaster can determine what skill applies to a roll. The GM has determined either a Persuasion or a Deception check.  Persuasion applies if being honest in the intent and description, and Deception applies if not."
  },
  {
    "question": "The GMsays make a persuasion check. The level 3 persuasion check for I want to be on you is a 26, is that high?",
    "answer": "The check is a success if the roll is equal to or higher than the DC, and not otherwise.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The rules state that you need to equal or exceed the DC to be successful. No further interpretation of success is possible"

    "question": "A level 1 barbarian attempts to persuade a barmaid to ignore everything and make an advance on him. He rolled a natural two. What adjustments are possible?",

    ],
    "rules_explanation": "There is no roll specified by the rules, so the gamemaster can determine what skill applies to a roll and if advantage or disadvantage applies to the roll.

    "question": "If there are no other rules, what kind of action do you have to take to make a deception check?",
    "answer": "There is no action to take to make a deception check unless a feature or situation specified a particular type of action is necessary. For example, you could lie as part of a conversational turn, or create a diversion by lying.",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Actions in Combat"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "You need to determine the applicable rules to know what actions may or may not apply. No general rule is applied here in combat. If out of combat, there is no explicit action, so lying is implied to take no time."
