    "question": "The level 4 level Barbarian, while raging, makes a reckless great weapon attack, but the DM states this is a tight tunnel and the target must crouch down, and round your shoulders as you're doing it. What check is required?",
    "answer": "An Athletics check is required.",
    "rules": [
      "Combat > Actions in Combat > Making an Attack > Attack Rolls",
      "Strength > Strength Checks > Ability Checks"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The Dungeon Master has ruled that the terrain makes the attack more physically demanding, thus requiring an ability check using the character's Strength. The presence of a rage condition allows the Barbarian's player to make this reckless, so advantage would be granted to that skill check"

    "question": "The 8th-level Rogue makes a roll lower than 10 for a skill check to find traps, what happens?",
    "answer": "Because of the Reliable Talent class feature, if the player makes a roll lower than a 10 for a skill check to find traps, the roll counts as a 10.",
    "rules": [
      "Classes > Rogue > Class Features > Reliable Talent"

      "Spellcasting > What is a Spell?"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The rules refer to the specifications for duration and caveats in the individual spell descriptions which apply to magical effects. In this case the belt form is the off state, so cannot return to use."

  {
    "question": "If somebody makes an attack with an advantage, is it an auto-crit? If not, which roll applies to the critical hit chance?",
    "answer": "No, advantage does not guarantee a critical hit. Only a natural 20 on the d20 attack roll can score a critical hit regardless of other modifiers or conditions to the die roll. Only the initial dice roll determines a crit. ",

    "rules_explanation": "The druid is still in contact with their game statistics, so they may use their power as normal. Since they use their powers for damage, the damage that they deal comes from their normal form. If they attack with a claw, it deals with the claw damage and may not receive any benefit as the Ice Knife is from the original form, again."
