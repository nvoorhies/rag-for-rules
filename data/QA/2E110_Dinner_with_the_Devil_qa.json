    "rules_explanation": "The player attempted to take a seat from a NPC, triggering a Dexterity contest. The outcome of the particular roll is not as important as the fact that it triggered the contest. The game master stated that the NPC was moving to take a chair.

If the initial NPC action was opposed, then the ability check would be against the game master set DC value as the default."
