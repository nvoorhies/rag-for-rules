    "question": "When Orym, level X fighter, makes a perception check, does the mountain-goating help help adjust the DC?",
    "answer": "Yes, adjusting the DC is used when the characters climb the side of the cliff.",

      "Combat > Actions in Combat > Help",

    "question": "Laudna, level Y warlock, has the 'Spider Climb' spell; can she use it to help them climb the cliff side?",
    "answer": "No, it is Athletics, not Acrobatics, and 'Earth Walk' helps the roll for Athletics with advantage.",
    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks",
      "Races > Dwarf > Dwarf Traits > Earth Walk"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The DM dictates what skills are used for a given activity. In this case, the task is climbing, for which the rule of thumb is to use Athletics. Duergar Dwarves' Earth Walk ability specifically grants advantage on Athletics checks, when moving through stone or earth. "

      "Spellcasting > Casting a Spell at a Higher Level"

    ],
    "rules_explanation": "At the table, there is some question as to whether the group retains the benefit of Pass Without Trace during this scouting mission."
