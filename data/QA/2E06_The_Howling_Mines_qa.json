    "answer": "A character with darkvision can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, but can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. In a lightly obscured area, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. A heavily obscured area blocks vision entirely. If the grass is about as tall as the cart at times, at times it's lower, the characters above that will see the whole terrain more clearly",

      "The Environment > Vision and Light"

    "rules_explanation": "The darkvision rules detail how darkvision interacts with light levels, and the vision and light rules define how this impacts perception"
