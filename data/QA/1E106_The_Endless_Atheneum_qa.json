    "answer": "There is no roll necessary, because the Bard can add the modifier (+5), proficiency bonus (+4), and minimum value of the die granted by the Bardic Inspiration (+1), resulting in a total of 30 on the check.",
    "rules": [
      "Bard > Bardic Inspiration",
      "Using Ability Scores > Ability Checks > Proficiency Bonus"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The question does not ask to roll but to sum an automatic total. A bard character of level 9 has a proficiency bonus of +4. Since the text does not specify that the character is proficient with thieves tools it can be assumed they cannot add the proficiency modifier to the roll. The minimum from the d4 inspiration die is 1. Dexterity modifier is given as +5.  So the total is 5 + 4 + 1 = 10."

    "rules": [
      "Using Ability Scores > Advantage and Disadvantage"
    ],
    "rules_explanation": "The rules for advantage state that 'When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage' and 'If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20.' This does not alter the difficulty class of the roll"
