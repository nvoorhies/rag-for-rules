    ],
    "rules_explanation": "Perception checks are required by the Dungeon Master when it makes sense for the character to make a roll for an action, and perception is a Wisdom-based skill, and the spell does not give specific instructions for the spell's usage."

    "question": "If multiple area spells are centered on the same target area, does the target take each spell's damage?",
