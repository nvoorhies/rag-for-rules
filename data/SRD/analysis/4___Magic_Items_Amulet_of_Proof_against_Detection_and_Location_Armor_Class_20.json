  "rule_text": "#### **Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.\n",
