More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.\n\nA character afflicted with **short-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.\n\nA character afflicted with **long-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 Ã— 10 hours.\n\nA character afflicted with **indefinite madness** gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.\n",
