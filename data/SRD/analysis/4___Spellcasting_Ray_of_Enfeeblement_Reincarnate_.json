Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.\n\nThe magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.\n\n| d100  | Race                |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| 01–04 | Dragonborn          |\n| 05–13 | Dwarf,\thill         |\n| 14–21 | Dwarf,\tmountain     |\n| 22–25 | Elf,\tdark           |\n| 26–34 | Elf,\thigh           |\n| 35–42 | Elf,\twood           |\n| 43–46 | Gnome,\tforest       |\n| 47–52 | Gnome,\trock         |\n| 53–56 | Half-elf            |\n| 57–60 | Half-orc            |\n| 61–68 | Halfling,\tlightfoot |\n| 69–76 | Halfling,\tstout     |\n| 77–96 | Human               |\n| 97–00 | Tiefling            |\n\nThe reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences.
