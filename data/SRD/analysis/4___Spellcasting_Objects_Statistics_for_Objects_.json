You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\n\n*Armor Class.* An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n",
