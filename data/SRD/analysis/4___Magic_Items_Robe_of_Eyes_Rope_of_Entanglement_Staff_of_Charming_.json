  "rule_text": "#### **Staff of Charming**\n\n*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*\n\nWhile holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast *charm person*, *command*, *or comprehend languages* from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.\n\nIf you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.\n\nThe staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.\n",
