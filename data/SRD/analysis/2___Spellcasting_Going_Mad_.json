  "rule_text": "## **Going Mad**\n\nVarious magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as *contact other plane* and *symbol*, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells*.* Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\n\nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.\n",
