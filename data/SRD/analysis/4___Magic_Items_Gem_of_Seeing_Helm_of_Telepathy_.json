  "rule_text": "#### **Helm of Telepathy**\n\n*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*\n\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.\n\nWhile focusing on a creature with *detect thoughts*, you can use an action to cast the *suggestion* spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the *suggestion* property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n",
