  "rule_text": "## **Blindsight**\n\nA monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. \n\nCreatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.\n\nIf a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception. \n",
