  "rule_text": "#### *Wondrous item, very rare*\n\nThis painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\n\nThe first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\n",
