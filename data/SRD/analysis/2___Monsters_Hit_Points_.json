For more on hit points, see the *Player's Handbook.*\n\nA monster's hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).\n\nA monster's size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\n",
