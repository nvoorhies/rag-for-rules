At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, \n\ncan use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.\n",
