  "rule_text": "#### **Actions**\n\n*Reaping Scythe.* The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.\n\n*Star.* Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\n*Sun.* You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\n\n*Talons.* Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\n\n*Throne.* You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the  world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\n*Vizier.* At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\n*The Void.* This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A *wish* spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\n",
