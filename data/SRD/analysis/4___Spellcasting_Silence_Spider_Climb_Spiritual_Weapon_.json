  "rule_text": "#### **Spiritual Weapon**\n\n*2nd-level evocation*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 1 minute\n\nYou create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\n\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.\n\nThe weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.\n\n*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.\n",
