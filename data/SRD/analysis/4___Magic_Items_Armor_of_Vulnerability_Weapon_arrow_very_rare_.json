  "rule_text": "#### *Weapon (arrow), very rare*\n\nAn *arrow of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.\n\nOnce an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.\n\nOther types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as *bolts of slaying* meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.\n",
