  "rule_text": "#### **Scarab of Protection**\n\n*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*\n\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\n\n- You have advantage on saving throws against spells.\n- The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.\n",
