It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with *oil of slipperiness.* When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.\n\nOne ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of *universal solvent* or *oil of etherealness*, or with a *wish* spell.\n",
